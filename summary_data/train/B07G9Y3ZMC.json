It basically sounds like a very loud Echo Plus with more bass. The bass is also overdone and boomy for music. If you are not an audiophile or particular about sound, these issues that I mention may go unnoticed. It gets loud though and Alexa is of course awesome. I wish I could give 2.5 stars",

I love the fact that i can adjust the sound with the equalizer on my Echo app. (treble, mid-range, and bass) I recommend. I had the first generation Echo which I still love, and i have the Prime music subscription which is great with some 20 million cd's to play.
