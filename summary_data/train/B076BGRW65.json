Don\u2019t give this purchase a second thought, I can\u2019t believe how cheap it is vs how well it all works! I would give 10 stars if possible!!",

Maybe a second strap farther down, or a wider strap to emerald more of the toe would work better. Still a h hmmm oof brace that gives over night relief, helps to prevent big toe from progressing inward and may even correct the toe position over a long period of use",

      "text": "This is a good idea (better than competing products), BUT the execution is very poor. It is rickety and uncomfortable. Re-manufacture to a higher standard and they could charge twice as much. Also there were no instructions included and there are pieces for which there was no apparent use. I tore mine apart to see if I could somehow modify it to be usable. Will work more ion it in future, in the interim it is useless.",
