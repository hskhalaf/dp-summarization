I do this to lighten it up a bit and it still tastes strong. Look at my pictures for reference, as it\u2019s still dark in color after running thru the machine 3 times. It\u2019s something you cannot do with the double espresso pods from this brand. Those can only be ran thru the machine once. This is the best deal I have found for these online $42.50 for 50! Yay!",
