(This is probably what made my worn-out larger (4-cup precooked) rice cooker, a different brand, stop working.) But (tradeoff:) my old one would collect and condense the steam outflow, where this one has a small hole in the top for venting steam. If you're stepping down from a 4-cup cooker, and you liked the amount of food it made, a 3-cup one's capacity will seem very small. (But this one does compensate somewhat by having the steamer, so you could steam vegetables and then mix them in later.)",

But it does have easy clean up and not much trouble washing out the burnt spots. If you are looking for something to make it easy this was not the thing.

The spoon is functional and good quality. Use it or you will eat the teflon. The steamer insert is somehow flimsy and probably made of aluminum.

I've put on since we met will speak to that), she has always been intimidated by rice for some reason. This took the intimidation out of it. It's relatively quick, but if you leave it too long, the rice will tend to dry out while it is in \"keep warm\" mode. All in all, for the price, I don't know if you can beat it. Cleanup is far more simple than what it would appear to be on similar models. It breaks down completely for washing. The removable lid is a must.",
