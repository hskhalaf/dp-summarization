It's sturdy, light, and very conveniant for transport when compacted. The only complaint would be the wheel sometimes skips giving shorter readings when measuring on soil and grass. We use the metric version for work measuring distances between vehicles, and it has held up to a lot of use in the office. Great product.",

      "text": "Not good! I have used measuring wheels for 30 years on a weekly basis. The older Rolatape wheels were good products and would hold up for a 2-3 years until the counter would break. This wheel is a different story. The telescoping aluminum rod with cam type locking levers is a very poor design. Very quickly one of the lockers became so loose that the wheel would not stay on the ground under any pressure. I had to tape the joint, which renders the telescopic design useless. It is also very bulky and heavy compared to the older slim design. Another flawed \"new\" design just for the sake of being new, at much lower quality.",

In retrospect, I should have spent the extra $$ and bought Keson w/it's big number counter. I'd also like a remote reset near handle but nobody seems to offer what would seem like a simple design.",
