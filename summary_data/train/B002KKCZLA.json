Terrible design in terms of not having the straps secured well to sole; narrow cloth attachments and inferior glue. Thought these would last better than my other Tevas, which also failed due to inferior glue used on soles which de-laminated completely after two years. For the price, not worth it.",

Up close you can see the time taken into the designing of the layers and stitching. The only problem I had was with the inside area near the arch. It was too narrow and rubbed quite a bit. Felt like my foot was hanging over a bit but in length they were right, couldnt go bigger. Other Teva's Ive had are more open on the sides and less restrictive to wider feet. As I learned while shopping, EVERYONE'S foot is different so this sandal will be great for lots of people.",

I wear sandals when hiking in southern Utah and northern New Mexico. The sole pattern on these sandals is aggressive and should work well for hiking. Ditto the sole thickness and foot bed - should be a very good hiking sandal. As the headline says, \"I don't even think about them when I am wearing them.",

      "text": "The last time I bought a pair of Teva's was, literally, 20 years ago. I got into a car accident and my feet swelled. I say this only b/c I took the sandals out of retirement and wore them everyday for over a year as they were the only option in my closet that fit. I finally \"broke down\" and bought a replacement - men's Kativa. They are brilliant. Super solid construction, stable, comfortable and they look great. I might encourage people to size up but I suppose that's an individual decision. And, they look SO much better than other brands.",

The Katavi sandals are so comfortable that after putting them on and getting used to them, I am not aware that anything is on my feet.

Infuriatingly this is the second pair from Amazon to fail in exactly the same way. Buy from stores or the manufacturer o be sure of quality.",

I found these sandals on Amazon and they were just what I needed. The leather straps are velcroed to make easy adjustment to fit the 'in-between' sizes. The cushioning on the sole and the adjustable straps allow me to custom fit to position my foot to allow the greatest amount of comfort.",
