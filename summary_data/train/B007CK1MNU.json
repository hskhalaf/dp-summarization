I held off on getting a spiderco for so long because I thought they looked weird but I got one and now all I see is beauty. The blade is nicely centered, the action is smooth and well balanced.

Decided to move up to an American made Para 3 LW and will see how that is - hopefully much better.",

I like the grip and light weight of the Endura handle, but the belt clip has had several issues. After lots of us and several hunting/fishing trips the belt clip needed to be replaced. The Tenacious clips and grips seem to be much more rigid. I think this is a great every day carry at an affordable price. After the wedding when I'm not broke, I'll probably pick up another 1 of these for myself.",

This is important to note because POLICE use this as a test, and if the blade comes out with a flick of the wrist (again, without using the thumb hole, just holding it in your hand and flicking it) they can confiscate the blade from you as it does not meet legal safety regulations.

Now, after a few years, even though the blade is as good as new and it still opens smoothly, I have lost all three screws, so it is useless as a pocket knife except to maybe carry loosely in my pocket which is not really an option.",

Made in China (laser-etched on the blade), pretty solid, however the bronze (or copper?) washers that act as the bearing surface when opening the blade were pretty mangled. They are thin, but even after oiling, not very smooth and actually squeaks. Will have to take it apart and rebuild them. But these complaints are very minor, I am still carrying it every day! I love the plain \"wedge\" ground profile, very thick and robust. Also having 4 optional positions for the clip is really nice.",

I would definitely recommend this knife to anyone searching for an inexpensive folding knife that is of great quality!",

I won't deny that I'm biased for Spyderco as I have purchased various enduras, delicas, even the police 3. I also have many kershaws, sogs, cold steels but spyderco is overall my favorite brand. This model in particular is my top pick in the category for value.",

Also the jimping on the blade and the G10 handle makes for a great feel in the hand.",

I recently broke down 8 large cardboard boxes into small disposable squares. The edge caught on paper and started to tear it, but just a few passes on the strop with green compound brought the edge right back. This handle feels very comfortable and natural in my hand. I could never choose my favorite one and only folder, but if I had to choose 5, this would be one of the 5.",

To be honest since its a lower end spyderco its not bad. Definitely worth adding to ones collection. I intend to buy a paramilitary 2 when I come into funds. Over all the black tenacious is a solid blade. No side to side play. The lock up is excellent for a liner lock. If you're on the fence get it. You cannot go wrong.",

There are much better locking systems than the one you're given however, it is still very well built. I use for EDC and I'm getting much more knives from Spyderco in the future! :)",
