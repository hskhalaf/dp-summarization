It doesn't foam much and should be applied with hands, as it won't work with a clarisonic or a washcloth. It's a big bottle, but you need a few pumps to cleanse your face. It's luxurious and worth the money. It's pH balanced, so you don't need a toner, and your skin will feel hydrated after you cleanse. It's exactly what I expected; I'm not really sure why it was rated poorly by others. My experience with the seller and the product was great. I'll definitely purchase again.",
