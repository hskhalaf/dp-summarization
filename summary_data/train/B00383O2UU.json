Very helpful if you don't have that much clothes to dry, and you want to save space. It's light enough to carry in one hand. I definitely recommend it!",

It fits just as much if not more clothes as before and the clothes dry just as fast. When folded, it fits very neatly next to the washer and dryer so I can put it away between washes. It was easy to set up, even without directions, so I would recommend it.",

You can lower one wing and take up less space, but the horizontal design takes up more space than the vertical, accordion-fold types of racks.

Even though it is light weight, it is super durable. It is easily foldable and goes right in a corner of my patio. A well worth investment to save machine dryer costs! Worth the buy.",
