These are easy to use, fit well over my helmet, and kept vision clear as day. I did have a face mask on at one point, and without proper overlay of the goggles these fogged up pretty quickly. I found that to be pretty annoying, as I had to keep messing with them on the lift to get them cleared and the proper ventilation going. Again for the price, you can't beat it. I only had slight trouble with fogging, with a face mask on.",

Additionally, the strap mounts close to the rear edge of the goggle frames, rather than the front edge. This means they also don't work as well with a helmet; the thickness of the helmet causes the strap to have to contort at an odd angle coming around the sides of the helmet and then holding the goggle frame in place. This was not comfortable.",

Way better looking than my old school style ones with a visible frame. They stayed on the helmet with no problems. I didnt have any problems with them fogging up.
