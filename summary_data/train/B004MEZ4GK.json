The card has a rear connector for auxiliary power (takes a floppy power plug), but my USB3 externals worked seamlessly without the extra power connection. The lowest price on ebay was substantially higher than this seller charged, even when shipping is considered. I placed two orders- one arrived in two days; the other shipment was delayed in the US postal system- seller answered questions quickly, extraordinarily courteous, and eager to help. What not to like!",
