We have a Britax Pinnacle G2, it's a god amongst car seats but too heavy for travel. Update! Returned both seats and purchased the Graco Atlas 2 in 1 Booster as backups/travel seats for both children and they are both happy!",

Luckily (I guess?) this is only used for travel but now I have to buy a different seat that will not be squeezing my kid's crotch so much.

Cute look (in my opinion). Soft fabric. Good recline if you anticipate car sleep. Price. Cons: latch is basic and a little harder to get in and out. The straps are not long. We anticipate that our kiddo will outgrow this seat well before hitting weight and height recs because there is very little give to the strap left. The recline makes it hard for an older child to get in and out themselves.",

They aren't as easy to install as my other seats that cost 5 times more, but my twins seem very comfortable and safe in them. The straps seem to glide when tightening, which makes it easy to get the appropriate tightness ( one of the most important purpose of a car seat). Plenty of leg room, and 2 cup holders.",

You can also use the latch option, which is easy enough too, but if you get into a car with hard to find anchors, the belt path is super fast to use. I only give it 4 stars because the harness can get stuck while trying to adjust it sometimes.",

It also has latch hooks which were also straight forward. We tried it in both a sedan and suv with no dramas. Overall it\u2019s a good alternate seat at a low enough cost to justify the spend. My only advice is buy a travel bag at the same time if you\u2019re not going to use it on the plane.",

Quality seems very good, and it seems like it was pretty comparable in comfort and design to our main ones at home.",

My 1.5 year old, 20ish lb daughter seems to like it and I like the cheerful pink color! She's spilled things in there and it's VERY easy to clean. The cover comes off like any other carseat and it washes without any problem (on delicate, hang to dry). I will be buying another for my son.",

If you are buying to rear face it would probably work for a ginormous SUV but not a compact car or truck.",
