I clearly heard shock waves from the person (in the pic) who was shooting .45 caliber handguns (Israeli made) just next to me. My God! It\u2019s so loud that it seemed I was not wearing any sound-proof earpiece. Even after the guy left, I still can hear loud shooting sounds from my neighbor shooter\u2019s regular 9mm gun shooting. I guess it is not designed for range-shooting at all. Don\u2019t believe those comments about perfect in shooting range. It may be only for light backyard mowing machine or soundproof sleep.",

Previously I was using another variety of in-ear plug and while they did well at noise cancellation, they were very uncomfortable. These, on the other hand, are extremely comfortable. So comfortable, in fact, I almost walked out of the building forgetting I still had them in my ears. As far as noise cancellation, these are not deaf quiet, but it's plenty for a shooting range. I haven't tested them in any other venue, but I'd have to assume they'd be great anywhere you need them. I'm very glad I didn't spring for a more expensive earplug and got these instead. You really can't beat the price.",

Cons: Peltor ships these with the cord rolled up, and one was tied pretty tightly in a knot. And after taking them out, the cord was kinked. I warmed up a cup of hot (not boiling) water, and heated them up for a few minutes, then stretched them out to remove the kink.",

      "text": "These earplugs are pretty good! They are comfortable and easy to clean. Personally, I find that they \"take the edge\" off of noise, as opposed to truly blocking it. For the price, they are an excellent value. It's nice to be able to keep a pair in my purse, a pair at home, etc. The color is pretty bright, as shown, but I find that if I wear them with the wire part behind my head and under my hair, it's more discreet. For me, these serve the purpose of dulling & softening sounds (though not eliminating them) when noise gets to be too much. Would recommend!",
