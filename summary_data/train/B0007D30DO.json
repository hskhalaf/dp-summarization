I had to let the compressor catch up every now and then because it stoped working very well under 70 psi, but that's my compressor's fault, not this thing's. Beats pay $100+ for the dedicated soda blasters I found online.",

If you want to clean, for example, a truck frame, it'll do the job but it's going to take you a little bit of time and patience. But like I said, for small parts, it works very, very well. I've posted a couple of pictures. I hope this review helps.",

      "text": "I bought this to clean up my curb from previously painted addresses. The old rectangle was too wide, and didn't leave a top nor bottom gap. This kit fixed that up just great. The curb now looks like it's supposed to. My air compressor couldn't keep up, so I had to take frequent breaks. Also, I live in the Southwest with very low humidity. There wasn't an issue with condensate during this job. It took about 30 minutes total, including filtering the sand through a window screen.",
