Franchise mode takes forever and is horrible on this version. No match for the PSP versions. The franchise mode was one of my favorite gameplay options.",

Do I think the graphics are pushing the system? I hope not because there is room for improvement. The game controls well, dual sticks and all the buttons you need mke this a playable portable experience.",

You can't just have two people in the same room link up wirelessly and go at it. Instead, you have to have access to the internet. Other than that, I'd recommend it, again, for those looking for a sports game play on the go.",

Overall, I am happy and would recommend this game for Vita. Buy it and show your friends what the Vita can do !!! We have to support this Awesome System.

      "text": "I have gotten TONS of value outta this game. Really fun. I have had a few people say oh its not as Good as the PS3 version. Its Great for the PS vita. Controlls well tons of options and play mods. and when it gets easy to beat teams change the skill levels and its challenging again. Only other game i got is MLB13 only 2 i bought directly rest are from the PSPLUS program. WOuld Recomend this to any Madden football fan for sure.",

I have bought the madden franchise since the SNES days and I am probably disappointed with this one the most because it underutilizes the Vita capabilities and is a cheap copy. Hopefully '14 will be better for Vita but I will wait for initial reviews before I buy.",
