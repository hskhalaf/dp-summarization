The most protective Nuzari cover is only a few bucks more than their lower end cover and is definitely worth it. The covers do fade with the elements but they protect the bikes. This is the only MC cover I will buy. Excellent quality. Very good value. Seller is very responsive.",

I have found with previous motorcycles and covers that if it doesn't touch the ground rain droplets splash the bottom of my bike and cause dirt blotches. Also, it works good if my bike is on its stands with the bigger size.",

The reflective lines make it easy to spot in my back yard at night. There's also enough slack to place it over the bike with the helmet still attached to the bike.",

The part inside the cover that would touch the hot pipe is rendered useless and I will have to wait for the bike to completely cool before putting it on. I like that the name helps you determine right away which part is the front. One pic is the medium and the other a large.",

This cover is well built and I like that the seams are reflective material since I often have to park on the street. I've paid three times as much for lesser quality covers in the past. The sizing recommendations are spot on. I ordered the Medium for my CBR and it fit perfectly. I would highly recommend this cover to anyone.",

I know some covers are thin but this one is best it's thick and covers the whole bike. We have an 2016 R6 and R3 and its amazing that it covers everything even the wheels and underneath the bike it's like wrapping the bike. Also it's waterproof. I would highly recommend this covers to everyone I know that has bike and to all the people that are looking for covers.",
