NJ weather is really unpredictable, overnight spring is here, so is weed and bugs! Mosquito and bugs always a bother when you stayed outside. The unit is very quiet and the LED light is good after dark. We put by the door in case any bugs will fly in when everyone in and out the door. We did not get any mosquito but 3 small moths. I believe the light will attract flying bugs and mosquito.",
