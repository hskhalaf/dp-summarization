The pivot feature for me is very useful as it help prevent outlets from being blocked by larger plugs. The power strip is well-built, feels solid, and easily wall mountable. The cord is a heavy gauge and is long enough, approximately 6ft, to be able to plug at a farther outlet. I would prefer if the plug were flat, instead of a standard 3-prong plug, but it\u2019s not a major issue or deal breaker for me. Ultimately, this is power strip is an excellent buy, especially with the numerous outlets and functionality.",
