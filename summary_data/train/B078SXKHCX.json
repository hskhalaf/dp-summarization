I decided to try out Raw & Root because they did not add sweetener to it and I liked the additional herbs added in. This product is fantastic!! I haven't had to take any sinus medication in over three weeks. I add a scoop to unsweetened almond milk and add a little honey also. I look forward to my morning cup every day. I am usually suffering with severe headaches every day and now I know what it's like to not have even a twinge of pain!",

It says to use one tsp (one scoop). The scoop is not equivalent to one teaspoon. The scoop is marked 11cc, one teaspoon is 5cc. So people are putting in more than twice what they should which is probably why they think it tastes bad or upsetting their stomach. Get a properly measured teaspoon and it tastes wonderful!",

I was so impressed I added a scoop to my morning protein shake and it was also delicious (Optimum vanilla protein powder, banana, various seeds, and skim milk). I'm looking forward to trying it with coffee next, as well as the suggested heated latte recipe. And a nice little surprise - it comes with a scoop in the jar.",

Just the right amount of vanilla. Decent with hot water and a splash of milk, heavy cream, or non-dairy \"mylk.\" Let's face it--I'm consuming turmeric for the benefits, not the flavor.

I wasn\u2019t sure how it would taste but let me tell you it is so tasty I blended mine in the bullet to make it frothy sooo delicious I also use coconut milk so if you want more smooth probably just use regular milk but it has such great body and smoothness it is a little grainy at the bottom of cup but that\u2019s just from all the spices no biggie \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd",

I switched to whole milk for the fat and I actually LOVE it with the milk, much creamier and I'm not a milk fan!",

As the \u201cmedical claims\u201d those obviously unverified. For the flavor I added half a spoon of raw honey and extra cinnamons to whats in the product and makes it better.",
