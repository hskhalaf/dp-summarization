The material of this bagpack felt really... rough. But there were much more serious issues. The front compartment seemed to be defective and no amount of force could close the zipper. Also the stitching inside were ripped. I don't know.. there were reviews that said you were paying a brand premium for Herschel when compared to something like Jansport which btw i ended up buying but thats another story..\ud83d\ude43 maybe this unique example is a knockoff or defective or a defective knockoff?? Hmmm life's many mysteries we must muddle thru... \ud83e\udd14",

If all of these are made like this then I would recommend a different backpack, but hopefully I just got unlucky with this backpack. For the price, that rip should not have happened without rigorous use which is my reasoning for a 4 star. I still use it regardless of the rip and has held up well other than that. Nice that it has a laptop pocket.",

The old one I had lasted about 5 years and still looked pretty darn good considering I used it every single day. Sadly, the zipper for the larger of the two front pockets came off. After repeated use, the fabric at the base of the zipper ripped and when I went to close it, the zipper closed completely and then the actual zipper fell right off. 4 Stars since they're kind of expensive and I thought it would last even longer considering the price and quality.

However this version of their backpacks have plenty of compartments on the front and also a very very thick an soft flap for laptops in the main pocket. The bag is also overall pretty large and holds a ton of items. The downside to me using bags like these is that the bottom tends to get dirty very easily, and because it\u2019s a leather in the design I chose, it will definitely rip and deteriorate much faster than other bags. However, it doesn\u2019t bother me that much and I\u2019ll still be happy to use it.",

I like the cloth or felt lined top pocket that holds and protects from my sunglasses from being scratched. Also, the laptop sleeve is the same material as the top pocket and holds my Surface RT perfectly. The front pocket (the one behind the white zipper pocket) has a lot of individual pockets and pen holders that nicely organize everything I have. I'm really satisfied with my purchase, I bought this back in January 2014 and it's still in almost perfect condition now September 2014.",

The simple gray design is exactly what I was looking for. My only complaint is that the two main compartment zippers have a lip of fabric over them that makes it difficult to open and close. You can fold the lip back to make it easier, but I find it just gets in the way. I think, though, that most Herschel bags (and other brands) have that lip, too.",
