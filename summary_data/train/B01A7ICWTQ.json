This is really a problem with some connector 'shells' being too large, and not the fault of this case.",

This case fits snuggly onto my S7 and while it does add some size to the phone it feels much more comfortable in my hand and less likely to slip out. The hard shock absorbing material covering the usual bumper points provides all the security for your phones body. The face also has a slightly lifted edge which means you can safely place your phone face down without worry of scratches. I personally love the carbon fiber design and would recommend this in the future.",

The buttons work very nicely, the holes are placed just right, and it looks pretty stylish. It also has a small lip to protect your screen. Get this case, not the crappy JTech ripoff of it.

Just in the day I had it, it slipped or wanted to multiple times. Save yourself some time and trouble, spend a few more dollars and get a Speck case. Ive had one for years and never had an issue or damage.",
