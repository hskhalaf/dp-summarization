The multiple lenses are clear, come in a handy container to keep them scratch-free, and attach/detach from the frame easily. The light/headlamp works just fine, perhaps could be a bit brighter but then you'd have to sacrifice the headset's light weight. Has enough room to even wear glasses under the magnification lenses.

The added light is also nice to have. I don't use it much but having it there when I do need it is great! For the price you can't beat this. I removed the glasses arms and use the headband attachment. Fits much better this way. But I also have a circular head, so the arms were a tad tight on my temple area. Again using the included head band attachment eliminates this completely. Very pleased!",

My advice is to order nose pads along with the magnifiers and you will find you like these as well as I do.",

They seem to have thought this out when they produced it because it will do just about everthing you would need something like this for. I hope that it holds up well. Time will tell. It came packed very well and the sent batteries and written directions with illustrations (this is very rare nowdays)",

I used these glasses with the highest magnification lens and I could see the embedded splinter so clearly! It was successfully removed in seconds, using pointed tweezers with my left hand. I never could have accomplished this with a traditional magnifying glass. You need to hold those with one hand, preventing working on the splinter. This is actually why I purchased these glasses... The ability to use both of my hands with splinter removals. I do a lot of yard work in AZ and these are a Godsend!",

I bought his product along with a Circuit Board Holder I also purchased from Amazon, and it just made the job so much easier. I would highly recommend this product for soldering and for doing detailed work on very tiny parts.",

It's also nice to have a range of different lenses, although I typically just use the highest power. The only annoyance is that the light uses 3AAA batteries. With these in place, it makes the unit a little too heavy and reduces the comfort, so I don't use the built-in light and just use external task lighting instead.",

The LED leaves something to be desired as it creates a hot spot, and would benefit from a diffuser. Your can easily add or remove the headband. All in all, I'd call it a quality product.",
