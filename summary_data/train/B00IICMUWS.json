It is just the right weight, not noticeably heavy, but it has enough weight that it doesn't feel terribly cheap. The trackpad works well, although I had to track down separate software from Microsoft to turn off the tap to click function. It would seem like Microsoft could provide that functionality in their own operating system with a product they sell, but I digress. I wouldn't use this as my main keyboard for gaming or for lots of typing, but for managing and accessing media it works well.",

Initially I was frustrated with the keyboard because the Function keys defaulted to their media key functions, and were messing with my normal keyboard shortcuts (when Alt - F4 puts your computer to sleep instead of closing the window it's quite annoying). Since there's no Fn Lock key to be found on the keyboard, I was afraid I may have to return it, however I came to find that you can toggle the Function lock by pressing Fn + Caps Lock and now this is the perfect all-in-one keyboard.",

It even lets you set up the \"media\" key (the one with a picture of a pair of headphones) to start iTunes. It's wide enough to sit easily on my lap. Probably the only thing I can fault is the trackpad is designed to be used with your right hand (I'm left-handed).",

Other than that, it's great for my specific use. Update: 2 months of continuous use and I'm still on the original batteries. Update: 11 months, still using the original batteries.",

      "text": "My old TV-puter remote wireless keyboard croaked from abuse from the kids and missing keys, which was a track ball type. This one was cheaper and the quality is higher. Besides occasional reception issues (they all have that I imagine) it has been great. Once you download the drivers from microsoft the it has programmable keys which I use to quickly open media player classic and toggle the a playlist. The volume function alone was worth the switch though. I had to fight the old one to track ball over to the various volume sliders. Overall a highly recommended TV-puter remote.",
