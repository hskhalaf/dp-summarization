Clean-up is a cinch with either a wipe or a short soak with vinegar, then a wipe. The nonstick material does seem to be thin so make sure you don't scrape it hard even with a gentle spatula. I just douse it with a little oil prior to use if I\"m concerned about any sticking, and that has worked great so far. I use this thing multiple times a day.",

After we used this the first time and saw how easy and well it worked, we were hooked. Would highly recommend.",

However, the instructions say that you should not get it wet. So I find myself wiping it over and over again with a damp cloth, which is very time consuming. They should have manufactured it so that the surface could be removed and washed out separately. To summarize, it works very well but takes a lot of time to clean.",

This quesadilla maker is super easy to clean and looks great on my counter.",

Still within return window, so going to exchange for a new one and see how that one holds up.",
