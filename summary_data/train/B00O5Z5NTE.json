There are two software options: the dedicated HP program or the free offered Silverfast. People will tend to prefer one or the other, but a choice for which is best is not quite as simple as might seem. I've found that the best result program choice varies from film to film. It's probably OK to use the auto dust/scratch removal with either program, but leave stuff like colour balance and unsharp mask sharpening for export to your other non-scan programs.",

The power button is mushy and needs to be held for a second or 2, its difficult to know if the unit has been turned on or off successfully, the activity light is under a lip, so if you're scanning multiple photos it's not always easy to tell if the scanner has finished it's current job. However, the scanned results are very very good. I would recommend this but I wish that it wasn't made by Epson, I wish Apple had designed it as the build quality for such an expensive product isn't what I have come to expect.",

It objects loudly if you try to turn it on with this in place!",
