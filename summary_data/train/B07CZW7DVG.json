The label indicates it is safe to machine wash and dry. Considering the quality of this mat, I felt it was very overpriced, and I would suggest finding a better quality bathmat for the price.",

In the attached photo, you can see one of the mats is clearly darker, especially along the border. Be wary if you want to match two bathmats. -- This bathmat is high quality for the price. The memory foam is thick, and the reverse side doesn't slide at all on my tile floor. The mat absorbs water well and doesn't stay wet too long. I'll update after a few months to see how it holds up against mold. I wish it came it larger sizes though, 18\" is quite small.",
