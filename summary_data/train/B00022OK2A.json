You won't be cooking ribs in any traditional way, but for steaks, chicken, burgers, pork tenderloin and similar, this is a more intimate experience and will use somewhat less charcoal to get to searing temperatures and is real grilling, not a kettle, which has its own plusses, like cooking ribs.",

I spray mine down with coconut oil spray after each use, then tear it down and store it indoors. Because of this, I only use it for parties, but that's fine. If I want fast and convenient I use the gas grill. If I want great food, I use the Lodge Sportsman. This entire grill is made in the USA, and if cared for properly, will last a few life times.

The one hiccup is the portability. It\u2019s a bit on the heavy side for a weekend camping trip, and if you hold it by the handle the weight shifts to the front. I\u2019ve cooked with charcoal, cherry wood and sassafras and have had no issues with getting it up to temperature. Would recommend to any and everyone.",

Excellent for Kabobs.(I simply do not put the grill plate on) The skewers fit great on the edges of the grill making it so easy to turn.The only negative thing that I could say about this grill is the handle definitely does not balance the grill-- it wants to flip the grill forward when lifting by the handle.

So far I've grilled steak, hot dogs, kabobs and chicken which all turned out well. Prior efforts on larger barbecue grills were disappointing in comparison. I never got the hang of them; this Lodge, though, fires up nicely and being cast iron retains heat well. Of course, the downsides are you'll need a cover to protect it from the rain. The grill has no edges so hot dogs can roll off and there are only two height adjustments. But even with those short comings, I'd buy this grill again.",

If that's what you want then that's what you get. It's heavy duty cast iron throughout with obvious attention to detail and I'm sure this cooker will still be going when my warranty expires. I suggest using natural lump type charcoal, not briquets, and a stack starter.",
