This one actually seems heavier / more durable than the basket that came with the dishwasher! Like other's I apparently had a burn-out in the left section of the original basket. I started having flatware drop through a hole that formed, catching, so basket resisted moving forward. Will definitely order again should need arise!!!",

PS: The measurements on the product description are very accurate, so measure with confidence.
