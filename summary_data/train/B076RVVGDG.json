But so far the battery in the Dewalt will outlast my energy, especially in this warmer weather.",

By the time I've finished my malty beverage, the battery is charged in my vehicle and off we go for another 1/4 chord. I also bought the 40-volt line trimmer to make use of the same battery and the 2 tools are a GREAT combination. My original intention was to return this tool if it did not meet ALL of my requirements, but it is definitely staying! Cheers,",

      "text": "I bought the saw separate and got the expensive 7.5 amp battery. I used it a lot this summer on only one charge. It does use quite a lot of chain oil and leaks a bit as other review mentioned. I keep it on a door mat so that is not a big factor. DeWalt is a good brand and I will likely add other items that use 40 volt batteries such as a trimmer and maybe a blower. Unfortunately, the 20 volt line is much larger and more popular due to price etc. which is another slight downside.",
