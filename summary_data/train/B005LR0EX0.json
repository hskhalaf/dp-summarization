The length is perfect when searing steaks or vegetables on a really hot grill but I wish that Weber had paid a little more attention to the open/close mechanism. Weber went for a very traditional open/close mechanism that feel flimsy and have a tendency to get stuck when you want to open or close in a hurry. Maybe a more substantial mechanism would fix this problem.",
