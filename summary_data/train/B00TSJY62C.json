Really tears up thick grass, heavy weeds and brushy areas.",

      "text": "The second time I used it, the trimmer fell apart. The front pulley pulled out of its seating and the belt broke. I contacted Amazon about this over a week ago and have not heard anything back. It was supposed to be guaranteed until July 26, 2016 by Amazon, but it doesn't appear that their guarantee means that much. I am very disappointed. I feel like I have wasted $299.00 on a piece of junk. I bought a 2 year warranty but it says I have to wait until Amazon's warranty ends. Meanwhile, I have a $299.00 lawn trimmer I can't use.",
