Of course, since I am in my eighties, I am still busy going with a fine comb through the Manual, which I downloaded and printed out a larger format. I am enjoying the challenge with so many features.",

The used camera was supplied in a maker's box, not a mark on it, and with far more extras than indicated in the Amazon description. Top marks to the vendor. This is a very advanced piece of kit, initial tests show accurate focussing and exposure, but I have yet to test all its capabilities. This is not a beginners' or entry level camera. Simply want to compliment the vendor on an excellent package - though for the price paid Special Delivery would have been welcome.",

      "text": "Bought to replace a Pentax 1st body with a dead sensor. A much more sophisticated camera - a lot of progress in a few years. It is quite complicated enough as a lower end model and takes all my lenses. Seems to be rather more intelligent in using older Pentax K and Screw (with bayonet adaptor) lenses (I've been a slave to the Pentax screw mount for nearly 60 years). The battery arrangements seem rather ad hoc : a proprietary Li ion battery clipping into a 4x round cell (AA?) space and an extra battery cage being needed to use AA batteries . The Maxsimafoto cage from Amazon is perfectly well made - no need to Pentax!",

It is heavy, bulky and does not hang well around the neck when sitting on your chest, and care must be taken when carrying over the shoulder to prevent knocking the lens. though this would be the case with and SLR?",
