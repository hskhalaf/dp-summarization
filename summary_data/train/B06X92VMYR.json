      "title": "Compact DSLR with super-fast autofocus",
      "text": "Bought this as an upgrade to an EOS600D. The major improvements can be summed up as follows - 24 mega pixel vs 18, quicker and vastly more sophisticated autofocus system, rear touch screen, faster sequential photos, built-in stabilisation system for video, included Wifi/Bluetooth (for file transfer, camera control etc), top LCD display. A few 'negatives' - the battery life seems to be shorter, no 4K video. Overall I am very pleased I made the upgrade and believe the money was well spent.",

Had to have mine professionally cleaned out within a fortnight of purchasing it (even the viewfinder was full of junk) still not 100% clear now. And I hadn't taken it anywhere dusty at all. The photos are nice and crisp and accurate but the battery dies much quicker than my 700D and my neewer flash has problems connecting.",

The mode dial locks unless you press the release, no more finding the dial's been bumped after you've gone to take the picture. Still to find out what the battery life's like and how the low light AF is compared to the old one, plenty more playing to do.",

Photoshop users be aware that the RAW files produced by this camera require the latest versions of adobe camera raw to be installed which if you have CS6 or earlier will not be available to you. You will therefore need to use Adobe's DNG converter or spend pots of cash on upgrading your Photoshop/Lightroom versions. Really pleased that I purchased this camera only minus point so far is that the body feels rather 'plasticky' when compared to other EOS systems that I've used. Probably add more reviews after a period of serious use.",
