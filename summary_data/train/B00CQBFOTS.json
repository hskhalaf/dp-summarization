I have my main inline fan pulling air in from the bottom of my large tent, sucking it out the top of the tent then blowing it into the bottom of the smaller seedling or veg tent. This booster then sucks the air out the top. This keeps my flowering tent perfect at around 73 degrees while the other tent is around 77. Both ideal for th usage of each tent.",
