We reviewed higher end Samsonite luggage sets, but could never quite embrace their product. We also checked out Tumi, and decided it was not worth the price point. Travelpro's quality, craftsmanship, and warranty won us over. We also have the 26\", and planning to purchase the 29\". Definitely a recommended purchase (p.s. I am not a bot, I am a real person!

The criticism that the suiter isn't wide enough for the shoulders of a coat is valid, but it can't be wider that the rollaboard is tall, so I'm not sure how Travelpro could solve that.

The built-in Suiter and using packing tubes really maximize what you can pack. We were at 18kg/40 lbs fully loaded.
