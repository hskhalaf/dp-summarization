It was not shiny and the strands of hair are very natural, not thick and coarse like some. I used it to thicken already long hair if your adding length to short hair I would recommend two. Auburn color was spot on.",

They where fulfilled by amazon, Items came in a silver sealed bag I have a feeling we shall be buying more colors. ( I am glad I got myself a proper wig brush).",
