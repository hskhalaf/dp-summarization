But what stinks is that it either came with a rip or somehow ripped when we put it on just now. I will get some needle and thread today to patch it up rather than returning it because of how much I love the fit. I just hope the rest of the seams hold up! Edit- by the next day anoth rip occurred up on the corner. So it does have weak seams and isn't going to last very long unfortunately!",

Anyway they have a curved back, winged arms and claw feet and I wasn't sure how nicely a slipcover would work. It covered and tucked in amazingly well! Easy directions, I like the fabric, and am so glad we got a two piece design as it really helps everything stay in place to have the cushions separate. It's not the same as a new couch but I am pretty happy with the results for now. Definitely recommend this product.",

One us a \"large\" love seat. 70\" long and 30\" deep, with removable back pillows and seat cushions. It fit. My other is a standard love seat about 60\" long and 12\" deep with just removable seat cushions. It fit both of them and looks great. I would recommend the zipper and elastic version just because of it's versatile nature. Made my ugly mismatched couches look great.",
