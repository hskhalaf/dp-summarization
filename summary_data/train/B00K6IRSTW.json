There are three reasons why you should buy these guys instead of some of the alternative offerings: 1. They are an L shape instead of an inverted T. As a result they don't interfere with other objects on the shelf 2. They are tall enough to get the job done without being too tall to fit on a shelf dedicated to paperbacks. 3. They are inexpensive.",

They work well to brace up a stack of books and the material on the bottom provides grip so that they don\u2019t slide off. Being right-angled in shape, they don\u2019t have a tab or edge to hang off and so work well to create a flush edge with the end of a shelf. They\u2019re also slim and not too tall, so they can fit in narrow spaces or be used hold Blu-ray cases without standing up too tall. The metal appears durable without being too heavy, so they should be easy to use for anyone.",
