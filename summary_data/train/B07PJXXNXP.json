      "verdict": "While people liked the New Balance Fresh Foam Arishi v2 for what it had to offer, more than a few of them weren\u2019t happy with some of its parts. While the lightweight construction was praised, the midsole was criticized for being unsupportive of the tendons and muscles of the underfoot. In fact, most of the complaints were about the cushioning unit as it was apparently flimsy compared to other Fresh Foam models. But the flexibility and the general durability of this road companion were highlighted as effective aspects.",
      "pros": [
        "The general durability of the Fresh Foam Arishi v2 was welcomed",
        "people didn\u2019t experience any material breakdown or separation",
        "The various color schemes that were available were lauded because they made the shoe pop visually",
        "Purchasers were happy with the breathable upper, stating that it kept the foot as dry and ventilated as possible",
        "The flexibility of this running shoe was appreciated",
        "testers noted that they were able to quickly transition through the gait without any hindrances",
        "The light construction of this product gained praise as it didn\u2019t cause the runners to feel as if their movements were marred or limited"

      "cons": [
        "Some consumers stated that the Fresh Foam unit in the midsole of the Arishi v2 wasn\u2019t as responsive or full-bodied as the ones in other shoes that feature the tech",
        "Several testers lamented the lack of an arch support mechanism",
        "they felt that the flat surface of the midsole didn\u2019t offer much comfort or steadiness to the foot-pad"

      "text": "UPDATE: The worst shoes I've ever bought. I've never hated shoes so much. Only six months and there's a hole in them already, very cheap material, insole keeps moving, laces keep coming untied....just terrible. Very lightweight and comfortables shoe, just what I expected from New Balance. However,this shoe has THE flimsiest tongue I have ever seen in a shoe. It's beyond annoying! Every time you stick your foot in the shoe, the tongue shoots straight back into the toe box. You pretty much have to sit down or bend over to put your shoes on every time. I'm very disappointed, and will not be buying this shoe again.",

It fits adequately and is roomy enough to wear with a thin sock, but considering it is supposed to be a 4E, has no width or room in the toe box to spare. The upper doesn't give or breathe particularly well either. All in all it is a decent shoe that is attractive and serves its purpose.",

Best thing about them is the look of the shoe and the flexibility. Also, as others have mentioned the tongue will easily move to the side. So if that\u2019s a deal breaker don\u2019t buy this shoe.",

Shoe collar around heel is thin, I am worried about side rip-out does not appear to be reinforced laterally.

These also aren't as comfortable as the higher end fresh foam running shoes (which I also own). These are great for walking and casual usage. As other reviews state, the tongue of the shoe and heel aren't as sturdy as their high end running shoes so you have to untie them to get in and out. On the upside of that, this makes the shoe a bit more sleek. So rating this based on it being a walking shoe.",
