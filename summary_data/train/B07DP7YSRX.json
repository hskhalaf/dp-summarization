Whole process takes about an hour. I use C_fe B_steo brand fine ground coffee and we drink it within a day or two with milk. Very nice. I really like the care in the packaging and the included color pamphlet with recipes and tips. A quality product from people who care in my opinion. Thanks and kind regards",
