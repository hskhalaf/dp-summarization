At the end I ended up just buying an $80 Craftsman from Lowe\u2019s. 3 weeks later one of those tire blew. Hmm... I then spent $80 on replacement wheels that are a size larger and hard. In one word: Awesome!!! \u201cComfortable\u201d enough, yet very hard \u2014 enough to take a heavy load. Bearings are less noisy then the original wheels as well. Solid 5 stars. Would have been 6 stars if these would have a grease nipple :)",

This tire is advertised for 500 pound capacity, not that I can handle that weight, and other tires were only 300 pounds and more expensive. One I saw had separated from the hub under load and I didn\u2019t want to risk that. I think I can happily live with this compromise.
