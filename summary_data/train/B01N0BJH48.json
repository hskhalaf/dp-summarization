I'm super impressed with the customer service that this company has. In addition to that - I ordered a replacement and the new set works perfectly. I would buy this again and I'll probably use this as a gift idea for friends. Honestly don't worry about my lid issue - and trust if you have one that they'll fix it for you. I am very pleased with my experience.",
