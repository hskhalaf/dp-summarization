I wish I would've listened to the bad reviews. This is simple to set up. I put both babes in and couldn't get it to turn very easily. I chalked it up to just needing to be moved and more. Nope.

Second, the bottom seat does not click when put in place so it's not secure. It is Sunday today so I am hoping when I call customer service tomorrow they will be able to help with these issues.
