The only time water comes out the frog's mouth is during direct contact with the sun. If a cloud passes over water stops flowing from frog's mouth. I get approximately 1 hour in a 24-hour day to enjoy water dispersing from frog's mouth. The only reason I'm keeping it is because my little grandson loves it.",

So in my case it gets sun from about 10 am - 3 pm., and only runs during that time. Mine sits on the ground in a courtyard so it does need to be cleaned about once a month. Overall for the price and quality I feel it was a very good purchase, and it fit perfectly in the small area I had.",

I did not need a big one sitting in my small garden. This fountain had a few dents, the small piece at the bottom of the frog that has to be inserted into the bowl was broken off. But it still could firmly in the bowl. I don't know about birds, but feral cats enjoy drinking water from it. Fountaine is functioning not just little cute fountain but also as an expensive water bowl for outdoor cats.",

It seems unless you have strong direct sunlight the water trickles more than flows. Like having the option of using solar or electrical power. I use the electrical adapter more, then it doesn't start and stop. The wildlife seem to enjoy as much as I do. Would recommend.",
