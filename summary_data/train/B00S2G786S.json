      "text": "Waste of money. This product is more of a lubricant than vitamin c serum. The rope two ingredient are water and glycerin which is used in hair gel and is basically a lubricant that leaves a shiny top layer on the skin not actually soaking into your pores. It peels off after minutes of drying and looks flaky and disgusting. This is not what a true vitamin C serum should look or smell like. I\u2019m so disappointed.",

At first it worked wonders for my skin, however, by my 3rd order, the product was no longer a thin liquid, it was more of a sticky gel, which took forever to absorb into my skin and seemed less effective. I am saddened that they changed the formula so suddenly without mentioning that in the description, so I hope this review will help other people before they purchase.",

The product is also pricey for what you get. The bottle is not filled to the top. Also since the bottle is dark brown it is hard to see how much is left. Received the Vit C serum 4 days ago, used it only 4 times - 2 droppers/day - and the bottle seems almost empty already!!",

Not sure if that\u2019s true, but I have some melasma and I will try anything that will help it. This product is gentle and has never caused me to break out like others have. While it does feel slightly tacky when I first apply it, it is soon absorbed into my skin and the stickiness goes away completely. For me, this is a must-have.",

Remember to use spf every morning of at least 30 when using this ( I would advise using this in a night routine ) because you will cause damage. MY ONLY downside about this product is that it does not label the percentage of vitamin c in it therefore 3 stars",
