C'mon Nike and others, everybody doesn't have a narrow foot. And we deserve nice kicks too. These joints feel amazeballs. I purchased an extra wide and these awesome.",

I can walk in these shoes for longer than most others I have tried recently (12 other pairs) without discomfort. The shoes are light and seem a bit more rugged than most running shoes, although not sure how they would fair on actual trails. I use them mostly for walking on paved/grassy/dirt surfaces as well as a treadmill and they feel great. The soles feel grippy, although I have not tried them on wet surfaces yet. Overall for the price (< $25) this is a great buy.",
