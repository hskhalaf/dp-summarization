It is exactly like the ones I used as a kid. No tools needed and extremely sturdy. My kids miss the ball and smack the rubberized tube all the time and nothing has happened to it. Worth the money. It is an investment and I would not hesitate bringing this to every tee ball practice for years to come.",

      "text": "We ordered this tee on Feb 25, and received it shortly thereafter. It's been perfect for our 4.5 yr old to practice batting, as the height is adjustable and the base is stable so it doesn't topple over. The main problem is that the rubber is already cracking at the seams. Since this isn't undergoing heavy duty use, it's really disappointing that it's already falling apart in less than a month of use. I suppose we'll have to super glue it to keep it from cracking all the way down, but I would expect having to do that after extended use, not only a few weeks of use by a preschooler with a plastic bat.",

      "text": "After about one hundred balls hit from a five year old, the Tee snapped off the base. After closer inspection, the Tee is only tack welded in four small areas at the base mount. Since the plate base is weighted, this allows the minuscule connections to vibrate and break. Not sure what the warranty is, I certainly don't want to pay shipping back for a replacement. I am thinking maybe I can beef of the support and weld a better bracket on.",
