Over the past couple of months, however, it has become little more than a gigantic waste of (a LOT of space) on our kitchen counter. For some reason it no longer maintains consistent temperature, so one waffle will be perfect, and the next will be a congealed mess. I reached out to All-Clad to see if they'd do anything about it, but their response was effectively \"sorry about your luck.\" We have a $30 Cuisinart heart shaped waffle maker that at this points does a better job more consistently. Save the extra $130 and buy something else.",

However, when I received this product I was very disappointed. The very important overflow batter catch doesn\u2019t stay in place and it makes a very difficult mess to clean up if it moves slightly out of place. The problem is that the little plastic cup doesn\u2019t lock in place, and the cord for the device sits right underneath it, so it constantly hits the cup. The slightest touch makes the cup move, and creates a big mess.",

I like the locking feature. The iron feels very sturdy and well build. The only disappointment is the overflow container. It feels cheap and does not stay on place when I move the iron even slightly. Cannot say anything about durability yet, but based on price it must last at least 10 years. :)",

I recommend setting the temperature at a 2 or 3...then increasing as needed (this thing gets really hot).

The only thing missing from the design of this unit is the lack of removable inserts to enable easier cleaning.

The 7 browning settings are perfect I typically use 5 sometimes 7 for my keto waffles. Haven\u2019t tried and regular Waffles in here yet but I bet they would be perfect.",

That bell provides a useful reminder, especially when I'm in the next room eating or visiting. A disadvantage of the All-Clad is that it makes only two 4-inch-square waffles at a time. So we bought two All-Clads because we sometimes host 25 people at waffle party open houses. Our family and friends are delighted with our All-Clad waffles.",

If attached properly it will do it's job. If you're indecisive about buying don't be. Go ahead take the leap!",
