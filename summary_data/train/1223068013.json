My 4 yo grandson loved using the scooper to pour sand in the funnel and filling up the bottle, He wants to do the \u201csand activity\u201d again. Be sure to place an old sheet or something on the floor to catch the spills. Then,throw away the whole mess instead of trying to clean it up - it is VERY fine sand. Might be better to make it an outside activity, if there is no wind",

You can make your own sand design however you like using the scoop and funnel provided. We put a paper towel under the bottles when they were filled and that made clean up of spilled sand easy. My daughter filled one bottle with straight colored stripes, held one at an angle so the stripes go higher to one side, and in the last bottle she mixed the colors some so the colors gradually changed instead of the hard lines. The corks fit tightly and keep the bottle securely closed. They look great and she's proud to display them.",
