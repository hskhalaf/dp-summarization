I just tilt them on my loop and cut loose just like the old quickdraws from cowboy days. Just don't forget to open them because you know you'll be half cocked. Truly amazing. The only downside is the multiple annoying emails I've gotten to get me to write a review. Even so 5 stars!",

I try to get more colorful styles like bright colors (pink, orange, light green) or unique patterns (e.g. leopard) but lost too many pairs.

If they sold a 5 in, I would try them one more time.. they are just too big for an L&D nurse to carry.",
