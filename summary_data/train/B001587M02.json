I needed to add 1 speaker to a small room in an office and I would best describe it as a light duty speaker; it puts off sound, but don\u2019t expect to be full bass and treble. Music sounds ok, but definitely not mind-blowing. Basic and good for the price if you need a little audio. It did not sound good when I really cranked up the volume, so I would not recommend it for surround sound or home audio, but for light duty its fine.",

In the end, the sound is warm, can get louder than I would want, and is clean at the lowest listening levels. Very satisfied.",

Purchased five and i can not be happier. The installation was so easy, the only challenge was running the cables. I had Bose speakers before and yes, the sound is terrific but i needed to consider the look at this time and Klipsch delivered.",
