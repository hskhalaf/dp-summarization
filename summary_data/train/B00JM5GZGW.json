I have tried value brands and even making my own dough, but this dough is superior. It's soft and easy to mold and doesn't stain clothes. Honestly, I don't know why people try to make their own. The dye comes off and gets all over and the texture always seems sticky no matter what. This dough is the way to go, and this pack is the best pack I have come across for color samples and value.",
