It is a very straight up rendition of one of the Marvel family legacies, depending on who and when the story telling is being done. Are they still related or not related anymore? I would have been more stoked if Quicksilver was in his traditional first appearance green instead of blue costume but am thrilled to have him none the less. Maybe Marvel will correct that with another set and include his now ex-wife Crystal of the Inhumans who STILL has never been presented and include their daughter Luna and Maybe Lockjaw. Now that would be amazing.",

I like this version of Magneto better than the recently released Marvel Now! figure, despite them sharing the same body mold, because I prefer the red and purple color scheme. Magneto also comes with two new head sculpts that are fantastic.",
