      "verdict": "Consumers are instantly lured to the refined look of the Polo Ralph Lauren Clarke which goes well with casual to dressy outfits. It offers moderate cushioning which may not be sufficient if you\u2019re after a sneaker that pillows your feet. It is quite bigger than the stand size which can be resolved by going a half size down. Although it isn\u2019t equipped and reinforced for vigorous activities, this smartly designed pair is something you can add to your sneaker rotation as it won\u2019t dig a hole in your pocket.",
      "pros": [
        "A lot of reviewers gave the Polo Ralph Lauren Clarke a full five-star rating as they loved its composition",
        "Those who have flat feet liked the sole construction of this shoe which comes with reasonably good arch support",
        "The roomy area inside the shoe provides enough space for supportive inserts",
        "A significant number of satisfied wearers grabbed another pair of this shoe",
        "Some of those with wide foot went a half size bigger and loved that this shoe does not pinch on the pinky toes",
        "A kind of sneaker that\u2019s not complicated to dress up or down",
        "Satisfied buyers rated this sneaker to be extremely stylish",
        "The style of this shoe is so appropriate to wear with jeans, tees, and polos",
        "A decent pair of shoe with an affordable cost"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "The Polo Ralph Lauren Clarke seems to be way oversized in length that some returned their purchases and in place of a full size down",
        "Less than a handful reviewer who is enamored with this shoe at first glance, cited it fell apart in less than six months",
        "It looks way better online, said by a handful",
        "The adhesive used in fastening the sole and upper isn\u2019t strong enough that the rubber gets detached quite quickly, mentioned by few users"
