Also, given that these were the \"waterproof\" version of the style, I found it kind of bizarre that they had a distinct crunching sound when you flexed these shoes. I'm sure it's the inner membrane, but just note that it is audibly noticeable. I really liked many Merrell shoes over the years, but this style is a hard pass.",
