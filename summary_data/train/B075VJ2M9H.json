Very sturdy, well made, comes with a warranty, and looks clean to top it off! My PS4, all accessories, and even games fit comfortably and seem quite secure! Highly recommend this case!!",

It's easy to take across town or across the country. Bag is high quality and feel very sturdy. You can move the padded walls on the accessory side. Velcro strap holds PS4 (and my gaming monitor) tightly. I would recommend this bag to anyone who travels with their PS4.",

But it's much simpler with the ps4 since it only comes with 2 cords. With that, you can fit so many more items. You can fit pretty much everything for your ps4 in this case. The inside is even customizable, so you can organize it the way you want. If you are looking for a good way to transport your ps4, this is a good buy. :)",
