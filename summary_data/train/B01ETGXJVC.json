Then I found this product which is less expensive and tried it. It is not as powerful as the Murad but does do the job. I like the spray nozzle and it lasted me several months. Would recommend!",

I tried body washes, showering as soon as I was done exercising, exfoliating, and other body acne sprays. This was the ONLY product that worked for me! It took a couple months for it to fully clear up, but that\u2019s expected. I\u2019m so excited because now I don\u2019t feel so self conscious when I wear shirts that expose my back.",

However I have purchased numerous out of other items from this company in the past I'm hoping that all of them together will show me more results.",
