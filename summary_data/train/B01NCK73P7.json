It has rollers; however, doesn't roll on carpet, which again I'm fine with since I expected that it wouldn't. Very easy to use and it does more sheets (12) for a much longer time (2 hrs) compared to my old one. I shred about once a month, so after this first shredding I used one Bonsaii lubricate sheet. I would highly recommend model 3s23 and the white color as it goes with my decor.",
