Setup was fast and the rain-fly kept out a popup shower that surprised us. Acadia National Park in summer is known for fog, so I was expecting a lot of moisture in the tent from condensation, but the airflow vents kept the interior dry. I'm happy I made this purchase, would buy again.",

PERIOD!... My 5 man is god for my cott, my gear and room to change. If I were camping with my wife or another in the tent I would have preferred the 6 man Mermac. Easy set up, even for one man. Foot print not included but I would suggest you use one. No need for sealers in stitches, Alps makes a great tent.",

I'm a 6' guy and this a 6' high ceiling so it's very comfortable for me. Putting up and taking down is pretty easy as well. It's also tough. I had my tent blow away and roll across a field a couple of times (because I didn't stake it down) with a cot inside and there was no damage to the tent at all.",

My friend also purchased this same tent, and his seams leaked water into his tent as well. All our clothes and gear were soaking wet. Thank God we had some water-proof spray and had a couple hours of sun in order to apply it and let it dry. I love this tent, and ALPS Mountaineering seems like a nice company, but this product was very disappointing.",

I sprayed the tent with a water proof repellent beforehand but after the first day it did collect some water on the bottom which caused a lot of condensation and wetness inside. We had a tarp down under the tent also. Over all was a nice tent to have on a sunnier camping trip. We have only used it twice so I have no idea how it will hold up in the future.",

It rained so hard that night that you could feel the pools of water under the floor, but we stayed dry. I also used it for a 5-day camping trip to the Grand Canyon over Spring Break. It works fine for car camping, but would be impossible for back country hiking. There is also no way 5 people could sleep in the tent, unless some are children. I fit 4 adults, with a very narrow, 10 inch, walkway in the middle.",

Of course, you want them firm enough not to come off, so it may be okay after a few uses.",
