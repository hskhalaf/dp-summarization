      "text": "Outstanding putting mat, especially for the price. As us golfers know, putting typically makes up roughly 40% of all shots, so every stroke gained counts. This mat is high quality, runs well, and has a sticky backing so it doesn't slide around on my tile floors. I love practicing my 5-9 foot putts as these can be VERY costly on the course. The only reason I rate this a 4/5 is because mine came a bit wrinkled on the top left side. Assuming yours is received without wrinkles it would be a perfect 5/5. Thank you for reading and rating my review!",

The foam insert is giving more of a bump than slope, which isn't so nice to practice appropriate speed. So while I like it as a feature of my office to give me some kinesthetic stress relief, I wouldn't use it as a reliable practice mat.",

Firm Golf Balls will tend to leave the putting hole with contact of a solid-surface. However, this issue may be resolved when used on certain-types of carpets. Unfortantely, the product tends to produce minor wrinkles when used on non-solid surfaces that may affect the accuracy and magnitude of your putt.",

I did well putting on my next round, maybe due to this product, maybe not. 3 starts because there really isn't much to it and the foam on the end is fairly cheap.

My only complaint is that the holes are so shallow, a good putt will right through and out the back. In my opinion, that punishes some good putts and starts making my stroke softer and more tentative, not good. So it's great for super fast greens, but not aggressive putting. Overall, it's a great product. I bought a second one for a friend.",
