I'm having to vacuum far less often and my Roomba (robot vacuum) is picking up significantly less of his hair. Plus, it smells great!

Out of all the shampoos i use on my pug, this one works great, leaves no residue, helps with shedding and smells wonderful",

Parts of her back are now so irritated that her fur is coming out in clumps and I can see her skin from so much fur loss. I almost can't believe the condition her skin is at right now after just a few days. She went from shiny and normal to balding and inflamed. Very regretful.",

I bought this de-shedding shampoo because of the reviews and I wanted something that actually tackles the dog shedding. Omg! I\u2019ve only used this 1 time and his shedding avalanche has returned!

Some days its a little harder to scrub the dogs for 10 minutes with the shampoo on the dog (especially when using in conjunction with the conditioner) but the results are totally worth it. Found it at a great price point and will be ordering again. My dogs look and smell AWESOME! Would recommend to my dog owning friends. Last night's bath really worked this shampoo and conditioner to it's fullest potential, getting rid of lots of loose fur for their spring shedding! Amazing stuff.",
