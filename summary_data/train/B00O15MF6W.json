      "text": "This broom is simple to assemble, the locking hub will prevent the handle from coming loose and it is a sturdy built broom. The outer bristles are softer than the inner bristles allowing you to sweep up light and small objects as well as more coarse or heavier objects - like wet sand versus dust. The only very minor change I would make is to lengthen the handle a few inches, it just seems a little bit short to me and I'm only 5'7\" tall. But really, it's a nice broom for sweeping the driveway, sidewalk or basement concrete.",
