To make a long story short, upon removal of the AIO, I could see that the cpu was wet and the motherboard socket was filled with fluid. I believe both are fried. Needless to say this a total nightmare. I am an experienced PC builder and have never had in 15 years a problem this bad.",

This cooler doesnt allow temps to go past 50. Idle is around 27 celcius on the aio vs. 45 on the stock cooler. Quality is very good. Mine arrived without any problems, and it looks pretty cool. You will be very happy with this cooler. Only thing I can criticize is the directions for the mounting. Its somewhat confusing since you have an Intel bag and an AMD bag but for the am4 platform you will use the contents within both.",

One thing you'll need to note is if you plug it into the CPU Fan Motherboard connector you'll need to set it to manual mode and 100% for the pump to work all the time and the LED pulse to work. Maybe best to just plug straight into the PSU.",

Corsair also has new PRO White LED fans which are substantially better and more quiet. I'd say use those.",
