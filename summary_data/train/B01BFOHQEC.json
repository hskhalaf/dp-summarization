Maybe it has to do with the brand of litter I use but this scoop was a bust for me. Also, it's terrible at picking up smaller clumps. I know the picture is unpleasant but this is what it looks like after every use, and it doesn't come off easily.",

I did spray with Pam before using and will probably spray once a week to help with the stickage since my litter does tend to stay wet in certain areas. (I find Scoop Away to be the best in odor and clumping). I also like how the slits are tighter than most so it does get a lot of smaller clumps in the litter. This is worth the $$.",

The metallic composition is stronger and sheds litter better than my previous plastic ones, and I expect it will clean and wear better too. But this scooper is noticeable heavy compared to plastic, and I expect some won't like the extra weight. I have three large cats and have previously used a longer handled, heavy duty plastic scooper, but I still notice the weight of the front which makes it more difficult to maneuver in a large litter box. If this scooper is ever redesigned, I hope there is consideration to adding an inch to the length of the handle which may help.",

The other one is too, but it's a lot smaller and, frankly, a piece of crap. After getting sick and tired of it clogging for the thousandth time, I decided to buy a new one. My search brought me here. And I have to say, it takes me less time to scoop with this nice new scoop, it doesn't get clogged, and I can get to the bottom of the box with ease. I've since ordered a second scoop to replace my other plastic scoop. This thing is awesome!",

The handle is too short. Difficult holding on to short handle while scooping. 3. The metal self adhesive bracket that holds the scoop does not adhere well to a wall, plastic or wood..had to buy command strips to help adhere bracket.

      "text": "I read the 5 star reviews before I purchased and I cannot agree more that this is by far the best litter scooper you will ever use in your life! Where was this fantastic product 20 years ago? No more fighting with cat doo doo stuck to the bottom of the box or all over the scooper. Helps keep the litter box much cleaner during scooping as you don't have clumps breaking up and getting all over everywhere. I'm actually thinking about ordering a couple more for gifts for my cat lover friends because I was so impressed with the scoop.",

      "text": "This is like having a really solid shovel to play in the sand . It makes the chore of scooping out the litter pan a little less disgusting and a little more like playing in an admittedly pretty gross sandbox. I have had cats in my life for nearly 45 years at this point and have always used the plastic scoops which constantly seem to be on the verge of breaking or just clogging up so much that I have to clean them with the hose. So while I am not thrilled with the daily chore of cleaning out the litter pan, this makes it easier and less disgusting. (I particularly recommend this if you have multiple cats.",

I never thought scooping litter could have a \u2018luxurious\u2019 experience, but after trying this out the first time I wanted to smack myself for using junk scoops for years. No joke: using this was so noticeably better I just bought 4 more for family who have cats for Christmas! I\u2019d highly recommend, this looks great and is built like a freaking tank. Makes it so much easier and faster to scoop out the corners that get gunked up and doesn\u2019t flex when getting out big clumps.",
