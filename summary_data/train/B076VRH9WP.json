Upon inspection I was surprised at how thin the brass strips are. Because the brass is so thin it provides very little tension on the plug contacts. I\u2019m sure taking it apart voids the warranty, but I consider the device to be defective and even unsafe due to potential arcing between the contacts. I am returning it for a refund.",

Alexa works well with it; can do numerous (groups) or individuals by voice control - and (important for me) the app allows one to schedule individual outlets. Using one for a nightlight - but Alexa can still turn it on or off and override the preset. More cost effective (and smaller footprint) than buying numerous plugs (which I also have done). Haven't used the USB's so I can't speak to them; though they look like they work...can also be controlled.",

      "text": "There's a lot of apps required with different smart devices but I like how this strip aligns with the Smart Home app. If you didn't know this app is recognized by Google Home. Each individual plug on the strip is controllable through voice control and in the mornings I can turn on my coffee maker without turning on the TV at the same time. The plugs are spaced wide enough to accommodate thick plugs to prevent under utilization caused by overcrowding of plugs. The dedicated USBs work well to charge my peripherals without taking up appliances that require the grounded plug connector.",

It not a deal breaker and I managed to hang mine up regardless but the slots would have come in handy.. 2)",

      "text": "I like to do woodworking as a hobby in my garage shop. With a limited number of electrical outlets, this power strip permits me to have multiple power tools \"Ready to go\" without plugging and unplugging them. I just announce which tool to activate (\"Chop saw on\"). When I leave, I can turn the power to all the equipment off (\"Shop off\"). This Smart Power Strip works very well for me.",

Love that I can connect up to 4 plugs and control individually or together through my TuyaSmart app. The USB port only has 1 controlled via Wifi, but it is clearly indicated and seems to be working when I tried it out. Currently using the plugs on a daily basis for my daughters room to control various desk lights. Will be purchasing more as it is too easy to use and is much less expensive than individual smart light bulbs.",
