Tip: I have placed the ladder between a post and zipper of the safety net so that one has something to grab onto when getting in and out of the trampoline.",

They just get muddy in our yard. Maybe it helps the bar not sink into the ground as fast? Definitely recommend and definite improvement over the little wooden step we were using that constantly got knocked over. Only thing better was trying to watch my littles wiggle their little butts up when there was nothing and they had to climb in. These should seriously come with the trampoline itself.

We used to drive to a hiking trail start about a mile away to take a 6-26 mile hike which stretches behind our yard, but then I found this diddy !!!! It fit beautifully over our railing, hooked on so we can \"jump our fence\" and then on the way back we simply lift it up and switch it over so we can enter our backyard just as easily as we left. GREAT FIND and fantastic way to improvise a trampoline ladder !",

The ladder isn't so large as to justify it coming in multiple pieces like it did. WORTH THE PURCHASE THOUGH!!",

Also, the bottom of the ladder has a foam cover on it, and I think it's going to get incredibly dirty sitting gone the muddy ground through rain and snow. Other than those two things, it fit great, and is easy for my kids to get on and off the trampoline now.",

Skywalker trampoline purchasers: I'm not sure I would not recommend for use with the Skywalker 14x8 trampoline; it's a little too short and hangs almost vertically. After jumping, if the ladder becomes more vertical, the hooks get loose and could possibly come off the trampoline. Bricks under the bottom rung and heavy-duty zip ties holding the hooks on (photo) seems to help.",

Not sure why the trampoline does not come with it's own ladder, so an aftermarket ladder is a must. Probably saved multiple injuries getting on and off the trampoline. On another note, please don't use your trampoline without a net...you are just asking for a serious injury.",
