The new style C3 reels have 4 bearings, 2 on the spool, one on the level wind and one anti-reverse. I spooled them up with 15 lb. Big Game and have caught 60+ stripers since they were delivered a couple of weeks ago. I have used the C3 and C4 reels in salt water for many years. Just spray them off with fresh water after each use. Disassemble and do the lubrication maintenance annually.",

I am very happy with this purchase and would reccomend it to anyone looking for a tough long lasting reel. I suggest this more for people that know how to use bait casting gear since it offers less in the way of adjustment for cast control than some other options, but if you know how to bait cast these reels are a great choice as always.",

      "text": "I love the Abu Garcia C3 reels. I know have 10 of them in three different sizes. They have great drags and will basically last forever if you maintain them properly. If I had one complaint is only the 6500 size comes with clickers. The last 3 5500's I bought cost another $20 each to add them. I mostly use them for trout sized fish now but have caught sturgeon over 60# with 6500's and the 5500's make great salmon trolling reels. One thing to remember is the C3's are Swedish and great quality. The S models are from China and are much lower in quality.",

This fishing reel's Carbon Matrix drag system offers smooth and consistent drag across the entire drag range, giving you the precision and power you need to subdue the most tenacious gamefish. It is also engineered for precise casting and line lay. The reel's six-pin centrifugal brake applies consistent pressure throughout the cast for superior control, while its synchronized level wind system ensures an even line lay and an effortless retrieve. And thanks to its extended bent cranking handle and power knob, this baitcasting reel offers the powerful, even reeling action and leverage that hard-fighting fish demand.",
