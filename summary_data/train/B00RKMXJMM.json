I read the reviews on about 15 different fy fishing vests and chose this one. I chose right! The straps adjust on the shoulders and around each side of the trunk. He put it on on Christmas, adjusted it and then played with all the awesome different pockets. He commented he mostly liked that it has a cup holder for his beer, and is breathable netting in between so he won\u2019t get too hot! Was definitely a win.",

I use there waders and boots but I had a hard time justifying paying $200 for a vest... so, I took a chance on this one... time will tell about durability but man... this vest has everything a fly fisherman would need. Pockets all in the right spot and dont interfere with casting. The flip pocket for flies is great. The holder for clamps and even the silly drink holder didnt spill a drop of diet I opened and left half full while i was wading through the eagle river in Colorado. I'm impressed and it saved me $140",

This all said, this vest has an incredible amount of storage. I carry a fly box so will probably just pull out the fly foam insert, but a cool feature. I like the water bottle holder but with a bigger bottle in there may get in the way, but I sinch it down when not using and its perfect. Great vest",

I thought that they had just received a bad one, so I went ahead and ordered it. Was delivered on time, but as soon as I took it out of the package I noticed that the zipper was only half zipped. I inspected it closely and found that it was not the quality I was expecting. It was the first thing I have ever sent back to Amazon. I have to say that they make returning an item very easy!",
