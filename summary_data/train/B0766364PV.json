      "verdict": "Superstar Rihanna returns with a pointy toe sneaker to add to her smash-hit Fenty Creepers. The Puma Fenty Pointy Creeper Patent is a magnet for attention with a glossy, reflective upper paired to an unorthodox platform sole.This unique, unisex creeper is adored for its comfort payback and high-fashion desirability, that\u2019s why many are tempted to clinch the deal even if it costs slightly expensive. Fenty lovers may need to note though that these snazzy pump tend to run small and quite heavier than its Creepers siblings.",

I love a good creeper, and own quite a few Fenty shoes..this bone color was a perfect change from the normal black. They definitely run a bit narrow so order a half size up if you have wide feet. They did take a bit of breaking in so not your normal comfy tennis shoe.",

I have abnormally short toes and narrow feet, though. I don't know how someone with normal feet could ever wear these shoes comfortably. Sizing up is recommended, though it would probably result in a roomy heel area",

Just trying them on it was clear not to go any further. I have an fairly narrow foot and these were tight in the width. The length is fine in my regular size. Too bad, because they are cool to look at, but I had to send them back for a hassle free refund.",
