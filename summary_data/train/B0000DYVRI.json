      "text": "I was initially put off by some of the posts, regarding trouble with cool, and/or cold starts. Sure enough, the unit I ordered started having start issues at +/- 65\u00b0 f. It is 37\u00b0 F outside right now, and this compressor has been outside so it's good and cold. I have been draining the oil out for two days. Today I added the full synthetic oil in the picture, and began trying to get it to start. After three resets of the thermal load switch, the unit started, and ran like a top. It's just as I suspected. After changing out the factory fluid with 100% synthetic, it starts much better. Hope this helps.",

Compressor on pressure set at about 97,98, shut off at 125. About the heaviest portable that you would want. Don't get this is you want a light portable. Very compact which has been nice.",

If your looking for a quieter compressor go with this one. I owned 2 oil free compressors and the biggest issue I had with them was that they were so loud. I work out of my garage and that noise scares the crap out of you. This compressor is quieter \"due to it being oil run\" but I really like the recovery time. On empty the tank refills in about 1to 2 min. The recovery time is something like 18 sec. Great compressor highly recommend",

The features that attracted me to this model are that it is compact, the CFM is high for the size, the PSI is high enough to handle the tools I use and, most importantly, it's oiled for a longer compressor life. It's a little heavier than what I am replacing but that's a reasonable trade-off for an oiled machine. The only CON would be that it doesn't have wheels. BTW - NEVER BUY and oil-less compressor except if your use is VERY infrequent.",

While working on a garden shed with the unit plugged into a longer extension cord, the unit would struggle to start and frequently pop the built-in load switch.
