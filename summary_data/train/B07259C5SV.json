It also works when I want to work standing up or seated on my couch with a friend. I included a photo showing a blue 12 inch ruler on the laptop holder. I adjusted one arm out as far as it would go. I use the stand with laptops that measure 12 inches across and the arms are adjusted all the way in like the arm in the left in the photo.",

      "text": "I use this stand for watching videos and reading my e-textbooks while comfortably lying in bed. I have my mouse on the bed with me and it works pretty well against the sheets. The mouse pad is too high and not adjustable to be useful. It holds my 17\u201d MacBook Pro. I couldn\u2019t give it five stars because of the mouse pad issue and the laptop size limit listed in the specifications. My laptop hovers over my bed while I\u2019m using the stand which makes me less paranoid, however, I never feel comfortable swinging the arm out away from my bed since the specs say it wasn\u2019t designed to hold a computer as big as mine. Have no regrets purchasing.",

It took 2 of us longer than it should have to assemble: one to use the magnifying glass to read, and one to do it! Vendors need to consider your customers. Make the instructions easy for the elderly, if not all who need them.",

      "text": "Using this from a typical recliner is NOT realistic - The arm does NOT swing at the connection to the pole, so the only horizontal movement is from the outer arm which extremely limits positioning - The arm comes out above the center of the two legs. Since the inner arm does NOT have any circular motion from the pole, positioning the two legs around the floor rails that are the feet of most recliners while placing the device holding tray anywhere close to a usable position is not realistic. It is awkward to use even with a couch. If it had wheels, maybe.",

Easy to move out of the way when I want to get up from the chair. I don't use it to stand while working. I don't know if it would hold laptop high enough. Quick and easy clips hold the laptop securely. Well made product. A friend who is mechanically inclined put it together in less than 15 minutes.",

Now, I just pick it up and move it back out of the way when I want to get out of my chair. More difficult, but it is surprising how we can be spoiled by how something works and find it difficult to do it another way.",
