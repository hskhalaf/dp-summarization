The flamingo was nice and big, made out of heavy duty pvc, not cheap and flimsy. It also comes with a nice repair kit just in case. It was a lot of fun big enough for adults and the kids. Overall it was hilarious and fun riding a flamingo down the hill.",

And we were able to fit 2 adults on at a time. We didn't do it often, but we did do it and had no problems. I'd gladly order more products from this company. I can't wait to try out summer floats",

If we were going to be out more than a few hours I would recommend some way to add air to it.
