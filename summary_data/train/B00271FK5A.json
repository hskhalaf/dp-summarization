      "text": "My cats love this treat. If I ask my older cat if she wants \"fishies,\" she knows exactly what I mean. She begins meowing and goes to the pantry. I like this treat mainly because it is protein, and not full of carbs. My older cat is on a weight loss program, and bonito flakes do not contain very many calories. I can still give our other cat (who is very slim) a crunchy carb snack and not feel as though I am depriving our older cat.",
