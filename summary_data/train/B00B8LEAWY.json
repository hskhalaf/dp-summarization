These are made with VERY brittle plastic and two rungs snapped in half the first time a player stepped on them. We have the name brand agility ladder and it hasn't had any problems for 6 years! Additionally, there isn't any loops in the nylon webbing to secure the ladders with stakes. So you'll have to get creative if you want these to stay in place. I would not recommend anyone buy this product.",

So if you were to snag one with your foot, the individual rung will slide out of place just as much as the whole ladder moves. Also means that every time you lay them out you have spend several minutes getting each box equal and squared out. They dont seem like they're 100% awful and maybe the rungs will get firmer on yhe straps with use. But for right now, I'll use these as backups only and use the old ones as primaries.",

      "title": "Great quality for the price",
      "text": "My daughter often needs a ladder for her soccer training programs and this got me looking for a reasonably priced one. We bought the 12-rung. She has already used it several times and she is very happy with it. Given the price, I was a bit concerned about sturdiness, but I am happy to report that it is excellent. The ladder is easy to set up and remains stable even with my daughter's most high-intensity exercises -- as stable as any high-quality ladder I have ever seen. Overall I am very happy with my purchase.",

I would like to have seem some tiny tent spikes to peg it down with. Some of my kids have big feet and will get tripped up and tangle the ladder. However over all this ladder was perfect for every player on my team. It increased our agility over 3-4 sessions.",
