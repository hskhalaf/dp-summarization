Even when it was brand new it didnt generate a lot of heat, and the table top isnt at a height or wide enough to sit and have a meal on. The best it could do is hold a drink, but the ceramic is uneven so it doesnt even do a great job at that.",

I can't return it because I missed that window by a few weeks. I'm reaching out to Blue Rhino hoping maybe they'll send a replacement regulator, but it will probably be the same one and I'll have the same problem. What a huge waste of money. I'm so disappointed. What's worse is I feel like I gave a crappy Christmas present.",

Save yourself a lot of waisted time and buy a fire pit with a stainless steel burner and fire bowl which will last longer. The Fire Sense unit is made from cast aluminum and has a stainless burner and fire bowl..... And no toxic smell. This fire pit is made from cheap stamped steel that will rust quickly.",

Love the pit but not acceptable the way it is. Just spoke to blue rhino rep on their 800 number. She told me it is supposed to soot and smell because it is made to simulate a campfire. Because of that response I would totally NOT recommend this pit. The fumes make you nauseous and the rocks/lava/glass are solid black. The company response is totally unacceptable and avoidance of the issue, which by the reviews is a big problem for every buyer.",

All screw holes lined up well when loosely assembled and then I tightened screws as suggested in instructions. Delivery was on-time and the heavy box was set on my patio for convenient assembly.",

It took my 8 year old son a little over than two hours to assemble - with my supervision and help for the heavy parts :). It looks really good, lots of happy faces sitting around this last night. My concerns when buying this were: if the flame would be high enough, if there was a bad smell, if it put out any heat. The flame is plenty high, the smell wears off after being on for a bit, and there is heat that is put out, not a ton but it's more than I expected. Totally recommend this as a center piece to your backyard / outdoor space",

Well, the \"rocks\" must be some strange plastic chemical fake rock, because they literally melted to the grate.

Should be a few warnings about assembling the doors to the top about getting the proper flush fitting before you get all the sections screwed together. You have to remember you are putting it together upside down\ud83d\ude06. All in all well worth the savings over fully assembled units offered in patio shops and retail outlets.

It was pretty easy and took about an hour or so. Assemble it in the shade if it's a hot day...the metal parts get really hot. We love the look. Not only do they include a cover for the firepit, but a cover for the propane tank so you can't see the white tank sitting underneath. I would definitely recommend this and have to my friends.",

Be careful when attaching the Bowl Assembly to the Hearth - it has to face a certain way but the directions don't mention that fact (before completing step 2 look at step 3 so the Bowl Assembly is facing the right direction. Also, the top and bottom screw holes are the same on the sides so be careful to attach them correctly. I am very happy with this purchase and can't wait for the cold nights to use it.",
