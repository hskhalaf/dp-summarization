      "text": "These little faux suede boots weren't made for walking but they are cute and have a soft sherpa-like lining. Think: slippers with a sole. They are definitely not waterproof but if you're going for a stroll with baby carried in a wrap or stroller, they will keep baby's feet warmer than socks alone. The Velcro closure makes it easy to get baby's feet in and the boots can be worn folded over which makes them a little more snug around the ankles. Baby may still kick them off but that's what babies do! The 6-12 month size measures approximately 5\" from toe to heel (see photo). Not bad for $10. Hope this was helpful!",

She tends to take off shoes on her feet to eat ( blame the teething), but she cannot take off this boots ( yet). Glad I got her the tan color, instead of pink, because the tan color goes with a lot of her clothes and not get dirty easily.",

If it fits a newborn well, it probably shouldn't fit a 6 month old, but I figured the material might be something flexible that would be snug on a newborn, then expand to comfortably fit a 6 month old. That wasn't the case. These should come in 0-3 months and then a next size. I gave them 5 stars for cuteness, but took off for the wide range, catch all sizing",

They are far too large for our baby, but they still work great in keeping his little feet warm. The reason for the 3 stars is because the item description needs to be greatly improved.",

They can be rolled down to fit on the ankle, and there\u2019s a velcro strap on the side to make them easier to put on a wiggly baby. Will probably purchase in another color because I liked them so much! This makes a great fall/winter shoe for your little one!",

It does have some grippers, so they are ok for indoors.",
