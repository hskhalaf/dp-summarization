The photos printed very dark for some reason and I had to do major adjustments to get them to print well. It did take a while for the printer to print, the ink ran out quickly, if you refill your cartridges you get all kinds of annoying messages and it says they are empty so you have no idea how much ink is in each cartridge. This is my first experience with hp printers and it hasn't been good. I'm weary about trying them again.",

Again, that may be a problem related to my computer or user error rather than the fault of the printer/software.

I was able to disable that portion of the start-up with the info I found - but it couldn't be done from the HP Preferences or Device Settings menus. It has to be done from the PC Startup menu. My PC now boots up normally. Despite this frustrating configuration problem, I am happy with the printer.",

I could click \"done\" after every few scans but then I would need to re-open the software each time and start scanning. Why is this so dysfunctional?",
