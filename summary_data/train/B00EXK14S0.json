So far the connections have been stable, and the user interface has been fairly high-quality and easy to configure (subtracted 1-star here due to some UI drop-outs during initial configuration). External interface security tests have been solid, as expected. This router has a Wi-Fi guest interface that has also been working well (and fast) during our tests. I would recommend this router for home users and Soho users.",

This router is somewhat wider than your average routers, so space may be something to look at. I have noticed that this router does affect the wirelss baby monitors we have in our house, so that might be a deal breaker for some.

But other then that all of the common areas get good signal and we have 4-7 devices connected at any given time. I like having the 2 network options. If one messes up I switch too the other. I have all my kids on one. So much better then our last router that had to be reset all of the time.",

There are a number of issues that make it malfunction and the (usually temporary) solutions are provided by other consumers. What has worked one time has failed the next. It\u2019s frustratingly close to being a good system because the small amounts of time it works are very helpful. I would not buy it again.",

    "description": "Perfect for HD video streaming, this dual band router delivers speeds of up to N600 + AC1300 Mbps. Four Gigabit Ethernet ports make it easy to share data quickly across your network and to external devices. You can use the high performance USB 3.0 port to attach a storage device and quickly transfer large files or share devices across your Wi Fi network. Plus, the USB 2.0 port is perfect for smaller file transfers or a dedicated printer. Beamforming focuses the Wi Fi signal directly to your smartphones, tablets and laptops instead of sending out a general transmission for a more efficient network with a wider range. Smart Wi Fi lets you access your network anytime, anywhere. Using your browser or the Smart Wi Fi mobile app, you can prioritize devices or websites, control content, monitor network activity and more. Advanced WPA2 encryption and SPI firewall help keep your network and personal information safe and secure.",
