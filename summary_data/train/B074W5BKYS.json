The camera connects to an app which allows you to actually SEE what you're trying to photograph. Unfortunately, myself and thousands other (source play store) cannot get the Ricoh to connect as there's a firmware issue with the app. Thus if you're smart you will not buy this camera until it's updated however from what I'm reading this has been an ONGOING problem even on iphone.",

When you want to move up to a dedicated camera, this is probably your best first stop. Well supported by most apps for creating AND displaying the resulting product - including built-in support for Google View. DO make sure to upgrade your firmware before your first shoot. Once you've done that and recharged the internal battery, it should be smooth sailing in any situation with decent lighting. Not the best in low light, but few 360 cameras less than $1k are.",

Overall it does its job, but at this point consider other newer models from Ricoh and Insta360. The software is kind of clunky and it is confusing to use the camera. On top of that you don't get the video stabilization and enhancement features you get with newer cameras. If you need it for Matterport, consider joining their beta program to use newer cameras or waiting a bit more for the full support of the Ricoh SC2 and Insta360 OneR.",

I'll charge this up a day or two before use and then I'll go to turn it on and nothing. Have to charge again.

    "description": "Style:Ricoh Theta V 360 Spherical Camera\n\nThe Theta V is lightweight 360 Degree spherical camera, it\u2019s easy to use and compact enough to carry everywhere. Enhancements including a new image sensor and Processor for improved image quality Allow the camera to produce more realistic \u201cas-if-you-were-there\u201d 360-degree content. The camera\u2019s new high-speed data transfer is 2. 5 times faster than previous Theta models, allowing users to quickly and wirelessly upload 14 Megapixel stills and high-resolution 4K videos for immediate showing and sharing. Omni-directional audio recording functionality enables 360-degree audio that is a strong complement to the high resolution video, dramatically enhancing the realism of a scene. The Theta V can connect to and be controlled by any Android or iOS-based smartphone or tablet using the Theta S app. Connection is either via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-which enables an \u201calways-on\u201d connection between a camera and phone-or Wi-Fi, providing users with greater flexibility in how they wirelessly control the camera. A new and unique feature of the Theta V is that Ricoh will be able to create new functions for the camera via software plug-ins. The first of these plug-ins was developed by Ricoh and is already integrated into the phone. It enables the Theta V to deliver the world\u2019s first remote playback capability in a commercially-marketed, fully spherical camera. The camera has a 4-channel microphone that supports 360 Degree spatial audio recording built into its body. Omnidirectional audio is recorded not just in the horizontal direction but also in the vertical direction, making it possible to reproduce sound and video as it was in the environment where the video was shot by linking 360 Degree video and audio together. Furthermore, using the dedicated accessory 3D microphone TA-1 (optional) scheduled for launch With the camera will allow users to pick up natural sound with a large volume of information at low to high frequency. Wireless communication protocol (WLAN)- HTTP (Open Spherical Camera API compatible).
