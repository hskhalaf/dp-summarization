They are thin enough to be able to hand reload the magazines, and would be great for lite utility tasks as well. I would not recommend them for heavy duty type tasks as thats not what they are geared towards.",

They're stitched clear through the outer seams, as well- so you'll feel them while wearing the gloves. Cutting/tearing them off won't address the stitching- and will likely shorten the life of the gloves if the stitching is removed (you'd just open holes in the middle of the seam). They're otherwise great gloves, except for those pointless tags.",

These were a bit large on me so definitely use the sizing chart. They do not keep the cold out. These are more for light protection. I don't notice an improvement in grip either.
