The one thing that would have earned a perfect score and 5-star rating: The inner case\u2019s mesh net doesn\u2019t secure accessories adequately. It would have helped greatly if the extended to the top edge of the shell (rather than only half-way) and/or could be secured with a zipper. Because of the current design, you must be absolutely sure which side of the case holds the Switch, and, open the appropriately to ensure that any accessories do not fall out of the case, which happens far too easily.",

While this means no wiggle room and a more secure fit, it personally did not suit what I was looking for. It's possible that I received a lemon, which I ultimately returned.",

The case protected it (not a scratch!) but the case was ruined (the zipper was bent, so no longer worked). I guess in all, it would be cheaper than dropping my Switch down some stairs, but the wrist strap really needs to be better built",

There was an issue with the mesh pouch, it didn't hold extra controllers, etc properly.

However if you have younger kids carrying the switch in here it's not sturdy enough to help be drop resistant. Be careful. It's a good enough case for an adult to handle or travel with.",
