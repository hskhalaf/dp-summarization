It pumps out a ton of glue and it does it hot enough that it allows you tons of time to get things where you want it before it sets. The included stand is a nice addition that keeps the gun elevated off your work surface and provides a stable base. The gun does not drop and or string really at all. There are cheaper hot glue guns out there, but this is the last one you will ever need to purchase. Great product and solid construction.",

Suggestion to manufacturer: extend the black silicone/rubber sleeve and use a more gradual inside taper OR increase the travel distance of the feed arm. Definitely a recommended buy as the above issues are not much of a nuisance and likely can be easily overcome with different glue sticks, more use, etc.",
