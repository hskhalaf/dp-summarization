Second, the shroud is not round, it's roundish, so it complicates somewhat the installation. That being said, once I installed it with the isolation, it runs very quietly and does an excellent job of keeping the attic cool. I recommended it to a friend.",

I left it on the manufacturers recommendation of 90 degrees for the thermostat but may tweak up a bit if it seems to be running too much. Installation took about 30 minutes with my son helping as the gopher and light man. Seems quite powerful as I could feel the draw when he flipped the switch. I could also feel and smell the stale attic air from outside. Quite impressed so far. Should help the air conditioning. Now for another layer of insulation!",

I recommend providing a plywood flange with a round hole cut to the diameter of the fan. This is a cheap fan and it gets the job done OK, but is VERY loud. I can a low hum pretty much anywhere in my house. I even mounted mine on rubber grommets. I could probably go back and provide some better vibration isolation. I'm guessing some of the vibration is just an balancing issue due to mediocre build quality. I'm only anticipating this lasting 2-3 years (my experience with similar fans), so I figured not worth the hassle of re-mounting.",

I am satisfied with the purchase, I would like to see a better design for the housing and supplied bolts. Fan is still running with little noise, can hear it when outside next to the house but no vibrations or loud noises as others reported. Make sure you secure the fan to studs and ply or paneling as suggested in the destructions. Good luck.",

Hey it's a fan, they do make noise. Had our first heat wave and it really did make a difference!
