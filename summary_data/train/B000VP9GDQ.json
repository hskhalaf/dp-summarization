And, I like having several varieties of shampoo bars available to me so that I can choose different ones based upon what my hair needs or based upon the smell I want that morning. I didn't want a full bathtub tray that went across my tub, as that would just get in my way when I bathes. Instead, these (with the tray) keep everything nicely clean and contained on the shelf / side of my bathtub.",

Glass is heavier). It will blend with your vanity and keep it dry. A regular bar soap will fit on it, so you don't have to be extra careful not to make a mess. I like liquid soap for the hands, but it is nice to have a bar of soap for washing your face quickly and not having all the cleanup afterwards. Pamper yourself and get this little jewel.",

It's durable as I dropped it while scrubbing the shower and there is no sign of trauma. Phew. Also, it has not built up any soap scum or mildew.
