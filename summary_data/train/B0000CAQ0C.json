However, if you press the buttons to quickly they will almost always miss the first button press. Very disappointed, I have an older one (1980s) and this does not happen with it. I would recommend getting the HP 12c as it will work every single time. No I would not recommend this product. Orginal review --> Fantastic calculator! A good upgrade from the HP12c. TVM calculations are faster on the hp12c, but the solver feature is awesome!",

They (old school 17Bs and 12Cs) were great. The new one is either slow to recognize pushed keys or frequently completely misses key entry. When you pay a premium price, you expect a premium product. This one falls woefully short. HP has obviously gone cheap in their manufacturing practices. I thought it might just be me, but checked with my brother (bought him a 17BII as a gift), and he and a work colleague who has the same HP calculator have the same problem. Very disappointing.",

I have to go much slower and make sure each number is entered. Also, the buttons feel different when pressed. I've had this model since 10/14 and it hasn't improved with use.

Some users lament the build quality of the 17B, and believe that it is not up to the standards of the older 12C.

There were always good financial calculators from the 1990s, example HP-19b II+ which was the Supreme Financial Calculator that my Sister has. That HP-19b II+ was impressive and daunting to learn. Now with this new (okay, HP product was introduced back in A.D.2003) HP-17b II+ is actually better manufactured--- pray it lasts as long as the HP-19b II+. Not a finance major, but is easy to learn.
