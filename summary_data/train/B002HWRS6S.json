This is a quality product and is offered at a reasonable price. US Wire has a good reputation. I would highly recommend this product. I hope you find this review helpful.

The fact that it is Made in the USA is great. If you need to run high-current tools on an extension cord, this is your answer. My previous cord (admittedly, it was 14 gauge) would get warm due to the higher resistance combined with high load, whenever I used tools like a circular saw, or especially if I ever plugged in a space heater. This cord never gets warm; the 15A breaker will trip before the cord becomes the bottleneck in the electrical path.",

Outdoor outlets are U-shaped (basically flat top/bottom sides like indoor outlets. but have a tiny lip around the outside). Will a circular plug work? I don't want to buy one if it is going to fall out of the outlet. THANKS!!",

On high setting the electric motor was not getting adequate voltage/amperage and the cord got extremely hot to the touch. I returned it and ordered this one from Amazon. Long story short, the Toro is running as designed and the cord doesn't get hot at all. Using an extension cord that won't carry the amperage/voltage needed will damage your electric tools.",

      "text": "I don't recall ever owning an extension cord longer than 50' so this 100' provided a huge amount of anticipation when I first unwound it. 100' is fairly heavy so take note of that when purchasing. the 12/3 gauge was too thick to be pinched and curled on the no-snag hooks of my yard tools (leaf blower, hedge trimmer) so there were times the cord would get unplugged simply because of it's weight and drag on the ground. I found myself wrapping the cord slack around my wrist to prevent the cord from being yanked while in use. I'd recommend this extension cord to friends, but I'd make sure to tell them of the thickness dilemma.",
