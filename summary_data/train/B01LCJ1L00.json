Wow was I pleased with the guitar when I opened the box. It seems well made with nice binding and very decent tuning gears, etc. For the price, you get big value. Sure, I'll need to do a setup but that's pretty typical for even mid-range guitars these days. I'm very happy with my purchase and would do it again.",

This guitar is just as good as the expensive one I was borrowing and I do believe it is easier to get my hands around the fretboard.

I tip my hat to UPS for doing an excellent job. Anyone looking for an excellent beginner or intermediate guitar this is the one. One thing I did do was change the tuning machines and put better strings.",
