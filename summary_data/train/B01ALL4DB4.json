This recipe would be perfect for mini dachshunds or any of the similar small dogs. The coin in my pic is for size reference - 3 pieces from this recipe, 1 from another product.",

At first she was throwing up and then diarrhea followed- it lasted a week. We had no idea it was the food that was making her sick until the second time she got violently ill again. She had fully recovered from the first time by taking antibiotics and prescription food. When she returned to eating this food again, the diarrhea and vomitting immediately returned. I\u2019m really surprised there isnt a recall on this food. There is something seriously wrong!",

But my regular sized chihuahua doesn't need anything done for his bites. I dice up a tablespoon of chicken and sprinkle on top. I am happy with Merrick small bites classic dog food, they give all the nutrients the dogs need and I have been feeding it to my dogs for a year, and I have beautiful, healthy, happy chihuahuas.

We're a big fan of Merrick in general, and will most likely continue to buy this when we run low. I don't like how the 4lb size doesn't have the same closure as the bigger bags. I can only clip it with a bag clip so kibble tends to go stale quicker. Merrick - you should update the packaging!!",
