      "text": "Have been buying this cat scratching post for years, my 3 cats go thru scratching posts every 3 or 4 months, but it is better than the furniture. This latest scratching post carpeting was very poor quality and immediately the loops came out. The carpet they are using now has too big of a loop to use on a scratching post. I have to clean up the carpet every time one of the cats uses the post, it gets caught in their claws and I find it all over the house. They should go back to the carpet they were using in the past, a tight weave, which made them last and were a better quality scratching post.",

Keep wrapping sisal rope to cover the bare spots on his old carpeted post, which is a couple inches taller, as well as an inch or two wider in diameter, with a solid post (instead of a cardboard core). - Weird (and tacky) plastic cap (instead of carpet). - Cannot specify color",

It definitely help with keeping him from scratching our couches, every time I catch him doing so, I tell him no and I point to the post and he just walks away from the couch and goes and scratches the post. Pretty magical, haha! We've had it for several months and it seams to be holding up pretty good, but whenever he finally destroys it we will be buying another one because it's really working great for us. I absolutely recommend it!",

      "text": "It took this pole about 3 weeks to arrive. The quality of the pole is sturdy and it doesn't fall on my 9 lbs cat. Well build and the whole thing is covered by carpet material which my cat really likes. I appreciate the packaging effort. There was no damage to it but it's a huge package like a small fridge. My kitty has been loving it since it arrives. Very nice product.",

I have 3 cats who use it all the time and it's holding up nicely. Very sturdy with a big base and a big circumference post. I highly recommend this post if you have cats that only like carpeted posts to scratch, and you want a tall one so they can really stretch to scratch.",
