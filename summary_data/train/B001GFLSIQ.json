For everyone complaining about being too dark, I'm not sure what you're looking for, these are goggles, not corrective lenses. The black line on the bottom of the pool isn't that hard to see. Also, if I had wanted my competition to see my eyes, I would have gotten clear goggles. FYI, no competitive swimmer wears clear goggles.",

What's really sad is that if they changed the injection mold to include more plastic material in this area (I'm talking about 0.5 to 1.0 mm), then these goggles would be awesome. Why do they make the nose connection point, and the side connection point, so small and thin? They do it on purpose so that it breaks intentionally, forcing you to buy another pair of goggles. Adding just a bit more material would fix the problem and add zero cost. I won't be buying these again. Any recommendations on a HIGHER QUALITY goggle that will last an entire swim season?",

For outdoor swimming, this is probably no big deal. For UVB light therapy, not good. I\u2019m thinking of painting the edges black just to block all light except through the lenses.",

The bands have not lost elasticity at all. Given that they look through to have two separate straps behind your head, you have a lot of adjustment to customize their fit. Con: the mirrored lens can be dark in the morning ocean, or any murky water for that matter. Coming out of the water to a sunny glare isn't so hot either. Depending on the time of day and where the sun is when you're spotting, the mirrored lens may not be ideal.",

Sometimes the opaqueness of the lens is a bit too much; makes it hard to see in any even remotely low-light situations (swimming at dusk for example). Overall, these goggles seem like a good product.

As soon as the shade hits my outdoor pool, they are too dark, and it can be hard to see the wall of the pool. These are comfortable goggles and good for general use, but I don't think they would suffice for serious lap swimming. I like the Aqua Socket or Speed Socket for swimming laps.",
