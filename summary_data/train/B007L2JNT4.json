I have always used mirror extensions when towing with my other vehicles and find it makes a big difference when attempting lane changes while towing a boat or camper.",

The passenger mirror is worthless. the magnification on it is off (too much?) and with the little bit of vibration you get, renders the image useless.

They are secure and do not move even when driving 75 mph on the hiway. They look natural because the color blends so good with the color of the mirrors. Had a few friends ask me about them and they said that they would be buying them as well. The outside mirror can be moved up, down, in and out and will stay in place as you need it. If it does move, you can use a small screwdriver to tighten the screw. Highly recommend.",

We have so far not encountered that problem. Very happy with purchase.",

The aft sides do because of the tabs (obviously), but appearance is good. The texture and finish match the factory mirrors perfectly. A casual observer looking from the front would probably think they are factory mirrors. None of the functional lights & reflectors are covered up. I haven't road tested them yet but I don't anticipate vibration because of the tight, glove-like fit. Great price, too.",
