However, I'm now concerned about the bacteria on the mat so I decided to grab a pair. These far exceeded my expectations for support/lightness. I'm able to switch my feet, tap and throw round kicks as easily as if I were barefoot. I highly recommend these for anyone who is serious about MMA at a high level and wants foot protection. They are true to fit in relation to Adidas, so whatever size you are in their wrestling shoes will be exactly the same for Otomix. I hope this is helpful!",

I bought these specifically for weightlifting. The grip is good, they are light weight, and I feel like they get the job done. They look exactly as advertised. I recommend and would buy again.
