This is easy to use and the online video instructions on the Ergobaby website make it a breeze. My son protests a little initially and then settles down comfortably. This is not bulky and great for wearing baby. We will probably transition back to the Ergobaby 360 once he gets older. Very happy with this purchase.",

This carrier was terrible! It offers ZERO support and you cannot use it without having one hand supporting your child\u2019s neck at all times. What is the point of a carrier if you have to hold your baby? It seems like they were designing this and halfway through gave up and released it to the public. So disappointed :(",

I don\u2019t feel like she could fall out and it frees both hands and gives her head enough support. It doesn\u2019t bother my back either.",

So far, he is tolerating it but he doesn\u2019t feel as comfortable with it as with the SollyBaby wrap. I think he is secure in it though and sometimes falls asleep in it.",
