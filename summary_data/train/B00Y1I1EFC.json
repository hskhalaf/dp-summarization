      "text": "This could possibly be the very first nano hexacopter to hit the market! And on top of that, it flies great! It also has nice LEDs for night flying. It banks well, does funnels and is very fast! I would say, the only downside to this multirotor is its tiny transmitter. Prop guard is removable. I did find one controller that works better with it ;) Edit : Spoke with someone from top race and he informed me that the next batch of this nano hex will be paired with a better, larger controller controller!

This drone has held up much longer than many others. The rotor guards easily bend back into place whenever it takes a whack. It moves pretty quickly in fast mode, giving the dogs a good chase, and is very easy to keep under control. My only complaint is that when in headless mode, the controller beeps constantly. The beeping is shrill and ear piercing, and there is no way to make it stop. I don\u2019t use headless mode because of this. Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars.",
