This makes it hard to toss some items... Things like paper plates are especially difficult because the opening is too narrow... Same with emptying the vacuum canister. So I want to love it and I'm happy to have a larger can but the circle design has some flaws.",

I got it to keep the dog out but it exceeded my expectations not only for the height but how it fits y\u2019all kitchen trash bags perfect and uses the whole bag. Before I would pull the trash bag out of my dollar general store trash can with plenty of room for more trash and always felt like I wasn\u2019t getting my money out of the trash bags. Not now!!!

If you have any trash inside of it the only way to Move It Is by grabbing the top with one hand and grabbing the bottom with the other. Not something that you would want to do with your trash can. I regret buying it and now thinking of just screwing a handle to one of the sides.",

However, from a practical perspective there is an opening/gap on both sides of the lid. It isn\u2019t a secure fit which allows the smell of the garbage to seep through. Unfortunately that means the trash bags has to be changed at least every other day whether the bag is full or not. I have enclosed a photo of the gap. Had I known this before hand I would not have purchased it but because of the price I will simply keep and use it as a non-food garbage can in the laundry room.",
