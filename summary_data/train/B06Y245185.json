Another reviewer said turpentine, and that sounds like what I'm smelling... It reminded me of burnt rubber mixed with chemicals or formaldehyde or something, just disgusting to breathe. I'm sad this company went this route instead of increasing their price if they couldn't afford to offer 100% pure tea tree oil anymore for such a low cost. It's just wrong and unethical.",

I was a bit worried that green coloring had been added (pure tea tree oil is clear to yellowish in color), but it seems just the bottle itself is colored.This stuff seems to be the real deal---same color, aroma and consistency---and very reasonably priced. Note also that tea tree oil dissolves plastic gradually, so the underside of the cap was partially digested, though none had leaked into the package. Perhaps explains why so many customers have received leaky bottles.",

      "text": "I don't understand the negative reviews and claims of fake. I have a toenail fungus that I have tried all anti-fungals on for a year and hasn't made a dent. I researched and found tea tree oil can help, after 3 months of using this oil on my toenail, massive improvement, so if it was fake or watered down it would likely not have helped. So I am happy with this product. It's a BIG bottle so you will have more oil than you will know what to do with, and a great low price.",
