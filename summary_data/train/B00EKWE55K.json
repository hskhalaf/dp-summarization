After getting everything downloaded I clicked on the BR-Receipts and it immediately popped up an error telling me to uninstall software and reinstall. I uninstalled it and watched as EVERYTHING on my computer was wiped out! Years of pictures of my 6 kids growing up, all of our travels, and every file pertaining to our home business ERASED!!! The software had attached itself to every document, picture, and file so when uninstalled it deleted everything. Currently on hour 2 of trying to restore my computer from right before installing this software. What a nightmare!",

On Windows, I use \"Not Another PDF Scanner 2\" (NAPS2) instead of the programs provided by the Brother CD. NAPS2's is a lot more user-friendly for creating multi-page PDF/TIFF. On Linux, I use gscan2pdf. Gets the job done. One down side of the scanner for Linux is that the Linux SANE driver doesn't auto-crop like their Windows TWAIN driver, this makes batch jobs a little time consuming. I have yet to find a Linux set up that is streamline enough for creating multi-page PDF/TIFF.",

It is extremely user-friendly, quiet and scans true to photo or document. Easily portable, lightweight, easy to install. We created workflows within the app that made scanning quick and easy. The only drawback is that after several hours of scanning, I advise shutting down and letting it cool off as it starts to glitch. We will not be without this scanner. It has made our geneological hobby so much easier!!!",

Don't know what the problem was, but I can tell you this little machine made our job so much easier and in half the time. Out of the box, plugged into the computer at the attorney's office and scanned over 250 pages in less than 90 minutes (that's with having to remove staples and taking papers out of binders and putting them back in during the process). Was praying for a no hassle machine, and can't say enough about this mobile scanner. Easy to take wherever you travel. Lightweight, worry-free. Definitely recommend this product!",

At first I was having trouble because the papers I was trying to scan would show up black with weird white marks, and I was confused because the configuration page was turning out perfect. After working with it a little, I realized that because the documents were old and the paper wasn\u2019t completely white, The scanner couldn\u2019t pick it up under the black and white setting. After switching to color it worked perfectly! I love that it came with a protective cover for the documents, and a nice sleeve for the scanner itself. Overall I am very satisfied with this scanner.",

It was easy to find on the Brother site and easy to install. By default, the scanner software wants to scan the document as a JPEG. Even on the highest (600dpi) resolution, the quality of a document scanned to JPEG was poor. However, a 600dpi PDF had excellent contrast and readability. I really like how compact, quiet, and easy-to-use this scanner is. I also like that it is USB powered. For the price, I think this was a perfect purchase for my needs..",

Then, configure the printer option to save as microsoft PDF. Voila! No need to convert JPEG to PDF now.
