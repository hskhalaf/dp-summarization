It comes with TWO goals inside ONE carrying case with a zipper. They are lightweight and VERY EASY TO CLOSE BACK UP! That is key for me - I'm always in a rush. It's also easy for my players to close them up too - delegation, people! So awesome that this set comes with disc cones too. You can never have enough cones. I leave this in my trunk and I'm good to go. I highly recommend this pop-up soccer goal. 5 STARS!!!",

It\u2019s sewn onto the goal at the ends, so barring getting a sewing machine out, the best I can do is try a bungee cord. Also, one of the bands holding a stake also broke.

The included anchor system ensures the nets stay in place and the material the nets are made of should stand up to the stress the nets will be under from the balls hitting them. All in all I am very pleased I chose this product and MOst Highly Recommend It.",

    "title": "GoSports Portable Pop-Up Soccer Goal (Set of 2), Red/White, 4'",
    "description": "The GoSports Pop Up Soccer Goals are designed to provide the ultimate pair of portable goals for training, scrimmages or games. The set includes 2 Goals (choose from 2.5ft / 4ft / 6ft widths) that fold flat and weigh under 3 pounds total. The goals do not require any assembly, but rather 'pop' open for immediate use. To close them, you simply twist and fold them into a flat shape and store them in the included carrying case so they can be taken anywhere. The goals are made from premium nylon fabric and netting that can withstand even the strongest shots. The goals can be staked into the grass using the included stakes, or can be taped onto the ground if you are playing on a hard court (tape not included). The goals are lined in a high visibility reflective fabric so they can be used in low light conditions. These are great for many different applications: youth soccer games, goalie less games, skills training, backyard setups and more. The set also includes 6 training cones that allow you to mark the 4 corners as well as the field half. The goals come with a full GoSports lifetime warranty and US based customer service, so we are here to help if anything goes wrong.",
