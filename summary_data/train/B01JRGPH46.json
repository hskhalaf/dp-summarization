It's quiet but has the power to file through the toughest acrylics and gels while also being easy to adjust for gentler filing. The handpiece is stable and comfortable to hold. There isn't the slightest wobble even at higher speeds. The only time it might grabs or drag is when the speed is set too low. I can't comment on the included bits because I use my own favorite ceramic bits. After two months of regular use, I'm very satisfied!",

I haven\u2019t dropped it, misused it, missed handled it, left it on or anything and it just cuts on but doesn\u2019t work. The drill doesn\u2019t drill. It\u2019s very frustrating because I was so happy to have and now it doesn\u2019t work. I know longer have ya box it came in. So I can\u2019t return it. I basically wasted my money. Is there something that can be done. I don\u2019t even want my money back I just want a new one.",

I wish the bits came with one that has thicker teeth, or grooves to grind down acrylic and gel faster. The files it came with will get the job done, but it takes a little longer. I notice that when you have the power (torque) turned up to a midway point, the drill becomes harder to control and it slips off the nail, which is not good, especially when you\u2019re trying to shape the nail. Overall. I\u2019m very pleased.",

Take heed and watch this review. Because if they do not replace it one only used five times and under their warranty time this is definitely a NO GO BUY.

I'm very happy I chose Makartt. I had used it only once and it has no vibration and doesn't heat up so far. The only negative is that its very difficult to remove the sanding band from its bit. Other than that I loved it.",
