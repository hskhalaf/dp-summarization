This took a few hours to put together, as there are many parts and screws, but the instructions are clear and all of the pieces were intact and fit together nicely. My only comment is that the screws that face the outside pieces are painted brown, so they blend in, and are labeled the same as their silver counterparts. Several times I had to go back and replace screws, so keep that in mind when putting this together. These should be labeled differently, or the instructions should indicate which versions to use.",

Batteries are included, along with spare parts. Two things: A. You will never be able to change the batteries in the burners once assembled. B. Put on the middle back panels with the tape facing the back of the unit or you'll have big white strips in the cupboards like me (the kids don't care, though).",

The instructions don't tell you which one to use where so pay careful attention to whether the screws will be visible or not.

She has recently developed a great imagination for a two year old and this little kitchen has her imagining even more! I love the play encouragement each little feature brings: the phone, light up stove, noise making ice machine, and open and close doors. Everything about this kitchen is high quality! One tip: don\u2019t try to assemble this in less than an hour\u2014 or the on Christmas Eve. There are a lot of pieces. Easy to assemble- just takes time.",

      "text": "My husband just put this together yesterday for our daughter's Christmas present. It took him a little over 2 hours to complete due to all of the pieces but it is a sturdy piece of \"furniture\". The ice maker works as well as the stove when you set pots and pans down on the burner. My only concern is the possibility of pulling too hard on the handles and it coming forward. We have it sitting on carpet so it is a bit more wobbly when the doors are opened. I am sure with time those latches will loosen up and we won't have any issues at all. Really well manufactured product for the price!",

The kitchen is very sturdy and the assembly instructions were very easy to follow. It was absolutely helpful having watched the assembly tips video provided on Amazon prior to assembling it. I bought the play food, apron and mit, pots, plate set, and motion sensor lights separately. They all made the presentation spectacular. The kitchen was definitely a great buy.

However, I don't think it was mentioned how confusing the directions were. You obviously had to be a pro at assembly to decipher the missing labeled screws, brown heads/silver heads, short/long, holes that weren't drilled, screws that went in at an angle so you needed to lift weights for a month to have the strength to send them home BUT all-in-all especially after time spent it's not a bad item. Fairly strong and detailed for short kids.",

A drill would\u2019ve been good to have for this reason, instead of making my own hole with a screwdriver. It\u2019s very study and heavy. My toddler loves the ice machine sounds.
