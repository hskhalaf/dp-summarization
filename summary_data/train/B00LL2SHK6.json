I do recommend this projector, as it has served me well, and looks fantastic for the price. Well done. Edit number 2: The second bulb lasted about 2 months. I am very disappointed.",

What amazes me is that projectors in 2020 have the same specs (25,000:1 contrast, 3200 lumens, 1080p) for the same price as this 2015 HD26. My 5 year old Samsung LED TV was at the edge of what was possible at the time. Now I'm lucky if I sell it for $100. I was researching buying a new projector because I assumed they progressed like LED TVs. It appears I'll be keeping this projector for many more years,",

Just recently, it started having a sound issue. The sound just dies at random. Sometimes, a hard reset of the unit will get the sound back. Sometimes I have to do this 5 times to get it back. When it does cut out, it's for both the internal speaker and the audio out jack. When you are spending this kind of money, you expect more. I'm very disappointed. I was going to give it 1 star but the video quality was good so i'll leave it at 2.",

I'm pretty confident I could handle it on my own if I had a decent manual, but I was told they don't provide technical manuals to the public. Just a way to force consumers to buy their overpriced service. If you are a do it yourself type, consider yourself warned you will get no help from optoma.",

When silent moments between episodes the fan is noticeable surround sound when used it makes it unnoticeable. Overall I love it it takes some time to customize to your best setting takes time.

Yes the resolution is marginally higher but in \"cinema mode\" the brightness is the same and still requires a dark room to enjoy.

The only word of caution I would give is that it doesn't have a lens shift feature so it is a little more difficult to get it exactly where you want it.",

If you don't have issues with the rainbow effect from DLP technology, this is a fabulous option for an entry level projector.",
