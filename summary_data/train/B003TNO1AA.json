However, the directions recommend oiling the belt prior to using it, but then it\u2019s very difficult to get the belt tightened and realigned properly. Mine always seems to squeak and make noise. Overall the machine is noiser than most, which doesn\u2019t matter too much for me because it\u2019s in a basement. Those that are concerned about that in apartments or small spaces should be aware. The belt is wider than some others, which is more comfortable for running in particular. I am happy that I bought it and value being able to run inside in rainy or snowy days. Would recommend depending on your needs.",

Thankfully the treadmill is just a backup for when I can't run outside and I will make do with the inflexible MPH settings. I mean, it was only a few hundred dollars so I really didn't expect that much out of it. Please update the product description to accurately reflect the available settings.",

I received it the next morning after i ordered it and it was with the Free Super Saver Shipping option. I would have really liked for it to have had the automatic incline but i can deal with the manual incline that it comes with. So far i have no complaints. If you have a small budget to spend on a treadmill i would recommend this one.",
