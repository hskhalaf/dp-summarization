      "text": "1 of my chisels came horribly milled -- kind of like it was set in at a funny angle in the grinder at the factory. Amazon's customer service was unapologetic and tried to offer me a $7 refund/discount, if I simply kept the chisel set. $7? Not sure how they came to that number. Not surprisingly, I returned them for a full refund and bought a set of Stanley Sweethearts (750s). MUCH better chisel set. Socket-style handles, better steel, better handle design. Consider spending about $20-$30 and buy the Sweethearts instead. They will last you a lifetime, if maintained properly.",

The backs take a very long time to flatten. I have not used them yet, I hope it is worth the time spent getting them ready to use.",

I will have to sharpen these as others have mentioned to remove the lacquer. Overall, they look nice, just was not happy about one of them not appearing professionally crafted.

Upon their arrival I did have to remove the lacquered finish and sharpen them, but I had to put them back in the leather pouch since I didn't have any real projects going on until this last weekend. They worked amazingly well. I was a little upset that the beating on the butt from the beechwood mallet did mar the strike surface quite heavily, but, what else would happen? The blades kept their sharpness through the project and left me impressed. I'd imagine the Sweetheart (socket) chisels perform better, but these still did a wonderful job.

Anyone who complains about that probably had no idea how to sharpen a chisel. I spent 5 minutes on each chisel to fine tune the bevels. I can handle that for $60.",
