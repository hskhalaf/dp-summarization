      "text": "I've used this and Meguiar's Ultimate Wash&Wax. I prefer this. Something about it feels gentler, and it does a better job too. This doesn't smell as strongly as the Meguiars, and that smell doesn't stick to my hands like it does with theirs. I found this generally easier to work with, too: Easier to apply, felt more lubricated, and buffed off dry much easier. It also doesn't dry quickly leaving you with dry wax before you're done with a quarter panel. 4 stars because 16oz is just enough to do my entire car and for the same price Meguiars gives you 24oz which at least lets you leave a bit in the trunk for spot-cleans.",

Did not do a great job of loosening up dust on the car, when wiping with a microfiber cloth I could feel the unevenness. Definitely left more micro-scratches than when I started. Maybe diluting and/or really saturating the surface would work better but I'd use the whole bottle for one wash. Going to try it as a drying aid, like how I use ultimate quik wax, and see if that works better.",

Wipe in one direction adjusting the cloth to a fresh edge on each stroke to avoid scratches. Then using a microfiber towel wipe to shine/buff shine... no elbow grease needed, just spray wipe and a quick buff and your car will look like you just paid $$$ for a professional detail.

The only downsides are the construction of the spray bottle (spring mechanism in the trigger tends to stick) and the fact that you need a lot of it to do a whole car. I would recommend just buying the big 1 gallon bottle and using your own sprayer from your local home improvement store. Aside from that though, it's a 5/5 product.",

I used about 6 of them. After trying this product, I used the Rain-x and McGreggor brands. Even though those brands came in bigger bottles (I believe 24 ounces) they were not as good as the chemical guys. They left streaks and didn\u2019t not smell as good. Next time I will be getting the bigger size. I highly recommend!",

This is my second bottle, since the first one I ordered Is sitting in some mail mans garage [only received an empty package]. Not gonna hassle with returning this, I'll just find a decent spray bottle and empty the contents once I get the cap off!! I must add Amazon did send a replacement for the first bottle!",
