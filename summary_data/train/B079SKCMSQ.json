QUALITY: In the past, Kingston brand computer memory chips are known for having the highest quality and reliability. The manufacturer's venture into microSDHC memory products continues it's stellar legacy. . 2. PRICE: This product is the lowest price for brand names - $1 below SanDisk. . . DISADVANTAGES . 1. There are none. From experience, I have never experienced a defective Kingston brand product. In fact, my 2008 purchased memory chips and 2011 purchased microSD reader are still being used.",

If you need this for a security camera type operation, it probably won't work as it's formatted in exFAT, and Windows will not let you change that. However, download EaseUS Partition Master, for free, and then you can format the card so it will work. Must use FAT32 file structure for the format. Once that's completed, it should work in your camera, etc. Again, Windows will not let you format it to FAT32. Use EaseUS Partition Master. Again, it might work.",

Roku sells MicroSD cards directly (generic 2gb), but with shipping, these faster 16gb cards were actually cheaper overall. I have 2 Roku 3's, and 1 Roku Premiere+ and I turned off each unit, inserted the card, then when I turned them each on I was asked to format the MicroSD card. That process took about 5-7 minutes and now that minor annoyance of refreshing channels is gone for good! :) And since these cards have more capacity (that Roku won't use), they may be more useful down the road for other applications too.",

If this is what you are looking for, take my review as confirmation. Besides this, it works like every other sd card, but based on online professional reviews, this sd card was specifically optimized for smartphones, which to me is a bonus.",

      "text": "This card works great in my camera, but when I was purchasing it, I needed an SDHC (like it says in the product title). Without reading the description too deeply, I ordered a 64G, knowing I would need quite a bit of space. If you'll observe the very last line of the product description, it says that the SDHC is only for the 32G cards. The rest are SDXC. SDXCs do not work on my audio recorder. I do not know a lot about technology so this may be completely obvious to people more familiar with it than me. Still, great card for devices that can actually use it.",
