The loose fitting pieces come apart very easily. I just barely bumped it with my arm and more than a fourth of the puzzle just came apart and I had to figure it all out again. The gold foil on the puzzle was very wrinkled and the print quality was very low. Too bad. Don't buy it.",

Pieces also fit tightly which I like.",
