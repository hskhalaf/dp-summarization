I'm hoping with more use it will continue to repair my now very dry and heat damaged hair. Some people have commented on the smell. I think it smells good. It is sort of perfum-y and strong, but once it's rinsed out its way more subtle. I like the smell of the original a little better but this one works way better so I'd never switch back.
