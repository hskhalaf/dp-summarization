I also tried audio CD's with the same result. I emailed ILuv and got a form response about whether or not it was in warranty, which it wasn't. I emailed them back looked for an objective quote for repair and was ignored. No response ever more from them.",

The ipod plugs in to the back, and you have to turn the unit around to reach the back to operate the ipod. It is the most ridiculous thing when you have turned off the power to the video unit; then turn it around and find that the ipod is still playing and will continue playing forever unless you turn that off too.",

Also, the unit itself is very thick and very hard to handle, though the picture cleverly hides the thickness of the thing. Great job iLuv's Photographer. DO NOT BUY !",
