I bought it at $470 , but several days later the price was dropped to $374. A bit of a rip off. I have a Dyson canister, but rarely have a need to use it. Another problem I see, is that hair wedges up into the narrow portion of the cup so I have to scoop the jammed material with a knife.",

I have a 950sf house, upstairs has carpet, and laminate wood flooring on the 1st level, it did a great job, sucked up the dirt and fluffed up the carpet. When you remove the arm and make it a handheld, it did my stairs with ease, easier to maneuver than a standard vacuum with the tube extensions connected. I would recommend this to anyone at this point, I know people complained about the battery life, but it did my whole house without using the Max button. If you had a bigger house, not sure how well it would do on the battery, but covered all 1950sf at of mine on 1 charge.",

This particular unit is built for animal fur and does a very good job on dog hair. You can use it without the extension tube and have a powerful hand vac for upholstery, windowsills and general dusting. Oh, and did I say I liked it?",

Also, for some reason the machine began to pulsate off and on. Other purchasers have commented on this: I wish I had seen their comments before buying this unit, that for other buyers, apparently, seems to work fine. Otherwise, it is very powerful and picks up dirt and fur off the carpet pretty well.",
