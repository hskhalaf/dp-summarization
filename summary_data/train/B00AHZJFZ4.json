It's just a shiny piece of plastic (no non-skid coating on the backside). The worst part? The edges all the way around the desk protector have markings from the manufacturer packaging. Supposed to be \"Krystal Clear\". Looks horrible! Thank goodness for Amazon's easy return process.",

I think I could solve that with some small pieces of double backed tape. However there are marks around the edges probably from the manufacturing process. i would think this would have been found during a quality control check. Ii fits my needs however I am returning because of the marks and hopefully third time is the charm.",
