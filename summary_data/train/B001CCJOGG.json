      "text": "I absolutely loved this camera. It took great pictures, and I was sad when it broke, after years of everyday use. It was so intuitive that I neve had to read the manual. I would have bought another Panasonic but the price is almost double what I paid for it 5 years ago. I've replaced it with a Nikon, which is, in no way, comparable. The only thing that is better about the Nikon was the price and the fact that you can zoom in while recording a video. Not many point and click cameras let you do that. Panasonic produces great qualty photos.",

      "text": "Great camera with excellent battery life and rechargeable lithiom-ion battery. Most cameras have 10 or 12 MP this one has 14.7 the photo resolution is amazing. The face tracking feature works well. There is a slight lag before flash though which can cause problems when taking photos in low light settings. I would have given it a 5 star rating if it weren't for the lag in the flash causing problems with night shots. Daytime photos are spectacular though. I think this camera is a great value for the money and highly recommend it.",

In low light it could definitely use a more powerful flash. As other reviewers have said as the ISO gets cranked up so does the noise. I'm ambivalent about this camera. It's not any better than others that I have had. Cannon just announced the S90. I might trade up for that when it comes down in price.",

Very pixelated, lot of noise in the image, even in the RAW format, and even for pictures taken in bright sunlight. The camera has great features though, you can set almost everything manually as in an SLR, but the picture quality is so disappointing that I wish I had not purchased this camera and stayed with the Exilim I had before.",

    "title": "Panasonic DMC FX-150K 14.7MP Digital Camera with 3.6x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black)",
    "description": "Color:BlackFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n Stylish and feature-rich, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FX150 is equipped with 14.7 megapixels, and also boasts a 28mm wide-angle Leica DC Vario-ELMARIT lens with F2.8 brightness and 3.6x optical zoom. \n\nThe FX150\u2019s manual controls and creative-shooting features distinguish it from many of its ultra-compact competitors. For instance, the Manual Exposure mode lets you choose the shutter speed, giving the freedom to render artistic images of ordinary scenes. The multi-exposure function superimposes up to three consecutively shot images together while the user views the previous image on the LCD, creating a surrealistic effect that cannot be achieved with a single image alone. Furthermore, the manual bracketing function includes typical exposure and adds new color bracketing to capture color, monochromatic and sepia shots of an image simultaneously. \n\nThe FX150 also records original photos in the RAW file format and comes bundled with the SILKYPIX Developer Studio 3.0SE software application, enabling the user to freely adjust RAW data settings such as exposure bias and white balance even after shooting for greater editing and image development. \n\nIn addition to manual controls, the FX150 also offers Panasonic\u2019s Intelligent Auto (iA) mode that provides the user with automatic settings adjustments depending on the shooting environment. A new technology, called AF (auto focus) Tracking, has been added to the iA roster of features. AF tracking enables the camera to lock focus on a moving object. Additionally, AF Tracking increases Face Detection accuracy, allowing for crisp, sharp-focused shots even if the subject moves while shooting the image. \n\nWhen the FX150 is set to iA mode, the following technologies engage automatically, no settings need to be made: \n\n *  Intelligent Exposure -- Helps prevents photos from being under- or over-exposed by instantly analyzing the framed image and adjusting the brightness in areas that are too dark because of dim lighting, backlighting or the use of the flash. The camera will automatically adjust the brightness accordingly. \n *  Digital Red-eye Correction-- Helps to eliminate the red-eye problem that sometimes results when taking flash shots at night. Incorporated into the camera, the built-in flash emits a small preliminary flash before the main flash, detects red-eye and will digitally correct it. \n *  MEGA O.I.S. -- Gyrosensors detect hand-shake and the lens system shifts to compensate, helping to prevent hand-shake from creating a blurry image. \n *  Intelligent ISO -- Determines if the photo subject is moving and changes the ISO setting and shutter speed accordingly, thus giving a blur-free photo. \n *  Intelligent Scene Selector -- Senses the ambient conditions, recognizes the shooting environment and will automatically select the appropriate scene mode from: Scenery, Portrait, Macro, Night Portrait or Night Scenery mode. This intuitive technology, helps the consumer use the most common scene modes that are built into the camera, but often go unused, without making any manual adjustments. \n *  Face Detection -- Detects faces in the frame (up to 15 faces), even if they are moving, and selects optimal focus and exposure settings so portraits come out clear. \n *  Quick AF (Auto Focus) -- Starts focus on the subject by just pointing the camera at the subject, thus minimizing the AF time. \n\nThe FX150 boasts the high-speed image processing system, the Venus Engine IV, which supports a faster response time, allowing the camera to shoot 2.5 shots per second at full resolution and six shots per second in High-Speed Burst mode. The FX150 can also record dynamic High Definition video in 1280 x 720p at 24fps. Other advanced features of the Lumix FX150 include:  *  Image Leveling -- When a captured image \"leans\" to the right or left because the camera was held at a slight angle when the photo was taken, the Image Leveling function rotates the image to straighten it and crops the unnecessary edges. No computer needed! \n *  Scene Modes -- The FX150 offers 24 different scene modes to respond easily to any shooting situation. The new Pin Hole and Film Grain modes add unique, film-camera-like effects and ambiences to images and the Transform mode trims and stretches images to virtually transform the subject.",
