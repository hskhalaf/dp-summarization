I slit the side open on the tongue and removed the huge piece of foam. I cut the foam in half to be thinner and trimmed the sides to help fit back in the tongue and had my mom sew them back together (shes a black belt with the sewing machine lol). Added insoles and these shoes look, feel, and perform great. Nice firm platform on pedals and very grippy . I will update if mtb pedals chew up the soles.",

Seriously, wth is happening to DC shoes? DC's used to last me 6 months or so of skating every day and now I can't even walk in them for less than 2 months before they fall apart. ** Update ** I contacted DC and they took care of the issue by sending me a $50 gift card which is just about what I paid for these.

Skate shoes are made to feel the board under your feet, but you lose out on traction and arch support in the process. Great shoe for what it is and our son? He couldn't be happier with them.",
