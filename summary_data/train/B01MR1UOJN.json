      "text": "I love the 3 in 1 bags! I use my bike to commute to work on good days, and I do not like backpacks carrying the heavy bike locks and all my work gear. This was the perfect solution. It easily comes off so that all my stuff can go in to work with me, but it is secure on my bike while I am riding. It has so much room to carry everything I need and I love how sturdy it feels. I have not had an opportunity to test how water resistant it is, mostly because I dislike riding in the rain, but I am not worried at all. Overall very pleased and happy with my purchase.",

I\u2019ve used this 4 days a week commuting for the past month and already the bag is fraying because it hits the spokes or tires, even though I\u2019ve installed it properly and keep it evenly weighted. This week one of the clips to secure it to my seat post cracked and is useless. The only good thing I learned from using this bag is that panniers are superior to a backpack. If anyone is looking for panniers, I would find a different product if you plan on using these often.",

We put our lock cables, U-Lock, and bike water bottles in the rear pannier. It fit well on a 19\"L x 7\"W Rambo R150 \"Extra Large Rack\" [Rear] also available on Amazon. While sturdy, durable and well designed, it can't compare with waterproof pannier bag sets costing three times as much - so set your expectations accordingly.

      "text": "After one bike ride, I noticed that the seams had started ripping. This was on a trial bike ride, and I only had my U lock, a set of screwdrivers, keys, phone, and water bottle in the bags. After reading the other one star reviews and noting that these bags can get into the wheel when they fall apart and cause crashes, I decided to return it and get something sturdier (and suggest that others do the same).",
