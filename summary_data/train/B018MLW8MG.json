Right now you need a screwdriver to tighten the screws down and to be honest who keeps a flat head screwdriver in their kitchen drawer, and if you do who wants to break it out every time you want to change the thickness of the slice, which I do often. Please install larger adjusting screws and you would have the ULTIMATE cheese slicer.",

      "title": "Very heavy cheese slicer",
      "text": "I bought this when my reliable slicer snapped after decades of use. This one looked similar, and it comes with a spare cutting wire, the Achilles heel of the previous cutter. It's a lot larger, heavier and more cumbersome than that old reliable one though. I plan to keep it as a spare, but I'm getting the German Westmark cutter. That might be more like my old slicer. The spare wire's nice idea, but could I find it by the time the original one snaps?",

      "text": "I\u2019ve only had this cheese slicer for a short time so I can\u2019t vouch for how well it will last. However, it\u2019s remarkably heavy. The weight suggests that it might last longer than more lightweight slicers. The handle certainly should never break and it comes with a spare wire, so I have high hopes. The heaviness makes it a bit challenging to use because the handle isn\u2019t quite long enough to provide the leverage to take advantage of the weight - hence the 3 stars for the ease of use. All told, though, it\u2019s a very nice slicer.",

Thickness adjustment tends to slip as well unless it is screwed down very tightly, which then makes it difficult to loosen for adjustment to a new thickness. Conceptually a good product with a nice design that is somewhat lacking in actual performance.",

Overall, we're very happy with the quality of the slicer, but the screws that adjust the roller for slice thickness have loosened while cutting slices. We do just tighten them back up with no problem, but they don't seem to want to hold super tight. Still love the quality for the price and the extra wire that came in the package.",

You can easily adjust the thickness of the slice by changing the angle. So far no broken wire or any problem. It might be a good idea to let hard cheeses soften a bit and to rock the wire back and forth while you're cutting. The weight is good and it feels sturdy and solid in my hand. Chrome like finish cleans up very easily, cheese doesn't stick. Highly recommended.",

It feels like a quality product that won't have you trying to fix a broken or disconnected wire every time you try slicing a hard cheese and if it should happen to break, which I doubt, it comes with an additional replacement wire.
