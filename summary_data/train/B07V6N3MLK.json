      "text": "Been using grills/smokers for about 30 years and this is the best I have ever had. The wood pellet feeder with electronic control makes keeping maintain a constant temperature effortless. Tried boston butt, ribs and salmon so far and all have come out excellent. Great quality and craftsmanship. A grill/smoker of this quality usually costs much more. Highest recommendation.",

      "text": "Really liked the quality of the grill. Easy to put together but a little time consuming. As for using it especially for a 1st time user of pellet grills. Was a bit confusing for the setting from smoke to cooking. I prefer more smoke amd bought a smoking tube. But when cooming on low temp had only a quarter of the grill with head and the rest with little to no heat very indirect heat. Possibly to do with the drip pan. But over all it's a decent grill for the price especially with size. I put 2 briskets and 2 pork butts and that was without the 2nd rack.",

Customer service was awesome; sent email about unknown parts that weren't mentioned in the manual and got a reply within minutes. Turns out these were 'bonus' parts to hang cooking tools on grill.
