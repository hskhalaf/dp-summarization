I assumed, after looking at the photo and reading it was a \"drop leaf table\" (that could hold drinks), it would be the height of an end table. This really is a nice newspaper/magazine rack, but it's much too small to keep the \"drop leaf\" open or it looks odd; it's just too short for a table. I honestly believe the \"drop leaf\" is an extra that unnecessarily adds to the cost and is useless. I gave it four stars, because it is a reasonably priced magazine rack.",
