It is such a shame......it could have been a beautiful cabinet. Is it functional? Yes. Is it flawed? Yes. Hopefully, at some point the company will listen to these reviews and provide a non-damaged product.",

Oh and if you have guns with only a 16 inch barrel like an M4 or AR the top of the barrel will only come up to the wood shelf. But if you are on a budget then this is an Ok gun cabinet.",
