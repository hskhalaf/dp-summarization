      "text": "I have to say the sound and noise cancelling of this is pretty awesome. Unfortunatley that's moot because after a month and a half of regular use the side of the headband cracked. Rendering it useless. Looked online and saw there are MANY people with the same problem and concerns. Someone from Sony even left a comment under a review on Amazon saying the issue has been looked at and \"measures had been taken\". Contacted Sony about a repair / replace and was told that wouldn't happen. Even though it's their defective product. They are the ones who chose to use cheap plastic on 400 dollar headphones, I'm the one paying for it. I'm never buying Sony again.",

The touch controls are great, the battery life is awesome, the bluetooth range is at LEAST 3X that of the Bose. They support higher quality protocols, the noise cancelling is better in my opinion.

In other words, for the duration of a 3 hour flight, the Bluetooth on your phone needs to be on whether you are listening to audio or not; and, while the battery on the headphones survives, the battery on your phone may not. Seems like a bug since this cannot be by design.

The right side has controls that are invisible: you just tap and/or swipe on them to pause, fast forward, or skip.

Something else I didn't like from WH1000XM2, they gave you two \"voice warnings\" of \"low battery, please recharge headset\", silencing all your sounds. This is ridiculously annoying for me as happens likely at 15% (~2hrs left) and 5% (30-40min left) and I left important things on meetings. WH1000XM1 just make red flashes and turns off with a voice sound.",

Either way, I was stoked to see them arrive, as they have amazing noice-cancellation features! Not nearly as comfortable as my old Bose QuietComfort 15s, but the noice-canceling is way better and the sound is almost comparable. I think I need to deepen the bass a little on my app settings, but so far I love these headphones, and am looking forward to using them on some long distance flights coming up soon. Loving the touch pad controls as well!",

But Sony's feature of pausing the ANC if you hold your hand on the right earphone won the day for me. Simply terrific and very convenient.

Touch sensitive buttons on the side are a little annoying taking the headphones on and off, as you can accidentally adjust the volume or change the song.

      "text": "LOVE these headphones. My girlfriend has the Bose and as I travel a lot I wanted noise cancelling, wireless and great sound quality. We just took and 2 1/2 plane ride and we both tried each others out. Noise cancelling is pretty much the same on both. However we both agreed that the sound on the Sonys were much better, especially the bass. It's not overpowering like Beats but much better than her Bose. I didn't think I'd care for the ear cup features but we both loved the way you can cup the right ear piece to pause our music or movies to actually hear without removing the headphones. Great purchase.",

      "text": "These headphones have above average sound, amazing noise canceling, and are super comfortable... except for the fact that they warm up my ears very quickly. After about 30 minutes, my ears would be burning and bright red. It would take several hours for the sensation to go away. I think this is because the earpads don't provide for much breathing room, or maybe the material just didn't agree with my skin. If it weren't for this issue, these headphones would be 5 stars. Ultimately, I had to return them because it just wasnt possible to wear them for longer periods, my ears would get too warm.",

That was them: these Sony Headphones are fantastic! Charge them and the charge lasts a long time. Turn on the noise cancelling features and I can't believe how well it works. My neighbor was mowing his yard and I put my set on. I light drone was all I heard. Then I turned on music and all I could hear was the music. I haven't had a pair of Bose, but if they work better than the Sonys, I doubt it would be worth the price asked for the Bose.",

Ability to instantly stop/start/vol up & down/next song is incredibly convenient - Range is awesome, on par with my Apple Airpods. Just now I left my phone in my seat (8C on a 737) and used the restroom at the rear of the plane. No disconnect or degradation whatsoever. - Sound isolation as good or better than the QC25.
