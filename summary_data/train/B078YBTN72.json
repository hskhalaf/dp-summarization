The nail clipper is pretty sharp, ought to be careful. I tested the thermometer and it looks accurate. The brush was nice soft that my neice enjoys when her mom brushes her head and back. The comb has cute little bubbles at it's ends so that it won't scratch when combing. Overall, it's very good designed and well cared product.",
