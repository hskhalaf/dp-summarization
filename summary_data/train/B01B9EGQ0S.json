If you don't plan on raising the blinds, they would be ok, but they are a pain to raise up and lower back down because the cords don't pull smoothly. The bottom is never quite level when hanging, and I end up pulling on the blinds to get them back down. They don't look like wood blinds, just smooth vinyl. Also be sure to measure the top of your window where the blinds will hang because it may not be the same size as the bottom of the window.",

They are not phillips, so very difficult to screw in - plus the heads are very thick, so if you have a tight fit (my window is 28.5), the screw heads actually keep you from installing the blinds. I ended up substituted some phillips head screws I had. That said, these are really nice blinds with real wood header and bottom rail. Much better than blinds I paid three times as much for. Would definitely order again!",

Also, the width of the decorative piece that snaps on over the hardware gives the blinds an expensive looking touch. A note about sizing: The width of our window openings is exactly 36\". We ordered the 35 5/8\" blinds. They were a tight fit, but they fit nonetheless.",

It was easy to remove the unneeded slats and re-secure the bottom one (after watching a youtube or two on how to do it). The blind pulls up cleanly and smartly, and the two drawstrings on the left turn the slats up and down very smoothly. I highly recommend for the quality/price ratio.",

If you put the hooks on the rail first, slide it in place, then you will have to ram the wood fac\u0327ade on the plastic hooks and they are a bit flimsy so they will break easily.
