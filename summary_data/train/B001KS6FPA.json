      "text": "Fit my 2014 Subaru Forester perfectly. Removing the original is more straightforward than how the owner's manual explained. There's really nothing to pry. Just lift the arm away from the back window, at this point the blade will point backward. Turn the movable part of the blade counter-clockwise away from the arm until you can turn anymore. Continue to turn counter-clockwise but now you have to use a little strength, yet not being too rough, until you dislodge the whole blade when the small cross-bar in the middle of the blade slides out from the clip on the arm. Now I can see through the back window again. :P",

The problem with the OEM wiper was that the outer end of the blade has less contact with the back window than the opposite end, so the outter edge wasn't as clean. But this blade doesn't seems to have that issue at all. Conclusion: based on some of the negative reviews, I was a little worry on the performance of this wiper prior to purchase. But I am glad this has exceeded my expectations. Highly recommended for my vechicle.",

TRICO doesn't list any wiper for the back window of the Forte5, but this one fits perfectly. Be sure you get the Roc Loc mount. So far, I've had it on a week, and it wipes better than new, doesn't hit anything (third brake light), and is overall a better wiper than the one that came on the car. The only difference I can see is the original was a solid piece, where this one is segmented. Speaking for myself, I would recommend this blade for the Forte5 (mine is a 2016).",

The Flex blades are on the windshield and they work well there. Overall, very happy with Trico products. Good price and good quality. No complaints.",

The product shown does not have the requisite slots necessary to slide into place onto the arm. Good thing Amazon has a decent return policy for items not fitting as described!",
