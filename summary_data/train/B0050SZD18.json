      "text": "Decided to get one of these as I love playing Retro games on emulators. Not really interested in the actual Ouya games. Got it today and after the initial 20 minute firmware update, I started playing with it. I installed 'RetroArch' and plugged in my USB HDD with 1000's or roms/isos on it. After fiddling around a while, I managed to get most games working in full screen with sound etc. The only games I'm having trouble with is Gamecube, Nintendo 64 and Dreamcast. With a little more fiddling, I'm sure I will get them all working. So far, so good. And at \u00a358 it was well worth it.",

It plays movies fine, though it does struggle occasionally with large 1080p files (it gets pretty hot in here, that might be part of the problem). Build quality of the controller is somewhat sub-par: the 'down' button occasionally triggers the 'left' button, which makes navigating a hassle... Overall, I'm happy with the purchase.",

Looking forward to trying the emulators . My only grumble is wi-fi does not seem that good I didn't seem to be able to receive a strong signal like I should have ,I had to use a cable .",

It's sad really, I can see what the designers were going for - almost the raspberry pi equivalent of a gaming console, but I personally don't think it works well.",

Now currently using as a home theater pc replacement and running various of emulation software to play classic video game roms. The OUYA stock rom isn't the best and highly recommend installing a custom launcher rom to get the best functionality from the device. You may also consider replacing the default fan inside the OUYA case for something abit more silent if planning on heavy usage. Runs xbmc gothem like a dream, all xbmc skins run smoothly and offers various amounts of customisation. Highly recommended device to replace xbmc based htpcs.",

UPDATE: I've been playing SNES, NES, NeoGeo, and PS1 On my ouya and i can tell you guys it works great, the controll support is also top notch, if you have spare bluetooth or usb controllers around use them!

Its not bad for the price, although the controller could use some improvement. There are now Tegra4 based microconsoles with better gamepads, but these cost much more. For this price, its a nice little toy. Mind you, this does not meant to compete with the big consoles.",

It's not a PS3, no, but with a bit of discretion the game selection is excellent. If you want a simple, hackable mini-console for messing about with, OUYA is the way to go. Would recommend to anyone.

Besides this, you may love it or be disappointed, depending on your expectations. If you have \"the heart of a developer\" and you are looking for a \"hack friendly\" game console, driven by the open source philosophy, Ouya is definitely for you! On the other hand, if you are looking for a \"game console\" in the traditional sense of the term, then you'd better purchase an XBox or a Playstation. Personally, I love its open philosophy and its \"hack friendship\".",

    "description": "Video games just feel bigger and better on a TV screen. Surround Sound. HD. A room full of friends. Console gaming isn\u2019t going anywhere, but console games aren\u2019t as much fun as they could be.\n\nThat\u2019s why the OUYA, a new kind of game console, exists--to bring groundbreaking games to the television in an entirely new way.\n\nGames Only on OUYA\n\nYou download OUYA games directly to your console--no discs to buy or scratch.\n\nAnd the games on OUYA are made by some of the most inventive game developers in the business. Favorite franchises like Final Fantasy, brand new never-before-seen titles and hundreds of other games. Shooters, platformers, role-playing games, action games... You name it.\n\nAnd, best of all, every game on OUYA is free to try. You might end up investing in that coin doubler, buying the healing elixir that extends your life, or unlocking the full version of the game, but everything -- absolutely everything -- is free to try.\n\nSmall... but Powerful\n\nOUYA is about the size of a Rubik\u2019s cube, but it plays hard in full-screen HD. It uses an nVIDIA quad-core CPU and outputs via HDMI at up to a stunning 1080p resolution. It powers on instantly.\n\nNeed more storage? No problem. Just plug in an external hard drive into the USB 2.0 port. Like to hardwire your Internet? That\u2019s cool. Jack into OUYA\u2019s high-speed ethernet port. WiFi works too. If you want to develop games, just plug your laptop into our micro-USB port -- anyone can release an OUYA game. And the hardware opens so you can customize it if that\u2019s your bag.\n\nWe listen to our supporters, and try to evolve OUYA so it always gets better for them. When you buy OUYA, you become part of our effort to change how console gaming works.\n\nAdditional Requirements\n\nYou will need a valid credit or debit card to download OUYA content. Your card will not be charged unless you choose to make a purchase. Though many games on OUYA will not require a purchase to unlock additional content or features, others may offer for purchase in-game products or additional features (like full versions or additional levels).\n\n\n\nBOX CONTAINS\n\n\nOUYA game console\nOUYA wireless controller with removable faceplates\nHDMI cable\nTwo AA batteries\nPower adapter",
