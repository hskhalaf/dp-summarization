In assembling the bassinet, I also loved how snug everything fit when it was together. It makes me feel that baby will be good go go in it with minimal worry from me. The light is nice and calming. I'm not the biggest fan of the music that is played only due to the higher-pitched nature of it, but it is a basic lullaby. Excited to use this product with our little guy.",

I washed the fabric twice thinking it was the source of the smell. Sadly wasted money. This garbage bassinet is made in china and sold here.",

Easy to move which is great because I move the bassinet from my bedroom to the living room each day and it is easy to pick up and cary to another room. My only complaint is that the thin sheet cover stains very easily and i can't get the spit up stains out.",

Oh and buy a sheet since the pad is super thin its like putting the baby in a cardboard box..",
