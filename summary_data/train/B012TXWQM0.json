The black color looks professional, although it does show dirt easily so I usually wipe it down once a week.

      "text": "I just bought the 55cm black ball. I measured it and it is roughly 48cm. I read other reviews that this brand balls are smaller and I wanted something between the 45cm and 55cm, so for me, it's perfect size. Packaging was great, a box within an Amazon box, inside came the pump, but it was useless, my lungs worked much better. Overall, looks like it's good quality and perfect for what I wanted it: for pilates and ab exercises. I gave it 4 stars because the size is wrongly advertised. Otherwise, 5 stars.",

So far the ball is serving as a desk chair and helps engage core muscles. It seems like the ball might have a small bit of a leak, which could probably be fixed by putting a sealant or oil on the plunger to hold air in the ball. The pump that came with this ball was not sufficient to properly inflate the ball, so I used the tube that came with the pump and blew into it.",

      "text": "Badger Boy's wife's review: I ordered the size 65 ball but it doesn't seem like the correct size. I pumped it completely and a few days later, let out some air and pumped it again hoping it would stretch; however, it still isn't truly a size 65 ball. My coworkers and I all use exercise balls for chairs. They purchased theirs at different retail stores (and are different brands) and theirs are all the same size but mine looks like it is the mini-version... Very strange. The material of this ball is a lot smoother and stiffer than theirs (which is more grippy and softer). It'll do the job but it wasn't what I expected...",

The only complaints would be that you have to inflate it manually and takes about 20 min to get it fully inflated also make sure you have a cloth tape measure as you will need to measure the circumference to know if you've inflated it enough. I'm still giving it five stars because for all I know this could be standard when buying an exercise ball. BTW the 75mm size will not fit through a standard door way fully inflated. Plan your inflation strategy carefully.",
