The sporty leather aesthetic of the Puma Basket is softened by its flimsy shoelaces which can be styled in many ways.This soul pleaser is garbed with a thoroughly cushioned tongue, collar, and footbed. The sizing and fit of this shoe may run small, but wearers can forget about foot discomfort while getting all glammed up under this peachy and comfy sneaker.",

The tongue is attached to the bottom of the shoe with elastic so there are bulges at the bottom of the shoes that stick into your feet and there arw also bulges at the top of the shoe for the laces go through. All of these bulges make these really beautiful shoes too uncomfortable to wear again. Sadly, I brought them on vacation with me and didn't try them on beforehand have the blisters to prove it. I feel like I just threw the money in the garbage for them. :(",

At first, I thought I would only want to wear them to match my outfit on my birthday but, they're so cute that I'm going to pair them with other outfits as well. Love this sneaker!",

It has both satin and grosgrain wide ribbon laces that are super cute. It fits like a typical Puma - more roomy in the toe area, moderate arch support with squishy insoles, and a nice sticky sole. I bought these for work - I'm a body shop estimator - so I'm running around on slippery concrete or dirty asphalt all day. They add a little sparkle to my otherwise boring blue polo shirt/black pants uniform.",
