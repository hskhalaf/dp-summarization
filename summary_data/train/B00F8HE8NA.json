The reason I am giving them three stars rather than five, is that when I am trying to blow them up, the air comes straight back out the nozzle as soon as I take my mouth away. I solve the problem by sticking my tongue against the nozzle until I can block it with my finger until I can close the darned thing. And even this does not always work. It generally takes me three tries to get these inflated sufficiently.",
