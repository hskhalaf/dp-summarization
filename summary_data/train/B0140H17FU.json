The smell is pleasant enough on application and dissipates quickly, and it's easy to apply. I held back one star, though, because it's just too expensive. They need to offer a larger size at a reduced \"per ounce\" price.",

And after using this for a week, the skin under my mustache and beard has gone back to normal, completely. My facial hair has become soft and shiney. Much less wirey, and it never itches anymore. I swear by this product, it literally changed my life.",

    "title": "Jack Black - Beard Oil with Kalahari Melon Oil & Vitamin E, 1 Fl Oz",
    "description": "Over time, beards and the skin underneath become brittle and dry and can get quite itchy. This is often due to the skin being deprived of hydration, which causes it to dry out. To combat this common problem, Jack Black has introduced Beard Oil, which is made from an exclusive blend of certified organic natural oils, potent antioxidants, and vitamins that help prevent dry, itchy skin and produce a conditioned, healthy-looking beard. Jack Black\u2019s PureScience formula delivers quick-absorbing natural oils and powerful antioxidants to soften and hydrate dry, brittle facial hair for more control and a healthy shine. Jack Black Beard Oil is lightly scented with natural botanicals and essential oils.\n\nJack Black Beard Oil contains essential oils and botanicals that work in conjunction to reduce itchy, dry facial skin and improve the look and feel of a beard. Kalahari melon oil and marula oil are rich in fast-absorbing hydrating oils rich in fatty acids that soften facial hair and smooth the skin underneath. Brown algae, vitamin E, and carrot extract are powerful antioxidants that protect against the damaging effects of free radicals. Plum oil is added to our unique blend to soften brittle and dry facial hair for added control and a healthy shine.\n\nJack Black\u2019s PureScience formulas are free of synthetic fragrance, colorants, and parabens. Every product features certified organic ingredients and is cruelty free and dermatologist tested. Almost all products in our line are vegan, free of artificial colorants, safe for sensitive skin, and made in the USA. For optimal results, pump 2 or 3 drops of Beard Oil into your palm. Rub your hands together and massage it upward into the facial hair while making contact with the skin underneath. To finish, groom the beard downward with your fingers or brush and style as usual. Reapply as needed.\n\n\n\nBRAND STORY\nNOTHING COMPLICATED. NOTHING COSMETIC. JUST SUPERIOR SKIN CARE",
