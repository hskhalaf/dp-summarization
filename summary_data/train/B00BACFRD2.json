I thought it was immoral to feed my dog only veggies but thirteen years later and permanent eye damage ( scratched cornea, etc) she is now at peace. Please do not hesitate to try this for your little pooch if they suffer from allergies. This could be the answer to your prayers.",

In other words, for the love of my dog, the environment, and for my piece of mind - - It's worth every penny! Besides, my finicky dog loves this food. I serve this with a whole cup of water in it, and it stays crunchy and she drinks all the water. By the way, we also give her Vegan treats called Max & Ruffy's. Also highly recommended.",
