A few dollars more than I was use to but worth every penny. These little babies are amazing. I just love that they can't clog and they really leave me with a nice clean shave. They work 100 times better than you would think for that price. Shipping was pretty fast and timely. Average 4 days to literally come from the West Coast to East Coast. I'm totally satisfied.",
