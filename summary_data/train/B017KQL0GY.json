        "Kidde's $189 RemoteLync is a solid security camera, complete with responsive IFTTT- and geofencing-based Home/Away arming and motion sensing capabilities, as well as a built-in siren to scare off intruders",

      "cons": [
        "The RemoteLync is essentially the same camera as the Homeboy, a product we reviewed back in 2014, although this version does tack on direct integration with other Kidde devices",
        "And like the Homeboy, Kidde's RemoteLync doesn't have live streaming or an HD-quality resolution"

VERY HARD TO GET CUSTOMER SERVICE ON THE PHONE, I'VE WAITED OVER 20 MINUTES AT A TIME AND STILL NEVER HAD SOMEONE ANSWER. I've EMAILED SEVERAL TIMES WITH NO RESPONSE. I WENT TO AMAZON CUSTOMER SUPPORT (WHERE I BOUGHT IT) AND AM STILL STRUGGLING WITH GETTING THIS WARRANTIED. SO, THIS COULD BE A GOOD CAMERA HOWEVER THE SUPPORT IS LESS THAN DESIREABLE AND I CANNOT SAY THAT THE PRODUCT LASTS. ONE HAS - ONE HAS DIED AFTER ONLY 5 MONTHS AND THESE ARE NOT CHEAP SO YOU EXPECT MORE IN A PRODUCT. STILL - NO RESPONSE FROM KIDDE.",

If I'm going in and out on the weekend doing yard work or I can cover the opened garage door area and not have to close the door every time I go in the back yard. If someone walking down the street tries to go in the garage I get an alert on the phone and they get an alarm warning. Quick notification on the phone. Good battery life. I would buy again.",

I sent 2 e-mails to support and tried the on line \"chat\" but never got a response. I am disappointed in the technical support. I guess if you never need any help then the equipment functions fine. I probably won't purchase another Kidde product based upon their lack of after sale support.",

I want to see it at the moment, not after it loads the video and then plays it back to me. I am returning them today. Hope this helps.",
