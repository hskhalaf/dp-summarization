Update: I almost gave these shoes away, but I decided to put some moleskin on the back part where it rubbed to see if that would help. It did and after a few months, they're finally broken in.",

NOT SO in this shoe. I ordered my normal 7.5 and it was VERY snug and uncomfortable to even try on. Returned these immediately in exchange for a half size up in the size 8. The size 8 fits like how my normal 7.5 shoes fit without any other padding or inserts. I've worn them all day to work and they are comfortable and stylish. Very happy with them, but MUST order 1/2 size up.",

Advice...order the next 1/2 size up.",

My feet loved the cushioned soles, and the mesh (which is not of poor quality) kept the shoe cool. I would definitely recommend this shoe to my friends.",
