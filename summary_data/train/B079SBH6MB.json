It will not pick up the sound or vibration when trying to tune lower or higher keys (notes)! All keys in middle section of piano are picked up and show clearly on review screen. If anyone knows of a piano tuning device that will pick up extreme high and extreme low keys, please let me know.",

The output jack is super useful for teaching electric guitar, but it's hard to read the screen and many students, for example, overtighten their string because F looks so similar to E without a backlit screen. But really: fair price and good product. Just consider something else if you are concerned about reading the screen",

I wish the display was lighted, because in average light it is a little difficult to read. In bright light however, it is very easy to see and read. All in all, it has some good features. I has LED indicator lights to tell you when you are in tune, or sharp or flat, so you really don't even need to look at the display to use this nice feature. Mine came calibrated to 440 HZ for A, which is correct. The batteries were easy to install.",

This is actually a very frequent problem with new zithers, because the wood becomes dry... Thus, I had to re-tuning it! And this \"Other Tuner\" product helped me SOOO much! My job became pretty easy. Yes, this is a perfect product for zithers, actually - I think - for each wired musical instrumments, although I made a try only on zither.",
