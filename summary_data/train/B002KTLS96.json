Have been doing 45+minute sessions on it while doing online things at my standing desk. Would highly recommend.",

I do the high intensity intervals 20/20 8-10 a day while working--in just a couple of weeks, I've lost 4 pounds. Plus, it really works the knees and hips so going up the stairs for this big gal with a bad back is much easier now. As I find time to go back to the gym, I'll continue with this piece of equipment. Who can't find 100 seconds a few times a day for a workout, right?",

I expected; however, that the steps would operate independently (like a regular stair stepper), but they do not. When independent, it forces you to work harder by default to keep a stepping motion. On this machine, stepping down on one side automatically forces the other side up. Xiser advertises the best exercise machine is the one you use. I don't think I would use it very much. No real criticism about its quality. It is not what one would expect from a stepper.",

      "text": "I use this every day, at least 10 times per day. I no longer have to work my quads out at the gym as long as I keep using it. The stepping is as smooth as can be, unlike the cheaper ones with the hydraulic lifts that work independently of each other. The science behind using this for very short periods at high intensity is legit. Besides...I'd much rather do this for 30-45 seconds at max intensity for 10-20 times per day than commit 30 minutes to cardio all at once. I'm very glad I found this machine and plan to use it for the rest of my life.",

But after reading about the things breaking or not working well, I figured it makes sense to go for quality. This \"Xiser\" is solid, well designed, and actually attractive in an industrial-chic way. The tension adjustment is straightforward, and the movement of the pedals is smooth. My heavy husband has even been using it (yeah!) with no complaint. Highly recommended!",

I noticed that the ground around the shocks is stained, and even with the highest resistance setting (there is a screwhead-type adjustment), these provide no resistance. I must have blown the seals. They might work well for someone lighter in weight than me, or someone my weight that does not run very hard. For the price, though, I was disappointed in the quality of the shocks.",
