      "text": "This bluetooth tracking card is awesome! It charges pretty quickly with the wireless charging pad, the setup is fast and app is very easy to use. Because it's a slim card the size of a regular credit card, you can slide it into basically any wallet, purse, bag, or suitcase of any size and feel completely confident while traveling. My favorite feature about this tracking card is that you can actually use it to find your phone if you misplace it... even if it's on silent!! I am totally going to purchase one of these for husband whom works in the oilfield so he travels weekly and tends to misplace his things a lot. Highly recommend!",

I can now easily charge my phone at my desk. Highly recommend!",

The credit card size card is easy to slip into your bag without being noticed and I believe is a great way to locate my bag is it is stolen!

Maybe I'm getting old and my hearing is starting to go, but I don't have this same issue with the Tile Slim, which is also less expensive. The Qi charging is a great idea, though.",
