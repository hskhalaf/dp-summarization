For those who need on the go, or who just want one product in one place and don't want to worry about spilling or whatnot, these really do the job. Each one is really thin, so when you think you're pulling one out, double check and make sure that you're really getting one; the first few uses I wasted a lot, grabbing 4-5 at a time and thinking I was only getting one.",
