      "text": "These must be a knock off. My closest is full of Aldo Cassedy pumps of every color. I figured since these were cheaper I would try them out, well I rather spend the extra 30 and buy directly from Aldo. I compared the inside of the shoe to my other Aldo shoes and the logo isn't even the same. The shoe stained my foot black after wearing them only once and a week later my heel is still black. The fit is all wrong my Aldos never scrape the back of my foot and these scrape so bad I have a mark. I'm returning these fake imitation pumps. Ladies spend the extra money and get directly from Aldo.",

They are also a bit taller then my other pair that I bought it store, that\u2019s the downside of ordering from amazon. Overall they are a pretty but uncomfortable. Most likely wouldn\u2019t recommend.",
