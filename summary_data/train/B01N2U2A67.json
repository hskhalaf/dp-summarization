      "text": "I have never written a review before but Venom Sports and their customer service compelled me to write one. I ordered a Large and it was not tight enough (order one size smaller than measured) and I contact Venom to exchange the product. They replied immediately and they did not have a Medium in stock and told me to keep my Large and they would send me the Medium free once it was back in stock. Sure enough 2 weeks later as described they sent me the other brace free. Fits great, feels great and I cannot state how amazing the customer service is with this company.",

      "text": "Disclaimer: Venom nor Amazon in no way influenced nor offered me any compensation or incentives whatsoever! Just received this awesome, well made elbow brace/sleeve. Nothing like the old, geriatric looking elbow braces from the 80s, 90s and early 2000s. Only problem was that a I ordered the wrong size due to the fact that instead of using a \"Tailoring measuring tape\"(which I do not own), I used a \"Kobalt\" regular retractable measuring tape (foolish me, I tried to be \"Mcguyver\"). Anyway, I can tell and assume that this sleeve/brace is going to be amazing in reducing my tendinitis during my gym workouts! Thank you Amazon, and thank you Venom sports/Fitness for having this product.",

I will be ordering some of their knee braces soon. Thank you Venom for such a great brace!",
