I now have a $400 bike too dangerous to ride until I can get the brakes totally replaced. Super.",

Not ideal for that much gravel, or if it gets loose, but it does fine. I'm very happy and would highly recommend it, especially if you're only riding on the street OR want a bike that's easy to transport or carry up/down stairs.",

It appears the instructions were a general, blanket instruction sheet not specific to the bike! We found the same exact instruction card was included with my husband's bike which was a completely different model. We were able to solve the problem after watching an assembly video on their website. I highly recommend searching for this video so you know what to do!",

I have not ridden in years, and after I bought this bike, I started riding 4-5 miles a day without feeling any discomfort. My husband assembled the bike, and even though the instructions were for a different bike, and he has never assembled bikes before, he managed to figure it out and assembled it in about 40 minutes. I am 5'1\" and the seat of the bike can be adjusted for someone even shorter. I have my seat set a few inches taller than the lowest setting. Sixthreezero was very responsive when I called them with some questions before buying.",

How wrong she was, now opts to cycle to work everyday. Not only is it a thing of beauty to look at but also incredibly well designed ergonomically. The upright cycling position eliminates lower back pain and the curled handlebars ensure a comfortable journey. The little touches like the handlebar grips are built to a high quality and she regularly receives compliments on her new bike. The team at Sixthreezero are incredibly helpful and made the whole process seamless. Absolutely recommend.",

It has easily fit on my bike rack that straps to the back of my car. I'm always getting compliments of how cute my bike is and how smooth it is to ride. I have had no problems with this bike and I would recommend this company to everyone. Well worth the price!",
