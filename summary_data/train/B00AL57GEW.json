To create a more consistent experience and to make sure that no one got thwacked with an errant rubber band, I chopped up some 2x4's and created this frame for it. If you were playing on a beach, maybe you don't want the frame, but with many people of many sizes, the frame made it even better. I don't know if the balloons went 300 yards, but they sure flew halfway down the block. Everyone loved this thing. I'd recommend without any reservations.",

We started with launching water balloons but quickly moved on to golf balls in order to see how far we could launch something. I think we went well over 300yds with the golf balls. As far as \"accuracy\", you're not going to be driving tacks and hitting consistent targets or anything, but it's somewhat accurate in regard to aiming at a general direction. Overall this was an incredibly fun purchase and I would highly recommend it for anyone living in a rural setting!",

Then we pulled out the old garden tomatoes and these would easily go 200'-300' without any problem. Soooo much fun! Can't wait to try it out this summer on rafters and tubers on the river.",

We consistently were shooting it about a good 150+ yards with three adults a decent sized water balloons. to get to 300 yards, you would need to use smaller balloons as the larger they are the shorter the distance it will go.

(tip: make small water balloons with the included balloons) The kids wore the dogs out launching tennis balls. Excellent product!",

We had it set up at home plate of a baseball diamond, shooting at targets on the bases and it was great, we were able to launch water balloons over the outfield fence with some pretty good accuracy too. Really fun, would highly recommend. I will say that the free balloons that came with it did not hold up well as it got warmer outside, but we had our own so it was not a big deal.",

The launcher is durable and has a lot of power behind it. We tested it with launching balloons, tennis balls, foam balls, dodge balls, golf balls, and other items. The golf ball is certainly the most dangerous. Over all its durable, easy to use, and works great! I would recommend it to anyone asking.",
