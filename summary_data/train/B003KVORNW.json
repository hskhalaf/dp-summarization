He got spooked and I FLEW off, landed on my right hip and SLAMMED my head back onto very dry, rocky soil. My head actually hit two rocks so hard it chipped the coating on this helmet. Here's the best part: ZERO head trauma or pain afterwards! (My back was totally out of whack, but my head was 100% PROTECTED!) This is the BEST HELMET you can buy! I'm about to purchase another one.",

I have a small, oval face and this helmet (like most) looked like an oversized pail on my head. I think the black/brown color combo was very nice. I did return it because I want a well fitting helmet. I don't want to wear one, but I know I should. I did try on two different Ovation helmets and 1 of 3 did fit in the S/M size - so sizing varies from one to another.... thankfully Amazon allows us to return easily.",

Tried this helmet for less than $80 and love it. Can't believe what a difference! It fits me so well and is so comfortable.",

It seems like the connecting part was very flimsy. My boyfriend was able to fix it for me and it held up fine on my ride yesterday. Other than that, the helmet is perfect.

The dial does not dig into your head or anything - I didn't even notice it at all after making the adjustment. Rode with it recently on a 90 degree+ day with high humidity and did not get hot! I have a Troxel and Tipperary helmet as well and this Ovation is by far my favorite.",
