This one is a solid construction without large amounts of plastic. As others have noted, it does best mounted to a bench or some other platform. I use it unmounted, but it does require support to ensure it doesn't fall over during use. Capping can be a top-heavy experience. Without careful support, the capper can tip over. This isn't a showstopper in terms of use. I'm happy with this capper even when it's unmounted. It just requires some careful attention when capping.",

The Colt does a good job of capping bottles, but the user should be prepared to pull down very hard on the lever when capping.

I am sure that you will get the same result if you mount the capper on a work table.",

I've wrapped the tip of the handle with foam I had laying around. Now I can't store it locked in the upright position because of the foam!

    "description": "Colt Bench Capper Solid construction sets this bench capper apart from the competition. This capper has a heavy duty machined (not crimped) zinc crimping cap, weld reinforced shaft, and is fully adjustable using its new trigger adjustments. Unlike some less expensive models of bench capper, this item is intended for long term use and high output operations. Accommodates bottles from 4\" to 12\" tall including most American champagne bottles. Made in Italy. Note: This capper fits 26mm American bottle caps only, and will not fit larger 29 and 31mm European caps (the optional crimping cups for the other bench cappers do not fit this model)",
