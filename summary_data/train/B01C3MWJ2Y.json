The brushes are soft and have lasted a while, but the wood is not the best, it cracked on the bottom and the paint started to chip. They are still useable though. Also, one of them came apart in the first couple of months. I glued it back together and it\u2019s fine but you know not ideal. All in all, they are good brushes and after two years still in good enough shape and soft.",

      "text": "I just recently started doing more thorough makeup, and hence why i wanted some nice brushes, so I cant tell if they are fake or not by the labels on the brushes, as one person said. On first examination, they seem very soft and real, but also have a very strong paint-like smell, but after reading other reviews on genuine Morphe brush sets, it is the smell of the plastic-y brush holder, not the brushes themselves. But thr smell is SO strong, it makes all the brushes smell like it, they need to air out to smell clean. Other than the smell, though, they seem fine, SUPER soft, and compared to reviews of real Morphe sets it seems pretty real.",

For those doubting the authenticity, the vegan set does not have numbers on it if you look it up online (I'm almost positive that all of the sets do not have numbers- just the individual brushes). However, they all have the Morphe \"logo\" on them. It comes with a cute case that is great for traveling as well! My only complaint would be the color- I wish they weren't as bright and that they would come out with this set in black (they do have another vegan set in black, but it is $50+). Great purchase overall!",
