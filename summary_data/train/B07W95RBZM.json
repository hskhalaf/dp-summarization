Probably not a speaker problem but a Sonos programming problem that is not yet sorted out. I was hoping for a better outcome with the new app. Nope. It\u2019s a shame because we really enjoy the rest of our system and would love for the Move to perform without these issues.",

I was very disappointed to learn the Move did not take advantage of SonosNet.

      "text": "Very familiar with Sonos products and always hoped they would make a waterproof/shatter proof speaker. As soon as I saw this one I was sold! and they did not disappoint!! The sound quality is amazing and the fact that it\u2019s lightweight and portable makes it\u2019s that much better!!!! This one speaker will easily carry sound throughout an entire room or area you want to play sound!!!! Well worth every penny!!",
