It will shoot up and out the water like a cannon (and might, um, hit the instructor in the face). My final product review.. I LOVE THEM. you'll feel it the next day.. for sure.",

They provide a good amount of resistance for most participants. The handles are lightly padded which makes gripping them a little easier.

One cap came off while my mom was using them and the weights flew up out of the water and almost hit her in the head! Not the best design/construction. Ended up having to glue the ends on ourselves. It\u2019s never fun when you almost immediately have to fix a product you\u2019ve bought. So other than the end caps not staying on we really do enjoy these weights and still recommend them. I\u2019m hoping we just got a faulty one and this isn\u2019t the norm.....",
