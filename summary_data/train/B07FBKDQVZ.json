These fit poorly, some stitching or seamwork or whatever the hell it is dig into my feet at odd places, there's a ton of discomfort on either end of the toebox, and this all came crashing down a few hours into wearing, which of course is after you can return them. It's a shoddy shoe, and I wish I never bought them because I can't wear them comfortably.",
