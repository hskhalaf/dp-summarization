      "text": "Bought this as a birthday present for my wife as her Canon lasted 3 months before giving up with a lens error. Apparently it is a usual complaint that Canon refuse to deal with or even honour their guarantee. I am a long time Olympus buyer/user and trust their good name and excellent lens optical quality. The functions on this camera are brilliant and everything can be fully controlled from an Android smartphone. We both own DSLRs but usually have a 'carry everywhere' pocket superzoom camera. I have a 6 year old Fujifilm F300EXR (the only other camera name I trust) but if I ever need to upgrade then I will buy one of these for myself.",

I should had been suspicious when normally there would be a hands on reviews before the official release. I wasn't able to find one anywhere. These picture was just my dog sitting around. In fact, I didn't take any action shots. These were basic still shots. My old Canon G12 took better picture with less blur. For now on, I sticking to Canon and no more Olympus for me.",

    "description": "Advanced Movie mode (high-speed movies & photo in movie capture)\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\n\nELEGANCE IN MOTION\nA sleek, premium design inspired by classic Olympus PEN cameras. Advanced technology adapted from the award-winning OM-D series. And the first-ever 5-axis image stabilization system for both video and stills in a compact camera. Though conveniently small in size, the new SH-1 looms large, offering an unsurpassed array of technical features: 24x wide angle optical zoom (25-600mm equivalent); built-in WiFi; robust video recording capabilities (including a new Time-Lapse Movie feature); FAST AF technology; and a variety of creative control options.\n\nSharper Stills and Video with 5-axis IS\nOlympus has incorporated its most sophisticated image stabilization technology into the SH-1 \u2013 the world\u2019s first* compact camera with 5-axis IS for still photographs as well as video (the IS performance of the SH-1 in video mode is superior to that of a digital camcorder). Enjoy the sharpness of blur-free images whether you\u2019re using the 24x zoom to zero in on wildlife or shooting movies of your kids out on the soccer pitch. *As of March 31, 2014; based on Olympus research\n\nThe Smarter, Connected Compact\nThe SH-1 is designed to fit seamlessly into your digital lifestyle. WiFi is built right into the camera; with the Olympus Image Share app on your smart device, you can share your latest creative endeavors by simply pressing a button. You can also use your device to control the camera remotely \u2013 zoom in and out, select shooting and drive modes, adjust exposure and autofocus, trip the shutter \u2013 which is handy for group shots and \u201csneaking up\u201d on wildlife. You can even geotag your photos with location information using the app and your device\u2019s GPS.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Video Capabilities\nWith the SH-1, you\u2019ll no longer need to carry around a camcorder! This camera shoots Full HD 60p video for smoother action sequences, as well as high-speed footage (120 fps in HD) that you can replay in slow motion for very cool effects. The Photo & Movie Capture feature allows you to simultaneously freeze action in full-res still photos while recording HD video. And with Time-Lapse Movie, you can compress up to five hours of action into a 20-second movie.\n\n\n\n\n\nSophisticated AF Features and Interval Shooting\nGetting sharp images of moving subjects is no problem thanks to the SH-1\u2019s touch-screen shutter operation, super high-speed FAST AF technology and ability to fire off up to 11 frames per second in full resolution. Interval Shooting is another tool for channeling your creativity; you can select any number of frames from 1 to 99, establish intervals from 10 seconds to an hour and set the timer at up to 60 minutes \u2013 great for changing weather, flower blooming and other fixed-point observations of movement.\n\nGo Old School with Manual Controls\nThe many automatic features of the SH-1 make it easy to take great photos and video. But sometimes you want to take matters into your own hands and apply your knowledge of just how a camera works. The SH-1\u2019s Manual Exposure mode lets you do just that; you can customize ISO, shutter speed and aperture settings to achieve the specific effects you envision, and check out the results on the LCD monitor before you snap the shutter. You can also use Live Guide to adjust color and brightness on the fly.\n\nOlympus iHS Technology \u2013 Intelligent High Speed\nAll the bells and whistles in the world don\u2019t matter if a camera doesn\u2019t have the right \u201cguts.\u201d The SH-1 most definitely does, sporting Olympus\u2019s best-in-class 16-megapixel BSI CMOS sensor and the same TruePic VII image processor found on the acclaimed OM-D series cameras. This killer combo powers the camera\u2019s enhanced Intelligent Auto \u2013 which recognizes subject matter and chooses the right settings almost instantaneously \u2013 and high-speed autofocus, enabling you to get the shots you want, when you want them.\n\nThe Photos Are Only the Beginning\nClear, sharp, colorful images are great \u2013 but sometimes you want to mess around with them a little bit. The SH-1 makes doing so easy thanks to eleven in-camera Art Filters that you can apply for effects like Pin Hole, Grainy Film and Soft Focus \u2013 no computer required! Another creative tool is Photo Story, which allows you to create a multi-perspective narrative within a single image \u2013 for example, an establishing shot and several close-ups; multiple templates are available for you to experiment with.",
