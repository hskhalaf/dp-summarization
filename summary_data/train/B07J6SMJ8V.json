It felt solid and nice but without a dedicated video card (which I was willing to go without) and then an issue that doesn't seem that rare, I can't see myself recommending this laptop. Shame as it looked and felt great (although it did get very hot when charging). I'm the end I got the refund and purchased a different laptop of similar size and features and I feel much better about my purchase.",

It's definitely a brilliant laptop that's worth the money. I just wish that there was an option so that only the pen that's in the box works with the touch screen and not your fingers as it's really easy to accidentally press something you're not meant to. All in all, I'm happy.",
