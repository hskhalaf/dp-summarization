Collar is strong in feel and looks great. Leash doesn't twist on itself as others do, feels strong enough for heavy pulling lunges, and dog seems to prefer it over others. For added safety I did reinforce connection points with securing tape as I do with all leashes.",

So knowing they will stand behind their product like that, I am updating my review from 4/5 stars to 5/5 stars! ------------------------------------------------------------------------ ORIGINAL: Really sturdy, thick collar. Has worked great. Only complaint is that the little plastic piece that holds the tags did break off after a few months, but I just looped the tags through the plastic buckle instead. Gets 4/5 stars for that and just for the color selection. I only had a few colors to choose from and I kind of had to settle.",

I have tried all different collars and these are my favorites. I also really like the colors. We purchased the orange, purple and blue.",

The guys from Phydeaux's sent me a replacement and sure enough it has been great. Very strong and no threading issues. I like the tags only ring and seperate leash ring.

The Med size works, but we have to make it as small as possible and that makes the collar doubled on most of the collar. Other than that- we love everything about it. Especially the D ring attachment. I wish all collars were made like this.",
