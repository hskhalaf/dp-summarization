Since it's a USB pass-through, it's not just a display and it must handle things other than just pushing pixels to a screen. The box is like a tiny, specialized PC. Unfortunately, that PC sometimes crashes and when that happens, the whole monitor goes black and then starts back up with the \"Dell\" logo. Sometimes I can go a whole day without this happening. More often, it happens once every couple of hours. It's infuriating!",

That said, it's covered under the Dell manufacturer warranty, so I should be getting a replacement. Hopefully the next one lasts.",

Has a couple of USB ports on the back that make up for the new MacBook's lack thereof. Also doesn't seem to encounter the internet connectivity issues experienced with other USB adapters. Only shortcomings are inability to adjust height (I just put a large book under) and no speakers. Neither of these were a big deal to me. Highly recommended.",
