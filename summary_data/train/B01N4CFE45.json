I\u2019m super impressed, when we do the other rooms in our house I will definitely be purchasing from this brand. We have textured walls which I don\u2019t like so I read that this matte paint would be best, and it is, unless you\u2019re really looking, the walls don\u2019t look as textured as they did before, which is what I was hoping.",

As a first time painter, I really had no idea what I was doing. One thing I learned (from the Internet) is to be very careful with the rollers/brushes used as that can impact the way the paint looks on your wall. Go with quality rollers. Anyway, I'm super happy I chose this color and this brand.",
