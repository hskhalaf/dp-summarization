My only issue is that it is VERY easy for the pens and stamp pad to cause mold. It had to air out, with the stamp pad left out of the case, overnight. Even after taking care to avoid it, it still became an isdue. Have to be very mindful. Outside of that avoidable issue, this is an overall great toy. Big enough for voth girls to use. I have decided to gift one to my nephew for his upcoming 4th birthday.",

I used velcro strips to hang it - it would have been great if the hanging hooks came with 3M strips instead. But it's such a low-stress drawing toy. No worries about anything drying out (except the drawing itself - there's not much time to make anything too complex before it disappears.)",

I got this set up for him as soon as it came and he played with it for a few hours. Everything seems sturdy .. as long as he\u2019s supervised because he\u2019s rough on everything. Definitely buying this as gifts for nieces and nephews!",

It is perfect though for my one and two year old girls. Heck, even me! \ud83d\ude04",
