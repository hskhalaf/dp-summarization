After watching numerous YouTube videos and reviews, I ordered the Shimano SH-56 SPD cleat set and the Shimano PD-M520L Clipless Bike Pedals 9/16in. plus a pair of Shimano shoes that accept cleats. Local bike shop installed everything for $10. First time out was easy to clip in and out without any problems. Just be sure to set the pedals to the low force setting. A great system which adds a lot more power and enjoyment to cycling. Highly recommended.",

Highly recommended, looking forward to many miles on these.",

The Looks are great but with those cleats it is tough to walk in them and doing so in gravel really messes them up.
