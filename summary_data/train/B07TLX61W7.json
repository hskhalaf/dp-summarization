The sound is amazing and you can play with the Equalizer to do what you want. The Logitech software is really a must here as you can download profile to match game that you play. I used to struggle to hear steps in COD Warfare/Warzone. Not anymore ! This is a game changer. The blue voice feature is also great and again with the Logitech software, you an play and make your voice differnt. perfect for Streamer or video content creator",

It sounds like you are in a cave, the surround sound really isnt surround at all. Footsteps behind you sound as if they are beside you, the rear surround sound is shocking. Maybe its the g pro suit software, but in my humble opinion, i sent for a return and went back to using my logitech g430's instead. At least with those i can hear a fly fart across the map in the future. I am really disappointed with this headset.",

Can't get a replacement even though i clearly hear more out of the right ear than i do the left ear... ridiculous. That's why this is a 1 star review, why would the return window close on the same day i bought it. Edit - I got my return, thank you Amazon for the amazing customer service. This headset works just as it should now, which is amazing. The surround is fantastic and the audio quality is even better than the last pair. You guys did good.",

However this product is completely let down by the fact that the microphone just doesn't work, and certainly doesn't plug and play. It won't work on its own or with the gHub software downloaded. I put two working days into trying to fix the problem, rolling back drivers etc. but no luck at all. I just can't invest any more time into this. I can tell from many similar online comments that this is a widely recognised product defect, and I await the next generation of this otherwise excellent headset, but for now I am returning it for a refund.",

The microphone functionality is the best I've seen on a headset and the software in G Hub lets you customise anything you want Only issue I had which stops me from giving a 5* review is that the sound seems quiet even when at 100% maxed out volume. Some other friends with this headset did not feel the same way and said they use theirs at around 70% volume and it's loud enough but from others I've heard the same issue as mine so not too sure",

I only wish you could push the microphone out the way instead of it always being in front of you.",

Surround sound is also great, so use the logitech software even though its plug and play which is also a W. best headset i ever bought, to be honest. Also great value for money.",

The initial setup took me about 2 hours of installing, reinstalling and restarting my PC. This is the only reason why this is four stars. The custom equaliser in the G Hub has very good sound reproduction, the different sound profiles for each game are very useful. The community share feature is great for downloading and sharing your own settings. Great headset, very comfortable with tonnes of padding, 7.1 surround sound for gaming which is the best surround sound i have used on any pair of headphones before. Would highly reccomend.",

Other than that they're good for their price, great surround sound, good comfort(mild clamp). Music is ok on them but they're for games. The G-Hub app with sound and mic presets with the USB DAC driver is what makes these so good. Mic quality with a good sound EQ with presets you can download make these probably the best headphones for playing games while on discord.",
