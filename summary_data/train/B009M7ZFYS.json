      "text": "This plunger is so expensive but after buying 4 other toilet plungers that took 20 minutes or longer to work or simply stopped working at all, I'm not mad at it. Granted, the higher price is probably because of the caddy (which is a nice touch) but even without the caddy I would still pay the price for this. It is the ONLY plunger that has worked with three different types of toilets and will not break down. It's super strong and sturdy and unclogs toilets in less than a couple of minutes! On top of that, it just looks nice. As long as quality stays the same, I will never buy another plunger again.",

The plunger doesn't fit in the toilet to create a seal which you need for plunging. The shape of the rubber doesn't match up with the shape of the toilet. I'm searching for another plunger as we speak. Had to get a snake to unclog the darn toilet.",

Its not too stiff, making it hard to get a good seal, or too soft, making it to do the job. It really is just right. That said, you have to know how to plunge properly with the right amount of force, while working it to get the optimal seal. It takes a bit of a knack, but really works much better than any other plunger out there. I was a plumber/ pipefitter for many years, and I know this to be true!!",
