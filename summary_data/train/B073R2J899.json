I bought the 14 Piece Bar Kit for my partner (a professional bartender), and might buy myself the same kit. Everything arrived on-time, in great condition, exactly as described and depicted. The only aspect that could be improved, in my opinion, is not with the seller or product - but rather - more of a personal idiosyncrasy and preference: I prefer a graduated jigger with 1/4 oz gradations, but I happily bought the kit with the jigger pictured and I have no complaints about the product.",

Doesn\u2019t allow for the use of the gate from the strainer but I suppose pushing the strainer to fit tight makes the spring compress allowing for a somewhat strain like as if using the gate... but still would be nice to have that option to use the gate or not... I have a feeling the Hawthorne strainer is going to bend sooner or later if I have to keep forcing it to fit the tin.",
