I have not moved it any and have only emptied the water when the indicator light was on. there is a \"clicking\" noise when attempting to turn it on and it simply will not turn on. I will not purchase this product again, as the return date was up in June, It must be cheaply made I am disappointed, and wasted my money for the small amount of time this product did work the two months that it did work.",

I only bought one because I found that it is so slow to dehumidify that it wouldn't do the job at all. It does \"work\" but it pulls the water out of the air so slowly that it really has no impact on the humidity level. This is probably only good for dehumidifying a small closet in a home that already has low humidity levels.",

I looked at a lot of dehumidifiers before buying this one and the other ones all look to have fake reviews. Many of the reviews were written the same day and sound the same. Few, if any, verified purchases. They may be fine, but I don't trust them. I've had this one several weeks and have been very happy with it.",

Other than that, no corrosion. So it's probably a cheap part from the company. At $80 that works out to $4.00 a month. I'm sure that old GE is pennies a month.

The humidity in my apartment dropped from 55-60% to now 50-55%. That 5% difference make a big difference! I now can raise the temperature from 70 degrees to 72 degrees saving money on air conditioning and I still feel more comfortable",

    "description": "This isn't a watered-down version of a bigger dehumidifier - it's a highly effective mid-size machine in its own right, built around the powerful and whisper-quiet Peltier technology. Because Peltier technology works with no moving parts, we managed to design and develop our dehumidifier as a compact appliance: small, lightweight, low on energy consumption, powerful, effective at drying up musty rooms, and, with all that, a long lifespan. Rated at being suited for spaces up to 2,200 cubic feet, our mid-size dehumidifier is the perfect tool to extract moisture and dust particles from stagnant areas and mildew- and mold-stricken rooms. From bathrooms to laundry rooms to bedrooms to antique cars to boats, it rids the air of mustiness and unpleasant odors while quietly pulling in excess humidity at a rate of up to 20 ounces per day at 86 Degree Fahrenheit and 80% relative humidity. The Ivation mid-size dehumidifier is fitted with a removable water reservoir with a capacity of two full liters. This spares you the hustle of emptying out an overflowing water tank every day, as it can hold approximately 3-days' worth of dehumidifying action. Our dehumidifier is also programmed to shut off automatically once it has reached capacity. An indicator light will go on to remind you to empty the tank out. A 12v DC power adapter is included, and power consumption peaks at 72w, making this an efficient and reliable unit with the comfortable dimensions of 81/2\" x 14\" x 63/4\".",
