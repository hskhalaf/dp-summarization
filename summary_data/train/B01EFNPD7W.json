They also are round instead of the weird triangle shape like others and cup the breast well. The straps are a bit thin and can get twisted easily while wearing, but not anything that's too annoying.",

The padding in the cups are thicker, not thin like the cheapo bras. And, the cups fully cover my breasts and I don't have to worry about them overflowing out.

Another thing i dont like is it doesnt provide much support especially when your engorged, which really sucked beause they hurt enough already. Also when I leak a little my nipples stick to the bra and thats painful as well to take it off. Regardless the bras are about 10$ Each which isnt bad when good brad are 2-3x the price.",

Couple of cons - I originally used the extension back clips but ended up using it as is because after several uses, it does lose its original stiffness/spring and loosens.

      "text": "I purchased these bras while I was pregnant with my son. I wore them before I started nursing and again when I started nursing. The quality of the fabric is good but I wish the removable cups folded better. When nursing and folding down the cups they seemed really bulky. I also noticed that they showed through many shirts. I ended up purchasing another brand of more absorbant nursing pads to place inside the bra and removed the included inserts. Overall, I've liked these bras but did need to make an additional purchase to make nursing easier. I considered purchasing the tanks they offer instead since they may serve the same function with more coverage.",

I'm really sensitive to anything tight around my ribcage, so I usually size up in the bandsize and/or use an extender. I ordered an X-Large in these bras. The cup size is a little too big (some gaping material on top), and the band--even with the extender--was a little tight at first but has stretched to feel perfect. Update: Now that I'm nursing, I fill the whole cup. Amazing bras that truly last the prenatal/postpartum divide.",

      "text": "This is a fantastic bargain. These bras are softer than the Leading Lady bras that I bought in the past for a whole lot more money. The fit is a tiny bit tight, but gives good support. The removable pads are nicely shaped, though I don't intend to use them. My only complaint is that the clips are not quite as easy to fasten as I'd like, it's hard to do them with one hand. But that's certainly not a deal breaker.",

      "title": "Good value for great comfort",
      "text": "Bought these after the birth of my 2nd daughter and while I wound up not breastfeeding, I\u2019m still wearing these bras! Pros: Super comfortable. Machine washable. Easy to adjust/remove/fix the padding when needed. Provides support without bulges, and really for about $10/bra, you can\u2019t beat the value. Cons: The pads will move around during washing, which is a minor annoyance. You will also need the pads to prevent flashing your headlights if you suddenly get chills. My bra size pre-pregnancy was about a 38DDD/F I bought the 2XL and it fits well; I could probably have gone down a size and would have been fine.",
