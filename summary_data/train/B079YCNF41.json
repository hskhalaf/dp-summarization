I read the reviews about the Mini2, said to myself let me invest a 100 bucks, am curious to try the better version of what's already good, and o'boy.. That Mini2 blew my mind away. Sound quality is second to none, the fit in the ear is even better than the Reflect Mini, it really fits like a glove (no pun intended), and when u twist it in ur ear, acts as if it has a noise cancellation - no joke! I love this Mini 2, I don't regret it a single bit, the next thing am gonna do, is post my Reflect Mini for sale hehehe.. Super highly recommended.",

I never used them in the rain, and they were never exposed to any harsh conditions. Sometimes electronics have problems, that's understood. But the JBL (Harmon) was so terrible about the support. They bounced me around the globe to different service centers with no one willing to lift a finger or deal with a faulty product. Finally I received an 80% refund from Amazon and will now buy Bose. BEWARE and DO NOT buy JBL.",

      "text": "This is a good product. It has a great battery life. The ear buds routinely hold a charge through 4-5 workouts, unlike my last pair that barely lasted through 2. The ear buds stay in the ear well during strenuous workouts. My only complaint is that the music is not very loud and the bass is lacking. The sound quality is not bad when the ear buds are pushed deeply into the ear, however they do not remain deeply embedded during the workout so you lose the bass and some of the volume when they loosen up. Overall I would recommend them for purchase unless you are looking for ear buds with loud volume and heavy bass.",

Turn on the headset and it says battery is low It won't stay on for more than a minute now. Tech support was helpful until it becomes known it's 4 months out of warranty. Coincidence? IDK.
