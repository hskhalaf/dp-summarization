It smelled just like the normal shampoo, does not turn my hands purple, lathers up very nice, and has kept the tone in my hair. If I let my hair go longer between washes without using it, I do not think it would work like Finola does, but so far it\u2019s been wonderful.",

    "description": "Size:13.5 Fl OzMore than a purple shampoo, discover the combination of pure purple pigments with a blend of fig and orchid to keep your blonde healthy and conditioned until your next salon visit. ColorLast Purple is a toning shampoo that neutralizes brass and yellow tones by depositing & nbsp; purple pigment which brings back coolness to blonde hair leaving it looking healthy and fresh. ColorLast Purple leaves hair with a silky shine and 2.5X smoother with 3X less breakage. Vegan formula and paraben free vs non-conditioning shampoo with the system of Shampoo and Conditioner no animal-derived ingredients or by-products. What is purple shampoo and how does it work? Purple shampoo is purple colored shampoo that distributes purple pigment to neutralize brassy, yellow tones. Purple is used because, if you take a look at the color wheel, it is the direct opposite color of yellow. This means purple and yellow cancels one another out. So when using purple pigment on brassy, yellow tones it color corrects your hair's hue restoring it to its former bright, cooler color.\n\nBRAND STORY\nProfessional By Nature. Honest By Choice.
