We RV travel a lot and enjoy a campfire most nights, but unfortunately there are lots of places where wood fires are banned or fire rings are not available. This is our answer to both issues...and we don't have to buy, carry or gather firewood along the way. This firepit hooks up to a standard 20-25lb LP tank, the same one we carry for our outdoor grill. Just be very careful to open the LP tank very slowly after connecting it to the firepit, or else some sort of vapor lock may occur.",

If close enough you can tell its a gas flame from the fumes as opposed to a flame from burning wood. It's not noxious but It's a trade off to not smelling like campfire afterwards. The few times I've used it and doesn't appear to be burning that much gas when using a mixture of high and low settings. I love the option of being portable.",

We took it on a camping trip this weekend and it was more economical and cleaner to use than a wood fire. No more smoke and the fire is instant.
