Turn off your EOZ air by a long press on the center of each of the buds for 3 seconds 3. long press in the center of each of the buds for 15 seconds, until you see the blue led blinking 3 times twice. 4. long press 5 seconds on each of the buds, and then press quickly 4 times on each of the buds, your earbuds should now be reset. I had to contact Amazon customer service regarding this issue, so I wish these instructions were in the manual.",

I\u2019m also using it for sport (running) and thanks to the secure over the ear, I'm not affraid to make it fall when I'm doing sport, even when I sweat.
