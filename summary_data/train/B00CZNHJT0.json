Grounds that are too loosely packed allow water to pass through too quickly without extracting any flavor from the Coffee. The dual-sided tamper compresses ground espresso into a densely compacted, evenly dispersed puck. The pressurized water then flows more slowly for the richest, most robust extraction possible. It also creates a necessary gap between the top of the grounds and the water disbursement screen so the dampened grounds don\u2019t Swell to clog The water flow for a silty mess. Dual ends (milliliters and milliliters) fit most portafilter baskets and the 4-ounce weight assists in the tamping process for an effortless preparation. Made from Heavyweight Aluminum, it resists damage caused by the naturally occurring acids found in Coffee. Sturdy and durable. Hand wash in warm, soapy water.",
