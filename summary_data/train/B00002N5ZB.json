Once I opened the box I immediately noticed chunks of the plastic around the top of the fan were missing and nowhere to be found within the box. The fan's power was very underwhelming. I quickly returned it and got a different Lasko fan called the \"Cyclone\" of much higher quality. It even included a remote and timer! Highly recommend their Cyclone as opposed to this fan. For only $10 more, the difference in quality is incredible. Their Wind Machine should be taken off the market.",

We are using it outdoors on our screened porch as there is not much breeze there. We like that the fan can be tilted up or down to blow comfortable air where we want it. It blows a very quiet, comfortable air on the low setting. I gave it 4 stars since it is a fan, and some noise is expected. We Ordered this on a Thursday, but it did not arrive until Monday although we were assured one-day\u200b shipping.",

This pushes a lot of air, and I've been happy so far with its performance. Honestly, though, I have no idea if it will last (I've recently had two HW fans die at around 14 to 18 months, so I'm trying this Lasko brand instead).",

So I needed to be cold with a comfortable sound to help distract me from everything else in the house and it works! I slept for the first time comfortably in months. I highly recommend this fan.",

If you're looking for a safe fan without any issues, I wouldn't buy this one. Invest in a fan with better reviews for customer service. With a product like this, it can be dangerous to use the fan anyways (little fingers etc.) so it's a big waste of money.",
