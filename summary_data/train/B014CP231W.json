When I open the second one I will let it air-out some on the patio before using it. Other than that, it's great.",

Makes you think about what kind of low quality rubber did they use to make the base of this mouse mat. I paid $8 for the mouse mat. It was a mistake. Not even worth returning.

I received it on a Friday, and by Monday it hadn't changed a bit! Its been a week and it's still a bit stinky but I hope that will go away shortly. Pros: Huge. This thing is a good size, has a good feel. stitching is great along the edges, has a good quality feel. Makes mouse movements a breeze and makes my desk look good Cons: The smell.",
