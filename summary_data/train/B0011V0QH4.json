Giovanni Eco Chic Smooth As Silk Shampoo gently cleanses dry, chemically processed hair without the use of sulfates and harsh detergents. Instead, a soothing combination of vegetable proteins and certified organic botanical extracts, including Chamomile, Aloe, Echinacea, and Apple, work together to cleanse, nourish, and deeply moisturize damaged hair. Your hair will not only be smoother and more manageable, but it will be luxuriously shiny, too! This shampoo is also ideal for washing unruly or frizzy hair without over-drying.
