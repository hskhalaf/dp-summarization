After one use, the steam rises into it making you have to clean AND dry before using it again. If not, the coffee grinds will stick to the container (see images). Also the coffee is a bit \"weak\" compared to our old coffee machine with a grinder.",

For the price, it function exceptionally well, and (unlike our Kerig, which only heats the water to 185 degrees), heats the water adequately to make very good coffee. We love being able to (very easily) set the coffee to go off at 4:00 am for our son's early morning shift--who can be awake enough at that hour to grind and brew fresh Joe?",

It is messy, has to have beans added daily, where my other machine would hold several days worth, and you can\u2019t make 12 full cups with the amount of beans the grinder holds. The other major flaw is you have to guess on the amount of beans to put in. You can\u2019t fill up the bean bin and then make a small amount of coffee. It grinds all of the beans. This coffee pot disappoints me daily and I\u2019m hoping Santa brings me my old cuisinart back. Wish I\u2019d paid more attention before ordering.

If you fill up the grinder completely and fill the pot to the max 12 cups, you end up with a weak pot of coffee. This means you would have to either use pre-ground coffee, have another grinder, or run the grinder without water in the maker, refill the grinder, then run the grinder again with water in.

While this coffee maker takes both beans and ground coffee, there is a distict (better) difference when the coffe is made by grinding the beans. The functionality is direct and simple. The coffee stays hot after brewing. I would have given it 5 stars except for the poping and sizzeling noise made by the unit while the caraf is on the warming plate. I kept going back to the unit looking for somthing wrong.",

    "description": "Style:Glass| Size:12-Cup\n\nGRIND AND BREW COFFEEMAKER\nRetire your alarm clock and wake up instead to the rich aroma of freshly ground, just brewed coffee, with the Cuisinart Grind & Brew Automatic Coffeemaker.

With streamlined European styling and a graceful carafe, it's a beautiful addition to any kitchen.\n\nA perfect addition to any modern kitchen, this 12-cup automatic coffeemaker grinds whole beans right before brewing to produce a fresh and flavorful pot of coffee.

In addition, its brew-pause function makes it possible to sneak a cup before the end of the brewing cycle. \n\nThe Grind & Brew Coffeemaker features a separate grinding assembly and filter chamber to make beans easy to add and used grounds easy to remove. A convenient \"grind off\" control turns the grinder off when preground coffee is used. \n\nSmaller amounts can be brewed without any loss of flavor thanks to the units 1- to 4-cup setting. For added convenience, the coffeemaker provides a large control panel, adjustable automatic shut-off from zero to four hours, and a 12-cup (5 ounces each) glass carafe with a generous stay-cool handle and drip-free pouring spout. \n\nAccessories include a gold-tone commercial-style permanent filter and a charcoal water filter for removing impurities.

The quality of that water is as important as the quality of your coffee. If water doesn't taste good from the tap, it won't taste good in your coffee. That's why Cuisinart has added a water filter to the Grind & Brew Coffeemaker. The charcoal filter removes chlorine, bad tastes, and odors, for the purest coffee flavor, every time you brew. \n\nElement 2: Coffee\nWhile coffee is 98% water, all of the flavor comes from the beans. To achieve the same great taste you enjoy at a coffee bar, you need to use the same quality of coffee. \n\nBuy the beans fresh and whole, only about two weeks' supply at a time for maximum freshness. Once the coffee bean is broken, its flavor degrades very quickly. That's why the Grind & Brew grinds your coffee just prior to brewing. If it is not practical to buy small supplies, separate larger amounts of beans into one to two week portions immediately after purchase, and freeze them in airtight containers. \n\nThe best way to maximize freshness is to minimize exposure to air, light, and moisture. So, once beans have been removed from the freezer, maintain them in a sealed container at room temperature, since damaging condensation occurs every time the beans are removed from the freezer or refrigerator. Note that some coffee experts advise against freezing dark-roast beans, because freezing can cause the oils to coagulate. Other experts disagree. We suggest you experiment and decide for yourself.\n\nElement 3: Grind\nThe grind is critical for proper flavor extraction. If the grind is too fine, over-extraction and bitterness will result. Too fine a grind may also clog the filter. If grind is too coarse, the water will pass through too quickly and the maximum flavor will not be extracted. The Grind & Brew is preset for a medium grind, the optimal grind for this type of coffeemaker. \n\nElement 4: Proportion\nCoffee that is too strong or too weak is always a disappointment. Follow the recommended portions of ground coffee in the instructions included with every Grind & Brew, and later adjust the amount to suit your taste. The Grind & Brew makes up to twelve (12) 5-ounce cups of coffee",
