I planned to use the bassinet in our bedroom for the first few months before transitioning to her crib. During her first two weeks, our baby rolled to her side while sleeping. The bassinet sides are mesh, but a considerable portion of the head and foot area is solid material. I worried that she would suffocate if she rolled to her side and therefore could not continue to use the bassinet. I wish the mesh portion of the bassinet sides continued around the entire wall.",

Our baby is 2 months, and is tall for her age- but is about to size out of this already! We will store it in case we have another one- it really was a lifesaver.",
