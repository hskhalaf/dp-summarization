Unless you purchased extra protection the warranty states they will repair or replace at your expense to ship....it has gone to the garbage pit and my rice cooker steams. I do not recommend.

The steamer also has a delay timer that comes in handy when you want to get everything ready but need to delay cooking for 30 minutes or more. Because the bottoms of each basket are removable, the steamer can be used as a single basket steamer if desired as well.",

Although I liked how it worked, it has no knob on the cover to remove it and caused me a first degree burn on the inside of my wrist to elbow. I chose the Hamilton Beach steamer for cover and removable bottoms that allow items to stand up while cooking. I also like that both bottoms offer more eggs for steaming",

The sensor was clearly broken and once the \"Low\" water sign lights up it stops the timer and stop steaming. Threw away the box and I'm certainly not going to pay more money to package it and return it. DO NOT BUY WASTER OF MONEY.",
