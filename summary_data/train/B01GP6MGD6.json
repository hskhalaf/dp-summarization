      "text": "I waited until I finished the bottle to write a review about it. The shampoo does smells very nice, it does leave my hair clean and not oily/greasy or too dry its right there in the sweet spot and it does help with volume. As a shampoo it is indeed a very good shampoo, now for the hair regrowth part I'm not so sure about it. Used it daily for over a month and couldn't note any difference in terms of hair loss or hair regrowth. Perhaps it didn't work for me.",

I'll keep buying it, especially now that my girlfriend is using it too..",

One downside is that it doesn't lather as well since it's sulfate free but what I do is completely wet my hair and lather up the shampoo with water before applying to my scalp. I am using this every other day! Hopefully it helps promote some hair growth!",

    "description": "Whether you\u2019re male or female, noticeable hair loss is upsetting. ArtNaturals Argan Oil Shampoo Hair Growth Therapy can help. Infused with regenerative argan oil, aloe vera, white willow bark, burdock root, rosemary, and thyme, this shampoo stimulates cell renewal and healthy growth as it revitalizes hair follicles and supports a healthy scalp. Thicker, shinier hair returns!\n\nOur hair loss shampoo fights male pattern baldness with natural, botanical oils and extracts. It aids in restoring thinning and dull hair, and helps prevent further hair loss. You\u2019ll add volume and texture while revving your scalp and hair follicles back to younger days.\n\nA major cause of hair loss is the body\u2019s production of \u201cdihydrotestosterone,\u201d or DHT. This androgen causes hair loss by cutting off the blood supply to hair follicles. They eventually die\u2014and hair falls out. ArtNaturals Argan Oil Shampoo Hair Growth Therapy contains multiple DHT blockers that help prevent this damage and loss.\n\nOne of these is caffeine. Studies have shown that caffeine is an effective stimulant of the hair shaft, and that used on scalp and hair, aids in faster growth. Then, the botanical oils and extracts go to work to hydrate, smooth and sooth hair.\n\nArgan oil, pressed from the nut of the Moroccan argan tree, is often called \u201cliquid gold,\u201d and is worth its weight hair care gold as it is chockfull of fatty acids and Vitamin E. Add to that the cooling and anti-inflammatory properties of white willow bark, the iron, potassium, and amino acid of burdock root, and the proteins from wheat, oat and quinoa found in ArtNaturals Argan Oil Shampoo Hair Growth Therapy\u2014and you\u2019re ready to wash, dry and start being happier with your healthier, thicker hair.",
