The handles are NOT in between the pads they are on the ends. If you are looking for a high quality mat this one is great and reasonably priced.",

They leave the mat folded and as the child gets better unfolds the mat one layer at a time til the child can do it in the ground. The only thing I will say is when she's barefoot she slips on the mat while doing the back bend .... so we will be looking for no skid socks ....other than that it's great. And I expected it would be a little slick so no worries",

We already had a smaller 4-panel mat, but it does not fold properly to carry by handle and had a much higher price than this mat. Would definitely buy this mat and from this seller again.",

They not only use it as a mat for tumbling and such but also as walls, forts, tents, and anything else their imaginations can come up with. The only slight downside is that this will slip on hard surfaces so just be aware. You can get a non slip rug pad if this is an issue.",
