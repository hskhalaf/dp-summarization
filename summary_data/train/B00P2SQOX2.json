      "verdict": "Keds Champion Chambray is bundled up with a soft-toned fabric, nearly resembling muted denim. It\u2019s teeming with comfort rewards coming from its breathable cover, lightweight body, and slightly cushioned footbed. In terms of sizing, this low-top sneaker tends to exceed one\u2019s typical shoe length. However, it can be fixed by either sizing down by half or wearing thick socks. Even so, this Chambray bundle, a lovely offspring of the Keds Champion, embodies a positive vibe that leaves its wearers beaming in bliss inside and out.",
      "pros": [
        "The Keds Champion Chambray provides an adequate arch support that keeps the feet from getting sored quickly, as declared by several users",
        "Some narrow footed users who opted not to size down said that having a large width allowed them to enjoy wearing this shoe for long hours",
        "The chambray fabric is thick enough to last a long time but not too stiff that it becomes",
        "The Chambray gray colorway looks great with jeans",
        "The colors match perfectly with almost any spring and summer wardrobe, according to many users",
        "Expect to get compliments wearing this shoe as it makes the feet divine with its slim profile, as stressed by numerous users",
        "A type of cut and style that never goes out of fashion, as declared by loyal Keds followers",
        "The Champion Chambray is versatile enough that it is an ideal go-to choice for leisurely city traveling",
        "A preferred shoe to slip on with any clothes for short errands, described by some buyers",
        "Very lightweight and it isn\u2019t bulky, affirmed by many",
        "The price is reasonable that several buyers went purchasing additional pairs in different shades",
        "The feet do not feel constricted with its closed toe structure"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "This sneaker seems to be half size larger than one\u2019s typical shoe length, noted by quite a lot of reviewers",
        "In spite of its comfort advantages, one user stated that it isn\u2019t the type of shoe for long days\u2019 work or all-day walking",
        "One reviewer realized too late that this sneaker needed a little break in time using thick socks which could have prevented her pinky toes from getting blistered"

      "text": "My daughter loves these shoes! Such cute Keds! Keds are not meant to be shoes with huge arch support. They are meant to be cute, versatile, and fun footwear. This pair really fits the bill! The color will match almost anything in your spring or summer wardrobe. The chambray is thick enough to last without being so thick it would be uncomfortable. They are the quality you expect from Keds. They definitely fit on the narrower side of normal rather than the wide side. I would not recommend these shoes if you normally wear a wide width shoe. Super cute!",
