      "text": "Some reviewers have mentioned that if your cat pees over the side of the litter box and onto the floor of the \"pet house,\" it gradually breaks down the wood and destroys the structure. This happened to the first one of these I bought. I've bought a replacement, and this time I've been taping three sides of the litter bag up on the inside of the house using masking tape (see photo, the masking tape is blue). Since the cats seem to always pee facing out of the pet house, this prevents the urine from going over the side of the litter box. Thus far, the wooden floor of the structure has remained urine free.",

The litter flies everywhere without a cover on the pan. You can't use a deeper pan because it will be too high on the door opening, and the cat won't be able to get in or out. My only option is to use the cabinet for storage and go back to the covered litter pan. Really a disappointment.",

No problems at all with either using it, in fact, they seem to like it. Assembly was simple, took about 15 min. Similar to IKEA set up and quality.",

If you were able to cut the box any lower it simply wouldn\u2019t hold any litter. It makes no sense and it doesn\u2019t look very nice. But the cat can get in and out now so it works.

The quality is no where near worth the cost and as the pictures show, it arrived with several dings and dents. It\u2019s too short to even consider using the towel rack and the door sits too low for the box to look correct inside. I\u2019m only giving it 2 stars for the reason that it is at least functional and hides my cat box from the side. There\u2019s no way this could ever be worth the almost $100 the company has been asking for it; I\u2019m kind of peeved I even paid $45; it\u2019s definitely not worth it.",

I'm also able to put things (e.g. laundry basket) on top of it which I was not able to before. I don't like the fact that the cat walks straight out of the kitty litter onto the floor, but products that address this were too large for the space. Litter that falls out of the litter box can slide out under the door. It would be better if there was a lip to prevent that. Overall, I like the product and would buy it again.",
