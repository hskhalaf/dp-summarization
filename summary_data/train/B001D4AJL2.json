I took off the cover and used the thin batting as a pattern to cut another pad out of heat resistant batting (the kind used for potholders). With both pads in place, it works great for my sewing and quilting projects.",

The cover is way way too thin and unless you want to scorch what you are pressing you had better put quilt batting underneath. IKEA has a better product for less cost. This board is adequate but just some design flaws. It folds very easily and is easy to hang in a closet.",

Will need to buy a replacement pad of better quality; ironing on this surface with press the mesh imprint into your clothes. Other than that, the general overall quality seems serviceable for light ironing needs.",
