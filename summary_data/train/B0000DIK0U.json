      "text": "Just bought my second Sony 400 disc player because the first one is nearing capacity. Works great no problems. Other reviewers have not liked the disc explorer. It works very well for me. Plug in a computer keyboard and enter titles and a still picture from the movie, use the up and down buttons on the remote to scroll quickly through index. I like it.",

It comes close to being as essential as my Tivo for me, and it wasn't even my idea to get it -- it was my husband who wanted this gadget. One caveat -- I almost never use the Sony menu system. We have a Harmony 688 remote so we use the Media button there to store and select our titles. Love it!",

    "title": "Sony DVP-CX985V 400 Disc Progressive DVD / SACD Player",
    "description": "Progressive-scan DVD player, compatible with DVD-RW/-R, DVD+RW/+R, SACD (Super Audio CD), and CD-R/RW discs with CD and MP3 audio.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nStore your collection of DVD movies and audio CDs in Sony's DVP-CX985V progressive-scan DVD/SACD player, and they'll just be ready for playback at a moment's notice. The DVP-CX985V multiformat mega-changer stores 400 discs and is compatible with DVD-RW/-R, DVD+RW/+R, SACD (Super Audio CD) multichannel discs, and CD-R/RW discs with CD and MP3 audio. \n\n Other DVD players detect image changes at the scan line level--Sony's Precision Cinema Progressive (PCP) system detects them at the pixel level. The picture is more faithful to the source--whether film or video--because separate, optimized algorithms are used to handle the differing pixel behavior. Separate algorithms are also used to process the moving and still parts of an image, resulting in sharp backgrounds with moving objects that are free from motion artifacts. \n\n The high-speed 108MHz/12-bit video D/A converter employs 4X oversampling for much more effective noise filtering. \n\n In addition to standard 2-channel CD playback, the DVP-CX985V plays 2-channel and multichannel Super Audio CDs. It reads the disc information of all the discs and loads the information into memory so that disc type, titles, and other text information can be displayed on the TV screen. \n\n It has the following video output options (with number of ports): component video (x1), S-Video (x1), composite video (x1), coaxial digital (x1), and optical digital (x1). It also has the following audio output options: analog audio (x1) and 5.1 channel (x1). \n\n Other features include: \n\n * Included remote operates the DVP-CX985V as well as a number of functions on select brands of televisions and receivers; its keys glow in the dark. \n * Instant Replay feature enables you to go back 10 seconds to review a scene with a single press of a button. \n * TV Virtual Surround feature generates a convincing surround-sound effect using only 2 stereo speakers. \n * Dolby Digital and DTS output. \n\n Tech Talk\n\n\n * SACD: Super Audio CD (SACD) is a high-resolution digital audio format that promises vast sonic improvements over the current audio CD format. SACD discs can be played back on dedicated SACD players or combination SACD/DVD-Video players. Certain SACD discs feature a conventional audio CD layer (hybrid SACDs) which can be played back by any CD player or computer with a CD-ROM drive. \n * Progressive scan: Also called sequential scanning, a progressive-scan system displays the entire image--providing all the horizontal lines per frame, rather than every other line--once every 60th of a second. This method reduces flicker and increases stability. Progressive-scan viewing requires a compatible digital TV. \n * Component video: Unlike a single video input, component video maintains the video signal as three separate signals through these three jacks. This connection provides optimum quality. To ensure maximum picture quality, use three video-grade cables for the Y, Pb, and Pr connections. \n\nWhat's in the Box\nSony DVP-CX985V DVD/SACD player/changer, remote control (RM-DX500), 2 AA batteries, RCA cable (57 inches), and operating instructions.",
