The holes are already in the frame, so no drilling needed. Just attached the brackets to the frame and they will hold the mattress in place.

Not a little either. I dont know if its because of the mattress cover i have on it or what. This is a big deal because i have had a spa sensations foundation that does not allow the mattress to slide. So i know its possible to make these \"non-slip\" type.

This frame arrives ready to use and was quick to setup. The under bed storage is perfect and definitely fits sterlite underneath of two shoe boxes stacked on top of each other. The only thing that others have mentioned is the spring squeak over time. It is not a permanent solution but is fitting the bill for now.",

The sturdy bed frame features a raised, rectangular-shaped design with horizontal panels and cross rows of wires that effectively support a mattress without the need for a box spring. The well-made bed frame sets up quickly and easily (no tools required), and it accommodates sleepers up to 250 pounds. Typical bed frames require a box spring and leave minimal space underneath for storage. The platform bed frame, however, offers the same comfortable crawl-into-bed height, but it doesn\u2019t require a box spring, which means a height clearance of about 13 inches underneath. Effortlessly slide boxes, storage bins, drawers, and more under the bed for easy-to-access, out-of-the-way storage space. Unlike other bed frames that can be squeaky, the AmazonBasics platform bed frame ensures quiet, noise-free support, even when rolling over from one side to the other during the night.",
