However when I put it on, the top/inside part of the shoe puts insane pressure on the outter part of my foot, like someone was driving a knife into my foot. I wore it for 10 minutes and could barely walk and when I took it off my foot was red & hurting in that area. I returned that pair thinking they might just be defective and bought 1 size bigger. But the same happened with the new pair. Very bummed because these shoes look s i c k. Maybe I just have wide feet.",
