He recommended Kenmore or Whirlpool. The installation was perfect--the installers were on time, polite, and had all of the necessary parts and expertise. Amazon is definitely the way to go when ordering appliances after you have checked them out in person and via reviews. Cheaper, faster, easier. Who knew? Thank you, Amazon and Kenmore!",

They actually wash and dry better than my full size front loading Amana 's that I had in there prior. A little pricey, but frees up so much space! I defenitely recommend if you don't have room Larger appliances.",

It is STUPID... I detached the lid mechanism so the lid stays in closed mode and taped it down. The machine is noisy and slow to respond to input. BTW it came with NO instructions or warranty. If it wasn't for the space saving aspect and the fact that all the electrical and vent connections have all been moved to accommodate this sick joke of an appliance, I would send it back.",
