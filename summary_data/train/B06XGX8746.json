The texture discrepancies are minor and with oil it should still work and should t be an issue. But for the price, these are great. I'm only starting to learn about they technique so I didn't want to really invest in something very pricey from the get go.",

The tool itself is a beautiful rose quartz and is a nice size to hold in your hand. The grooves are smooth and it feels absolutely fabulous gliding across the skin. I love it so much that I ordered one for my mom as well.",

As long as you don't expect some huge miracle change, just some soothing, relaxing relief from swollen eyes (and headaches, really helped that), I don't think you'd be disappointed with these. I'm certainly enjoying them.",
