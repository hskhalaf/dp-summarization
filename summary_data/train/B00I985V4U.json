The extra low bass and warmth that you literally feel makes this subwoofer a NEED TO HAVE item to go along with your speakers. This subwoofer is a monster in sound and in size (it's HUGE) and I can't say enough wonderful things about it. Just do yourself a favor and buy it. Don't believe me? read about it in the online audio/video forums. You really won't be disappointed!",

It has a chuffing issue in the port at low and intense frequencies which is made much worse with the fact that the cover covers both the speaker and the port. Would be nice if some how the cover was designed around the port instead of over it but I guess that wouldn't look as good. The chuffing is about 5 times worse with the cover on. You can take the cover off but then the speaker is not protected. For the price, I don't think it can be beat, however.",

Playing many different types of music, it has shown effortless, clean, well defined bass. It is capable of playing very loud bass, as well as quiet subtle bass. Can't wait to get the rest of my speakers installed! Update: I have hooked up my 7.1 surround with this sub. The sub produces bass that is present without being overwhelming. Blends perfectly with my bookshelf speakers. My room is 14x20 and the sub is a perfect size for the room. Highly recommend this subwoofer. I only wish i had bought one sooner!",

I'm happy watching movies on a 4K computer monitor, but I want to be able to experience much more out of the sound in cinema and music. I feel this subwoofer more than accomplishes this hitting the lowest of low frequencies and a powerful and tight manner. I will need to update this review as I continue to enjoy this speaker.

Sticks out from wall a good 2 feet, maybe slightly more. Has a metal front grill, which indicates to me its a well built unit. I dont have any complaints on this subwoofer, you have to ask yourself is it worth shelling out 8 hundred for a very capeable sub (SVS) or is a $300ish pretty good sub good enough (bic\"america)?",
