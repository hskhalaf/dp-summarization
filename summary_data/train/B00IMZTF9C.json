It features a waterproof membrane too, which offers plenty of protection against rain or water. More importantly, it's very supportive, which made avid hikers and outdoor nazis become even more in love with the Respond GTX.It has a pretty stiff outsole that is designed to protect the foot against really hard surfaces. Wearing a padded insole can make walking on soft soil or grass much more comfortable.",

Both these previous Meindls the most comfortable I have owned, fit my rather wide foot perfectly. Doubt I will look elsewhere in the future. These new ones look to be the same quality; Just waterproofed them and looking forward to using them first thing tomorrow morning.",

I bought them for \u2018tramping about\u2019: I do about 40 miles a week on town footpaths and country paths. (Mountain boots for the hills and mountains!) The shoes feel very steady and supportive, even over roughish ground. They are remarkably light in weight for a quality shoe. I have to use orthotic insoles: they fit a treat in these shoes. I particularly like the laces: they stay tied with just one bow, there\u2019s no need for a double bow and lots of spare lace flapping about. An excellent product.",

While the length fit of the shoe is correct, even after 2 weeks wearing them these shoes are reluctant spread and accommodate my wide foot, unlike the Merrill shoes I am used to. In addition the sole has limited cushioning compared with other shoes, making them uncomfortable to ware for long periods. And finally they don't breath, so very warm feet. In summary, poor width fitting, insufficient sole cushioning, poor breathing. Won't be buying these again.",

While some reviewers report it as having a wide fit, this was not my experience; it seems, at best, a standard fit. The main problem, and the reason that I have awarded just two stars, is that the waterproofing is ineffective; for a hiking shoe this is just unacceptable. I paid \u00a3103 for the shoes and the price has risen as high as \u00a3135 which is far too expensive and I am very disappointed.",
