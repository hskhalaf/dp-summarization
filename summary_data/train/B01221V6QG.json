Short and simple; throw out your cartridge razors and buy this. The razor is hefty and high quality steel. It doesn't feel like those cheap cartridge razors covered in plastic, it's the real deal! The shave lather smells great and feels good on the face. The actual quality of the shave is phenomenal. I highly highly recommend it.",
