There is absolutely nothing you can do to fix it. I was advised to ship it to New Jersey and see if they can fix it. This means weeks upon weeks without the camera, and it is only 2 months old.

Unlike Sony and Canon, every lens Fuji makes is optically superb. Switching to Fuji has been like drinking a cool glass of water after over a year in hell. I'm a believer!",

It actually made my camera seem just about as heavy as my old canon rebel (with a little 50mm on it). I felt like a bit of an idiot that I didn't even consider how big and heavy the lens might be.

I have small hands but managed to accidentally press buttons while shooting because of the small grip area. I know that people with bigger will get annoyed. I tried to learn how to get around the accidental presses but couldn't help myself when I was working fast with the camera. The auto focus was a little less forgiving than I expected and would take a couple tries to focus on the points that I really wanted. Overall this is a very nice camera but comes with its expected flaws",

      "text": "It was between this and the Sony A6300 for me because of the similar pricing. I believe I made the right choice. The senor in this thing is a beast, I believe it has better image quality than the a6300 for still images and it has nice video capabilities as well. If you want a cleaner 4K go for the a6300 as it shoots 6k downscaled to 4K for a sharper image. Still the video quality is excellent in this thing as well.",

This small camera has already impressed me, really good image quality, fast focus, and a really good iso performance. I only wished if touch screen can be used for more than focusing and taking pictures, and I wish if there was an easier way to access ISO selection panel.",

      "text": "Excellent colors, great ergonomics, tad slow in autofocus compared to Sony A6000+, but very good overall experience. The 18-55 lens rocks with the sensor. Sturdy feeling while handling, touchscreen is a great plus to review, focusing. Using zeiss and other lenses with manual focus is quite easy. Viewfinder is a bit small but that's the trade-off. Great travel Camera without compromise. Won't miss DSLR when the opportunity strikes!",

Extremely fast and a joy to use. For $1200 I'd expect more, a lot more from fuji on processing power. I'm using 90mbs read and 60 write and yet it takes 2 seconds to review the picture. If you like taking pictures one right after the other, forget it. This is going to get you very frustrated. Otherwise it has a great kit lens, very nice menu.",

Basically I am constantly hitting the buttons with the thumb part of my palm while trying to take pictures. This brings up a sync option for what I think is the flash. It's happened a lot while getting ready to take a photo using the EFV. Eventually I will learn to pay more attention to where my palm is at in relation to the camera and I think that issue will die down a lot. This camera is just remarkable though.",
