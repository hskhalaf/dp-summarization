Additionally, these shoes are wider than I expected and the sole is soft, leading to a bit of wobble which, from my experience with other shoes that had the same problem, can lead to knee pain.",

The textured material also holds dirt so they are very hard to clean. That's the great compromise with these materials - shoe leather lasts a long time because you can clean and polish until it looks new again. But, it's not as light and comfortable as these. So, if you are OK with buying a new pair every three months or so, these are for you. If you want shoes that last a long time, you want good old fashioned hard leather.",

They are uniformly soft and have very little arch support. They are super easy to put on though and are generally comfortable.

Very appropriate for casual dress, errands, shopping, visiting friends, going to dinner etc. Shoe probably does not provide enough support to wear to an event where there might be some casual sports/athletic participation by the wearer.
