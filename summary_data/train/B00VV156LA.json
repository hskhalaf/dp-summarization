I\u2019ve had it for 2 months now and I woke up in the middle of the night to smoke coming from the plug. Appears the unit overheated and melted the plug and cause it to melt. My electrician came and checked out the outlet, which he said was not faulty and said it was the heater that caused the issue. Had I not been home it could have easily started a fire... Too bad Its past the return period.",

But for those of you who are really looking for a quiet space heater, this may not be for you. It really is a great product otherwise! I love the remote control so I can adjust it from my desk without getting up every time. Cuz walking is so over-rated anyhow. Anyways, great product! Worth the buy....just noisy!",

It stopped working in month 11. For the price, maybe that's fair -- you get 11 months of heat. You decide.",
