It comes with a TON of string however it is so complicated that I can't even use it the way the instructions say to. I am literally 22 years old and I spent over 30 minutes just trying to understand the instructions and measuring and cutting string that I was over it. I actually tried more than once and had other people try to understand it and do it and it was just more trouble than it was worth. I am really curious how children are supposed to be able to do this.",

I attempted to make a bracelet for several hours, but was unsuccessful and asked my dad for help. He found the directions confusing, so we looked online for a video. He started weaving it, but also found it very frustrating. The colors are beautiful, but the gold and silver string unravels easily making it impossible to weave. This kit was very frustrating. I would not recommend it.",

For the most part we got the hang of it and had a pretty decent first bracelet.

One caution: Be careful if your hands are damp or if a kid has anything sticky on their hands because some of the color coding came off one of the foam looms. But it is still worth the purchase, as that problem can easily be remedied with colored Sharpies or other permanent markers. So much fun. I would recommend buying an extra pack of thread because soon everyone will want a bracelet, and it if you're crafty, it can be addictive! Fast shipping...thanks, seller!",
