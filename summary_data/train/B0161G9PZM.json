All the pockets on the inside ar fantastic and hold things like my sticky notes, wallet, sunglasses, and other odds and ends. It's big enough to fit my laptop, notebooks, pencil bag, agenda, and more. The pockets on the outside are perfect for my travel mugs too! I think the best thing about this bag is that it's water resistant and it zips close! And not to mention really cute too! I Would highly recommend to anyone!",

One of the smaller bags had a dirty spot that would not clean off, and I emailed the seller about it, and I got a response the same day. They sent out a replacement for it free of charge, and I received it 2 days later. It's in perfect condition. And the bag itself is really cute, and I'll probably use it as an oversized purse when I'm no longer using it for the pump. Overall, excellent purchase, and I would absolutely buy from this seller again.",

Or have one ready with a diaper and small pack of wipes so I can just grab that out and go to change baby without bringing the whole bag with. Love that it straps onto the stroller and it's a light weight bag. Definitely worth every penny!",

The side pockets are very large and the extra zipper pockets in the front are great for my personal things so I don't have to dig in the big part of the bag for my wallet, phone, etc. Only had the bag for about a week, so I am hoping it holds up well, but so far, I really like it!",
