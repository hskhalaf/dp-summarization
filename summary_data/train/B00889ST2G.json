I want to take great pictures in a compact camera when I travel. I do not care about 4k videos or touch screen features that newer models offer. This camera records awesome videos as well. Before I ordered it, I did a lot od research on Flickr and Youtube. I am very happy with my purchase!",

To make matters worse, I have also had consistent problems with an intermittent display screen. Imagine taking the picture, it is out of focus, and the display fails.

It has slowed down a bit after a lot of usage so it may be a battery thing. I love the picture setting effects that you shoot. Video capture quality is top notch. DSRL-ish camera in a compact body. Can't ask for a better camera. Negatives - Pricey - Has slowed a bit after much usage, not a biggie but nitpicking. - Can't change picture effects after taking a pitcure, It would be nice if I could have done so but not a biggie and just nicpicking.",

It's been solid, Bought with the premium leather case - an excellent and well-fitting add on to keep it protected but still easy to sling over your shoulder. I've taken amazing photos of my kids - frame worthy shots. The intelligent photo option works amazingly well, and the large sensor size is great at capturing stellar photos in low light. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a point and shoot camera in this price range.",

I use Sony's IDC to send 16- or 8-bit TIF files to Photoshop. (IDC didn't find my copy of PS-5 until I told it where to look.) That way I can keep all 20+ megapixels and have access to Photoshop's huge palette of magic tools when adjusting the TIFs.",

For razor-sharp images and pro-quality defocused backgrounds, the RX100 features a large, 1\" sensor and an ultra-bright Carl Zeiss f/1.8 lens. It also features a handy control ring for easy access to aperture settings and more for total creative freedom. \n\n\nTECHNOLOGY\n\n\n1\" EXMOR CMOS SENSOR, 20.2 MP\nCompared to the average point and shoot 1/2.3\" sensor size, the RX100 boasts a large, specially developed 1\" Exmor CMOS sensor to capture more light and reproduce every stunning detail with greater fidelity. Original dual noise reduction & column A/D conversion further decrease noise to ensure smooth, clear reproduction - even in low-light.\n\nBRIGHT F1.8 CARL ZEISS VARIO-SONNAR T* LENS\nNewly developed large-diameter F1.8 Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T* lens delivers refined background defocusing - bokeh. A premium multi-layered T* coating also dramatically reduces ghost and flare caused by light reflection.\n\nWIDE RANGE ISO SENSITIVITY\nShoot in nearly any light with natural results thanks to sensitivity that ranges from ISO 125 to 6400. Auto ISO mode automatically determines the most appropriate setting, or manually expand sensitivity for greater control. The bright lens, extra large sensor and precision image processing work together to ensure remarkably low noise.\n\n\n\n\nCOMPLETE CREATIVE CONTROL\nGet SLR-like handling with a full range of controls for video and still shooting-from Program, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority and Manual (P/A/S/M) modes for more advanced photographers, to an incredibly effective iAuto mode perfect for beginners. On-screen prompts help you refine your skills and exercise greater creative control.\n\nRAW IMAGE CAPTURE\nSave pictures as compact JPEG files, ultra high-quality RAW files, or both at once. When shooting in RAW format, images are saved prior to de-mosaicing or applying white balance, sharpness and color enhancement for maximum latitude when enhancing images on your PC.\n\nGORGEOUS FULL HD VIDEO\nCreate amazingly clear, extra-smooth movies with Full HD 1080/60p video capture in the AVCHD\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 Ver. 2.0 (progressive) format at a high frame rate of 60 fps. You can even record fast-moving subjects and dark settings with astonishing clarity thanks to the large image sensor and high-performance lens.\n\n\n\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\n\nMASSIVE 1\" EXMOR CMOS SENSOR, 20.2 MP\nThe massive Exmor CMOS sensor with 20.2 MP captures ultra-high definition images that take full advantage of the camera\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp Carl Zeiss\u00c2\u00ae Vario-Tessar T* lens. The sensor enables advanced column A/D processing that reduces noise levels, resulting in astonishing low light images with incredible smooth and clear details.\n\nBRIGHT F1.8 CARL ZEISS VARIO-SONNAR T* LENS WITH 3.6X ZOOM\nNewly developed large-diameter F1.8 Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T* lens delivers refined background defocusing - bokeh. A premium multi-layered T* coating also dramatically reduces ghost and flare caused by light reflection.\n\nP/A/S/M MODES FOR VIDEO AND STILLS\nEnjoy a full range of controls for video and still shooting from the beginner's iAUTO mode to P/A/S/M: Program, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority and Manual. On-screen prompts help you refine your skills, build your confidence and exercise greater creative control.\n\nCAPTURE JPEG FILES, RAW FILES, OR BOTH\nThe DSC-RX100 saves pictures as compact JPEG files and/or ultra-high quality RAW files. RAW files save images prior to de-mosaicing, white balance, sharpness and color enhancement. This retains maximum latitude for enhancing the image on your PC.\n\nFULL HD 1080/60P\nRecord crystal clear movies at the highest resolution available with capabilities for 60p in 1080. This provides stunning, fast motion video with less distortion for playback on your HD TV.2 With dual record of stills and movies, you can shoot both at the same time.\n\nLOW-LIGHT ISO 6400 SENSITIVITY\nncredibly clear low-light pictures without sacrificing detail, made possible by the low-noise Exmor\u00c2\u00ae CMOS image sensor and refined BIONZ\u00c2\u00ae image processor.\n\nHIGH SPEED AUTO FOCUS\nTo improve focusing speed and sensitivity, the Exmor\u00c2\u00ae CMOS sensor uses its rapid throughput to deliver high-quality image signals to the camera\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BIONZ\u00c2\u00ae processor, which provides intelligent response data to a new high speed actuator motor in the lens. The result is fast, DSLR-like focusing speeds even in low light.\n\nCAPTURE THE DECISIVE MOMENT WITH UP TO 10FPS\nCapture full 20.2 megapixel resolution images at up to 10 frames per second, helping to ensure that the decisive moment is captured such as the soccer ball flying into the goal. In addition, a mechanical shutter helps reduce distortion when continuously shooting moving subjects.\n\n3\" XTRA FINE LCD DISPLAY\nThe 3\" (1,229k dots) Xtra Fine LCD Display makes it easy to scroll through menus and preview life. WhiteMagic increases visibility in bright daylight. The large display delivers brilliant-quality still images and movies while enabling easy focusing operation.\n\nCUSTOMIZABLE FUNCTION BUTTON\nAssign up to seven different functions to the function button, to allow quick access to your most frequently used features.\n\nOPTICAL STEADYSHOT WITH ACTIVE MODE\nOptical SteadyShot\u2122 with Active Mode for blur-free movies even while walking. Camera-shake compensation using Optical SteadyShot/Active Mode has been improved with the addition of new electronic image stabilization. Now it\u2019s easier than ever to obtain sharp, blur-free movies even when zooming in unsteady situations, such as shooting with one hand while walking.\n\nMEMORY RECALL\nMR (memory recall) mode can memorize up to three groups of the user's preferred settings. Settings include zoom magnification, white balance, exposure compensation, date, and grid lines. This enables quick switching of settings at the right moment.\n\nSOPHISTICATED METAL BODY\nThe sophisticated aluminum body is lightweight, slim, and strong.\n\nAUTO PORTRAIT FRAMING\nSimply photograph a person and Auto Portrait Framing will save an additional, optimally framed image in portrait or landscape orientation. Combining Face Detection and By Pixel Super Resolution technologies with rule of thirds, Auto Portrait Framing provides beautifully composed and appealingly balanced full resolution portraits.\n\nAUTO HDR MODE\nCaptures more scene dynamic range than a single exposure can handle\u2014and more range than photo film. Combines the best highlight detail from one shot, the best mid-tones from a second and the best shadow detail from a third for one incredible shot (up to 6 EV stops). Captures in a split second. (Recommended for still subjects.)\n\nFACE DETECTION/ REGISTRATION TECHNOLOGY\nThe camera can automatically detect and register up to eight individual faces and adjust focus, exposure, white balance and flash to help deliver crisp, properly lit images of family and friends. Can prioritize children or adults.\n\nMULTI-ASPECT RATIO RECORDING FOR STILL IMAGES\nCapture still images in any of four aspect ratios \u2014 1:1, 2:3, 4:3, or 16:9 (vertical to horizontal). This provided the freedom to choose a ratio that matches the scene or the specific shooting purpose.\n\n3.6X OPTICAL/7.2X CLEAR IMAGE DIGITAL ZOOM\nMost digital zooms use electronic cropping to get closer to the subject, resulting in unsharp images. With Clear Image Zoom the powerful processor compares patterns found in adjacent pixels and creates new pixels to match selected patterns, resulting in more realistic, higher-quality images. Clear Image Zoom digitally doubles optical zoom for closer photos.\n\nBUILT IN POP UP FLASH\nEnjoy the convenience of flash photography everywhere you go.\n\nFOUR FOCUSING MODES\nThis camera has two Autofocus modes: Single-shot AF (AF-S) or Continuous AF (AF-C), which tracks moving objects. It also has Manual Focus for manual focusing freedom, and Direct Manual Focus (DMF), that first uses autofocusing to focus on the subject, and then allows fast and easy switching to manual focusing for even more precise adjustment.\n\nDIGITAL LEVEL GAUGE\nDigital level gauge to allow easier leveling of the camera.\n\nMF ASSIST AND PEAKING\nManual focus becomes much easier because peaking highlights the edges that are in focus in your choice of three colors (white, red, or yellow). This is especially helpful during macro or portrait photography where your focus setting can make or break your shot.\n\nMULTI-FRAME NOISE REDUCTION\nIn this mode, the camera automatically shoots multiple images and layers them to produce a single noise-free image. This method provides noise reduction equivalent to a 2-stop lower shutter speed while maintaining the same aperture setting. Since the Multi Frame NR mode can be used in combination with P/A/S/M modes, it expands the user\u2019s shooting flexibility.\n\nPHOTO CREATIVITY\nThe Photo Creativity interface enables you to easily enjoy the creative expression of SLR-quality digital imaging without complex jargon. Changes can be combined/ removed and viewed in real time on the LCD making it a breeze to make adjustments. Choose from several different Photo Creativity functions using the convenient control wheel and center button including; Picture Effect, Background Defocus, Color, Brightness, and Vividness.\n\nPICTURE EFFECT MODE\nRealize your creative potential with Picture Effect, a fun and simple way to convert ordinary landscapes and portraits come to life by heightening mood and emphasizing certain attributes. Effects are Soft Focus, Posterization, Retro Photo, High Contrast Monochrome, Rich-tone Monochrome, Miniature, Soft High-key, Toy Camera, Pop Color, Partial Color, Watercolor Painting, HDR Painting, and Illustration.\n\nCREATIVE STYLE SETTINGS\nControl how the camera processes your images with six finishing styles: Standard, Vivid, B&W, Sunset, Portrait and Landscape. You can even fine-tune contrast, saturation, and sharpness to your personal taste.\n\nSWEEP PANORAMA\u2122 MODE\nCapture expansive landscapes automatically. Press the shutter, sweep vertically or horizontally. The camera does the rest, continuously shooting images and stitching them together.\n\nSUPERIOR AUTO MODE\nGet cleaner, more dynamic pictures and fewer missed shots. The camera automatically recognizes the correct scene mode, then quickly shoots and combines up to six shots to produce images with greater clarity, optimum dynamic range using Backlight Correction HDR technology and lower image noise using 6 shots layering technology. Superior Auto intelligently detects 33 scenes for still images and movies, making it easy to get the best shot.\n\nINTELLIGENT SCENE RECOGNITION MODE\nIntelligent Scene Recognition (iSCN) Mode automatically detects 33 different types of scenes for photos and 44 scenes for movies, and then selects the appropriate camera settings. In Auto Mode, the camera takes a single shot using the optimal settings. In Advanced Mode, the camera takes a photo with the optimal settings and, if in difficult lighting (low light or back light) immediately takes a second photo with another optimized setting so you can choose which to keep.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPLEASE SEE THE COMPARISON CHART BELOW TO FIND WHICH RX100 SERIES MODEL IS BEST FOR YOUR SHOOTING NEEDS.\n\n\n\n\nRX100 III \n\n\nRX100 II \n\n\nRX100\n\n\nSensor\n\n\n 20.1MP4 BSI-CMOS\n\n\n 20.2MP BSI-CMOS\n\n\n 20.2MP CMOS \n\n\nProcessor \n\n\nBionz X \n\n\nBionz \n\n\nBionz \n\n\nLens focal range\n\n\n24-70mm \n\n\n28-100mm \n\n\n28-100mm \n\n\nLens max aperture\n\n\nF1.8-2.8\n\n\nF1.8-4.9\n\n\nF1.8-4.9\n\n\nLCD (degrees of tilt)\n\n\n 3\" tilting (180/45) \n\n\n3\" tilting (90/40)\n\n\n 3\" fixed \n\n\nEVF\n\n\n Built-in \n\n\nOptional\n\n\n No \n\n\nHot shoe \n\n\nNo\n\n\n Multi-Interface\n\n\n No \n\n\nMax video bit rate\n\n\n 50MBps (XAVC S)\n\n\n 28Mbps (AVCHD)\n\n\n 28Mbps (AVCHD)\n\n\nWi-Fi \n\n\nYes, with NFC\n\n\nYes, with NFC\n\n\n No \n\n\nND filter\n\n\n Yes \n\n\n No \n\n\nNo\n\n\nBattery life (CIPA)\n\n\n 320 shots \n\n\n350 shots \n\n\n330 shots \n\n\nDimensions \n\n\n102 x 58 x 41mm \n\n\n102 x 58 x 38mm \n\n\n102 x 58 x 36mm \n\n\nWeight\n\n\n 10.2oz \n\n\n9.9oz\n\n\n 8.5oz\n\n\n\n\n\n1.
