But I have absolutely no problem staying in these glasses for many hours. The battery life is also very good. I was very sad to find out that Nvidia is discontinuing 3D Vision. I bought an extra pair (I already had 2 pairs) because I'm afraid that they disappear from the market soon. I think 3D Vision is one of the best 3D technologies from the picture quality perspective.",

Dell in their infinite wisdom did not include a pair of Nvidia 3d glasses. To get my laptop running this was all I needed. I just went through a configuration wizard where a spot below the dell logo turned green to inform me I was in 3d mode. The glasses are also auto-off so don't keep trying to hold the power button to turn it off. I did have to update my Cyberlink PowerDVD software to play the latest 3D movies! Good luck, 3D looks awesome, even on a small 17\" screen!",

That being said they do come with three different replaceable nose pieces for more comfort. They are comfortable enough to wear during a three hour movie. After that, its probably time to take a break from 3D anyway. The wireless feature works flawlessly and they stay charged for an appropriate length of time. They have a USB cord to charge the battery. Highly recommended!",
