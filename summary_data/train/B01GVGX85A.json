You could spend more - lots more - but it's gonna do the same thing. Hamilton Beach has been doing this for a VERY long time and, sure enough, they've got it right. Imagine that. It toasts evenly, can accommodate all (normal) sizes of bread, bagels, and English muffins, is subtle in terms of style and footprint, and just works. If you're just sick and tired of your money ... you can get rid of plenty of it on the supposedly high-end toasters ... but they're gonna do the exact same thing this does.",

After discovering so many toasters had more than 10% of 1-star reviews, I then looked for the one that had the least amount of 1-star reviews. This was the one! It was also one of the lowest priced models. The toaster came quickly and it's been working like a toaster should. It toasts evenly on both sides, it's easy to adjust and the slots are big enough for a sliced bagel. And the outside does not get dangerously hot. I'm a happy consumer now. Try this model and you'll be pleased.",

      "text": "I am very happy with this toaster. I read everyone's reviews and I had no idea toast was such a hot topic! I was looking for a cheap toaster that did the job, this one fit the bill. It toasts evenly and will only allow you to lower the lever when it is plugged in. It is slim and everything about it works as advertised.",

Cleaning could be made more accessible by allowing you to remove the bottom but given our litigious society, forget that. After nearly two years it is still toasting! And, it looks nice. No annoying noise to tell you when it is done which, to me, is a plus.",
