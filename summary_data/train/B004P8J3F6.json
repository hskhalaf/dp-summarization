      "text": "This thing has to be looked at as the Mercedes or BMW of nutmeg graters. Its German engineering bears the same relationship to the more common French graters as those cars do to French cars. In other words, I find most other nutmeg graters, nearly all of French origin or using French critical parts, to be very frustrating whereas this one simply grates the nutmeg with no fuss. And they've even put a cap on the bottom so you don't get nutmeg gratings all over wherever you sit it after use (I used to sit my old grater in a recycled jar lid).",

I love the slim design and fold over handle as it doesn't take up as much space in the cabinet. I especially appreciate the cover that fits onto the bottom of the grinder that prevents a mess.",

We actually started by buying the round Peugeot 19501 with acrylic top because I've used and liked Peugeot pepper grinders in the past. But the Peugeot nutmeg grinder was cheaply made, the plastic flimsy, and I could tell it wouldn't last. After returning that one, we took our chance on the Gefu and are very happy with this one. The Gefu grinds as well as the Peugeot but is much better made and we think it will last.",

About the only thing I can complain about is the bottom of the unit, which is used to cover the output blades, was initially difficult to remove and we were confused by it. But I'm nitpicking. I've seen the price for it fluctuate as it goes in and out of stock from various venders but it is worth the wait.",
