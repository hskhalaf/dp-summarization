I don't know why ECCO is changing its style for comfort. Once I tried it on I could tell it would give me a blister in the back heel area. It rubs the back area. Be careful when ordering these ECCO. I'm very disappointed ECCO. Bring back the real ECCO golf shoes!!!! I'm returning these.....",

I can walk into a store, find a classic style in a 6-1/2 and know it will fit perfectly. I ordered the same size in these shoes, and could not wear them. The instep (from insole to top) is very narrow, and takes a flat foot, which I do not have. I gave them to a friend, fit her just fine. Bummer.",
