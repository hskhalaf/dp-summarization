I kept wondering why I couldn't get it to stick to my refrigerator because the magnet is really strong. Turns out you need to remove the back cover. With the front of the holder laying on a soft towel, pull the two plastic tabs up to remove the back, don't replace the back cover, and just keep it someplace safe in case you want to put the holder on a wall later. I agree with other reviewers that large knives have to be attached with the handle up.",

You have to remove the plastic from the back to activate the magnetic strip on the back. Be careful I pinched my finger so hard it bled (cause it is super magnetic and I did not have a tight enough hold on it).",

      "text": "We purchased, this, the husband and I, to resolve a knife storage debate of sorts, and we are both thrilled with the results. This adds a practical bit of style to the kitchen wall while saving space and making knives easily accessible. The mount was easy to install and seems easy enough to remove at whatever later date while no risk of falling until then. Our only regret is not buying another one as we apparently have more stuff we'd like to stick up there than we have room.",

Installation was incredibly simple and they haven't budged.

It's saved so much space to be able to throw out the knife block, and its so easy to pick out the right knife every time. It even holds our kitchen scissors!",

The magnet on the back allows for you to put it on the side of your fridge, and it also comes with screws. I did not use the screws, but I mounted it to my kitchen tile using scotch double sided extreme mounting tape (30 lb) and it seems very sturdy. I do wish that it came with mounting tape to hold it up so that I didn't have to buy any, but I still love it. I would definitely buy it again.",

I did not screw in the back piece like the company strong suggests. I have (7) knives hanging from the magnet that is attached to the side of my Frigidaire Refrigerator. Solid & strong; I may not risk it and buy some of the 3M adhesive backing. But for right now, it works and looks awesome! And for the price of $17... this is fantastic.",
