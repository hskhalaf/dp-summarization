The instructions were pretty much useless and I could not figure out how to secure it to my car so I called a friend who eventually figured it out. Turns out the supplied clips did not fit on my Jetta so he somehow modified the straps to make fit. Once loaded properly, it was very secure and did not move around while driving at highway speed. It is very roomy and holds a lot of stuff. I did not waste the $20 on cargo mat, I used a yoga mat which did the job perfectly. If you don't have one then buy one for $5 at 5 Below!",

I was being careful and the pull to tighten the straps was modest, just enough to secure the bag. I have stored the bag indoors and taken good care of it. None-the-less, it appeared to be very brittle. It was not fun thinking about how the bag was barely secured to the vehicle on the way home. Also of note, the zipper becomes very difficult to operate as the plastic coating also begins to peal off. Move on and find a better bag, don't put yourself in the same position.",

Other than that, I only had to check it twice as recommended by other purchasers. Even checking twice the straps remained tight through the whole trip. 6 hours going above 70 mph and through rain and it worked great with room to spare.",

Make sure you point the zipper close to the back side and with that we've had no trouble. I got a tiny lock as a general deterrent when we stopped at places. Was perfect for shoving in sleeping bags and soft bulky items on our camping trips.",

The little straps that come with the package may suffice for light driving, but if you're going on the freeway those little things are not going to hold up.

We've used it twice to drive two thousand miles from Arizona to Michigan and then back. One of those trips it rained. The entire drive. Not fun. Our suitcase and bedding was in the bag and I was expecting them to be wet from 38 hours of almost continual rain but everything was dry. Also, if you aren't an idiot, it's simple to use and easy to secure. I have a regular car add it was awesome to have all the extra space during the drive.",

It never leaked, even in downpours so hard we had to pull over. We put it up and took it down off out car over and over, somewhere between 40-50 times during our travels. Finally, one of the front corners started to wear thin and we had to retire it after last vacation. I'm sure this new one will also serve our family well.",
