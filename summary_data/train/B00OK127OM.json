(The arch is hard plastic; I can\u2019t bend it). Also, if I completely turn the music dial, the music doesn\u2019t last more than a couple minutes. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this.

The song only last a couple minutes too. Design is awful as the animals get stuck on the arm as they move around. It\u2019s 2018, a battery powered mobile would be much easier. Giving it two stars because we used it for two nights and the girls thought the little animals were completely amazing.",

The animals on the mobile hit the giraffe pole and don't even spin in a circle you have to tilt it to the side if you even want it to move right which in my opinion is a safety hazard for my son so I don't. Over all this mobile is a $15-$18 value and I paid over $50 after shipping and handling for this piece of junk, DO NOT BUY!",
