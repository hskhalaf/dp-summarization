So I started to look on Amazon and I found these decals (I know some of the animals aren\u2019t accurate to the place or Hawaii is not there or Central America title\u2019s is not there) but actually I cannot be that picky. I\u2019m really happy with the purchase. Not everything has to be perfect! I love it",

We struggled with lining everything up as we wanted it to be straight and very realistic. We used a blue paniting tape to box off where the map would go so that we know what space we were working with (we kept measuring and remeasuring). Getting all small stickers on and the details done took some time. I think it took us about 1.5 hrs to properly do it. Our wall is not 100% flat surface so we had to also make sure all stickers were sticking well. Great for the price.",

I had considered purchasing a similar one online and it was quadruple the price and some bigger companies were charging $150. I took a chance and I'm so glad I did. These come in 3 sheets but there are lots of separate decals (fish, wale, waves, starfish, etc.) but it is not complicated and I was able to peel and unpeel as needed when I didn't get placement right on first try. The instructions/diagram are easy. Overall we love it. We love to travel and we want to get our little guy excited about the world around him too.",

It looks awesome! I was really nervous about putting it up, but that process was pretty easy (I had help- I think it would be more difficult alone). There were a few spots it didn\u2019t immediately adhere, but I think it had to do more with my wall (slightly textured) than the decal. I just kept pressing those spots on, and they eventually adhered. I would highly recommend this product!!",

You have to line up the stickers just so or they look wrong or overlap with other pieces. Where you\u2019re supposed to connect the pieces is often hard to get just right.
