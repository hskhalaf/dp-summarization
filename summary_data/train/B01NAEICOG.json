My only issue is the insoles are not actually glued into the shoe but maybe this is the normal design. It doesn\u2019t affect the fit and don\u2019t foresee it being a big deal.",

They were comfortable but my foot was sliding around a lot and I thought it would give me blisters eventually. Both boxes were totally destroyed when they came. I ended up returning both pairs because I found some Nikes I liked better.",
