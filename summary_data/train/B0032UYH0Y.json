      "text": "I bought these tennis shoes thinking they would be like my old Reebok New Port Classic sneakers. Well color me disappointed. My old sneakers were super comfortable and beloved. These are incredibly uncomfortable. The forward seams inside the shoes rub against my little toes in whatever socks I wear. Granted they're not yet fully broken in but I don't remember my old NPC's being this uncomfortable, EVER. I can only walk in these shoes for short periods. These are made in Brazil and I don't know if that makes a difference but the care instructions that come with the shoes are in multiple languages except English. This was a very disappointing purchase. May have permanently put me off Reebok shoes.",

But they will never compare to the Kaepa's I had. which seemed I could wear a lifetime. It is very hard to find just a basic white shoe without some design/glitter on the side.
