Somewhat expensive, I realize especially because your computer probably came with a free (aka cheap) one - I like this mouse better than a wireless one I've tried.

The wheel also turns smoothly and the buttons are responsive. It is overall a good quality mouse in addition to being ergonomically correct.",

On the plus side, I liked the ability to customize the buttons in different ways, and the product seemed to be of good quality. Although this wasn't the right product for me, it might be perfect for someone else, especially if hand/wrist position is a concern.",

It helped me at the beginning by reducing the tension on my wrist, but then it began generating pain along the edge of my hand, so I stop using it. The idea is interesting and valid, the natural position for the wrist is sideways and not twisted down. The problem is that there is no base to rest the lower edge of the hand, so that part gets stressed out. Of course everybody's ergonomics needs are not the same, but I recommend instead the, which have been working great for me (3 years now).",

I hate roller wheels and don't need to use it or notice even notice it on this mouse. But it works too for those who want it.

My work requires me to be at the computer all day, so I was getting really discouraged. I've tried everything from chairs, keyboards, foot rests, desks to get around this pain. It's not as if it's gone, but I can't quite believe how big a difference this mouse made after only one day of use. My fingers aren't numb. My pain is reduced by about 50%, which puts it in the completely manageable zone. I'm very grateful for this device.",
