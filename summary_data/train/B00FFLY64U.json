Since the filter displaces any water in the pitcher, if one over fills the pitcher, water pours out, if one under fills the pitcher, one must remove the soggy-dripping filter to add more. I'll have to determine the proper amount and measure it. An extra step which would have been obviated by simply providing a fill line. Poor design.",

      "text": "I just got this in over the weekend and had my first brew this morning. It tastes great! I was pleasantly surprised. It's my 1st cold brew maker and I wasn't sure what to expect. I wanted something simple and easy and it seems to be both. A bit smaller than I thought, but it makes about a quart and will give you multiple drinks per brew so it's enough for an average drinker. The basket is big and takes up some of the water space, which is maybe why it is less liquid, but it allows you to have more or less grounds and make it to your desired level of strength. Not bitter tasting.",

I haven\u2019t had a problem with all of the grounds getting wet even if I put in the filter after the water. They do rise to the top at first but after you shake it to start the diffusion, they all seem to drop, at least for me. I highly recommend!",

In the process of a replacement now. Besides the 50/50 QC, good product. If you buy this, first fill with water and shake the crap out of it. If no leaks, your likely going to give it 5 stars.",

Assemble unit, shake, refrigerate. I give it an extra shake about 12 hours in. 24 hours after you started, you've got good cold brew. Shake again immediately before you serve.

It's just enough for my boyfriend and I to split in the morning. Highly recommended for anyone who has been spending way too much on coffee every morning.",

After adding more water you want it to sit a little longer though. I also poured the water through the coffee grounds before attaching it to the lid. It helps speed up the brewing process and helps soak and sift through all the grounds.",
