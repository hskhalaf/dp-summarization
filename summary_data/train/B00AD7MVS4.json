Tuning your marker will make it more reliable and consistent and don't just rely on the tank. One reviewer asked how many shots from the 68/45k. This will vary from marker to marker. Poppits like an Ego will yield a bit more shots per fill than a spoolie like a DM. But generally I get about 1600 - 1800 per fill.",
