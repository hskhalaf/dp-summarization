The Royal Gormet 3 burner grill with porcelain coated griddle fullfills that job perfectly. My first \"griddling\" was scallops, shrimp, and brussel spouts. All foods came out grate as I can adjust the griddle temperature in three separate zones. Oil or grease handling is pretty easy, make sure the griddle is perfectly level, except the waste hole could be larger. The catcher tray locking mechanism could be designed a little better as well, but works perfectly. The Griddle is an excellent value for someone who will use it regularly and clean after use.",

If it is annoying there appears to be a way to position the griddle top to prevent it. A close look at the standoffs on the bottom of the griddle will make the fix apparent.

The griddle itself is very sturdy and heavy making up most of the weight as the stove is fairly light compared to the griddle. Heats fast, though the edges stay cooler and cleans easily. Great table top griddle. Exactly what I was looking for up to this point and price was good too.",

      "text": "This product is garbage. First it emitted smoke from under the cooking plate right out of the box. Used it two times both times was an absolute failure. The regulator froze and provided intermittent flame. Took a very long time to get hot enough to cook. Second time the metal frame (paint) caught fire then the regulator developed a hole and it began leaking propane. There is no quality to this product. It damn near burned down the tailgate. Too late for a return. Thanks Amazon for pedaling absolute crap.",
