It's been more than 2 hours since I applied, before I applied my eyeliner and eyeshadow, and I still do not see any mark anywhere on my eyelids. That has never happened before. Thank you!",

I have very oily eyelids. So oily that my fake lashes will un-stick without using primer and with eyeshadow my creases get so gross.",

This time around I can\u2019t even see my eyeshadow. I wonder if the formula has changed. I doubt this was a fake. It does leave a sort of film so you do have to be very careful applying. Does dry out the eyelid which I love for my greasy ones. I just wish I could have the old kind back. It was always sold out on Ulta.com and I can never find it in stores so I know it\u2019s a hot item. It\u2019s too bad.",
