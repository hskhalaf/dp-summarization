The kids were excited about it but after a few uses they weren't crazy about it because the accessories hurt their hands. It looks cool and fun but the ring handles aren't comfortable and those monkey knots are the worst. I think if I did it again I would try to get something that advertises comfort grip or something like that.",

Biggest problem...... the monkey bar cracked in half with my daughter on it. CRACKED. IN. HALF!!!! She's 64 lbs. This equipment is tolerable for up to 300 pounds. Im expecting an exchange for a new one and I'm hoping damage is reversable as my daughter is now scared to death to try it again. GRRRRRR",

The slackline has additional spaces on it for more things to hang than what's included. So we got some additional rings and added them on. Our backyard is now the hit of the neighborhood. I also love that it came with tree protectors. And that it all folds up so small for storage for the winter!! Its a win!",
