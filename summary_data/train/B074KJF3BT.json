      "title": "Perfectly designed for young babies",
      "text": "I really like that the curvature of the wires are gently sloped vs the high frequency sine wave design on others that we own. The wires are well spaced and uncomplicated. This makes it easier for young babies to stick their hands between the different lanes and navigate the wooden beads across the wires with their still relatively clumsy hands. The gentle slopes allow me to rest the beads on them first so that my son can try to slide them down. The suction works really well too, unlike the suction cup on the Sassy Wheel (another beloved chair toy). It fits on our high chair tray, Bumbo seat tray and our Joovy walker tray. Very pleased with this purchase.",

      "text": "I gave the toy as a gift to a little boy. He loved it, but one of the dowels that held on one suction cup came off almost immediately. The boy's father tried to remove all the dowels with the suction cups, but they were attached very well. So he used wood glue and re-glued all the suction cups on so that the boy could not remove it. I would ask the manufacturers to use a better glue...so no one could remove these smaller parts and possibly choke on it/them. Thank you.",

This allows us an extra 10min to finish our dinner--so valuable and 100% worth the money! Good quality wood, wires don't bend (even despite heavy teething) and beads are the perfect size for his tiny hands. He started playing with it at 5months old and this has really helped him develop hand-eye coordination much earlier than others in his same daycare class. Would highly recommend this item to other parents looking for a nice high-quality toy that will stand up to the test of time!",
