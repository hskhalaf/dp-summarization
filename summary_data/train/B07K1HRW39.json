I don\u2019t even find it necessary to wait the 10-15 minutes for it to dry and be effective. I like how the strips are cut strategically to help you contour them to your nose. The price of them is great compared to name brand and work just as well if not better. I would buy them again.",

To use the strips, you need to wet the nose area and then apply the glue side over it. I waited for 15 minutes for it to dry out and the results was great. A lot of blackheads came out as you can see in the picture so it was super effective. Overall, I would recommend this set for its adhesion strength.",

Also, they take a little longer for the water to get absorbed and soften the stiff strip's adhesive side, which was already off the plastic film when I opened the envelope, so I was afraid they were expired.

I will stick with the original famous brand. Have tried several brands, but nothing comes close to the original. Will not buy.",
