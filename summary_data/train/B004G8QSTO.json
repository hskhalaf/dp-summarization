It is not too big to haul around, and the f1.8 lens is sharp. The Olympus jpegs are as usual, brilliant, and can be used straight out of the box, but there is a raw mode as well. It is an ideal camera for the times when the DSLR is just too much to take around, and it is head and shoulders above other point and shoot cameras in the picture quality and low-light situations. It is an alternative to be considered to micro 4/3rds and copycats. Kudos to Olympus.",

I'm glad I did because, for a compact camera, the picture quality is excellent. The auto focus is fast and the other manual controls are what I need in a camera.I was so pleased,that I ordered the new XZ-2, which one has to wait for,since it is not in the stores yet.",

I'm not sure what the best settings or features a good camera should have but the Olypus XZ-1 is very user friendly in that it has preset settings with options for certain situations that you're planning to take pictures in. For example, took the camera to my son's soccer game. There was a setting that was specifically for snaps of moving objects. The shots I took came out great and without any motion blur. Can't say enough how happy I am with this camera. I would absolutely recommend it.",

I have a Nikon system and have been into photography since 1976. The Nikon entrys into this segment are no better and in fact worse.",

    "title": "Olympus XZ-1 10 MP Digital Camera with f1.8 Lens and 3-Inch OLED Monitor (Black) (Old Model)",
    "description": "XZ-1 DIGITAL CAMERA BLK - product specs to follow via CD. What's in the Box : Strap, Lens cap and Lens cap strap, LI-lithium ion battery, F-2AC USB-AC, Adapter, USB cable, AV cable, Olympus Setup CD-ROM.\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n Unleash your creative side with the first-ever Olympus X Series camera. Designed for those who want the quality of an SLR in a high-end point-and-shoot format, this camera provides a new, easy-to-use outlet for artistic expression. With the XZ-1 you'll capture high-quality still images and HD videos in any shooting environment thanks to its fast, super-bright, built-in Olympus iZuiko lens and its large, super-sensitive CCD sensor. \n\n\n\nOlympus XZ-1 Highlights \n\nFast, super-bright f1.8 iZuiko 4x wide lens\nThe iZuiko f1.8-2.5 6.0-24mm (28-112mm equivalent angle of view in 35mm cameras) digital lens is a newly-developed 4x compact version of the legendary, high-quality ZUIKO Digital lenses featured with Olympus DSLRs. With a minimum aperture of f1.8 at wide-angle and a maximum aperture of f2.5 at telephoto, this lens assures fast shutter speeds for sharp low-light images. This aperture range also allows photographers to take portraits that highlight the subject by defocusing the background, a capability not possible in most compact cameras. The lens is specifically designed for clear, high-quality photographic performance with minimal ghosting or flare. \n\nHigh-sensitivity CCD\nCompared to existing 1/2.33-inch, 14-megapixel CCDs, the light-reception area of each pixel of the 1/1.63-inch, 10-megapixel CCD featured in the XZ-1 has been doubled. Superb, low-noise images can be shot even in dimly lit situations such as night scenes and indoor shots. \n\nAdvanced manual controls\nThe XZ-1 offers advanced manual controls that experienced photographers expect from larger digital SLR cameras. But, with the XZ-1, advanced features are easy to use. A control ring around the front of the lens and the wheel controller on the back provide immediate access to the most important manual settings like ISO, aperture and shutter speed to make it easy to adjust the camera on the move. \n\nNew, 3-inch OLED monitor\nWhether composing still images or HD videos, photographers will appreciate the XZ-1's sharp 3.0-inch OLED monitor to frame and show off still images and High Definition (HD) movies in detailed 720p. The LCD displays 610,000 dots in vivid color, reproduces colors and shades more accurately with deeper black tones, and consumes less power. The monitor also provides a wide viewing angle ensuring that images can be composed from even the most obscure angles. \n\nLow-light performance\nThe XZ-1 has an easily accessible built-in pop-up flash to illuminate low-light subjects, reduce red-eye and fill in dark areas. The camera also features an AF illuminator to make it simple to focus in low-light situations. Additionally, Dual Image Stabilization further assures you'll get the shot you want while holding the camera: Mechanical Sensor-Shift Image Stabilization compensates for camera movement in low-light conditions when shutter speeds are slower while Digital Image Stabilization freezes the action with high ISO sensitivity and fast shutter speeds that prevent blurry images often caused by a moving subject. On top of all this, the XZ-1 also offers a Low-Light mode which automatically adjusts the ISO sensitivity up to ISO 3200 to take sharp full-resolution photos in dark places. \n\nHD movie with HDMI control\nShooting video is as easy as ever with the new Olympus XZ-1 camera. The camera captures all the action in crisp 720p HD video at 30 frames-per-second. The XZ-1's easy-to-reach record button on the back of the camera body makes recording videos a breeze. If you're about to snap a photo and you realize a video would capture the spirit of the scene even better, simply press the record button and instantly you're capturing videos! The XZ-1 makes sharing your content easier than ever. Just connect it to your HDTV with an optional HDMI cable and use your HDTV's remote to control playback functions and navigate the camera's menus from the comfort of your couch. \n\nTruePic V Image Processor\nThe XZ-1 pairs a high sensitivity 10 megapixel CCD sensor with the TruePic V Image Processor to produce clear and colorful photos using all the pixel information from each image to provide the best digital images possible. The image processor is noted for accurate natural color, true-to-life flesh tones, brilliant blue skies and precise tonal expression; it also lowers image noise in photos shot at higher ISO settings (ISO 100 to ISO 3200), enabling great results in low-light situations. \n\nHot shoe and accessory port\nTo expand the camera's versatility, the XZ-1 includes an accessory port that is compatible with select PEN camera accessories. Photographers can attach optional accessories like the SEMA-1 external microphone adapter, the VF-2 electronic viewfinder, or the newly introduced MAL-1 macro light. These optional accessories easily slide into the camera's accessory port and hot shoe. \n\n\nAdditional Features \n\n10-megapixel resolution\nThe 10 million pixels in the high-resolution CCD create superior image quality. Create poster-sized prints without losing a single detail. \n\nLarge, high-sensitivity CCD\nProviding the best image quality ever in a compact Olympus camera, the large 1/1.63-inch CCD enables greater dynamic range and smoother gradations from highlights to shadows. \n\n4x iZuiko zoom lens\nBased on the standards of Olympus DSLR lenses, the wide aperture of the iZuiko f1.8-2.5 allows a rich and vibrant range of photographic expression. It allows faster shutter speeds in low light--and it allows for a shallower depth of field than most compact point-and-shoot cameras. \n\nHD movie 720p\nA simple, one-touch button allows you to record movies with amazing clarity in high-definition, right from your camera. \n\nAccessory port\nThe XZ-1 includes a port for accessories including the SEMA-1 Microphone adapter set and the VF-2 live-finder, a detachable electronic viewfinder. The viewfinder easily slides onto the camera's accessory port and hot shoe to provide 1.15x magnification for a 100% field of view. The VF-2 rotates up 90 degrees which is useful when shooting subjects from challenging angles. The external accessory port also allows for connection with the SEMA-1 external microphone adapter set for enhanced audio capture. \n\nIn-camera Art Filters for movies and still images\nWith six in-camera Art Filters (Pop Art, Soft Focus, Grainy Film, Pin Hole, Diorama and Dramatic Tone) you can explore your artistic side while taking both still shots and HD video. The Art Filters can be applied as you shoot, no additional software required. \n\nDual Image Stabilization\nDual Image Stabilization combines Sensor-Shift Image Stabilization with high ISO sensitivity and fast shutter speeds to capture crisp, clear images in any situation. \n\nNew, easy-to-use Live Guide control\nSeeing the results before you shoot can change the way you take a picture. Want more vivid or muted color in your shot? Want warmer or cooler hues? Want a brighter or darker subject, or a sharper or softer background? Or maybe you want to capture the fast-moving action of your subject with a little artistic blur, or perhaps freeze the action? Simply set the camera to iAuto, press OK to engage Live Guide, then press the up and down arrows on the back of the E-PL1 to easily slide through numerous photographic effects. Make adjustments and watch the LCD as the effects are made live -- before the image is captured! Live Guide also features a Tips section on how to compose a shot or shoot kids, pets, flowers and more. \n\nIn-camera PANORAMAv\nCaptures three images and stitches them together to create one amazing panoramic picture by simply pressing the shutter button and slowly panning across a panoramic scene. \n\nAF Live View with AF Tracking\nAF Live View works as seamlessly as a point-and-shoot to display subjects, in focus, on the LCD the instant the shutter is pressed half way. AF Tracking locks your subject into focus right on the LCD, and constantly adjusts focus and brightness whether you or your subject is moving. With this mode, a simple push of the AF button and shutter release enables you to keep fast-moving and unpredictable subjects in focus. \n\nAdvanced Face Detection\nFace Detection automatically focuses on your subjects' faces and optimizes exposure for sharp, brilliant portrait pictures. \n\nTruePic V Image Processor\nIn addition to more detail, the image sensor, combined with the next-generation TruePic V Image Processor, delivers excellent dynamic range, accurate color fidelity and reduced noise, all the way up to 3200 ISO. \n\nUnderwater Housing (optional accessory)\nThe XZ-1's compact design makes it the perfect companion for all of your dive trips. The PT-050 underwater case has been customized for the XZ-1 and is waterproof to a depth of 40 meters (approximately 130 feet). With its durable, high-quality polycarbonate construction, this Olympus housing protects the camera from water while also cushioning it from knocks and bumps on land.",
