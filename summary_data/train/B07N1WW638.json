After installation (with some troubles), it appeared the wifi signal becomes stronger in certain areas; however, one major problem soon began to appear: wifi signal dropping of - it had never happened before having this extender. Basically my iphone suddenly turns to LTE mode, using large amount of data. It happens more frequently when two or more cell phones are in use in the same area. I relocated the extender to various locations within the house, without any improvement. I would like to return the device if possible.",

I have so many devices attached to my router and too many walls between my router and my \"office\" that I had a problem maintaining a signal.

Installation was very simple and once it's up and running, you don't have to do anything else, just turn on the computer and start working. It works great and didn't require a second mortgage to buy it. If you need a better signal in your network, get this. You won't go wrong.",

Reduces bandwidth. I bought this extender to boost up the signal of base router. However, this pice is absolutely useless. This eats up the bandwidth. When I do speedtest with this router I get 0.3 MBPS. when i switch it off and use the base router at same location (which is even far) I get 20 MBPS 3. Freezes up frequently- you have to plug/ unplug to get this back to work. Love it ! avoid it. dont buy !",

In short, I couldn't even get connected to it from my computer via ethernet. The extender never would connect to my brand new TP-Link router (which works like a dream), and the app would never install on my phone. Nothing about this product was worth the hour I spent trying to even get connected to it. I received it today, and I am returning it today. I'll buy something else.",

It does a great job of bringing a big strong signal into the home office, but it's slowed down from the speed coming out of the main router. As much as I'd like to have the fastest signal possible, I'd much rather have a strong signal then a super fast one. It's fast enough and it is never gone down in the almost two months since I've had it.",

But, the signal is not strong enough. The measured signal of my existing wifi was -60ish. Not enough for my needs. So I installed this maybe 50 feet from my AP. And I was disappointed to see that the new SSID was actually weaker than the signal from my AP. After relocating the unit, it did the job. It's compact and fairly easy to setup. Perhaps the tiny size and lack of antenna is the reason for the weak signal.",

A plus is the app that can tell you if it's placed well (in a zone where the original wifi isn't optimal) but beyond that, it's a bust. I have it in the entryway with a metal entry door, and the signal can't get outside. I've had it in the back yard in the alcove with the water heater, and the signal only goes another 30' into the yard. The alcove is made of wood, and has a metal door. It might work better if the signal can escape via a window or wifi-porous wall, but my house isn't set up that way.",
