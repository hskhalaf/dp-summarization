If I didn\u2019t pay so much for the sound bar I would throw it in the trash. No complaints with sound quality. The Bluetooth for a high-end company is nothing but the worst. The remote is even worse. Please do not buy this product. It will save you a lot of grief in the long run. So long Klipsh. You suck",

My primary goal was to NOT have satellite speakers and wires everywhere, and this fit the bill nicely. The sub is wireless and is more than powerful enough. The bass is clean and consistent, and the sound bar itself puts out clear and clean audio. If there's one downside, it's the height of the sound bar, which might require you to have your television on a stand of some sort for it to not cover the bottom of the screen, but that's a non issue for me.",

      "text": "The best of the best. My third purchase of Klipsch sound equipment and the best so far. Makes my old Sony seem like the sound came through and orange juice can and I string. I have to be careful with the bass SW, I get up early and my neighbors can feel the bass in their beds! Pure, clean sound with lots of juice when I need it.",

    "title": "Klipsch R-20B Bluetooth Soundbar with Wireless Subwoofer (Satin Black)",
    "description": "The Klipsch Reference R-20B is designed to quickly connect to most TVs. An included digital optical cable connects to your TV's digital output to the back of the soundbar. For the few TVs without an optical audio output, there is a 2-channel analog input. Once connection to your TV is made, you just plug the soundbar into a standard electrical outlet and turn it on. The built-in Dolby Digital Decoder takes over and allows the Klipsch Reference R-20B to automatically reproduce detailed, high-output sound in almost any size room no matter what format of sound is coming from the TV's output.",
