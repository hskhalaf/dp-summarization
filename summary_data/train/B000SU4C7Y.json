It\u2019s just an acrylic coaster with long double wall! That\u2019s it. Nothing fancy or magical about it. So no surprise that it didn\u2019t keep the white wine nor champaigne chilled for a long time. Only reason we just kept it is because my wife liked the look of it better than the steel chillers. But not quite functional. It\u2019s just wrong to call it a \u201cchiller\u201d as it\u2019s really not.",

It keeps a chilled bottle of wine chilled with no mess. No need for ice. No dripping water. No cleanup. Since we only use it during dinner, I can't speak to how long it will actually keep a bottle chilled but if you're looking for something to keep wine chilled during a meal, this is it. It also hold a champagne bottle nicely. Buying more for Christmas gifts this year.",
