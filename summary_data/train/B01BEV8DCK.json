      "text": "The organizer fit well on the back of the seat in both my Sienna and Tucson (I have to move it from car to car at times). It took awhile to find a tissue box that would fit the pocket. Regular tissue box is too long. Small tissue box (I ordered those from Amazon w/ the hope that it would fit) is too thin and short! Then I saw the Puffs Softpack Plus Lotion Tissue at the supermarket that fit perfectly!!! The tablet holder can hold an 8 inch-tablet. We just put books in there for my daughter who likes to read. Overall, good organizer. Provide extra space and convenience for a quick grab of tissue, water, hand-sanitizer and/or wipes.",

I'm sadly returning it today and continuing my search for a better quality backseat organizer. If it didn't hold up in the box, doubtful it would hold up to my toddler using it.",

I do like the fact that it's a great place to store sunglasses, drinks, and books etc. For my son. Only downfall is that because he's still in a car seat, he can't reach anything. The product is not to blame for that, obviously. Good product overall!",
