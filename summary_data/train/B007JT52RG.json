It works extremely well and facilitates cleaning throughout the house. My only somewhat negative comment is that it is very heavy when filled with water to the half way mark or higher. Solution was simple.... just don't fill it above about 1/2 to 1/3. This is a high quality product at a fair price. The WaveBrake baffles work well to keep the water from sloshing, and the wringer is strong, well designed and probably will last forever. I am a very satisfied customer and recommend the product highly.",

This does help with big messes, but for cleaning a relatively unsoiled floor it seems to add steps that one doesn't wish to take in the monotonousness task of cleaning..",

Also comes with a metal handle to pick up the bucket out the mop sink. The wringer is detachable making pouring much easier and lessen the weight. The wringers geometry and perfect create lots of clamping force without you have to push so hard. Overall very satisfied with this mop bucket.",
