I contacted the seller and was immediately issued a new pair. However, it\u2019s been 6 weeks since receiving the new pair, and they have TORN AGAIN! My husband is 5\u2019 8\u201d and 170, so...pretty average I\u2019d assume. He only wears them indoors, so there is no reason that we should have had this issue. He\u2019s owned several pairs of Ugg slippers in the past and has never had this problem. We will definitely be buying straight from Ugg in the future.",
