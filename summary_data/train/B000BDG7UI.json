      "text": "I bought these to make benches for our dinning room table that did not come with seating. I love these benches!! The legs are easy to assemble and seem very sturdy holding three or more adults easily. The product is so great because you can make these benches however you would like. We made our benches just shy of 7 foot long with 2 - 2x8\" boards each. We also used a hammered metal spray paint for these legs so they look like the metal legs on our table. I would recommend these to anyone wanting to make cheap, sturdy benches!",

I spray painted them black, because the color is really not that awesome. There are a lot of \"flash lines\" that are left over from the injection molding, which you either need to sand/scrape, or just don't look close. My 2x4 (which is more like 1.5x3.5, like all 2x4) sat really loosely in the slot for them, but the screws secure it pretty well, but if the screws go, it will all fall apart.",

You can put outdoor cushions on it, but I like the looks of it plain, and in the winter - I can use it as a bird feeding platform - just throw the seeds on it, instead of freezing while refilling the feeders!",

It seems as though the Suns UV rays has caused the plastic to become brittle . A 6 month life expectancy is very disappointing !",

Next was deciding to paint, or just seal the boards. We sealed them with clear coat 2 applications,,and final application was brushing Man 0 War on them. That brought out the colors in the redwood boards. Nice final product. Took at least overall for paint to dry - 3 days.",

      "text": "One of my picnic table benches fell apart from rot and I replaced it with one using this kit. Building the bench was easy. I bought 5 pieces of pressure-treated lumber. Four were 5 feet long (you can make them any length you desire) and the fifth was 6 inches shorter. Using an electric screwdriver, I was able to screw all the pieces together in no time. The bench is very stable, but also on the heavy side. If I had used cedar, it probably would have been a bit lighter. Next up is the table, which is deteriorating. I plan to use this company's kit for the table.",

The simple design, easy directions and low cost; together with the satisfaction and sense of accomplishment when finished, made it the perfect purchase. Better than expected.",

For our purposes we didn't need something a queen would sit on - just something near his grill so he could flop down between grill peaks/flips. Not only did this assemble easily, it looks finished and expensive. Had we known this thing existed before we bought all of our patio furniture, we would have bought the kits for those as well.

I used a primer then painted over with a color only to discover that it wanted to peel right off. After pressure washing the paint and primer off I started over with a plastic primer which still seems to not want to adhere completely. Other than that, it's a real nifty product!",

Make sure you're ok with the knots and other imperfections found on all lumber. Use a rubber mallet if things get tight . a few screws zipped in and you're good to go. It can get heavy so an extra pair hands to help is always nice.",
