The PleatCo is not a replacement for a Hayward. I never did work right. I contacted the people at Hayward and they told me that the PleatCo would not work, and they were right. I installed the Hayward cartridge and had good results right away. Note; this is intended to be a lifetime filter. The Hayward web site says to wash it with dish detergent as body oils and suntan lotions will clog it.",

I'm chalking it up to a bad decision on my part but wanted to warn others. I will go to my pool store next season to get a REAL Hayward cartridge - it will cost me more but at least I know it will work.",

And like many other reviewers have stated, these filters do not fit correctly. These were EXTREMELY difficult to seat and they vibrated so badly that we had to put duct tape around the top of the filter housing. I purchased the filters from the seller in 2018 and those filters were off brand, but fit fine. This will be my last purchase from this opportunistic seller.",

Had no issue with the fit, keeps the water clean like filters are supposed too, easy to clean and the price is amazing. Definitely switching over to this one for now on...why pay more for something that basically does nothing but traps dead bugs, my daughter's and her friends never ending hair and everything else nasty. It cleans it all and does the job at a better price.",

The new filter really makes a difference. Thanks!",
