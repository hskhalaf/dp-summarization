The color blended seamlessly into my fair skin tone and shrank pimples fast. Sometimes I didn\u2019t even need to put powder on over it. Both times I bought it from Amazon, however, it looked orange when I blended it in to my skin \u2013 even under powder. I don\u2019t know what went wrong with the version Amazon is selling, but it is hot garbage. I cannot stress this enough \u2013 IF YOUR COVER-UP LOOKS ORANGE, IT\u2019S FAKE/A BAD BATCH. Buy elsewhere; it\u2019s worth the few extra dollars.",

      "text": "On my 62nd birthday I was gifted 3 zits which was a shock since I haven't had a breakout in a long, long, long time. I didn't know what to use to get rid of the annoying scourge and happened upon this medicated concealer so decided to give it a try. In just a couple of days 2 were gone completely and the 3rd was hardly noticeable. The coverage is light, not thick or cakey, yet conceals very well and it blends perfectly with my tinted moisturizer (also Neutrogena). I'm so glad I bought this miracle in a tube, however I hope I don't need to use it again anytime soon!",

You don't cover anything unless you put a lot, which is not good either.

This listing is cheaper than drug store prices, which sort of offsets the tiny volume of product. With daily use, it'll last a month tops, depending on how much coverage you need.

It is so pink-based that I need to put a green color corrector over or underneath it in order for the area in which I applied it to match the rest of my face. My only remarks on this are that you need a green concealer or face primer in order to use this product to counteract the pink. I would recommend that Neutrogena make more yellow-based products in general as well.",
