I visited a dermatologist that identified the tea tree as the culprit and told me it is not uncommon for people to come in with allergic reactions to ingredients that are more natural (e.g., tea tree oil, lavender, eucalyptus). As soon as I stopped using it, my skin was okay. Not everyone will react this way, it'll be case by case.",

      "text": "I purchased this as I wanted a soothing body wash and read all reviews. I have given it 2 stars as the product works wonderfully, but, I cannot stand the smell. Having used many tea tree products previously, I expected a gentle pleasant scent. For me, and I am admittedly sensitive, this has the odor of a petroleum distillate. When I opened the well packaged product, removing the safety seals, I was immediately hit with a whiff of Naptha or mineral spirits. I would never use this on my face.",
