Sturdy, snapped together wonderfully, did its job right? I just ordered the Mathlink Builders, TOTALLY different plastic. The linking blocks aren't sturdy, they swivel when you stack them, you can't push them together with ease (6 and 7yos) and they are slightly bigger. The last thing I need for learning is the kids getting frustrated and being \"done.\" I did not expect them to be this way. Items can be used, but with help and not independently anymore.",

I can see how these would be great in helping to learn math, counting, sorting, etc. The only negative was how hard they snapped together and came apart at times. The kids tended to need help. Hoping they get easier with use.",
