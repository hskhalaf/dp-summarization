I installed the WFS-1000 under our coffee-bar sink to provide filtered drinking water and clean tasting water for tea and our espresso maker. What a difference! Great clean taste with the double carbon filters. The WFS-1000 is super easy to install. Since I wanted to filter all the cold water coming out of our faucet, I replaced the provided push-to-connect fittings with 3/8 OD Tube compression x 1/4 MIP brass fitting which allowed me to connect right to standard supply lines. Flow rate is great - as is the water!",

I prefer not having the same two filters in stages 2 and 3.

As for the construction - The parts are definitely better than what you get from the box store brands. The faucet is stainless steel construction and not the plastic stuff you usually get with other brands. Overall I am very pleased.",

I had this info late and it was draining water almost 24/7. I use water well and normal pressure for my system is 30/50; it means, when pressure was less then 40 the auto valve was open for draining. A waste. I installed this APEC WFS-1000 longer then a month and water doesn't taste as good as the one from reverse-osmosis but is better then plain. I\u2019ll be using all three carbon filters to improve quality since I have a sediment one for the whole house.",

The installer said the fittings are of high quality, and after using it for about a month, I can vouch for the excellent taste of the water that comes through it. My only gripe is that it took a long time for the water to run clear of the sediment from inside the filter -- more like a week or two of use, not the paltry 5 minutes of letting the water run that is recommended by the manufacturer. However, that's finally over, and we're very happy with the system.",

In my opinion this is the best bang for your buck when it comes to affordable 3 stage filters. The water tastes great. My wife and I compared it to the bottled water we used to purchase and we couldn't believe how much better our filtered water tastes. The bottled water tastes almost chemical like compred to our new apec system. I'm super happy that we bought this brand, highly reccommend.",

There is a marginal diminished flow caused by the filtration, but it fills bottles twice as fast as our bottled water unit or a Brita Filter-As-You-Pour model. The only real \"downside\" is the water temperature is as it comes into the house, which in some climates can be particularly warm. Still, ideal for tea and coffee.",

Installation was easy with clear instructions - supplied materials are high quality. Our kitchen sink is above the basement and I mounted the filtration system on the basement wall below. The unit came with ample tubing to make this work and this not only saved me cabinet space under the sink but it also makes the filters very easy to swap out. Great unit, reasonable price, good quality - recommended.",

However, my only problem was with the shut-off adapter that was provided with the filter--it leaked and I ended up damaging the rubber washer when I removed and reinstalled it. Since it connects to the faucet shut-off valve already in place, I thought it was unnecessary. So, I went to the local hardware store and picked up an adapter with a 1/4\" outlet to hook up the filter. I believe it would be a good idea for Apex to dump the extra shut-off valve and include this simple 1/4\" adapter with the package. Sometimes less is more.",
