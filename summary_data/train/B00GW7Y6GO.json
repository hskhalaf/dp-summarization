      "text": "I am planning to travel to catch northern lights in Canada and am very worrying about the climate which is below -30C. After a thorough review of softshells, I chose this one. I am not an outdoor person so a bit worried about wearing this after the travel, but that worry went away when I tried on. It fits very well, no point of uncomfortableness, warm, well stretched. Now my only worry is Korea is not so cold in winter anymore due to global warming, so maybe I need to travel out to the cold countries in the winter just to wear this on!",

Ideally I would return it for a size up, but I'm lazy and this one fits okay enough so I'm keeping it. Size up if you're unsure!",
