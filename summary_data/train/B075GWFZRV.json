It was very difficult carrying him around the house with me all day. I watched a YouTube video of how to wrap an infant who cannot hold their head up and this wrap became my lifesaver. He fussed a little while I tucked him in, but he would always fall asleep within mins. I highly recommend this wrap if you need both hands free and want to comfortably wear your baby.",

My cat loves it especially being able to walk around with me and still cuddle. I really like it because I can use my hands for other things. It's a win-win.",

After taking 15 minutes to put the baby on my chest and the toddler in a buggie to run inside a store in South Louisiana September heat and humidity, I was exhausted for the day! This is a great product if you want a wrap for inside the house, and for baby to feel your closeness.. but for errands, my suggestion would be another easier product, or just wait until the baby can fit in a faster wrap before shopping!",

I make sure his head and neck is really supported. The key for me is wrap it as tight as you can. The wrap will stretch to accommodate him. Took me about 3 times wrapping before I really felt I had the hang of it. This is the first baby item I have felt like I\u2019ll be getting my moneys worth out of! Love it!!!",

I started putting it on before I leave the house so I don't have to drag it across the ground. The material is super soft and is a great quality for the price. I'm not sure why would pay $50+ for a more well known name brand when this one works perfect!",
