It comes in at around 600 pieces (592 to be exact) and is for ages 9-16. It can be built as either a tow truck or a forklift but not both at the same time. What makes this more realistic and for older LEGO fans is the design is more detailed. More pieces more in different directions and the designs are more true to design. My son loves that it looks so real and moves up and down.",

I'm not sure we had the Technic sets when I was growing up, it was more just the traditional blocks with a few one-off parts here and there. We were lucky enough to get some Star Wars type space ship back then and we were more than excited. I have always loved the detailed instructions that LEGO provides. They are far superior to anything their competitors have and that is important for little kids.",
