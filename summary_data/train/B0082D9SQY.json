The stain stays on for several hours after the balm has soaked in and/or wears off, but it came off easily with a makeup remover wipe. This was a nice change from some other stains that I've tried that are a pain to remove. It also stained a nice consistent color, not blotchy like some stains can be. It comes in many colors and I have almost all of them, but Honey is my favorite! Love this product!!!",

You will also need a lip liner otherwise, the stain will bleed out. It also didn't last as long as the matte sticks.",
