The cats like it, of course (as if they didn't, nothing else would matter). It's a good size. It's the smallest we've had, but our 16+ pound cat jumps in and out happily.

Right now I'd say yes...however if there is a box out there the same size, with a hood, that has a stronger plastic material I would trade this one for that instantly!",

This kitten will probably grow to a smallish cat as his mom and probable dad are small. Our other cat has an extra large box because he is big and the kitten was afraid of that box. The bottom on this one is rather deep, but the hood fits on a small shallower pan for now and I have confidence that he will convert to the cool sifter portion when he gets a little taller. I'm still keeping an eye on him, but he is doing fine with the hood minus the flap.",

      "text": "I purchased this brand litter box before and had it for several years before the plastic began to crack. The ease of cleaning the box is much better than using a traditional box with a scooper. However this new box seems to be poorly made compared to the last one that was store bought. The locking tabs that attach the hood to the pan are essentially useless. If you put your trust in them, one day you\u2019ll end up with a box full of litter spilled when the tabs fail. If they can engineer some locking tabs that would work and maybe a thick mil plastic for the pan you\u2019d have a AAA litter box here",
