Once we were done I pulled it out and hooked it up. right away it had an fatal error code. It is completely unusable. I followed the prompt and called for a REFURBISHED replacement, which I have to pay for, Still haven't received the new one. I looked online for a solution to the error and apparently it is very common with this model whether on start up or over time. You are taking a pretty big risk with this model.",

This was fixed by switching the input selection back and forth once, or by turning off both machines and turning them back on. After that, projector has no problem communicating with that same device.",

As far as shift and zoom are concerned, just buy a decent mount, use the calculator on Epson's website and you should be in good shape.",

      "text": "I've been using this projector for over a year in my home theater. My only issue has been with the noise emitted from the automatic iris. I have this mounted on a 7 foot ceiling, about a foot in front of the seating area. During movies you can hear the clicking noise from the iris as it adjusts to the picture. This is a known \"issue\". Since moving the projector is not an option, I've disabled the automatic iris with negligible impact on the picture quality.",

      "text": "I wanted a projected which was in the $1000 range but could work during the day as well as the evening. Doing the day \"normal\" mode is required and I set the image mode to Living Room. It can be a bit loud but with the sound system on loud, you don't notice the noise of the projector. At night I use \"eco\" mode. The projector noise is very low and the image is still perfect, especially in cinema mode (best for night). The overall image quality is awesome, especially with FULL HD movies and games! Configuration was very easy too. An awesome projector!",

If I could have placed it out of the way I might have been okay with the extra background noise. 2) The zoom capability was so small (1.2:1) I had to have the projector within 14' of my screen. This limited the placement and how the family gathers around for a movie.",

However with this pictures are smooth, and you get the feeling like you are truly in a cinema. Cons: There is more noise than the previous unit I owned. It never bothers me but you certainly notice it when the projector is the only thing on. Thats it.",
