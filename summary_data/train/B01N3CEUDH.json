UPDATE AS OF 9/27/19 Since I've purchased this product I have saved ALOT of money in heating and cooling costs. The app allows you to control it while away from home, set a schedule and at what settings your comfortable with, and shows how much energy was used in a monthly basis.

I adusted on this thing for 3 days and could not get it to function correctly. The problem is the temperature would warm up too fast ( on the thermometer of the thermostat ), the AC would come on and then very quickly within 5 minutes the temperature reading would come down causing the AC to shut off. I place 3 other thermostats close by to check, they all matched each other but not the thermostat one. Contacted customer support but did not receive a reply. My unit cycled on and off way too often.",
