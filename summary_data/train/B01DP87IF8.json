Well, after no more than 5-10 minutes (probably not that long) I was pulling up clumps of hair. I did about 3-4 passes down the drain and voila, it worked!! Water ran straight down the drain! No pooling in the sink! Try these before you call that plumber. It worked !",

      "text": "So after reading so many glowing reviews I was desperate to try this for my tub! However not only did it not work as well as expected .... as I was trying to pull it out it broke! I now have an unattainable long piece of plastic in my tub drain with absolutely no hope of retrieving it! :( Don't buy this cheap plastic product! I know you may be as tempted as I was to try it but unless you would like to chance it and have it break off in your drain which will further compound future clogs DO NOT USE THIS... complete waste of money.",

The problem with this tool is that it is too wide to fit in my drains and the teeth don't protrude enough to get hair clogs out. I kept wondering if the tool was going to break because the plastic material is not extremely bendable. My zipper tool began to break which would have caused a problem getting stuck down in the sink. Also, I would recommend the brusher tools. My bathroom sink drain needed cleaning all over. Good type of tool. Too wide, teeth too short, product prone to breaking.",
