There was limitation to adjust toe a certain degree. Specially the rear wheel is too much toe-in condition. Battery runs about 10 min (not measured exactly) and my kids is pleasant enough with this running time. Another notice, wheel bearing, which is made of plastic. It should be more advanced one in this range of price RC vehicle.",

Bought new stainless dogbones, inserted and ran in the for 2 batteries, saw it was running with rear axle only. lost another dogbone... ordered longer dogbones... way to much work for a new car.

My terriers chase this all over the back yard. We have about 2/3 of an acre and this truck soars through the grass. The 4 wheel drive makes it turn fast and sharp and allows it to go through even high grass. The battery life is not the greatest (about 15 minutes), but the nice part about this truck is that essentially all of the parts are replaceable/upgrade-able. Even though it was a little on the expensive side, I think it is totally worth the cost for this fun machine!",

I simply wanted to enter the rc world without buying a ridiculously priced item and have been thoroughly pleased with this product. The bent shock will be replaced for 12$. So to see a special needs kid smile as much as he does when driving this truck, I say thank you Redcat!! Great buy and highly recommended for any newcomers!",
