This toaster only does half of that job. One side is lightly toasted and the other side is untoasted. If I crank up the setting, sometimes nothing changes. At other times I get bread that is lightly toasted on one side and burnt on the other. I have read reviews of this product stating that it will toast evenly, which is why I purchased it. Unfortunately, my toaster won't toast:( However, it does look nice and it does have several attractive buttons and knobs.",

We plugged it in, put our first piece of toast in - and it only toasted one-side, the sea as the one we were replacing. Of course, going through the same process, in reverse, would be astronomical,....so I'm going to have to recycle it. Stay away from this product. Unfortunately I can't give it a '0'.",

First, the toaster is not very deep and my large bagels stick out slightly and to not toast evenly. It's not a deal breaker but I've never seen a toaster this shallow before. The other thing is that when you lift the handle to lift the toast high enough to extract it, it does not raise it very much. Again, not a deal breaker and it is adequate if one is careful. It other regards, this toaster seems better than any other one I've had before.",

For example at 2pm it gives medium toasting. The slots are fairly wide to accommodate bagels but they way the slots are designed thinner bread is held securely. Seems well made for the price and looks good. I deducted a star because larger bread sticks a little out of the top. It could have been about 1/2 inch taller. Not really a problem as most items fit and I can turn down the control and flip the toast midway. Would recommend",

Also, my old toaster has a bagel setting where only the inner part of the bagel would get toasted and the outside would not. This toaster has a bagel setting, but it just slightly lowers the temperature, but still toasts all sides of the bagel, so I find bagels get burned on the outside and not fully toasted on the inside. Would not recommend if you use the toaster a lot, however I do love the pop of color on my counter.",

It's not perfect, but it's abouth the only dark gray \"metallicy\" toaster we could find. The defrost then toast feature actually worked surprisingly well, not a gimmick. I don't judge a toaster by \"eveness\", so don't even ask. As long as a piece of toast comes out with some sort of tan color on each side, I'm happy. I don't care if it's even across the whole side or from side to side...it's toast.",
