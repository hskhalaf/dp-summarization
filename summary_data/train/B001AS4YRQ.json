It is not for a serious body builder as the weight does not go high enough but for most who want to get in better condition at home it works quite well. I'm very happy with it. I used to life quite heavily and run marathons/triathlons but with a lower back injury and pinched nerve those days are behind me. This helps to keep me in shape and give me relief from the pain. Highly recommended.",

The booklet they give is a pain to look up how to do the exercises...they should include a poster or something of that nature. I\u2019ve already sweat stained the booklet. Like all us consumers, we go through the pain of assembling such products that we are discouraged to take it apart and box it up neatly for a return.

When this happened he knew a new one was needed. It wasn't too hard to put together as all the parts are clearly marked. Even at our age, we had it together in a few hours. This one has many more features and is pleasing to the eye.",

If you want to spend the money and really only want upper body the rest of the machine is good. I really wanted squats but husband likes upper body.",

So, it is a system that should get better and better with time and familiarity. For the price, it is hard to beat.",

Assembly was straight forward with the only a slight hick-up with cable/pulley system. I didn't pay enough attention and had to redo a section. I wish Bowflex would include posters with the different exercises on them like previous models. I would certainly recommend this unit to anyone, especially if they can get it on one of the sales.",

      "text": "I have been using for 60 days. Very happy with purchase. Solid machine, built well. Have been working out for 30+ years with free weights. Now I am mixing up my workouts with the Bowflex and free weights. Love the Bowflex because you don't have to worry about a spotter, the 310 lbs is great for bench flys and other chest exercises, bicep and tricip work. At some point will probably need to go to 410 but mixing it up provide a great workout for next 10 years!",

Two people are better than one for assembly, but I did okay by myself. The one thing you need to remember, the maximum resistance is 210 pounds, which is plenty for most folks.",
