The heater is strong enough to keep hot water warm for an extra 10 to 15 minutes or so, which in total gives me a nice 20 to 25 minute foot bath. I'd give this five stars if it were just a bit less expensive. It's not pricey for what you get, but it's not exactly a steal, either. Overall, I'm very happy with this.",

      "text": "I had been using a deep plastic foot tub for my footbath, so thought this might be an improvement. But even with the electric booster this tub does not keep the water warm any longer. Instead, because there is less water, it cools down faster. I usually soak my feet while watching TV, but the noise from this machine gets in the way, The bubbles are nice, but not worth the racket. It comes with pedicure tools. but most women will already have them, The most important feature is the water temperature, and this fails the test.",

This is a budget way to recreate a spa like pedicure but it doesn't work. This would be cute for a spa-type birthday party but not for repeated use. The kit that comes with it is okay but these are items that can be purchased at the dollar store so they don't necessarily stand out as a reason to rate this product higher.",

I selected this to help my cost-cutting efforts; its relaxing and does well but not as pampering as aSpa visit. It keeps me somewhat pampered with bucks in my pocket without tips, upsell temptations, etc The toe-control is a plus and I KNOW my germs are mine. The equipment cleaning process and frequency at some spas DO scare me.",
