There are a range of games and video services available through the Oculus store (most are chargeable) and all offer a different experience. For \u00a360 this is a real must have experience for anyone with an S6/S7 and has made me very excited for the more powerful VR systems coming out later in the year.",

It even has a vr cinema where you can watch movies and videos stored on your phone. Both picture and sound is amazing. Defo recommend headphones to immerse yourself fully into the experience.
