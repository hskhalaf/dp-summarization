      "text": "This scanner is a workhorse. I've scanned more than 1200 books so far (bindings removed) with very little trouble. The scanner does a nice job of dealing with minor page deformities (tears, stuck pages). The software is flaky and requires a reboot far too frequently. I wish the scanner had a larger paper capacity or the software had the ability to stitch PDFs together (most books generated three or more PDF files that had to be manually combined later). Does not scan to Word format at all, just PDF, JPG, or TIFF; however, it can be set to do character recognition within the PDF setting.",

It was at a time when I needed to finish a lot of scanning (!!) and decided to replace with the same GS-50, but it was no longer available. This machine is very good and scans very speedily. The quality of scans is as good as the GS-50. I'm sure it can do a lot of things better but have not played too much with it as its used primarily for office scanning of documents. Cons: Price. Its expensive. In this world electronics, I'm surprised it would cost this much.",

The next level person, after nearly two hours on the phone with him, said it could not be done. My assistant finally clicked something that was not in the instructions and it worked. If it weren't for lousy, uninformed tech support, I would give this scanner a higher rating.",

This is definitely a high functioning scanner and great if you have a lot of paperwork to scan in. The program is also very easy to use. Definitely worth the price, I would highly recommend this scanner.",
