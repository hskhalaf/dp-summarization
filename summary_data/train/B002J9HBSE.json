The netting on the left side isn't really big enough to fit my Nalgene, so I just stuff my water bottle in the backpack. The problem with this backpack is that, while it fits 17\" laptops, it isn't sturdy enough to carry them around. After four months of use, the stitching in the bottom right corner has come undone, making about a 2 inch hole. It's a shame, because this is the least obnoxious-looking backpack I could find that will fit an alienware 17. Maybe I'll give SwissGear a shot...",

I ended up placing a rolled up t shirt on the bottom for cushion. All in all, a great budget backpack. Would recommend.",

      "text": "Just needed a simple bag to carry my laptop to work and back. Works pretty well, has plenty of room for laptop, charger, a couple other cables and a notepad and pens. It doesn't feel likes it's really high quality or anything but should hold up fine for what I use it for. If you're looking to carry your laptop on a bike ride or hiking or something I don't think this is the bag that you want. My only real complaint is that the shoulder straps are too short to wear it comfortably on my back, I'm a pretty big guy though.",

The multiple pockets are very useful. I like the water bottle holder. It has served me well for over a year and seems sturdy enough to keep going for a while. I lug it all over and throw it around in airport security - no issues.",

It's hard to explain--basically when I open it, I keep expecting the zipper to keep going, but it stops at the top. There is probably a reason, like maybe it keeps the computer in better.",

      "text": "Bag is only a laptop bag, great for carrying your 17\" laptop (if you still use something that big) and its accessories. It is very thin so spare set of clothes and a water bottle is not going to fit. Not ideal for long travelling. Another one of those laptop back packs from a laptop manufacturer. Material is good however I wish it had more space. Stress the bag with weight and seems will start to tear.",
