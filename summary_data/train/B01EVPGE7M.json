Unfortunately, I read comments and reviews of the shirt on site, and there were many comments that advised that the shirt ran very small, and advised buyers to purchase a size or two larger than they would usually buy. Because of that, I purchased 2 shirts; size XL and size XXL. When the shirts arrived, the XL was too large, and the XXL was HUGE. I had to return both shirts for refund, and now I don't know if I can even order the same shirt in a size Large, which is what I should have ordered to begin with.",

It was about right in the shoulders and arms but the length fell just to my waistline, making it a bit too small to tuck in without expecting it to un-tuck when sitting to standing.",
