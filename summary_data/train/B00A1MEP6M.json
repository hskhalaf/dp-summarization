      "text": "Got this waffle iron in July of 2017 and when fixing breakfast for family the day after christmas it blew up. When opening the lid the wires touched because of a design flaw and blew flames out the back! Do not buy. When sent email to Oster gave us a standard reply that they had too much volume to contact us. We then called the 800 number and were told to much volume and please call back. This item was not used that much to blow out flames causing a fire hazard. Would have gave zero stars but that's not allowed!",

Power cord wraps up behind for compact storage. The only little complain is that yes it stands upright to store away in small kitchen areas but it doesn't lock together. When it's standing, it has a gap between the two halves and it feels as if it could open up while standing. It would surely take an intentional knock for it to fall open but I'm just saying. It's not enough to take off a star. I'm still happy with it.",

It heats up so high that it's impossible to touch without oven mitts, so forget about letting kids help make waffles. In almost every single instance, the batter stuck to the top and bottom and instead of having delicious waffles to enjoy, I was scraping it off the waffle maker. This is true even with oiling and spraying it. On the few occasions we did manage to have a decent waffle made, it was flat and unenjoyable. Save yourself the aggravation and do not buy this item. While inexpensive, it is nevertheless not worth the money. Truly disappointed.",

It was easy to store as it stands vertically. However, I purchased this in January 2018 for my birthday and it stopped working a few days ago in April 2018. I'll probably get another that's how much I loved this waffle maker.",

It makes perfect waffles, it is a good size so it doesn't take up too much storage room but still produces nicely sized waffles. The only thing I would prefer is if I could detach the little griddle to wash it thoroughly. The instructions say to just wipe clean, but I also have to spray cooking spray/oil so the waffle doesn't stick, that becomes greasy and messy, but I cannot thoroughly clean it as I cannot put the whole waffle maker under the sink water.",
