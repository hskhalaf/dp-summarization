      "text": "Great rock climbing pad. I was deciding between a double or a triple and I'm happy that I went with the triple. It is super light and easy to carry. I'm a 5'6 tall woman and have no problem scrambling over rocks with it on my back on the way to my bouldering spot. It's fairly stiff but I like it that way, and I have not rolled my ankle yet landing on it. I would definetly recommend this pad, especially for the price.",

      "text": "This was the perfect add-on for a fellow climber to carry. I use the Mad Rock R3, Mad Rock Duo, and the Mad Rock Triple Mad Pad to cover a large area when bouldering. The built in velcro attachment sleeves help fill the gaps with other Mad Rock pads, and this has been a very useful piece of equipment to round out covering large fall zones. Be aware that this does not have storage pockets, and is large. I generally have someone carry this separately, and have been very happy with the feel of the foam when climbing.",

I was looking at getting a crash pad BUT this is even better, light weight, portable for photo shoots and overall well built ! I also got this over a crash pad because of its dual use for luxury camping , as a 6ft tall person I needed something longer. If I could change anything it would be the color ;) Highly recommend this product",

Just remember to bend your knees before letting go and falling. The sofa option on it is also surprisingly comfortable. I really hope they restock this. The Madrock website wont ship to Alaska, and i have to order it from Amazon. Please restock this so I can buy 2 more!!",
