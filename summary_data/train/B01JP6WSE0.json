The lid comes off completely rather than having hinges which was something I didn't consider and don't really think works for us.",

The only way it will work is if I leave it in on place forever because I can't use the bottom panels (the correct way is too big to fit, the other way is too small and they fall out) and I can't divide the toys because the dividers are also the wrong size. I paid $60 for a toy box that appears to have been made with $5. Waste of money.",
