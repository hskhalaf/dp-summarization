I would suggest getting a protection plan with these headphones because headphones can be unpredictable. Update: I've had these earphones for 8 months and they aren't working now...

The magnetic buds stick together when I'm not using them, which makes them nearly impossible to lose. The battery life is amazing. I use them all day long and only charge at night.

      "text": "These Beats X headphones are really amazing. You can hear base but it\u2019s not thumping like other Beats products like you would expect. Great music output. Transfer does not lag or have any noticeable difference from hearing music right from phone. When talking it sounds like I\u2019m on headphones but no noticeable outside noise or interference. Was told I was coming in crisp and clean over the phone on the headphones. Controls work really easily and if you have an iPhone, Siri you can do all sorts of things. If you want more base then maybe you should get the PowerBeats 3 or etc. They have a little more base to them. I highly recommend these if you are searching.",

Nevertheless, they now refuse to turn on. There is no visible damage, and no notable incident between when they worked fine yesterday to when they didn't work this morning. This same scenario happened with the first pair. I'd sent them back to Apple they sent back photos showing \"damage\" that was not there before I sent the pair in. I'm expecting the same with this pair. Save your money, don't buy these.",

It's also hard to know if they're on or off, you have to take them off to see if the light is on. They're also too long and gangly.",

Highly recommend paying the slight extra and opting for the Powerbeats, since these Beatsx sound comparable to the Apple earbuds included with your iPhone. Though as usual, the packaging and out of box experience is superb, I just wish the Beatsx were on the same level as the rest of the product line",

I have had mine replaced question-free by Apple about three times now, so if that is part of their business model on these, I would say the A+ customer support and warranty service (free replacement) is worth the price.",

Easy control of volume. Then a week ago, they just stopped connecting to my phone's bluetooth. I've done all the troubleshooting. I've downloaded the new updates from the Beats website...but sadly, they no longer link to my phone. For $100, they should not suddenly stop working. This seems consistent with other reviewers.",

Though these stay in, you might be othered with the strap hanging on your neck. It drives me a little crazy, but okay with a collared shirt.",

The bluetooth connection is a tad bit awkward, I have to do it via the iPhone setting 30% of the time--but it could be because I'm not sure if I've already turned off/on the headset.",

Never had any other issues with them, until today when the right ear bud stopped working. So I got one year and four months out of headphones that costed $99.95, when I bought them.
