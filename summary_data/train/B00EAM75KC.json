But now that I have been out in the rain, cold and overall miserable sleet, i can say this jacket is pretty amazing. It is very waterproof. The fold out hood provided decent cover, as well as concealing perfectly in the collar. And best of all it is very warm. I actually have to make sure not to over do it with layers as the bonus feature of being waterproof also does a good job at insulating the air in. Very pleased with overall mobility and visibility at night.",

Will probably last 3 seasons! Great for snow blowing the driveway. Kept me warm and protected from snow flying down the back with the hood. Great jacket for $40!!!",

Neck area does have soft material & looks to be well made. Would classify this as a \"heavy\"safety windbreaker for active type work. I do have long arms, but sleeves are not too short, cuffs/waist band are tight to keep wind/rain/snow out. IMO, with a couple layers added underneath will be warm enough in 20-30 degree temps in mild winds. Lost one star, due to missing Zipper!! WTH Its 98degrees outside so I can wait....again.",
