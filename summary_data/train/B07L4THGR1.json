However, if the speaker has a low pitched voice and speaks loudly, this headset will turn their voice into a disturbing fuzzy blur -- where words may be difficult to make out.

I use it mainly for talking being its a mono headset, but the quality sound for playing music is fine. Doesn't take long to charge, provides extended hours of talk time when used at full charge. The only complaint I have is the band doesn't adjust to the size of your head. Overall a great product.",

I had no problems hearing others, but when I spoke to them, they said it sounded like I was in a tunnel and was static-filled. It was also not seamless between 2 devices. I returned this headset. I bought another headset from ICOMTOFIT that is less bulky for $39.99. People can hear me clearly, it has much better quality and connection between 2 devices, and I can wear it all day without charging.",

Connects quickly no interference and I can walk around my house and other rooms in my house without loosing connection or clarity and I do have a 2300 square foot home.

The cushion on the earpiece softens the feel of placing it in the charger. There's no click or snap to know that it's seated properly and when the microphone is vertical it is hard to see the led light indicate it's charging. Other than that, this is a good product that is priced MUCH better than other headsets on Amazon.",

      "text": "This headset exceeded my expectations. I tested this out for music (using Google play) and works well! Volume buttons easy to use, and easy to switch right into a call when I get one. The mute function is also nice on this, you flip the mouthpiece up and it mutes for you. Just as easy, flips down and unmutes. This also doesn't have the annoying delays most other headsets I have tried have, so this is a huge plus for me on conference calls.",

I'd advise against this headset, look for something that works better. The only positive thing I can say for it is that the battery life was actually decent.",

The charger is awesome and it maintains a charge for a great deal of time. Its comfortable but could stand to be a little tighter but that's a matter of individual opinion.
