I wish they had of been made more durable,but for the price what should I expect? The strings were hanging so it wasn't hemmed. I'm not sure if they will last a week with this boy because he is quite the Dennis the Menace type,lol..I got the X-Small and they fit me, but I have tiny hands for a grown woman too! They do have the adjustable velcro straps and were comfortable. Cute monster design on the top.",

But they are my son's bacteria farm and he gives them 5 stars. Maybe I'd give the sticky things 1 star because they have lasted much longer than expected as well as retained their color and stitching through dozens of washes. Unfortunately, my son stands by 5 stars because of what he describes as awesome color and design that are comfy to wear while he uses the restroom.",

He is very specific about what he wants and has about a dozen different gloves (not including any winter gloves.) So when he got these, he loved them! They fit just right. They have the right amount of flexibility and he didn't have a fingerless pair before for summer cycling. They are super thin and he says very comfortable. They will keep his hands free of scraps and cuts in the summer for sure!",

Aside from the size, they seem to be decent gloves for the purpose I bought them for (skating and biking). Something to give the hand a bit of protection without the bulkiness of many other gloves. I gave lower stars based on the sizing issue and that the description should be reflect an age range versus generalized terms.",

Aside from the size, they seem to be decent gloves for the purpose I bought them for (skating and biking). Something to give the hand a bit of protection without the bulkiness of many other gloves.
