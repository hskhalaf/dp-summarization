Pro: - come with correct clip - are good platform pedals. - all metal construction Cons: - They are very heavy - not the easiest to get out of when slowing down. - Have very tall platform on both sides, I had to trim the grip down with a dremel to make it work with my shoes. - do not spin very easily. I have heard that it is intentional so that they will stay upright while clipping in and out.",

Why would you put teeth on the clip side? Makes no sense. Then the screws that insert into the shoes seem to be made of soft metal and strips easily. Also, when turning the axle, there is almost a friction grittiness to them--the Shimano's turn with smoothness. I ended up getting some Shimano pedals PD-M324 instead. Much better quality for only $20 more. You get what you pay for!",

I guess you get what you pay for sometimes. These would be great for a leisure bike or a child's starter pedal. They are definitely better than toe-clips but these ones in particular are not very durable. Don't pay more than $25 to $30 for them or it's a waste. Go with Shimano if you can.",

I like the versatility these pedals offer as well as the fact that they are significantly cheaper than similar shimano pedals.

The only negative I would have is that they are very tricky to get used to because the cleat side tends to fall to the bottom when your shoes aren't clipped in, making clipping back in kind of tricky. This was exacerbated by the fact that they were my first clipless pedals so I wasn't used to doing this anyway.",

They are about 4 3/8 inches wide vs 4 inches for the similar Shimano pedal. I have the Shimano pedal on my bike, so I just swapped with her, giving her several more degrees of lean in a banking turn.

It takes some getting used to, but having the platforms on the other side have helped on those short runs when I just can't get my shoes locked in. Seem to be well built, and they included a pair of SPD cleats which worked with my super small budget.",

You can only notice it when spinning by hand and can't feel it when on the bike. Plan to buy two more sets for other bikes. They are work great!!!",
