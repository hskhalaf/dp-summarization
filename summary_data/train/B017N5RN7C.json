I really wanted to like these shoes, but they were just too uncomfortable because of the tightness on the toes. I had to return the shoes.",

Needless to say they were ruined and this is his second pair that he specifically asked for. We did have to go up a half size for his comfort, but that might just be personal preference. Highly recommend these.",

      "text": "I wore New Balance M587 and it's predecessor since 1993. I find something I like and I do not want to change. That shoe has been discontinued. Finding a shoe that fits and is comfortable is a daunting task. I went to a shoe finder program on another website. It suggested this shoe. I purchased it on Amazon because it was lower in price. I like this shoe better than the New Balance M587. I am not a runner but I stand a lot in my part time job and I walk, so I cannot tell you how well it performs while running in them.",
