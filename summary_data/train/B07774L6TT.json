Bezels are not as thin as advertised by the pictures (Hate when manufacturers do that.) Use google to search for calibrating your monitor. It will walk you through calibrating the monitor if you are using Windows 10. Also make sure to go into windows display settings to set the monitor to 75hz. The monitor is smooth in gaming and I really can notice a bit of difference with 75hz. At $87 I would say that it's worth it after calibration.",

My bonus came in the fact that it has simple builtin speakers. The Ubuntu server has never had sound as it has no audio card or output. However, the server recognized the HDMI and was able to funnel sound out to this monitor. Now I can test apps on the server and hear them. Sweet.",

The ONLY drawback really that others have mentioned is the onboard speakers arent really that loud or concise. Im not a fan of outboard speakers as im not hardcore and i have an asus monitor with onboard speakers and that one is awesome! But more expensive of course. So overall, i would reccommend this monitor and if you are an avid sound fan then i would expect to buy external speakers as well.",

      "text": "Very satisfied with my purchase. I bought it as a second monitor, and it does the job. It's a rather unspectacular monitor - but that's OK for the price. It delivers full 1080p, has built in VESA mount, 2x HDMI and VGA. I've had it 2 months and it hasn't failed. The blue LED light however is HORRIBLE- as in offensively bright - it's like a laser beam in the dark. Almost warrants -1 star, but the fix is so easy (tiny bit of black tape) I'll give them a pass.",

The monitor I actually got has a 1/2\" thick, ugly bezel on it. Since the thin bezel is what swayed me to Spectre instead of better brands, all I can say is ya got me Spectre. Never again.",
