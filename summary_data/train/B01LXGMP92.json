      "text": "I think this pump is going to work great for pumping diesel fuel from a 5 gallon plastic fuel can to my tractor. However, I do want to mention that the fuel filter WILL NOT FIT in a 5 gallon Briggs and Stratton diesel fuel can. I think I read on a review that it will fit a 5 gallon can - but, again, not in a Briggs and Stratton. I am going to have to find a smaller filter to fit on the intake fuel line. Otherwise, the pump and assembly seem well made and should work well. I plan to get a small 12V lawn tractor battery to use with the pump.",

It seems as fast as my much more expensive truck mounted high flow pump, but I can't verify because I don't have a flow meter on it. We use this to pump diesel fuel out of a storage tank on the job site. What I like about it is the portability and the ease of setup. You could easily switch from one tank to another without having to unscrew pipes and all of that.",

      "text": "I bought this pump in January for transferring diesel fuel but I didn't set it up and use it until April. I was very happy to find a pump at such a reasonable price which was working nicely. It was only used a few times to transfer a total of about 65 gallons of fuel. As I was using it recently I noticed a puddle of clear oil under the pump and after looking closer realized it is the oil that is supposed to be sealed in the motor housing. In other words- the pump is shot. Amazon only offers a 30 day return policy on the item so I am stuck with a broken $100 pump. Ouch.",
