I've tried every trick I can, but I think I'll have to buy a new phone as anyone who calls just hears ringing, even when I answer the phone. I can making outgoing calls, but only after several trys. My husband has the same phone, and his does it occasionally, but I think because I use mine more it's having more trouble. Sometimes my calls don't come through at all. Very frustrating.",

So just do your research because this won't work on my plan so i have to get a different one to work with my plan.",

Because I'm on prepaid I don't have a warranty of any kind, and I'm a mechanic so my phone falls out of my pocket or accidently dropped in an engine bay or something else just as ridiculous and this phone has yet to crack or break (knock on wood). Even if it does break, it's one of the cheapest replacements to get! I recommend everyone to this phone.",
