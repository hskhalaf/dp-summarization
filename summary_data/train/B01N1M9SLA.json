The owners were especially delighted that the shoe was stable and supportive, and was able to accommodate custom orthotics. However, issues were pointed out by buyers which included the inconsistent sizing and width, the stiffness of the product, and the poor construction which resulted in blisters. But in the end, it was still considered a reliable walking footgear by most of the reviewers.",

        "A vast majority of owners claimed that the Propet Stability Walker delivered comfort during extended periods of walking and standing",

        "it was roomy at the ball section and the toe box, but snug at the heel",
        "The stability of the trainer delighted many users because it prevented the foot from excessively rolling in or out",
        "Numerous reviewers stated that the upper delivered exceptional support, especially at the ankle",
        "The deep toe well allowed the footgear to accommodate custom orthotics as well as ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) braces, said a lot of purchasers",

        "A minority of consumers commented that the cushioning felt hard and uncomfortable, and needed to be broken in",
        "The durability of the footwear displeased a few consumers",

Within two months, threads on the bottom wearing almost flat. I've had them slightly over 3 months and the top of the right shoe, (near the right toe) has a 3\"rip-seam opened up.
