The \u201cbindings\u201d were so flimsy and large. No child\u2019s foot would be able to fit in this thing. As for those who want this as a serious learning board for anyone over the age of three, do yourself a favor and purchase a real snowboard\u2014 which is what we plan to do.",

The packaging was a bit strange. It came in a box large enough for about 10 of them with no packaging inside to keep it from rattling around .......... well, more than rattling. I was shocked when I opened it that it was still in one piece. I probably would not buy this item again. Quality vs. Cost doesn't seem equal. Time will tell ~ after she takes a few trips down the hill we'll know for sure.",
