Four of us looked through them and all four of us ranked these as the 2nd best in clarity and 3rd in eye relief. Due to their small size and lower price, these were the pair we decided to keep. These are a great value and worth consideration. The one pair that had the best eye relief and clarity was the slightly more expensive Nikons Aculons. The Nikons one problem was their size and weight, being a tad too big and heavy for what we wanted.",

After destroying a pair of bushnells and giving up on a few other pairs, I saw these on sale and took a chance. Holy moly am I glad I did! They have adjustable eyecups, focus well, can be used at dusk, hold their distance adjustment, are packaged well, and are not too heavy or bulky. I've used them in the rain/fog with success as well. The strap sucks but nobody's perfect. I highly recommend these and am SO glad to have found them!!",
