The straight cable that came with it had a short out of the box. Definitely not worth the price premium, stick with the regular K240s and maybe buy some upgrades for them. Sound is of course the same on both versions",

With this type of quality control I might as well go with Chinese cheap stuff and buy new ones every half a year for a quarter of the price.",

I don't like to gauge products by the price, but these feel like something that costs $30 tops. If you mush them against your ears the sound is kind of there, but they're effectively Chinese clones of the original. I should have guessed so, since the price is about half of what they were 20 years ago (not even considering inflation). Also they were shipped in the factory box, no external packaging. I can only hope that I've finally been a victim of an Amazon phony and that I will get my refund.",

Definitely not for bass heads - but a amazing quality headphones for the price. Each time I hear a familiar song, I am able to notice some hidden instrument/note that I have not heard earlier - using other headphones or using a home theater setup.",

The inclusion of two cables, one straight and one coiled, is great for musicians. I always use a straight cable when playing keyboard because I want the cable to hand down away from my arms. For listening to music I like the coiled cable so I can move around without getting tangled. If anyone asks me to recommend a set of headphones under $300 this is usually my starting point.",

Bass response is a little weak but that's to be expected using internal amps and open construction. They only took a couple of hours to \"burn in\" and sound was a little tinny and sharp prior to that. I was disappointed to find that the headphone end of the removable cable is a proprietary connector, I somehow got the impression that it was the standard 1/4\" on both sides so that if the cable were damaged it would be easy to source a replacement.",

I had ATHM50's before but they were a bit too snappy on my head, which caused headaches after a couple hours. These I can wear for upwards of five hours and feel totally fine.

One reviewer sent them back because his cubemates could hear them.

      "text": "Do you want a pair of headphones to accurately listen to your music? Do you enjoy hearing Everything in your music? Then yes this is a good buy. It is more an accurate sound producer than a bass thumper thingy. Comes with both leather and foam earpads, a really long cable and a short coiled cable. I use these for quiet listening and gaming at home (or sometimes just to show off.) Great pair of headphones!",

Sounds better than the usual SONY MDR- 7510s They are comfortable. (I Have a Big Head) The Bad: Bad for playback, Music, ETC. (stuff requiring a larger dynamic range) Bulky headphones slide off of head if worn while walking. Ears get warm. Cord is Too Long",

Maybe the AKGs produce a more accurate sound, but maybe they're actually lacking clarity in the high end. To my ear at least, the Sonys sound a lot clearer and have better (more balanced, distinct) sound reproduction in the upper mid and high frequencies.",

If you're using them with an I-Pod or something else, they do exactly what they say they do, you can't hear any outside noise. So, after perusing Amazon, i decided to go back to AKG.

      "text": "This headphones are simply great! If you are looking for something to record, this are a really good deal!!!!! They really sound like nothing, just like water! The speakers really reproduces the sounds very tight! Just as the Yamaha monitors series HS So, if you are looking just for regular headphones to listen to music, they are not going to sound good at all. This is not for listening music, this is for listening to details. This is just for listening every single frequency without adding something else. If you have a crappy record, here is going to sound worse! This is just for people how know what they are looking for.",

Performs great and I love that it came two sets of cables (coiled and straight) and two sets of pads (fake leather and suede). The pads are a bit stiff in my opinion. I like the product but I would consider another brand next time around due to quality of ear pads alone.",

If you're on a budget you can mix with these without field monitors even!! (although the reason you need field monitors is you can't get accurate low end sound on headphones, you still can get a clue on these) If your into making music that is listened to thru headphones (internet,MP3's) these will help you mix better. They are also good for getting the details on your mixes and blending in effects without it sounding like you using effects. (which is how a pro is suppose to mix)",

Strings sound much better. I will also caveat this by saying that these phones show lower quality MP3 recordings in all their graininess, compression, etc. that my other phones tend to mask. Finally, be aware that these are not noise cancelling and that others will hear what you are listening to, as these are not closed - back.",

I wear headphones almost all day at work and these AKG's are a treat to wear for long periods of time. The sound quality is excellent! At work, I listen mostly at low volume but on the train rides home I adjust the volume higher and the sound quality is amazing. Well worth the money...",
