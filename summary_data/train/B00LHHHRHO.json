Combs to me are hard to maneuver on bellies, armpits, legs, necks and so on. Plus I\u2019ve never had a comb that the tip didn\u2019t pull hair. I try to get lighter color comb colors so that the fleas/flea dirt are easier seen on lighter colored combs. Everything is contained in one small unit, perfect for traveling as well.",
