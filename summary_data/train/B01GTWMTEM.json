There is a zipper to accept the \u2018lightly\u2019 stuffed pillow form. You can remove the inner pillow and probably zip it back up and do a quick cold water wash as needed. The pair I ordered came Fedex in a cardboard box. Each pillow was in a vacuum sealed bag and fluffed immediately upon opening Could the pillows use more fiberfill? Yes, but I\u2019m good.",
