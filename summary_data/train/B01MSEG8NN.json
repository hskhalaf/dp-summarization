The company should not advertise this as a 120V because it doesn\u2019t have full functionality as a 120V hot tub. I wish I had just bought a 220V tub.",

We stuck with the 110V and did not change it up to the 220V. You might loose a degree every 30mins. Not a big deal. The delivery process was super easy and the gentlemen was very nice and easy with setting it on my drive. I then had 5 friends come help me lift it into place. Very easy and SHIPPING was FREE! Amazon Prime... gotta love it. Thanks Hudson Bay",

A week later we had the Spa set in place, filled and operating with no problems. We set the water temperature at 90 Degrees. With the air temperature at 110-120 Degrees, the Spa water felt wonderful So this is our Cold Tub Story. I would and do recommend your Hudson Bay Spa to All. James Owens a Grateful Owner",
