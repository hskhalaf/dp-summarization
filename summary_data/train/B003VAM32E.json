The latency was too noticeable to be able to play wireless and so I always kept this one plugged in. It still works but it does not use the logitech unified usb system so it rarely gets used. I have since retired this solid mouse and moved onto SteelSeries mice. I find their shape more comforting and the mouse clicks are more pleasant than the stiffness from the Logitech. I do miss logitech's scroll wheels though. Best in the category.",

High sensitivity makes a worlds difference in gaming. -Great look and feel. -On the fly sensitivity changes using mouse buttons is a nice advantage. -Fast on-the-fly charging. -Interchangeable battery which is cheap to replace. -Driver software is great and well thought-out.",

Doesn't require any installation to run it immediately, and some settings are built-in already, which apparently can be modified. The scroll release button is a big plus, makes browsing big documents very nice and smooth. Weight is very nice, not the heaviest out there though. It is also one of the biggest mice I've ever used, and shaped very nicely (doesn't fit my hand though, my pinky still stuck out)",

The mouse buttons are much too light and the weight of my fingers presses them. A stark contrast from the well weighted keys on the g9x.

You can also replace the rechargeable battery if you were on the go as well! I recommend the same brand that provided (Eneloop).",

Unfortunately, the USB cable (which provides data when plugged in instead of wireless, a nice feature) is very stiff and thick. This means I'm always fighting with it, trying to wrangle it where I want to go. It's such a problem that here I am writing a review about it. I'm currently shopping for a softer, thinner Micro-B USB cable.",

Lots of button (13 total), configuration and with the new Logitech gaming mouse software can have multiple games presets (set point did that but LGMS its more friendly), high precision 5700dpi max Some cons that it has are that its not using the unifying receiving and it could be kinda elevated for some people. I loved the ergonomic of it. If battery ran out, just plug the usb cord and continue play while charging. By far is the best gaming mouse i ever had.",

When my wife's' old MX Revolution died, I recommended this to her and she loves it. I ordered a spare so if one of ours ever gives up the host we won't have to wait for shipping even a day!

Seems to last a full work day of HEAVY cad use and charges overnight. I love that it uses eneloops, I've got tons of these already. As for the mouse. Having 13 programmable buttons is really nice, they are all quite reachable except the 2 behind middle mouse button. I haven't noticed any performance differences between wired and wireless.",

I can also play through an entire day of FPS gaming on my PC and still have battery life left over. I definitely recommend this mouse.",
