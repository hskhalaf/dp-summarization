Before I had a 12\" wheel when my chinchilla was smaller, and once he was full grown I could tell he was having a harder time using his wheel. He used to just hop, now he can actually RUN in this 15\" wheel. Never again will he have to use such a small wheel. Heres a pic to show size comparison to him. Long rambling short: GET THIS WHEEL.",

Pet store wheels were too small for our chin and she couldn't really run/hop in them. They were also super noisy and I'd find myself taking them down at night to get sleep! The chin spin looks great and my chinchilla can actually run naturally. It took her a day but now she loves it and we can barely here it! The only thing I hear is the sound of her feet hitting the metal and I have to listen closely. Makes me feel so much better when I have days where she can't get out of her cage!",

This chin spin although heavier seems to be better supported by the braces so it's not tearing up my cage...so all in all this thing is awesome!",

This thing mounts with a big X bracket, and no matter how hard she's running, all I hear is the sound of her little feet on the metal. She absolutely loves this thing, it gives her plenty of room to run as fast as she wants, and it's actually become her favorite spot to just hang out.",

It is very sturdy on a Critter Nation cage. It was quick to put in the cage. I was being rushed by my chinchilla. It will last a long time.

The deformation does not add a lot to noise but it definitely increased. Overall, the chin loves it and excercises a lot, became less aggressive and sleeps better.

I wish the price was under $100 but you pay for quality. It is a big wheel so does take up a bit of space. All in all I would buy more for my other chinchilla cages.",

Our chinchilla can run easily at full speed now without have to bend over backwards. Don't waste your money on those cheap plastic wheels.

You can barely hear a thing with this wheel, and I'm not concerned about it falling off as I was with the plastic wheel we had (which was also incredibly noisy). It's easy to put up, too. Cinder actually has a habit of chilling on top of her wheel, and this wheel is great for that! She manages to balance on top and the wheel doesn't shift or move, so she doesn't fall off. And fits very well in her cage! We have Quality's Chinchilla Mansion.",
