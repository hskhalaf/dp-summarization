Even if you can't get the hamster wheel to work, this is an under $10 set that comes with 3 hamsters, a nice minidoll, and a bunch of uncommon pieces and colors.",

However, in the future, Ill stick to bigger block until she gets older. I love the idea and the concept of the ferris wheel. However, I would like to see it larger for younger children with fewer parts. Nonetheless. I will buy more kits and more blocks for her in the future as she continues to grow and develop better fine motor skills. Thank you for putting this kit on the market.",
