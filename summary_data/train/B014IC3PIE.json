I found this sink for a very good price on Amazon. The installers were amazed at the beauty. Everyone that sees the sink love it. Everyone thins I paid over $1,000 for it. The best surprise when I read the enclosed booklet, the company that makes it is a non-profit organization, helping abused kids. I couldnt ask for better.",

It is stained and tarnished worse than anything i have ever seen. We have taken all the precautions to keep it in good shape and we have also bought copper cleaner and polisher and it hasn\u2019t done anything for it. I can send a picture if needed. But please don\u2019t waste your money on this item.",

However, the sink did not have any damage at all. It was packaged really good on the inside to withstand that type of dents on the outside. It is more beautiful than pictures show. It is breathtaking. I can't wait to have it installed.",

My sink did arrive damaged with little scratches and a small dent, but that is to be expected with such a soft metal product. Research copper and it's natural properties before you buy this sink. The natural color of copper changes... almost daily. It does need to be sealed with a caranuba wax, and it does need to be hand dried with a soft cloth occasionally to prevent verdigris. Again. Research copper before buying. Highly recommend, but that's just my opinion.",
