My face does feel alot smoother and more moisturized. It hasn't been irritating my skin and it's a great moisturizer. I use a very little bit just to get a thin layer over my face then I apply my lotion on top. I've also been using African black soap and witch hazel so the combination of these things may have resulted in this outcome but overall I'd say it's a pretty good product as adding it to my routine has seemed to help.",

I bought it again and have used the product twice daily for about 6 months. The discoloring on my stretch mark scarring has changed and now looks a lot more unnoticeable. I will definitely use this further in hopes time and effort will completely heal over the marks. I highly recommend it for anyone suffering from scars that they feel will never be gone.

I am almost a year post-op now and my scars are somewhat visible but definitely an improvement, they no longer bother me. This product comes in an easy to use bottle. Faint smell, did not bother me. My skin did feel slightly greasy afterward though. I would recommended using at night after a shower and waiting a few minutes to dress. The bottle lasts a long time",

I used this religiously at least twice a day starting in the beginning of my second trimester up until my delivery date. It worked wonders!

Con - it's not cruelty free & I wish I had researched that better before purchasing. I will look for a cruelty free product next time. As for quality of the product, I cannot comment as I have not been using it long enough. It does moisturize very well and has staying power.",
