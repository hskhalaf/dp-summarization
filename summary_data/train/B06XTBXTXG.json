If I had been any higher it would have been disastrous. Others have had the same experience with broken rungs. I am a professional carpenter that weighs 175 pounds, and I have had over 10 ladders. Not a single one had ever had a rung \"break\". This should be pulled from the shelves and recalled. DO NOT BUY THIS LADDER!!!!!",
