Now, I am ordering another because my wife slept on it and was wow'ed as well. We ordered a med firm which is soft and conforming on the pillow top but the firmness keeps you from sinking in. If it sags in the future I will update but for now we ALL are perfectly happy with these mattresses.",

When I laid down on it for the first time, I realized that the reviews that said it wasn\u2019t too firm and that it was fairly soft were lies. It\u2019s so firm that I spent $400 on a Serra memory foam mattress topper to try to help and it\u2019s still not great. If I could easily return this, I would in a heartbeat. I thought maybe the firm, yet soft reviews and the reviews about easing back pain were convincing enough to try it, but I regret it. You get what you pay for and I have definitely learned my lesson.",

It's very soft but firm at the same time. Only time will tell how it will hold up but it looks like a great buy so far. The first pick is 1 hour after opening and second was 4/5 days later.
