The headset started crackling when listing to music, even on low volume. It also use to cut off when talking to people on Skype and take a while to reconnect or turn back on. I did get a refund for this headset as I personally wasn't happy bout it.",

The signal range is a dice throw, some go further than others but they're generally quite good. I would urge people to find a different headset. As amazing as the G930 is, it breaks too easily. Supposedly the later iterations of Logitech's wireless headsets are just as flimsy and I can't imagine their wired variants being any less vulnerable.",

Also messes with Windows and sound card audio settings when app tries to override settings. Build seems very fragile, while comfy they feel a bit too cheap for that price. Audio delay is very small for wireless headphones, and they are good if you want to sit on a couch to watch some movies on PC/console. Battery lasts for few hours, however had to disable auto-shutdown in config file as they tended to turn off after 15-30 minutes.",

It does have a tendency to disconnect from the USB dongle mid conversation (the connection light starts flashing whilst it recovers) and it doesn't like it when you disconnect the USB lead to go wireless mid conversation either. I think given the pedigree, these issues shouldn't really exist but given the fact I purchased it with a very heavy discount, they can be somewhat forgiven as a result of the lower price. However, had I paid full, then would be sending back for a refund. I use these for work for VoIP mainly and they are comfortable to wear for long periods (6 hours plus).",

The crackling/buzz noise is because of a service fault with 'Windows Audio' on windows 10 as even completely turning the headset off does not stop the noise. Update: Voice is now becoming \"robot-y\" very often, this is terribly hard to rectify as it seems anything I do on the computer or connection to the headset has no avail.

However, the biggest downside of this headphones is that it suffers from repeated disconnection with the transmitter. A search on Google will show that many other users of this headphones have also encountered this problem, which to this date Logitech has yet to conclusively solve.

      "text": "I've had this headset for a while and have finally had enough of the constant disconnects and interference that I've been experiencing since day one. I don't know if it's poor design or if there is just so many devices using 2.4Ghz band but this headset is plagued by static, buzzing, cross-talk and almost constant disconnects. As a gaming headset, the point is to be able to communicate with other players but that is almost impossible when it disconnects 4-5 times in a row every few minutes. Terrible headset.",

Moving my head even just slightly would lower the sound significantly. So frustrating because when the headset worked properly it was comfortable, good sound quality and the battery was decent. I've moved on to a different headset now and while I'll miss the wireless aspect, I won't miss random disconnections and then the terminal issue.",

The sound produced from this headset is unreal, it is easy to use / understand and setup. Worth the money in my opinion.",

      "text": "After reading the reviews i was a bit scared. But still bought it and have no regrets. Must agree the software could be better. Mainly because of the battery monitor. The numbers are a bit random. Other than that sound quality is very good. Only time connection was lost is when i was 2 flors down from the dongle. Battery holds long enough depends on the volume and bass settings. In my case 8-11hours. Very happy with the product",
