      "verdict": "The iconic Air Max line remains to be a yardstick in the 2015 model where great aesthetic appeal and decent performance go. Nike never fails to stretch the boundaries between performance and lifestyle, particularly in this model. While it is undeniably a great-looking shoe, it offers decent cushioning and responsiveness only. The arch support is moderate with a less than average traction. It lacks the performance of a shoe carrying a $200 price tag.",

        "There is a noticeable smoothness in the transition, based on several reviews",
        "It is significantly lighter than the previous model",
        "A good number mentioned that the midfoot wrap is better than the earlier version of the Air Max",

I bought two pairs and both were replicas. Everything about them was fake. The Black/White Bright Cremson Blue replica was not even close to being original, nor was the White/Bright Crimson-Black. Another key thing is the shoes smelled like cement, authentic Nike Air Max 2015's do not. I attached pictures of the box I received, and from the box of an authentic pair I bought from FinishLine. Huge difference and one of the easiest ways to identify replicas.",
