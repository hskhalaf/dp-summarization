Luckily I was the one to get the wire broken off the brush in my burger and didn\u2019t swallow it. I went out to look at the grill and to my horror found dozens more broken off wires up against the edges of the grates. Scared the hell out of me. This is ridiculous. Any one of these wires could potentially be a cause to the ER/OR. I\u2019ve used other wire grill brushes before and ever had a problem. This new brush goes in the garbage.",

This thing actually cleaned decent and is as close to the old school bristle brush's. I upped my original review from 4 to 5 stars since I've used it many times since then.

I have had mine for almost three months and use it about every other day. I have not noticed any degradation of the bristles and when you use hot water on the hot surface, I still get a quality deep cleaning. If this brush still functions in a decent manner after six months, I\u2019ll be happy and will probably purchase another one.",

      "text": "I have been buying \"cheap\" grill brushes that lost pieces(handles, bristles, scrapers) and became useless. This brush is simple and effective. The handle is sturdy and it appears that the wires continue a ways in to the handle increasing the durability and effectiveness. It cleans grates throughly with no need to come back and scrape between grates. Update: I used the brush for at least one year before I had to send it to its second life at the cabin cleaning the grill there. Still going strong. I am now using a similar brush by Weber with only one set of bristles instead of three. I miss the old one!",
