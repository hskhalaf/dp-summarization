Excellent customer service goes a long way and says a lot about the company and I would highly recommend! This is a quality product, but this is my first time spiraling vegetables, and it's honestly a waste of time for me. I know a lot of people love the zoodles, so if you are one of those people, I would definitely recommend! I just think it's more work than using a grater, and for the dishes I eat, that form of the vegetable is better for me.",

After multiple uses so far, the blades are still sharp, and the \"zoodles\" are very noodle like. I like how the cap helps to use up all but a small triangle of the veggie so there is very little waste. Also Lifestyle Dynamics emailed recipes and tips as described, and overall they made me feel like they cared about my satisfaction with the product.",

Pros: Cheap Makes nice zoodles I wash it in the dishwasher and it's held up well Cons: Kinda awkward to hold while spiralizing Sometimes the top doesn't hold well to the zucchini, so it just spins around without actually spiralizing the zucchini Always have some zucchini left over that can't be spiralized, usually about an inch Makes my hand cramp Bottom line: If you are looking for cheap and still want zoodles, buy it. If you are going to have a LOT of zoodles, upgrade to something else.",

      "text": "I love this little kitchen tool! It's small so it doesn't take up much space. It's lightweight and easy to use. The sharp blades cut extremely well allowing you to get perfect veggie noodles. The only complaint I have, is the diameter is not adjustable, so larger vegetables will not work with this spiralizer. I had bought some squash that was a little large on one end and would not fit so I had to cut them down some. Other than that, I would recommend it for those looking for an inexpensive spiralizer.",

Great for people on a low carb diet or anyone who wants to trick their kids into eating some more vegetables. Won't be going back to real spaghetti anytime soon. The only problem I would say is that it doesn't work for large zucchinis. For the recipe I just use an onion, garlic, a can of tomato sauce, italian seasoning, and some milk (to reduce acidity), and bring it to a boil then simmer. Then I throw about 2-3 zucchini (noodles), cover the pot and simmer for about 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add salt and pepper and/or parmesan cheese.",

I've made \"pasta\" several times with zucchini and summer squash and it really feels like I'm eating pasta.
