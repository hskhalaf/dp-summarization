The scratching pad in the middle lasts pretty well (I always turn it over to get more life out of it) and replacements are inexpensive and easy to find, but not really necessary as the main attraction is the ball.

I wish the ball didn't pop out, but they really like it so I'm going to try getting another one.

      "text": "These hold up really well- I have two cats and they love chasing the ball around, especially after I add a little catnip to the scratcher. My one cat hoards the scratching posts and is a little territorial, so this gives a nice other option for the other cat who doesn't have as easy access to the posts without choosing the furniture. I never used the adhesive, so can't speak to that. It doesn't tend to slide around a bit without it, but it never bothers the cats so it doesn't bother me",

Well, this was definitely not the case. I took it out of the box about 2.5 ours ago and she hasn't left this thing alone. I put the catnip on it that came with the toy, she immediately started attacking the cardboard and then figured out the ball moved playing constantly for about an 45 minutes. Now she's all tuckered out and sleeping on it. Great toy. I will be replacing the parts as they wear away.",

He eventually gets bored, but with this toy, he loves playing longer. The ball also naturally moves around the track with just a little force. I have had another similar toy where the ball is in between a top and bottom layer, and my cat didn't enjoy that toy nearly as much as this one. Simple and perfect. *On a side note, the other cat we have loves to sit on the circle. He sits on it every day. Haha!",
