The only thing I\u2019m upset about this time around when ordering was that the seal was broken and a lot of it had spilled out into the envelope. This product is not cheap. Can you please make sure you put the plastic seal around it so it can\u2019t break open? Love your product though and your face wash!",

I should have returned it , but I was not up for dealing with a leaky (big ) bottle. On a side note, please ignore that dreck someone wrote about Ahava; it's anti-Semitism, pure and simple. It is baseless.",

The pump should allow larger amounts in one pump. I have to pump it about 3 times to get enough on my sponge. It is not ideal for the shower. The scent and lather are mild if that is what you like. It does the job but I won't spend this kind of money on it again.",
