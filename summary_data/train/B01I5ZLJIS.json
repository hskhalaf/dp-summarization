      "text": "I purchased this table because it was cheap and because I needed a stand for my critter cage. This one was just the correct dimensions, it has a shelf and it appeared in the ad that casters would be able to be added. The package arrived in great condition, easy flat box and everything was intact. It went together super easy and was level and sturdy...enough. Its certainly not the best looking for a living room but it would do fo someone who is looking for a low cost alternative to milk crates and a piece of plywood for a top :) This ended up being a great choice for my needs and I love it.",

      "title": "Broke After Four Months of Use",
      "text": "We ordered the Classic in Brown on April 1st. Initially the table was fine, but by early August, the table had become so structurally unstable that we had to throw it out. The weak points of this table are the corner soldering in the metal frame. It's poorly soldered and will break with enough use. In four months of moderate use two corners spontaneously decided to break off! Definitely not worth our $50 when cheaper coffee tables have lasted much longer without problems.",

      "text": "The construction of this is not what I wanted. It is a piece of particle board sitting in a metal frame. The result is an artificial looking surface with a table that has a raised metal edge around it. The top easily comes out of the frame if you push on it from underneath. I would have 100x preferred a table with a flat, solid top. I bought their TV stand, which is exactly the same construction. I think it is fine setup for putting a TV on and forgetting about, but for a piece of furniture as central to a room as a coffee table is, the cheap construction takes away from its usefulness.",

I was happy with the mattress and bed frame I purchased from them, so figured it was worth the risk - at the time there were no reviews. Pros: Looks Good Easy to put together Supports up to 100lbs. (check manufacturers documentation, this was accurate when I purchased it) Bars beneath shelves should prevent excessive warping. (See pictures) Cons: None so far! Overall I think this was a great purchase. It will be easy to deal with when I move, it should last for a long time, and it wasn't a hassle to assemble. What more could you ask for in a coffee table?",

Anything you put on the table will leave marks, even just a cup of water. Also, it collects a ton of dust. Overall, I would be ok with this table if it wasn't for the EXTREMYL SHARP edges.

They are sturdy metal and have 3 metal supports under each the top and bottom shelf. I was able to put these together in no time, 5-10 minutes per table. They are the perfect size, sturdy and have plenty of room for the animal storage items. I love these for this purpose. Cage is the living world deluxe habitat extra-large. This isn't something I personally would use as living room furniture now as an adult earning a substantial living but would be great for someone living on a tight budget.",

It was for staging a condo we were selling and we would have had to cancel the photographer and delay selling until a new table came. We should have ordered a different table and returned it when the new table came. Now it's too late and we are stuck with a table that arrived damaged.",
