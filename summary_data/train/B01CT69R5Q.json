And it would not keep me warm at a night-time temperature of 30 degrees. Also, a 40 lb. bag of pellets lasted only 14 hours, not 36 as advertised. If you are living without reliable (24/7) electricity do not even think about this stove as an alternative!!! Back to wood on the Kaibab Plateau",

There is one thing that would make this a better product: make a mirror image version. Having the chimney on the opposite side would make the installation easier.",

After a cleaning, having really dry softwood pellets, and having the setting on high, we are lucky to get it to 500 degrees. The only time it works great is when the burn basket is compromised and it allows for a LOT of pellets to drop. Compromised means the metal bars burn away. But when too many pellets get through, this causes problems as well. You need to replace the burn basket at least once a season, sometimes twice at $45 a piece.",

Personally I find it easier to clean than other electric pellet stoves. I have the stove vented directly up through the ceiling. Drafts well. Nice and quiet. I have been using it for several months as my major source of heat. Fantastic stove.",
