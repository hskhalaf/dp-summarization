It requires a bit of strategy and a bit of luck. It's fast-paced and sometimes frustrating, but it's always a good time. Super high replayability so it never gets stale or boring like its board game predecessor. Overall, five stars. Highly recommend.",

I only gave it 4 stars because there are some situations that come up where they don't have rules to explain what is allowable or not.

I've played it hundreds of times of the years, bought it for friends and family. There is a reason that it has such good reviews.",

It took me a bit to get the hang of it (discard 3, draw 2, cards in play vs cards in hand), but my husband was a master after two hands.

Easy to learn but deep strategy if you pay attention. There are a couple of scenarios that aren't covered in the rules but we've adapted house rules to cover them.

      "text": "If you love card games but miss playing an occasional board game, you will love Monopoly Deal. We watched a how to video on YouTube as the instructions left us with a few questions. The game is fast pace, challenging, and quite fun. You get the feel of a card game combined with rental fees, property purchases, and even hotel rates. Challenging and fun for two players, a large group is not necessary. Definitely a game to add to your collection.",
