Perfect amount of detail to keep my 6 year old focused and busy for hours but he was able to finish the shark the first night. Then took apart the next day to make the next design, and so on. Now hes back to the shark! Definitely worth keeping the pieces in their own container away from his other legos so he can make it over and over again. I cant wait for him to get more of these 3in1 sets, they are perfect!",
