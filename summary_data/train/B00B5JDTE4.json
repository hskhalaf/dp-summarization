      "text": "By far the worst Amazon experience ever, came in the wrong style and colour. Glasses are beyond used. The lenses are scratched to the point where one can barely see through them, the frames are so rubbed and worn that most of the writing on the inside of the arms is worn off. The frames are stretched out and loose. Unbelievable. It makes me wonder what sort of method and protocol for selling repackaged products Amazon employs. It will be a while before I buy anything here again. Really disappointed with this product as would have returned it but have returned home from Indonesia would cost too much to do so",
