I did a project with external mic and boom, and sound quality was great. I like the dual slots - use one for video and one for photos. Very happy with it - worth it to go up from G50 for the larger sensor if you can afford it.",

You can start a time lapse on an iphone for instance in less than 3 seconds - on this you've got to go into the menu and set up the configuration to do it - there is no one button set up time lapse - you'd really have to ask if they know what people are doing on their cameras. There is everything you'd expect - great picture quality etc - but if you want to take great quality video using intuitive software go with a smart phone.",

      "text": "We first tried a cheaper camera about 15% of the price. While it kind of worked, it would break up the videos into 30 minute sizes which made more work to compile and distribute. This Camera doesn't do that. The image looks great, needing almost no processing. A little trim at the ends potentially depending on how started and stopped. We use a tripod and a patch cord for the audio in to reduce noise of our chapel and get primarily the speakers during the service.",

After spending a week shooting and editing, I find that the image quality is just not there. As another reviewer pointed out, it is very soft and lacks the sharpness of other 4K cameras. Compared footage from my Sony AX100 which I owned for 3 years, the difference is night and day. Sony is sharp as a tack. The low light performance is terrible. Image is fuzzy and grainy. Sorry, I tried really hard to like it. i have included raw screen captures from playback. It helps to illustrate my issues.",

I own a FDR AX53 as well, a very solid hand-held 4k device. The GX10 is a more capable device overall, though don't ask me to give up the Sony, I think both work very well. The Sony's battery life stands out compared to the Canon's (4500mAh to 2670mAh). Otherwise the Canon outpaces the Sony. I am not so sure that I would be as impressed though if I had paid the original retail price.",

This is definitely a step up. The optical zoom is very nice. We'll be using it on future projects, It's hard to be objective with such little experience with semi-pro equipment. But this is clearly better than anything I've used before. It's definitely a pleasure to use.",

The competition also comes from the greatly improved video capabilities in DSLR's. My wife has been using a G10 for five years and myself uses 5D III then IV. We just don't see any Canon prosumer models that can justify an upgrade - frankly even the GX10's footage look amateurish. The only possibility for an upgrade is that if Canon ever releases a broadcast quality model at a competitive price.\ufeff",
