Quality built Seems to be very fast but planning on upgrading the HHD to SSD pretty soon which should boost the speed a lot. also plan on adding another 8 gb ram. The Screen \"WOW' everyone sees it and comments on the crispness of the screen. The video card is ok since we only watch movies and do no editing. but still very fast. We will enjoy for years to come",

The seller should be a hard pass. Not worth the risk if you really want a dell buy directly from Dell even if its through an amazon order some of these third party sellers are a problem.",

But if you are looking for a good quality laptop with moderate to high gaming performance, then this is the laptop for you. (I recommend installing another 8gb so-dim stick of RAM for the best gaming performance roughy $50 about the time of this review. (Also you should probably install it yourself, there are many videos on YouTube showing how to on this specific laptop. (It is easy)))",
