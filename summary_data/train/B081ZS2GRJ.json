Also because they have a really terrible smell that smelled my whole room up when i took them out of the package. I have a 10\" queen memory foam mattress and these sheets are huge. They do not fit tightly. I recommend purchasing these only if your mattress is 14\" maybe even 12\". Pros: They are soft and they domt make me sweat.",

I woke up in the morning and could not believe how cozy and comfortable these sheets were . To start with the fitted sheet comes with extra wide elastic and a generous sized pocket to fit even the tallest mattress. The hem on the flat sheet and pillowcases feature a beautiful embroidery stitch that looks very elegant. I would have expected to pay a much higher price for such high quality sheets these are simply amazing I would highly recommend these to anyone",

They wash well, but are definitely wrinkled once you get them out of the dryer. This is not a big deal to me, but if it is to you, then you may want to consider that. The material feels like quality as it is not super thin. Have had these on our bed for a week now and they are perfectly fine for sheets. I thought they may be rough with how the material feels, but they have been surprisingly great to sleep on.",
