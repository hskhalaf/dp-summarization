They are extremely thin and sharp.Once you get used to cutting on the pull stroke, very high accuracy is possible with very little waste and cleaner cuts than I've ever seen from a hand saw. The afforably replaceable blades are held firmly in the plastic handle by a large plastic screw that has worked perfectly so far. Would I recommend this to a freind? I already have.",

Finally worked out a technique that wouldn't tear things up too bad but had to do a lot of sanding when finished to get rid of the gouges and scratch marks. Should have been more patient and ordered the Veritas Flush-Cut Saw elsewhere...",
