It allows either full itemization of deductions or use of the standard deduction. Highly recommended. So simple even a cave man can do it. :)",

Now that I am retired my taxes are fairly simple to do but I still would rather file via software and e-file. I live in a state that does not tax retirement income or Social Security so I did not need the state tax software. The Basic edition was more than adequate. I filed electronically and received my refund before Valentines day. This year's edition was as versatile and easy to use as last year. I do wish they would remove the idiot message (\"it's taking longer to load\") over the years it has lost its charm!",
