After he had his second accident on the bed I decided to look for a cover that was waterproof, but also comfortable. After about a month on the bed, today he had another accident. Urine soaked right through as if it was made of tissue paper. Zero stoppage. Complete waste of $45.00.",

I like the fabric, it\u2019s real fabric and not plastic so it doesn\u2019t make any sound when you\u2019re in bed. I have yet to see how durable it is, though. I washed it before installing, fearing it might shrink. It didn\u2019t. Just set on cold water and low dry.",

My only recommendation would be the manufacturer extends the length of the material around the zipper or that they sew the material down. it I love the hidden zipper and the way that it was designed for you to tuck in the end of the zipper into a little velcro pocket. Will buy another for my full bed , recommended",

I've used a dust mite proof cover on my mattress, box spring, and pillow for years, and it really makes a difference in my allergic reactions. This one had a slight plastic odor when it arrived, so I machine washed and dried it according to the instructions. Then there was no lingering odor. I really like the terry cloth upper surface; my mattress pad and sheets stay in place better than with my last one.",

Keep in mind using these covers alone are not a \"magic cure\" to a bug problem you have to use these alongside multiple other methods if that's why you're buying. Be sure to measure the depth of all mattresses before ordering don't assume \"oh it's just standard size\" or guess. We made that mistake with a few and had to return and re-order (which was handled fairly quickly by the company and well done).",

Being waterproof and airtight, it does have a tendancy to hold in air as well. When you sit/lay on the bed, the rest of the bed is like a balloon until the air escapes the zipper area, I guess. I tried to open the zipper more to minimize this but it didn't work. Not a big deal though.",

Not noisy at all. Super easy to put on. Would definitely recommend it.",

Beautiful beast of a mattress, but it was nearly impossible to find a cover that would fit that wasn't $300. After about an hour of googling all the covers that would ship to Canada, this was the best price, and it fits very well. It still took two people to put the dang thing on, but our mattress is also over a hundred pounds, so I don't fault the mattress cover. It will be nice to sleep easy at night knowing it's protected.",
