It takes 5+ hours to cool down my 250 sqft room!",

The auto evaporation system allows for continuous use and with the programmable 24-hour on/off timer, you can control the temperature even when you\u2019re not there.\n\nIn addition to cool and fan only modes, this versatile unit also has Dry mode to remove excess humidity from the room without additional cooling.\n\nIn October 2017, the Department of Energy implemented a new test procedure to determine the BTU rating of portable air conditioners. The procedural change has adjusted the amount of BTUs allowed to be claimed downward by as much as 50%. There have been no internal changes to these units, and the functionality remains the same.
