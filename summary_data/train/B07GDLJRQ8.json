And in these days of COVID, it is easy to socially distance and hang out with friends while watching movies outside. Definitely recommend! Last week was Princess Bride, tonight is Holy Grail.",

The fan works great and is fairly quiet, but again, the spikes are to small and it tips over easily and can cut off the air supply causing the screen to deflate, I ended up using metal tent spikes and it did the trick.",

Use caution with the bag and black blow up screen frame. The black is not colorfast and if it gets wet it'll stain the white screen. Be cautious of any moisture including dew. Best practice for me so far is to roll the screen up to minimize the wrinkles.",
