When I use it mostly in 28F-36F it works better then more expensive waxes and here in Cali that's a normal day time temp on all the mountains here.",

I can't feel any difference between this and the expensive stuff, it's slick and the best deal out there. A nice big chunk that will last me a while, I'll definitely buy this again.",

Hertel hot sauce is much better than the other name brand all temperature wax, which i have been using, lately. The Hertel wax glided like fluoro wax thru the moist powder. And, the block of Hertel hot sauce wax was three times bigger than the name brand and the same price!",

Maintaining speed during the shallow/flats is not a problem, I often pass skiers/riders that were probably going the same or faster speed as me going down the hill before the flats. Prepare to wait for your friends while using this wax :p i would recommend this to anyone who waxes their own board/skies.",
