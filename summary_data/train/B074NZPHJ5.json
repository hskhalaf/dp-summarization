Only problem I ran into is the scraper that came with the printer has burrs on the blade and scratched my base platform.",

The print quality is at least as good as the more expensive printers I've used. I recommend this printer without reservation. Next step, the Anycubic Photon DLP printer.",

Googling doesn\u2019t help. TL;DR it\u2019s a lottery and the winner gets the broken one.",

Tried the spare hot end it comes with, same thing. Sent them both back for a refund. A+ for Amazon's return process though. Was very easy and quickly refunded me.",
