The only drawback I've found is that this particular model has only one HDMI port for connecting accessories. I had to buy an HDMI adapter unit with additional ports in order to hook-up both the HD TV cable and a DVD/Blu-Ray player. Other than that, the TV is great and was a real bargain for the $179.00 asking price.",

TV and Shield combined use about 2a. I would have liked a bigger screen, but 22\" 1080p isn't bad at all. Sound quality is also good. As others have noted the USB and 1/8\" ports do not function for power or audio. I suggest using an Android or Fire TV for Bluetooth audio. I switch to a JBL Charge 4 for audio output when I need to take my sound outside.",

The picture is okay and the sound isn't bad for a small TV. ...however, if you want to do anything else with it other than hook it up to a cable (eg Comcast), forget it ; it's a headache",
