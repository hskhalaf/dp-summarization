Takes 12 sheets but caveat- and they tell you this- a folded paper counts as two. So actually an envelope could count as two. I have not had it long so I can\u2019t say how well it will hold up to my household cleaning abuse. I never do credit cards in a shredder due to recycling, so no review on cutting that stuff up",

It took about a half hour to cool down, and then I was able to continue shredding. The only drawback I noticed, was the shredded paper in the basket started to lift the lid when the basket got overfilled. Unfortunately for me, I ignored the window in the basket, and just kept shredding. This won't happen if you're mindful of the shredded paper through the window. Happy Shredding!",

The shredder's stainless steel blades slice through folded paper, staples, paper clips, and even credit cards quickly and efficiently. To maximize the security of your personal information, the blades cut across and down, leaving one-fifth-inch-wide strips of paper. With an attached 125-sheet-capacity wastepaper basket, this shredder is a practical addition to any home or small office.\n\n \n\nThe AS890C 8 Sheet Light Duty Crosscut Shredder offers:  * Stainless steel blades that cut through credit cards, staples and paper clips.\n * Cross-cut technology turns documents into confetti.\n * Shred rate of 8.36 pages per minute.\n * 125-sheet-capacity wastebasket.\n * Manual reverse mode for clearing paper jams.\n\n\n\nFeed as many as 8 sheets of paper at a time into the shredder.

Cross-cut Shredding for Better Security\nWhether you're disposing of financial statements, personal information, or junk mail, this shredder's cross-cut technology offers high-security protection. Insert as many as eight pages into the 8.7-inch entry slot and watch through the viewing window as the paper is quickly sliced across and down into 1/5 inch scraps. Even if your documents are folded in half or riddled with staples, the stainless steel blades will quickly shred your documents so that you can dispose of them safely.

Each time paper is inserted, a sensor will activate the blades. If more than eight pages are inserted at a time, the manual reverse mode can come in handy to clear a temporary paper jam. In case of heavy use, the shredder also features thermal overload protection to keep the unit from overheating.\n\n What's in the Box\nAurora 8 Sheet Crosscut Shredder with Basket. \n\n \n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe Aurora AS890C 8 Sheet Crosscut Paper/Credit Card Shredder with Basket is a heavy-duty paper shredder that shreds credit cards, paper clips and staples.
