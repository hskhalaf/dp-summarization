This removed the pills so easily and my clothes are as good as new! I do have one word of caution: make sure you use it on a flat surface and don\u2019t go over any parts of the fabric that aren\u2019t as flat as they can be. If you don\u2019t do this, you risk putting small holes in your fabric. Luckily this only happened to me once before I learned my lesson. This product is fabulous and I wish I would have discovered it sooner!",

It's difficult to clean the remover, which I had to do just about every 30 seconds. The remover also eats up batteries quickly. The product was poorly designed and I'm not sure how it has such high ratings, but I would like to return it and would not recommend it anyone.",

My only complaint is the guard was a bit difficult to get off, and felt like it was going to break with how much force I was using, but eventually it did budge. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase.",
