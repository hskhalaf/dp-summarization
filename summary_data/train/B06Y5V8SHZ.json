Maybe it's user error, but we've all tried it when it isn't functioning properly. A day or 2 later it'll work just fine. Just annoying when it doesn't work though, that is why I deducted a star.",

If you're either of these, this product will work for you. The wheel is still a bit to small for my tastes, but holding anything larger than a joycon works for me. The construction seems solid and did essentially what it was designed to do.",
