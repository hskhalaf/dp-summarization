It's also a great tool to get those who already know the basics up to current standards. Stefan Mischook focuses on essential parts and only provides the background details that actually matter. No time wasted dissecting frogs, this book takes you directly to the meat of webdesign. The cover says 'A no-Nonsence, Jargon-Free Guide to the Fundamentals of Web Design\" and that is exactly what this book delivers.",

I even used the sites search bar by typing source files. Nothing comes up. If someone could please point me in the right direction I would gladly change my reveiw to 5 stars.",

However, just as my confidence was growing (toward last 1/4 of book) the author throws a lot of other coding languages at you and I got confused and lost. He begins by going slow and methodically but about 3/4 of the way through changes speed and assumes I know what I do not know. Still, very much worth the buying as I now know what I want in a website. I will be able to work with my designer, setting up a site that I WILL MANAGE. This is huge.",
