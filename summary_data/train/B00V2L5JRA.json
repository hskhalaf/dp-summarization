Unfortunately it doesn't really compress at all when you sit in it and it just becomes a 3\" booster seat which throws off the back support of the chair entirely (some office chairs have adjustable support, the 3 inches is likely more than you can adjust for though). Would not recommend with any chair that doesn't have a solid straight back, if your chair has lumbar support get something thinner (would absolutely not recommend it be used in an office chair like pictured). Otherwise it's a fairly solid product but because it doesn't compress and doesn't work in an office chair like advertised, 3 stars. I gave it away.",

We are heading into winter so I might have to remove it. Overall, a great product but not so good for my needs.",

I bought the second one last month. It\u2019s okay, but a noticeable quality drop-off from the first one. The memory foam is not as dense. The mesh cover is baggy and not tight fitted around the cushion. Unfortunately, they\u2019ve taken a great product and turned it into an average one.",

I'm super impressed and it has been a game changer. I'd also say give it a few days to get used to it.",

My pain is almost absent during my whole work day using this seat cushion at the office and so I got a second one to use at home and where I go because otherwise my pain is impossible to sit. I am very happy and I will recommend this to anyone with cyatic pain, sacroiliac joints disorder and any other lower back and buttock pain sufferer without a doubt.",

I loved it so much that I brought it into the office to use even after my tailbone got better. Fast-forward a year and I fall down the stairs and bruise it again. Bought another one to use at the house and in the car! I even convinced my coworkers to buy one for the office. It really helps with your back problems and makes driving long hours in your car bearable. Highly recommend!",

As a normal product I would give this a 4 or 5 star rating, however the reason I purchased it was because it stated it was good for wheelchair use. It is NOT, it provides too much lift to the point that it is at an unsafe height. Because I felt the washable nonslip cover is excellent and the foam is very good quality I will be modifying it by cutting %25-50 off the thickness to see if it still provides good comfort at a safe thickness.",
