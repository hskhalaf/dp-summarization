Anatomic Relief Bicycle Saddle. Finally, I installed Foxnovo Bicycle Kickstand. PROS: lighweight, STI shifters, good quality - and not just for the money. Greatest value/price ratio. CONS: one tube blew per bike, which means it was not fitted properly at the factory. I called Customer Service, and they sent me replacements relatively quickly. Basic cheap saddle. No kickstand. I just want to underscore that the bicycle comes NOT TUNED, so factor extra $70-$100 into the price.",

Saddle is comfortable enough, and it feels lighter than I'd expected for an aluminum frame. The brakes look OK, the pads seem a bit on the cheap side, but they stop the bike just fine, I took it on a long, steep, curving downhill with no problems. I ride mostly on a relatively flat asphalt trail and this bike can go. I got this as a low-cost replacement for a decades-old Schwinn and so far it's fully lived up to expectations.",

Added shimano clip pedals, continental gatorskin tires, seat cushion, tool pouch, storage pouch, and dual bottle holders. Definitely recommend.",

I did 5 miles the first day and was a bit sore, but with a $10 cover it is more than comfortable enough for doing at least 10 miles (I have yet to do more than that, yet).",

Like other reviewers have said the tires are thin and they wore down pretty quick. I didn\u2019t have many flats at first for several months, but recently I\u2019ve had multiple flats in a row. So after a few hundred miles you may want to consider upgrading the tires. Other than that this is a very solid bike worth your time and money if you are just getting into road riding.",

I think handlebars may be next, though, these are a little on the small side. If you're looking to get into riding or want something to use as a permanent trainer bike, this is a good deal. The frame seems well made and it comes with solid beginner grade components. We did not assemble it ourselves, instead taking it to a local bike shop. I'd recommend everyone do that, as the packaging says something about needing professional assembly to validate the warranty.",

When I took it for repair, the repairman suggested that I get the inner rubber lining replaced as it wasn't of good quality (I am talking about a rubber lining which resides between the metal tire frame and the tube, not sure what is it called). He also told me that the Vilano is generally a low built bike and not for extensive use",

The shifting is terrible, it's too stiff, and just wasn't what I was looking for. I read a review someone wrote about spending the extra money on a name brand bike and I couldn't agree more. But for the price you get what you pay for, just not for me.",

      "text": "This bike is a bargain at just over 300 dollars, but it's not perfect. I'm having trouble getting the shifting tuned, maybe because of the cable stretching or maybe some other reason. It works okay, but sometimes can be slow to shift and even if I keep messing with the barrel adjuster I just can't quite find the sweet spot. Something creaks when I ride, I think it might be the seat. And the tires are pretty low quality, lots of flash on them. But the thing's like 200 dollars cheaper than any other bike I could find with integrated shifters, so I'm ok with it.",

Assembly was straight forward took a few hours, some reviews say only 30 minutes, but to really be done correctly a couple of hours should be the time to you would need. Because of weather I have not been able to ride my bike yet. Bike seems well made and very light weight. The reason I only gave 4 stars is because I have not had a chance to ride bike yet.",

Take the time to true the wheels and set the brakes up, as well as fine tune the derailleurs and this bike rocks for under $300. Swap the seat too, as factory was aittle underpadded for me. Great purchase!",

Excellent service by Vilano and I can't wait to get back on my new bike. I will be much more aware of holes in the road in the future (I am used to mountain bikes this is my first road bike)",
