She chases it and her favorite is to simply dance with it. This little toy gets plenty of abuse from her playing with it and so far it has not fallen apart. I bought this item in December 2016 and this is March 2017. So, yes, if you have a little one, this little puppy is a great way to entertain them and the bonus is you will be entertained too by watching them play with it.",
