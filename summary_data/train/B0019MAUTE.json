Nothing fell on it.... just spontaneously exploded! Glass went all over my office and my all in one (very expensive) computer hit the floor and busted. This economical desk cost me $1500 so far today... plus I have to purchase a new desk...get carpet cleaned... the list goes on.",

      "text": "Pros: Athesticly ok, but keyboard tray sits low and is not adjustable. My chair has to be in the lowest setting in order to be able to use it and not have my knees hit it. Has a good foot print to space ratio. I can put everything i need on it without having it take up too much space. Neg: The box came completely mangled and one of the large panes of glass completely shattered. Not sure if this was a shipping problem or not. Also, parts appeared to have been assembled before. If i was getting a used or refurbished part or parts then I would have expected to have been told and received an appropriate price reduction.",

No issues with breaking, glass seems very strong. The top part holds two 22in monitors with no issues. I did not like the keyboard stand as was too low so I just use the main desk. It does not have a lot of space so if you are looking for a large desk this may not be for you. However if you are looking for a good space saver I would recommend.",

Its sturdy but from the bottom the glass is pretty easy to lift up so if you have busy body little ones the like to push things, I'd keep them away. The desk does have several weight requirements per piece of glass, but I honestly didnt bother to weigh all of my items and calculate before I put them on there however, it is holding up pretty good. The glass is also easy to clean BUT the desk is extremely heavy, especially in packaging when it was delivered",

The glass is thick and I enjoy sitting at my desk doing projects and work. The pull out tray also works well for my keyboard and I couldn't ask for a better product for the money. The assembly was done by someone else, because I just didn't want to take the time to figure it all out. It did take him a while to put it together and I believe I paid 75.00 to have it done. Well worth it, so I wouldn't have to struggle with all the parts. Hope this helps.",

It's sturdy to hold a computer on each side (I work from home and also have a personal PC) and I can swivel back and forth between them. The only downside is the bottom stabilizers (the ones that have the Vs on them) came horribly scraped up.",

The desk is VERY sturdy, well machined, and attractive. It sits at a good height and the pullout keyboard tray really DOES have enough room to put a mouse pad -- not an abundance, but enough to accommodate it properly. Take a look from up close and you can see how stable the black powdercoating is as well. Also, the instructions that came with it were about as clear and logical as any you're going to find. No ESL goof-ups or nonsensical phrases. I'm really impressed.",

In addition, I run my cables along the frame via zip-ties for nice cable management. You'd think with glass that fingerprints would be a huge issue.

Also, read the instructions carefully, and don't tighten the bolts until the glass is placed on -- which is the last step. I really like the elegance and simplicity of the design. Also, you can put the keyboard tray and monitor stand on either the right or the left. But you have to decide the layout before you start building. Glass seems sturdy, and monitor stands can support 60 lbs. But the corner piece can only handle 30 lbs, so don't put heavy things in the corner.",

Unfortunately, this wasn't discovered until the carton was opened and all the pieces were removed. Called manufacturer and they shipped a replacement. Although, it took about 7 days to receive, this was an easier option that trying to repackage and return to Amazon. Assembly was straight forward. But the keyboard slider is off about a 1/4 inch on side. This appears to be a quality issue. Usable, but annoying. Again, not annoying enough for me to go through the hassle of returning.",

I would definitely recommend this desk. However, when my package came, legs were sticking out and I came to find a huge gauge in the top of one of the glass pieces. This all isn't extremely noticeable for the scratches are in areas that are not easy to see. But still kinda bummed my NEW desk looks rather used. All in all a good product, just don't expect it to be in perfect condition!!",
