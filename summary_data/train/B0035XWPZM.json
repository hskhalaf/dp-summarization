I ended up unsewing it to get it out because we have other small animals in the house and a squeaker encourages prey drive. But I really love this toy, and my puppy really loves this toy! Update* This is my dogs favorite toy. He loves the crinkle in the tail! and he loves sucking on the horns (odd, but whatever). He goes to sleep with it every night and uses it as a pillow, an eye mask, or as a \"binky\" of sorts.",

Anyways we have trouble with toys just turning into a mushy mess and falling apart. This has lasted longer than most already. He wont let it out of his site.",

It has been a challenge to find toys durable enough for his persistence and dedication. :). goDog does an amazing job. My dog likes soft toys (think of children's plushies), but needs something strong enough to deal with his chewing apart. goDog toys are the perfect blending of the two: soft and durable. They aren't dog proof or tear proof, but they provide enough resistance to last a good amount of time and keep him happy. goDog is always my 'go to' for my picky little boy!

Some of his other toys have holes or the ears were ripped off with chewing, but godog stood up to the challenge and is a great purchase in my opinion.",

Luckily, he'll still happily played with the torn up \"skin\" as long as I keep him from eating the stuffing, but I was still hoping for at least a day before he'd chewed holes in it.

After they tear the \"skin\" into pieces and they start to smell really bad, we tossed them.

Just so that my dog can shred it again in an hour......",
