No way had I seen this in person first would I have bought it. I can buy a bigger more stuffed and cozy bed for $10-$20 at Walmart or tractor supply. So for $45 I say NO. Don\u2019t waste ur money it is so thin and cheaply made and nothing \u201cortho\u201d about it",

I had to add 2 regular human pillows to the bottom to make it feel like it was doing more than just sitting on the floor. For a $130 dog bed I expected more.",

So, just know that not every animal is going to worship this bed, then decide to spend your money.",

The thin mesh that holds the stuffing is SO weak that if you have a dog that burrows (most of us do) he/she will cause small scrapes in the mesh through the fur covering it. Third wash and all the stuffing is ALL OVER my washing machine. I\u2019m now searching for a better made dog bed. If you don\u2019t care about having clean dog beds, get it. If you want something that can withstand your dogs burrowing AND be washed, go with something else.",

After one month I can report that one of the sides is slumping and the center base has only gotten more worn down with use. My dog does not use this bed spontaneously and only uses when I direct her to it at bedtime. She definitely isn't excited to be in it or dragging it around the house as her favorite place to lie down. Too bad too, because if they had just added padding to the center base it would be fine.
