I initially loved the size of the screen and the HDMI port was useful. Then I went to uni and found that it's actually pretty big and heavy. I'm looking to downsize now, but if it weren't for the size, I wouldn't have a problem at all. Overall I've had a great experience with this computer; I've had Chromebooks before and they've been great. I don't need to run hefty software or anything, just a good, zippy system and reliable place to write and store work.",

Purchased the R13 after reading a number of reviews and recommendations online, and I am not dissapointed thus far. Although the model itself is a few years old, this version manufactured in 2019, came with the latest Chrome OS operating system and updates, providing access to Google Play Store and the apps I use (Amazon Prime Video, NETFLIX etc..) without the need of tweaking the system. Performance is fast and smooth, and once you get used to the nuances of Chrome OS, this is a really easy and practical laptop to use.",

I don't know what's really going with the hinge, because the lid is always open (laptop mode) and the laptpop sits on a steady place.

Very snappy and runs most android apps really well in developer mode. I really wanted the Asus c302ca but I refuse to pay \u00a3600 for it when it sells for $499 in US. (Asus, what were you thinking?) I got this for \u00a3339 but have just noticed it's now shot up to \u00a3400.",

      "text": "This is a superb machine. Bought to replace a Toshiba Chromebook 2, which although it had a fantastic screen had only 16gb internal storage and a cheap plastic build that made it feel like a Fisher Price toy. The Acer has superb aluminium build and a glass fronted full HD screen. The mediatek processor is fine for my use, handling 1080p 60fps video with ease. The screen could be a little brighter and the speakers are a bit underwhelming (bluetooth speaker needed for volume) but apart from that it is almost perfect. Play Store in beta works fine so Netflix and BBC iPlayer downloads are possible.",

So got in touch with Amazon, they were also brilliant, sent it back and asked for a replacement. Waited and waited, the replacement did not arrive, so not able to say too much except that as a novice at all this, I loved it. Eventually got hold of Amazon about non-delivery and they could not have helped more, I then ordered the next size up. Will review that separately.

Keyboard somehow feels a bit cheap, clumsy. 3. My biggest problem: It is slow. I am using it what it is intended to do (mainly Google drive stuff) but sometimes opening a Sheet(pretty simple one) it takes somewhere around 12-15 seconds. Comparing that to my Dell laptop is really bad. 4. There is a massive lagging when playing videos.",

I didn't give 5 stars because the screen isn't IPS and I read a review somewhere that said it was, though that was my fault for not checking the validity of the review. Other issue is the SD card slot. This is just for plugging in and pulling out, not for upgrading the memory. It doesn't allow the card to go right in so it sticks out about 1.5cms from the base, so for transport or handling, the card will need to be removed and stored elsewhere.",
