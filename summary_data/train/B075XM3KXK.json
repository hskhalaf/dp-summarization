Instead it came with lashes already stuck to the wand! Now no where did I see it say that it was a lash extension mascara so I don't think it was fibers! Either way, the formula was super thick and didn't smell so good! I want to say it was actually a knock-off I don't think the real urban decay would have looked the way it did or go on the way it did!!!!",

      "text": "After reading glowing reviews of this product, I was excited to try it. However, it really did not deliver the thick, stunning lashes it claims. The worst part about it is the stupid, rubbery wand which makes the mascara glob onto my lashes, creating the dreaded spider lash look. It does not thicken my lashes, in fact it makes my already thin lashes stick together and look even thinner. It was slightly better when I replaced the horrible wand with a brush wand from a different mascara, but the formula was still pretty bad. This is way too expensive of a price for a product that doesn't work well. Very disappointed.",
