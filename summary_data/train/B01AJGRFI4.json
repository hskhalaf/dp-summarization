      "text": "I keep renting this but I'm not sure it works as well as I'd hoped. The smell is like a VERY faint ozone scent so not unpleasant and it does seem to eliminate cat box odors in the moment. It isn't long lasting. Or maybe I'm not using enough? I use unscented litter though since cats have a better sense of smell and don't enjoy perfume type smells as much as I do and the litterbox is necessary for my indoor-only cats so I don't want them to be uncomfortable. I'll keep buying this because it doesn't bother my two furry family members and it does work, just not great.",

This product has a bit of a bleach-like smell, and honestly, unless I was just putting it over the litter, it didn't seem to make a notable difference in the freshness of the litter box. So, if you want to sprinkle something in every time you scoop to cover the newest odors, I guess this might work for you. Me, not so much.",

Those two combine should trap most of the horrible smell. For all the people with native reviews. Your supposed to sprinkle it with your regular cat litter. Even better just buy a lot of zeolite and mix with activated baking soda litter.",

So, no going outside to potty for any of them! This product really works. I keep two very large cat boxes with high sides in my laundry area. I've been very pleased since using NonScents that I don't notice the urine smell at times like before having used other scented baking soda products. I still continue changing/cleaning the boxes on a regular basis, too. But, what a refreshing difference now! Thank you!",

The cats became allergic to any unscented litter that contains activated charcoal (which keeps the smell down), so we were left with purely unscented litter that had no way of not smelling. Unfortunately, the litter box is located in a closet right next to my desk, and this made things rather unpleasant. We bought NonScents and things smell no more! There is no smell, zilch, coming from the litter box, and I do consider myself someone who can (unfortunately) smell everything. It's wonderful. The product does have a vague chlorine/bleach smell itself, but only when you initially put it on, then it goes away quickly. It doesn't bother me or the cats. Will buy again!",
