I should have noticed the cheap prices on used pairs. I thought maybe Sony was lowering the price because pure wireless are the new way to go. No! Someone figured out how to make something extremely cheap look very authentic. Shame on whoever sold them! One try, and you'd see right away these cannot be genuine Sony product.",

No vibration at all. But the biggest issue is the white noise in the background. Somehow the Mpow Jaws Gen5 doesn't have these issues and it's at a lower price. If the next version addresses these issues, I would get them. But for now, wait for them to drop in price to $35-40 or get the Mpow Jaws Gen5.",

Usually I need the smallest but the mid size that came pre-attached was actually pretty comfortable even for my small ears. The wire is flat and thicker than a couple others I have tried. This should help it roll against the skin less while moving. Battery life is always an issue with any Bluetooth product for music, but so far so good. I appreciated it came fully charged.",

They do cost a bit more than the field of $20 wireless bluetooth ieps, but the quality is obvious, especially at the charging port, activity buttons and connective wire. I think that a number of dissatisfaction reviews probably come from poorly downloaded material. Most of my my music (rock, classical and jazz) are FLAC and the clarity is obvious.

After first hour of music battery drops to 70%. 15hrs of playback, my earbuds are nowhere near it. Highly disappointed!!!",

This makes it hard to use while running or doing anything with my hands where I have to clean my hands or remove gloves to readjust the strap. I've also found that for me, personally because of my big beard, that the microphone is unusable for calls because any left/right movement of my head causes my beard to rub over the mic and make a scratch sounds. Again, this isn't really an issue with the product in general, just something to think about if you have a long beard.",

I hadn\u2019t seen this mentioned yet, so I thought I\u2019d put it out there in case this would be an issue for any potential buyers. Maybe I have weird shoulders?",

Of course Wired Headphones at this price will sound much better but for the Bluetooth headphones the bass response, mids and highs sound great and I haven't had any issues so far with the connectivity or battery life.

Best solution is to loop around your neck but then the microphone is behind you if you take a call it is hard for the person you are talking to to hear you. I like the way they are magnetic when they hang down around your neck.",
