You have to work fast or you need to reheat and then the consistency is more difficult to work with. One package was enough. It was as effective at hair removal as the salon wax. My first try and it was pretty easy and not any more painful. Great product. Just bought 3 more.",

Instead- when you mic it for less time and it\u2019s thicker and not all melted, I\u2019ve found that\u2019s the perfect time to use it.",

The advice of creating a tab and pulling before the wax hardens is very helpful.",

Make sure you let the wax cool down enough before applying to your skin (duh) and apply a generous amount to your area that you are waxing. No issues with my underarms after a day, I do wish it came with more spatulas for better application when you are applying more.",

It did take a Weirdly long time to heat up in the microwave, about 8-10 minutes total which is way longer than the 3 minutes listed in the directions. It had a pleasant smell, didn't leave a residue, and wasn't harsh on my skin. Will be buying more.",
