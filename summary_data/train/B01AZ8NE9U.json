I didn't want a corer that sliced the apples because I have a food processor that does the trick. I was simply amazed at how easy and well this corer worked. I was able to core 30 apples and hand peel quick enough the apple didn't brown. Bonus, my three year old now eats apples because in his words \"the inside does not look weird.\"",

I was afraid I'd need a lot more hand strength to get through the apple, but the \"teeth\" at the base make easy work of getting through the apple. I'm no longer put off of coring apples simply because I dread lugging my tabletop unit out of storage and setting the whole thing up. Can't recommend this little guy enough.",
