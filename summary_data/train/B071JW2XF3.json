Each shoe has a noticeably different colored footbed! I checked for availability of another pair and they were much cheaper than I paid the first time (65)! So, I've ordered again and hoping I can get a matching pair. I'll decide what the return will say when I see the new pair. They are very comfortable and I love them.

I was a little worried, because I have big feet, that they might look a little awkward with the wider straps, but they don't--I like the look on my foot. Also like how far toward the back of the footbed the straps are secured--they feel sturdy and comfortable--no slipping.",

I love Vionics. This design and structure is right for me. However! I have learned to try on at my local store before ordering - since the sandals tend to be far more roomy than the shoes (not surprisingly). If Amazon has a better price (and Vionics are VERY pricey) I order online. Sometimes the local store has sales and coupons which are competitive, but either way - it's a good idea to try before you buy, as there is size/fit variation from one Vionics shoe model to another.",
