People have commented about the screen not being very high resolution, but the image and video quality has seemed quite satisfactory to me. The android user interface is very easy to navigate, and the structure and layout of the physical device seems solid and well thought out. UPDATE: I have now had this device for almost 4 years, and it is performing just as well as it did on day 1. Battery life is excellent and apps don't freeze.",

Tried starting it up according to the Manufacturing requirements....and nothing! The Manufacturer claims they cannot do anything unless i was in the USA. and it would cost me for the repairs. Just that it does not sound practical.  Had two other HTC phones in the past and they were superb and attempted to buy this one for my third... which was disappointing. \"Dont put all your investment into one kind of product\". \"Diversity is Good\"",

The construction is plastic, so I recommend a case. Compared to newer phones it looks just OK but the size and functions are above average. Update After few months, this is a great phone for the price.",
