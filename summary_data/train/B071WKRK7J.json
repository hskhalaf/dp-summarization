It is also a gear that greatly excels on the breathability front, making it a worthy ally for adventurers who prefer hiking in warm environments. Unfortunately, the greatness of this shoe stops at its footbed\u2014its presence is nothing to write home about. Overall, to get the most out of the Danner Mountain 600 EnduroWeave, wearers have to first deal with its lackluster insole; whether by learning to love it or by just replacing it.",

They\u2019re also super light, and good looking till you actually hike/ break em in. However I\u2019ve probably not even put 100 miles on them and the \u201ctough\u201d fiber woven upper material has several snags in it, is fraying at the ankle area and the toe box/cap is coming unglued on both feet. I thought Danners would be a little higher quality but overall I still like them for my first pair of hiking boots.",

These boots fit the bill; stylish enough to wear on a date, but they are light, have great tread, good support and typical Danner quality.

The true test on the trail is yet to come, but based on the usage already experienced, I do not expect issues. No heel lift, good instep and lacing, feels great and looks good.",

The inner liner around the heel (achilles) looks to be a little stiff and lacking padding, but they were very comfortable on the hike; didn't notice any problems in that area. Very comfortable out of the box. Lightweight and at the same time stable and supportive. Only time will tell, but first impressions are that they breathe very well without allowing dust and dirt through the fabric. Looks like they will be excellent hot weather hikers for a good long time.",
