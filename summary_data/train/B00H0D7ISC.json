The slide mechanism is made completely of metal which apparently was not the case in earlier years. And at the current price point it is less expensive than less versatile rakes in big box stores.",

I couldn't tell you how long it'll last, maybe forever, but my money is on that to break first rendering the whole rake useless. Non traditional handle means I can't put a taller handle on it.

      "text": "Not much to say - it's a rake, right? Well, the fact that it's adjustable means 2 things: 1. You can open it all the way up for raking your yard, but still shrink it down for tight spaces around the edge of your house or between obstacles. 2. At its smallest size, it makes it considerably easier to store than non-adjustable rakes. Also, it is all metal and seems to be pretty sturdy. I'm impressed. The other reviewers were pretty adamant that this rake was definitely better than others. Color me convinced, because I'm a believer now.",

We have Pecan trees so adjusting the rake to the narrow settings allows me to rake the nuts up into piles making it easier to pick up later. Very happy with this product, would definitely recommend!",

I usually like the bigger plastic rakes, such as \"Ames True Temper Greensweeper Poly Rake With 48-Inch Wood Handle 1920000\" but decided to give this a try. It doesn't pull the grass or tree mulch, so it is great to use around tree beds. I have used it only once and so far it has been great. I will write more detailed review after I have had a chance to really test it out.",

I like that the tines are stiff and hold together when you have small twigs in with the leaves instead of bending up like a plastic rake. Also with a more narrow setting you can slip in between bushes or flowers easily. Only con is that the rake become substantially shorter when set to a narrow setting, the shaft could be 6-12 inches longer but you may have a different opinion.",
