      "text": "I love this fire pit. After searching for the perfect fire pit that would fit an adequate amount of wood, I believe this is the one. Many other fire pits hold very little wood or can only handle kindling; however, this one will fit several substantial pieces no problem and can handle a decent size fire for groups to sit around. The design makes it easy to get oxygen to the fire and start it from scratch. It also comes with a grilling rack should you want to cook out over the fire. It looks great and is sturdy. I would be sure to get a cover for it as, with any outdoor items, can start to rust with exposure.",

I dropped it one star due to the rust that has developed on the fire pit already and its not where the paint is at. Another star for quality: The lid flexes and twists, seams not completely welded, and missing paint. I'll be really surprised if it lasts two years without intervention.",

But in his defense, it said outside through snow, rain with wet ashes in the bottom the entire time. I've decided to buy a cover this time and I am sure it will double its life. The fire pit is the perfect size allowing you to stack several decent sized pieces of firewood horizontally across the bottom and build up from there. The grate that comes with it allows you to toss on some hotdogs or hamburgers. It is good looking and well made. I would recommend it.",
