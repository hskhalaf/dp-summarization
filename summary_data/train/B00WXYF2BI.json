If your someone with a newer model mac and you're think about buying a keyboard cover I recommend you don't hesitate because newer model macs use something called butterfly mechanism for they're keyboards now and that basically makes them super easy to break because of a little bit of dust and super hard to clean. It doesn't help that the cost to repair a mac keyboard (even if its just one key) is stupidly expensive. So don't hesitate to spend this little bit to save a lot later down the road.",
