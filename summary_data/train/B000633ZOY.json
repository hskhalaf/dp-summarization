He had space to turn and lie down but I don't think a pet any larger would fit. For reference the little guy is 22 inches long (excluding tail) and 14 inches high. We did start training him to get in a few weeks before travel so that he'd be ok in there for a couple hours, this step is highly recommended. We did not see any zipper failure as some have experienced. The bed was very stiff but seemed comfortable, the carrier held its shape when carrying nicely.",

He's a large cat, but fits in perfectly with plenty of room to shift around and switch position. I'm a 5'3\" female and found this much less cumbersome to carry than the awkward plastic carriers, and the shoulder strap is a welcome option.",

However, because I have two cats and will travel with them together, I eventually replaced my sherpa with a carrier that expands, so I can bring them on board Southwest flights with me and they'll have a little more room. People with only one pet should find the sherpa a great fit for their day-to-day carrier needs.",

And my cat pretty much ripped it apart during the flight. I had to hold it shut as I carried him off the plane.",

Using a carrier that is too large could result in motion sickness. Your pet should have enough room to stand up and turn around inside the carrier.\n\nPrior to traveling make sure to allow ample time for your pet to familiarize itself with its carrier. We recommend purchasing a carrier at least a month in advance to allow your pet sufficient time to become accustomed to it.\n\nPut the carrier in an open area so the pet can investigate and get used to its scent and shape. Put one of your pet's toys, treats or blankets inside the carrier to entice your pet to enter it willingly. Do not force your pet inside the carrier. Take your pet on short trips in the carrier so they get used to being transported in it. If your pet does not like being inside, or tries to escape from the carrier, we recommend further training prior to travel or considering transporting your animal in a hard-sided carrier.\n\nTRAVELING BY PLANE\n *  Always check your airline's rules and regulations prior to flying. Your pet should be securely in the carrier at all times when aboard the aircraft.\n *  Always supervise your pet. NEVER leave your pet unsupervised or unattended in a carrier. Failure to do so can result in damage to the carrier, escape, or injury to your pet.\n *  Never give your pet sedatives or tranquilizers unless prescribed by your vet. If prescribed, be sure to get clear and precise instructions as to the dosage, the frequency of the dosage and any risks involved with sedating your pet. Follow the instructions exactly. Do not increase the dosage at your own discretion as pets can easily be over-medicated, especially when flying, as increased altitude can cause cardiovascular and respiratory problems. \n *  Do not allow your pet to travel with a choke, pinch or training collar. Cats should travel with a collar that has a quick release or break-away feature. \n *  Leads should not be used when your pet is enclosed in the carrier. \n *  Be sure your pet's collar is secure and clearly displays proof of current vaccinations, your name, address and contact info. \n\nTRAVEL TIPS FOR YOU AND YOUR PET\n 1.   Book reservations for you and your pet early. Most airlines restrict the number of pets allowed on board each flight.\n 2.  Complete and print your Guaranteed on Board\u00ae forms, or call your airline for its specific requirements. \n 3.  Research your destination city\u2019s pet rules & regulations, along with those of where you will be staying. \n 4.  Prep your pet for travel. Be sure it has ample time to adjust to its carrier and practice traveling with your pet in the carrier on short trips prior to the big day. \n 5.  Make an appointment with your vet. Acquire a health certificate and ensure your pet is up-to-date with its shots no more than 10 days prior to your departure. \n 6.  Research and create a list of local vets and emergency clinics at your destination. \n 7.  Be sure you have all of your and your pet\u2019s documentation in order. Do you have your pet\u2019s health certificate? Do you have your Guaranteed On Board\u00ae forms to show to the gate agent? \n 8.  Have your contact info clearly and securely labeled on both your pet\u2019s carrier and on your pet\u2019s tags. \n 9.  Pack for your pet in advance so you can be sure nothing is forgotten. \n 10. Arrive early on your day of departure and allow ample time for you and your pet to check-in and board your flight. Plan ahead and know various locations at the airport(s) where your pet can relive itself prior to (and between) flying. \n\nTRAVELING BY CAR\n *  Always supervise your pet. NEVER leave your pet unsupervised or unattended in a carrier. Failure to do so can result in damage to the carrier, escape, or injury to your pet.\n *  Secure the carrier in the backseat of the car only. Do not secure the carrier to the front seat - your pet will be the safest in the back. The seatbelt can be secured through the luggage band located on the rear side panel of the carrier. The shoulder strap can be secured around the headrest if applicable. \n * Never give your pet sedatives or tranquilizers unless prescribed by your vet. If prescribed, be sure to get clear and precise instructions as to the dosage, the frequency of the dosage and any risks involved with sedating your pet. Follow the instructions exactly. Do not increase the dosage at your own discretion as pets can easily be over-medicated. \n *  Do not allow your pet to travel with a choke, pinch or training collar. Cats should travel with a collar that has a quick release or break-away feature. \n *  Leads should not be used when your pet is enclosed in the carrier. \n *  Be sure your pet's collar is secure and clearly displays proof of current vaccinations, your name, address and contact info. \n\n\nThe ideal carrier for the jet-set pet, the Delta\u00ae Deluxe features top and side entry, a side pocket for storage, roll-down privacy flaps, mesh panels for ventilation, locking zippers, padded hand-carry straps, an adjustable, no-slip shoulder strap, a seatbelt / luggage strap and a Delta luggage tag.
