So it doesn't need to be plugged in to check.

Edit: TSA guidelines don't allow past a certain mAh threshold (~20,000 I think, looked up a while ago and this was well beyond the limit) without special requests. So if you're planning on flying with this, then you're going to be making phone calls prior to every flight or risking losing the bank if a TSA agent calls you out on it. Still great for all the previous reasons, but I had to dock a point just for this.",

It does take a while to charge completely, but it lasts about a week. average 10-15 full cell phone charges.",

      "text": "Brought this along on our transatlantic vacation. It was a great relief to know we could change our kids tablets, our mobile phones, bluetooth headphones, etc. during the flight. In fact, using the device was so convenient, and the battery so long lasting, that we regularly used the device once we arrived in Europe as an alternative to the adapter we brought along. Great investment!",

I can't help but feel it charges more than advertised (I am currently using an iPhone 7 Plus). Of note, it does take a while to fully charge. I suggest leaving it charging overnight. I was a little surprised about the size, but with how long it lasts, it's totally worth it. I can still fit it in my coat or backpocket.",
