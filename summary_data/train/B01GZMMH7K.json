I keep it on the high setting for about an hour, then switch to low. If you are looking for a quiet and powerful fan, I HIGHLY recommend this product.",

      "text": "I use one of these to cool my 20 gallon hexagon aquarium. It is plugged, via a USB power adapter, into a Inkbird temperature controller to automatically turn it on/off as needed. When switched on high speed the fan can, through evaporative cooling, drop the water temperature about two degrees in ~90 minutes. The fan is absolutely quite. The fan clip easily attaches to the rim of my tank which many aquarium cooling fans can not do. I have the fan aimed to blow air across the water surface NOT down into the water.",

So when someone recommended this online, I decided to try it. It's SO much better put together. Clip is super strong, quality of the plastic is way better, and I'm glad I have it for my next SUV camping trip. Tested how much it pulled from my solar charge controller, and it was pretty minimum; well worth it to me to have some air moving in my tent or car at night.",

At some point I need to grab a couple more. Also, if you need to clean the blades off (we have a bit of humidity here and a lot of dust, we live off a mostly dirt driveway) I can suggest q-tips with alcohol on em, just stick it right in between the slats, while it's off of course!",

I have the second unit mounted in my golf cart plugged into the USB port to keep my wife cooler.

The 2 swivel points let us aim it exactly as needed, and so far it has held it's position. The long cord makes it easy to reach a power source.

I like that it has 2 speeds available and that you have the choice to just set it on the desk or even better to clip it to a lip of the desk or hutch. The angle is adjustable, so that's a help as well. I recommend it.",

My aquariums are on a rack so I got a dual USB charger. Works pretty well so far.",
