Those worn out, $45 Nike's are in better shape than these shoes are after less than 6 months of wear. The waterproof abilities of these shoes has more to do with water not escaping after they have filled up through the already splitting seams. These are by far the worst shoes I've ever purchased, and certainly will not buy another pair of Merrell's again.",
