I spray saline nasal mist in her nose, let it sit for a couple of minutes while I'm putting half klinex in the aspirator. Then the mucus comes out with one or two aspiration. The mucus has never passed 1/4 of the aspirator, and staying under the klinex. Easy to clean, running in tap water, soap, rinse, and done. I am so glad I got this, so my baby can breath, eat, and sleep well.",

And better than the nose frida IMO. It's still a little difficult, but much easier to suck effectively with this one.",
