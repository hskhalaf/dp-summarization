I'm a RN and work primarily in a hospital, but during the fall I travel around to different companies/offices in my vicinity to administer flu shots. This cart has been perfect for lugging the box, sharps container, and cooler with vaccine. Prior to this I was using one that felt like it was going to fall apart. This one can handle 3 boxes of supples. Haven't had any issues with the wheels, but will just replace with heavy duty ones from HD in the future if needed. Mostly use it in the first flatbedstting, I assume the upright setting is just as good. Highly recommended!!!",

Then I had to empty mom\u2019s apartment, so I did buy a larger handtruck, but this little dolly does almost everything you need to do, and when it folds into a cart, a box or bags of groceries will just sit very nicely on it.

It is can hold a lot in both positions. The upper wheels are pretty small, so it doesn't maneuver as well in cart mode, but it's a reasonable trade off for being able to fold nearly flat. In cart mode you have to stoop down to roll the cart. We would like to see an extendable handle added to future models. It is still five star product in my eyes.",

Using it as a hand cart worked better. I definitely need bungee cords to keep things on it. I went around a corner quickly and the bins slid off. I attribute most of the issues I had with it to user error. Folding and converting were easy.",

And when in hand cart mode, it has a good size clearance over small steps, it doesn\u2019t rub on the edge of the step or get stuck. It\u2019s awesome.( Both our old house and new house have small steps) And when folded up, it\u2019s thin, so it takes up no space whatsoever.",
