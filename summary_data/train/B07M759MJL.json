The insert soaks up the water and doesn't dry out (in the humidity), and the upper doesn't do much better. They began to stink like mad, and I had to throw them out. Also, there's no arch support, and the white sole is for some reason impossible to clean. Maybe they're good for other things, but don't get them near water.",

Just get some odor-eaters and put them in over night. The insoles are machine washable too. The breathable mesh keep my feet from getting too sweaty. I have already bought another pair in a different color. The navy blue one's look really good under pants as well if you have to dress them up a bit. Awesome shoes!",
