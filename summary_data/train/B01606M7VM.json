The problem is that this feature drains the battery when its in sleep mode and your table doesn't startup.",

If you want a portable art tablet, get the Cintiq Companion. If you want a pretty powerful tablet for other things, and to carry around with you this tablet does just fine, though a bit overpriced for what it actually gives you.",

      "text": "In all my years of working in IT, I have never had a computer blue screen on me straight out of the box. But it happened with the Surface Pro. This thing blue screened on me twice before i even got to enter a username. After somehow managing to set up a local account, the display drivers made the screen virtually unusable. I was not even able to get into settings to update the drivers as the screen did not respond to where i was touching as well as glitching out and not letting me see what screen i was on. I had high hopes for Microsoft, but unfortunately, i am left utterly disappointed",

No device fills this niche better than the Surface pro. The Pentium processor is surprisingly fast for the specs. 4GB of RAM can be limiting but as long as you keep background apps to a minimum you will have no issues. Note, because I did not realize: This does not come with the pen or the type cover. I knew it did not include the type cover but I thought it did come with the pen.",
