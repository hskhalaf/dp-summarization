Levi's fit either perfectly or way off the mark. Absolutely no consistency in size. The pants I absolutely love are the 811 Curvy Skinny in a 29. I also like the Mid Rise Skinny in a 28. The 711 is definitely not for me!!!",

I really like these jeans but they do stretch out quickly. However, with a higher rise they do not fall down like other jeans when they stretch out. One note - sizing and fit do not seem consistent. I had purchased the same jeans from Macy's (for $15 more) and returned them after ordering these, however they did fit slightly differently, even though they were exactly the same jeans.",

I got a size 33 (16 in normal sizing) and the back pockets are spaced quite flatteringly! The overall fit is great as well! The amount of stretch in these jeans is just right- keeping the jean look exactly that: jeans. I want more! Waiting to see more options than just this one in the size 33 y\u2019all! ;)",

I will definitely be looking to buy more, it's hard to find a good fitting skinny jean. FYI these are more jean feeling material than a legging feel for those who were wondering. I also have skinnier calves and these hug them nicely with a little give, but not too much.",

      "text": "These jeans were exactly the fit I was looking for! I cannot wear a high rise or normal mid rise jean as my torso is too short. Luckily, through research, I learned that many of Levi's jeans are labeled \"mid-rise\" but the actual measurements of the rise are closer to a low rise (but not butt showing super low-rise). Out of all of the jeans I ordered to try, these particular 711 skinny jeans were perfect! I can't wait to build a collection of these! I recommend trying on any 711s you get because they can have slightly different fits!",
