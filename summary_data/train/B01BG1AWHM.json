My only complaint... most boot straps have a lever buckle to clasp and tighten them. This pair does not... you have to pull the strap tight by hand, which leads me to believe this strap will eventually break. Nevertheless, no regrets in buying these skates. I'm just a casual skater, and these are perfect for me.",

I can easily skate for hours in these things even without wearing thick socks, and the stability I have on the ice while wearing these boots feels almost like I'm cheating. My only complaint is that I've almost tripped myself a few times with the toe picks, but that's the nature of figure-skating type blades. My blades did arrive sharpened.",
