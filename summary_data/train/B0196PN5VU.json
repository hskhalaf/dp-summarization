In fact, it works TOO well where the bait kills them almost instantly instead of bringing the poison back into their nest and wiping out the rest of the colony. I put the bait in the high traffic area on my window sill and within 24 hours I had a bait tray full with dead ants inside. I ended up using additional baits in the same location to get rid of the remaining ants as the initial bait trap was too full for ants to even enter into the bait. But it got the job done eventually.",

The ants go in and take some \"food\" back to their queen, which eventually rids your house of ants. The few ants that eat while gathering will die inside the trap. Since new colonies of ants can move into your house territory overnight, I place these in the spring, where I know the ants typically enter and leave them there until winter when the ants are not active. I have two cats who are not interested in these, but I would be cautious with dogs (since dogs eat anything.)",

I turn this cartridge upside down on Aluminum foil so that T300 liquid spreads and provides more surface to capture as many ants as possible in the shortest possible time. Time is critical because spread surface of T300 gets harder after two to three days. and ants won't stick on them anymore.",

    "description": "Size:3-PackAttract and kill the ants you see and the ones you don\u2019t with TERRO Liquid Ant Baits. The liquid, which contains borax, is specifically designed to allow worker ants to consume the product, survive long enough to carry the liquid back to the nest. Ants consume the liquid ant bait and return to the nest where they pass it around to the rest of the colony. The active ingredient in the bait slowly interferes with the ants\u2019 digestive systems, ultimately killing them. Since this is a bait product, you will initially see more ants as they are attracted to the liquid \u2013 but don\u2019t worry, this is a good thing. After the bait is consumed, insect populations will begin to decline. Complete control may take up to two weeks. For your convenience, TERRO Liquid Ant Baits are easy to use and feature a new and improved snap-off tab design \u2013 no scissors needed! To open the bait, hold the station vertically and twist the new and improved tab. Then place indoors on a flat surface near ant trails and other signs of ant activity. The more bait placements, the better. Be sure to leave the ant baits undisturbed while the ants are actively feeding on it.",
