I work as a Medicolegal Death Investigator for a Medical Examiner's office, and my phone has ended up in a swimming pool 3 times, a muddy ditch once, a pond and a creek. Able to retrieve it each time, and it still works perfectly. I just clean it off, dry it and put it back to use. I have the extended life battery on it so I can go at least 72 hours of standby and talking without having to recharge the battery. I will be buying another as a backup just in case the next time it goes in a pond, I can't find it. I cannot say anything bad about it.",

I have dropped it in a river, i have climbed up and down ladders all day with this phone and a 3/4\" wrench banging together. this thing is great. it's a little old, the software is better on my $29 zte, but you could smash like 30 zte's to pieces with this phone and keep on going. don't need a case, and it's definitely better than carrying something in an otterbox",
