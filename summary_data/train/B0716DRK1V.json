I usually struggle to find watches that aren\u2019t either too masculine for my liking or too small on my wrist (I\u2019m very tall and so most \u2018womens\u2019 watches get lost on my arm), but the simplicity of this makes it a nice unisex watch.",

I\u2019ve been wearing (and skating) in mine for nearly 2 months now and it\u2019s still spotless. For the money I paid for it I\u2019m really happy, Iv always liked Nixon watches and this one is the right mix of smart and casual.",
