I went low budget with the 1, because I wasn't sure if I was going to like it or if it was going to work with the old TV I was going to be using temporarily. But it works great, and is good for what it is. In hindsight, I would spring for the 3, because the 1 does not auto-play on Netflix, and I've gotten mixed answers on whether the 2 does or not. But for bottom of the line, this works just fine for Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, etc.",

The actual cable behind the TV is messed up, but I have not fixed it and it's been at least a couple months. I hooked up the ROKU and I can't stop watching netflix, hulu, bbc, amazon prime, tons of music stations, tons of cool indie stations... I only keep my cable hooked up b/c I need the high speed internet and it's actually cheaper to keep the Cable+internet package, than the internet only. I think Comcast is actually giving cable TV away for free to pad their cable subscriber accounts so they don't lose their butts in the stock market.",

Hint: If you have an older TV and need a Roku with composite cables, don't get a Roku 1, get a Roku 3 and a powered HDMI to Composite converter box for about $30 from Amazon. It works like a charm!",

I would mirror others displeasure at having to give Roku my credit card information considering how careless businesses seem to be in guarding this sensitive information or how very efficient and clever the crooks have become in stealing it depending on your point of view. For me it does exactly what it says it will do. I do wish I could turn it off though hence the four stars.",

However, in the description it states \"with rich, vibrant video streaming up to 1080p HD.\" I have it connected to a 1080P television, via HDMI, but it only sends a 720P stream... Maybe it's a setting I haven't discovered yet, but perhaps it's a misprint in the description. In either case, I say, keep up the great work, Roku!",
