I got them to put around my dining room table for if and when I ever have company. Ha ha. After trying them, I wouldn't be able to put anybody I really cared about in them. In the meantime, they look great and the price was right. I think if I took the seat covers off and put some actual padding down it might make things better but I'm definitely not going to go to all that trouble.",

You will have to use different screws and secure the seat in some other fashion that how they're delivered. Poor design.",

The \"glue\" holding the backs together came loose and in less than 30 days the top section separated from the back when pushing or lifting the chair up to scoot it out to sit down. One leg on one of the two in the \"set\" was shorter than the other so if it's on a hard surface it wobbles - luckily I have an area rug under my table so it's not too noticeable. I would definitely NOT recommend them and will be looking to find replacement chairs that I can actually sit in and test first.",

I'll admit that they're good looking chairs, but much smaller than I anticipated and the fabric on the chairs is of a lesser quality. Fortunately, with my cost savings, I can easily pick of some fabric and do a quick custom cover of each seat which will result in making the chairs appear far more attractive than the $240 paid (6 chairs). If the size is in question, I highly recommend going to a furniture store for a comparison...it's well worth the trip.",

In order to reinforce the entire chair, I have to buy metal \"L\" brackets to screw to the rear of the chair seats and legs; then buy straight metal strips for the front of the seat to attach to the front legs.
