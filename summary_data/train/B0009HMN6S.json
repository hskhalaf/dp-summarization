I wanted something I could carry around the house, and also outside if I wanted to. This folds in half and it's very light. It's thin, it's perfect. I have a 11inch laptop and a 15inch laptop. This works perfectly for both.",

There is no way it could handle a heavy 17\" laptop and yet it was over $40 when I bought it! If you value the safety of your laptop or electronics just don't use this desk... save yourself the headache and anger.",

The area is smaller the mouse pads I own which makes it a little awkward to use one.",

    "title": "LapWorks Laptop Desk 2.0",
    "description": "For best use, sit with legs relaxed and natural, wider than the awkward knees together position when using a laptop without our desk.\n\nLapWorks offers 2 portable, folding Laptop Desks to choose from, both made entirely of the same strong ,yet flexible, polycarbonate plastic with non-slip rubber pads. They will bend but won\u2019t break.\n\nThe Laptop Desk 2.0 is a heavy duty lap desk that is also a typing stand and the Futura Laptop Desk is our stylish laptop desk. \n\nFor those who just want a strong, durable, and portable lap tray to make their mobile computing experience comfortable and ergonomic, the Laptop Desk 2.0 is an excellent choice. It acts as a physical barrier to protect your lap from the notebook's heat source and reduces overheating in your notebook by up to 20%. The LTD 2.0 is also a 5-position incline typing stand to improve your typing ergonomics. The Laptop Desk 2.0 can easily fit into your backpack or laptop bag for quick transport.\n\nThe Laptop Desk 2.0 has a companion accessory (not included) called the MouzPad. It's a 6\" x 9\" snap-on, snap-off extended mousing surface that adds an extra 3\" to the units overall length. \n\nNOTE: The Laptop Desk 2.0 is our heavy-duty lap desks made of Polycarbonate - the same material used to make bullet-proof glass. They are proven to support the weight of a 12 lb. bouncing bowling ball.\n\nWhen opening flat you will feel some resistance when opening the unit. Simply open and close the unit quickly 10 to 15 times. This warms up the material and reduces the resistance substantially. \n\nThe Laptop Desk 2.0 is black Polycarbonate and black no-slip rubber. Opened flat the 2.0 measures 20-1/2\" long by 11\" wide by 3/8\" thick. Folded in half it measures 11\" by 10-5/8\" by 5/8\" thick and weighs 1 lb 6 oz.\n\n6 month warranty.
