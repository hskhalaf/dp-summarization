Technology is fast moving making it difficult for us old timers to adjust, but this machine has made that transformation very easy and gives us confidence to learn all the other features it has to offer. The unit arrived on time and with much care from their shipping department. Everything was well protected and arrived in perfect condition. We are very happy and impressed with this purchase.",

I like that I can easy move it from the car to the house. I haven't used it off a charger longer enough to know how well the battery lasts because I always keep it plugged in to the car charger.

Thanks for the carry bag forthcoming!",

We've been through almost 2 movies without having to plug them in. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because they don't come with a case or way to attach to the seat back so my kiddos had to hold them... it would be a nice addition if the company would consider it.",
