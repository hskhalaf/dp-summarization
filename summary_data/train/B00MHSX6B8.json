I don't know what any of the low reviews are on about. I got two. They open bottles. And I am able to spin them on my finger with the other end. The ones I received had no words on them. The metal wasn't really scuffed or anything.. I honestly have nothing negative to say. Five bucks got me two fantastic churchkeys. :) They open bottles, they're low cost and I'm sure they'll last me a long whiles!",

When the replacement came in it came with two openers and only one was punched properly. The second opener was useless. In the end I ended up with two working opener but not without putting up a fight for it. So frustrating.",
