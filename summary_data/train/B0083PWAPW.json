Even knowing my serial number and searching the internet, including the online Kindle help resources, I was not able to find out that I have a 2nd generation Kindle Fire HD until I got in touch with Amazon and they looked it up in their internal records. I asked the rep where customers could find this information and he said it was only available by contacting Amazon directly.",

And although there are MILLIONS of books at 99c - many are not BOOKS - they are short stories. True novels cost more. But this is not the Kindle - this is the salemanship that comes with it.

      "text": "I mostly read ebooks on my Fire HD, but enjoy having the flexibility to check my email or surf the net on the same device. My other 2 Kindles may be going to family members so this will likely be my main reading device. Right now I read from all 3. Also have an iPad but didn't like using it as my main ereader. Enjoy the crispness of the Fire HD screen. I have an m edge cover for it, but think I will buy a sleeve. Prefer holding it without the extra weight of the cover. I've always been pleased with Amazon products and,so far, am enjoying the Fire HD. Looking for more apps in the future.",

It is different and I personally like my older one better. the on off button, the response to the touch screen. But my wife never used mine and loves this one. again I love the Kindle. I have an Ipad and I'll take my kindle any time. C.Flemish feel free to discuss this with me at @wookie198 [...] and if you are in the mood for something good to read feel free to check out one of my own books. Thank you",

I've had an android phone and was thrilled when I discovered the power of android.. this is android magnified in terms of what can be done. the video and screen colors are vibrant, the sound is better than my tv!, and very very functional. I recommend! Only reason I downgraded to 4 stars is because can't do attachments with gmail. ....at least I haven't figured out how yet.",

I would give it a 5 but the browser has some minor problems with some specific web pages I frequent. Amazon support has been terrific. I thought I had a problem with Skype. Amazon was helpful through chat and direct telephone. We found that I had no problem with my Windows PC and Skype. My wife's IPAD will not accept video from my Fire HD. Audio to her is fine and the Fire HD accepts her video and audio. Amazon's support was also very fast in responding to me. I rated their support 5 stars.",

Did not want to spend the money on an Ipad, glad I didnt. Two of my friends have Ipads and after playing around with my Kindle Fire, they want their money back!! lol.",

      "text": "I loved this thing for the year it worked. FreeTime is great if you have small children. The HDMI out is a nice feature too. Then -- less than a week after the one year warranty expired -- it started turning off on its own despite being charged. Sometimes it powers off before it finishes powering on. It doesn't stay on long enough to be usable at all. And it doesn't appear to be the result of a faulty or damaged power switch. I am not an Apple fan at all, but I must admit we have two iPads (including a first gen) that are still going strong and have never had any issues. I can't recommend refurbished Kindle products.",

It has step by step directions for its operation and any possible problems. I only wish that it had a memo recommending and showing how to access this info. I came upon this data quite by accident. I could have saved time and had an easier orientation with an info insert positioned atop the Kindle. The new HDX sounds great with especially the addition of a front-facing camera and instant communication with product assistance technicians. I always feel that Amazon is a company with integrity that has its customers uppermost in its operations.",

This is perfect for the things I need/want most in a tablet - email, reading books, reading magazines, surfing the web, watching videos/movies. It is lightweight, easy to see/use (intuitive and logical formats and usability), responsive touch-screen, good backlighting, incredibly clear everything (the HD is worth the extra money), great sound quality, portability, wi-fi connectivity, and many other features that, for me, are secondary, but great features. I am discovering something new every day. I have no complaints about this tablet. I would recommend the Kindle line, especially the Kindle Fire HD 7\" to anyone.",

Several calls to technical support have yielded help but they have absolutely no clue as to how to fix it. Their only solution is to offer me a nominal credit of $30 (I have invested $338 in this device along with the accessories that go with it). Very disheartened to say the least and will probably not purchase another Kindle. The problem I experienced is common among Kindle users and one would think that Amazon would work on a solution for this problem.",
