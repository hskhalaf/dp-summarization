      "title": "GREAT FOR BALANCED BAT WEIGHT",
      "text": "Great tool to develop and enhance bat swing speed. Love that Champro makes several different weights thereby accommodating all ages of users. We use these during practices and when warming up for games. I can definitely see an improvement in bat speed after using these for an entire season. Another positive is that the \"doughnut\" tends to emphasize a balanced bat weight while sleeve weights add more weight to the end of the barrel. Will be buying some more of these for the Fall Baseball season.",

I thought that if league officials even found one of these in your team's gear bag you could be DQ'd for a Little League game. Perhaps they've changed the rules since I coached. But as a sink sprayer hose weight (my intended use), it's just perfect.",

      "text": "Bought this for my 9 yr-old son. He loved it. Teammates loved it. Coaches loved it. The whole team passed it around. It's really the ideal weight for 9-10 year old kids. I'm giving it 4 stars because it's not easily visible in the grass. This means when they forget to pack it up after a game (as 9 yr olds often do with helmets, gloves, bats, water bottles, etc.) the coaches and parents won't see it. Yes, of course, the kids should learn to be more responsible. But this is a product review. Grass-colored youth weights are easily forgotten and lost. I'm buying the (heavier) orange weight to replace ours.",
