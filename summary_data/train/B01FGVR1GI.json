I was looking at wicker, but decided being insulated was worth giving up the traditional wicker for the insulated baskets. Not only is this basket of incredible quality Kama it was the most reasonably-priced I found. It is the only one I found that had extras like a salt pepper shaker, a cheese cutting board, and cloth napkins! The advertisement says it is a 4 people basket, but I think this is large enough to pack a week's worth of food in!! Plenty of room! Well made. Easy to carry. Thank you!",

The service ware was attractive and seemed sturdy enough for a picnic, and the \"storage\" space was adequate for a bottle of wine and a good amount of food. It was attractive and I would honestly welcome it as a gift to myself.",

This bag kept everything cold for the 2 days I was there and still had 1/3 ice left in the water bottles. Well insulated and could for sure keep drinks cold as fridge temp for at least 3 days. The utensils cut our 0.5in meats without prob. It\u2019s lightweight and so portable. Love this thing!",
