It's a compact dslr, a little on the heavy side, which performs impeccably. I may be a bit biased, being a long time Pentax user but I do own a Nikon dslr plus a full frame csc & 2 micro 4 thirds cameras & this beauty outperforms them all! If you're a first time buyer this could be the only top class camera you'll ever need. To see images taken with this combo. Check out Keefy 243 on Flickr.",

A weather proofed camera that's got a surprising number of enthusiast features at a beginner's price. The dual control dials are another feature you won't see replicated at this spend level. There's not much in the way of competition particularly when you realise how easy it is to put some fantastic legacy glass on the front and achieve superb results.",

Arrived within a couple of days too. Part 2. I have recently returned from Scotland where I photographed a wedding near Stirling and landscapes on the Isle of Skye. Camera behaved superbly - long exposures with filters were successful using LCD screen, manual settings and the histogram in very wet conditions. Very pleased with the results.",
