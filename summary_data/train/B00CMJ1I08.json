      "text": "I agree with others that handheld use is pretty much impossible, as is true for any high-power microscope. The focus could have a little finer control, but is reasonable considering the price. I bought this microscope to examine and photograph the fine details in my 3D prints. It works great for that. The software installed easily and is remarkable free from unwanted add-ons: it does just what I need. All in all, a fine little microscope.",

Other 40$ scopes claim 200x magnifying ability but really only offer 30x with a digital zoom. FAIL! My only complaint is that the stand could be a little more sturdy. The tightening nuts are plastic and I am hesitant to reef on them. This allows a tiny bit of wiggle which isn't a big deal, but it could be improved with some metal fixtures. Software is simple and glitch free with NO bloat ware or 3rd party spam. I researched this a long time and it is the Best scope hands down for the money.",
