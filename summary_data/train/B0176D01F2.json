I have it set up in my living room and it's serving a wonderful purpose in the entry area for our coats and briefcases, bookbags, purses, etc. I have hats on top and baskets on the bottom. Awesome little find. My only complaint comes around the workmanship. We had an issue with one of the screws and it popped through the top and left us with a scar on the edge of the top. I am not sure how to replace the seating board but if I could I would. That was frustrating and I was disappointed in the low quality. I would like to have real wood in that instance.",

We didn't screw this into the wall (we're renting so we don't want to deal w the holes), but for it being free standing it's sturdy enough. I put cute picture frames on the top shelf. The very bottom bench has enough room for about 5-6 pairs of shoes which is a good amount imo.",
