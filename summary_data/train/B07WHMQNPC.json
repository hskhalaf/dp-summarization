Our front door is the only entry or exit for our apartment so we now have a 30 second video record of every entry and exit plus anyone approaching or even walking past our door. The $3 per month fee is well worth the price. Video quality is great during the day or night (see photos), and we can view from our phones or on our TV with our Fire TV stick. It also sounds a chime on our Echo Dot when anyone rings the door bell or knocks on our door.",

Panning up works well.) and a second camera to detect deliveries to the garage door we will be all set. Even without the the tweaks, the Ring has been helpful. We have conformed comings and goings and dealt with a few issues.",

Got it super fast, but it would not work with our door (our door was the right thickness and the hole was fine..) because of the decorative wainscoting on the outside the device wouldnt sit flush between the pieces. Since it didn't sit flush, the piece to screw the back plate into was too short and unsuable. If it were a little longer and there was a shroud that could go around it, it could have worked, but ultimately I had to return it.",

I used it over month and even have purchased an extra battery, but started considering about switching to other solutions. If you are willing to pay $30/device/year for subscription, this might be OK to go.",
