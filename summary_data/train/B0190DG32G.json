      "text": "The maximum RAM this model can support is 16GB, HIDevolution have put 24GB in, but that means 16 have become incompatible and my machine is running on 8GB. The BIOS flashed on my machine is N501VW, not UX501VW - it is amazing that it even switches on! HIDevolution did spend some time on the phone with me to confirm the issue, but as soon as they did, they refused to help me further unless I paid them. End of the day, I have a machine at least 1/3 of the power I paid for. Bad experience. Do not recommend.",

I immediately reformatted and installed Linux Mint, and after a few tweaks, works brilliantly, so no problems there. Yes, it is a US keyboard, but I'm used to the Mac keyboards which are all US layout too, so not a problem, and it is pasted all over the product description as well as the answered questions, so don't understand why some users are \"shocked\" they received a US layout keyboard. Will update if anything goes wrong.",
