It's a piece of metal with holes and hardware, not sure why they charge so much. Can't go wrong buying from Amazon.",

      "text": "I see that they make every effort to support many types of TV sets (they provided many different sizes of screws and nuts). Most of my installation time was spent to make sure I find the right stud behind the dry wall! After that, it's very easy to install the bracket on the wall and the 2 vertical bars on TV. I did everything by myself with a Sanyo 39 inch LED TV. But I think the mounting of the vertical bars (with TV attached) to the horizontal rectangular bracket is not very secure and the bottom \"locking\" mechanism is not tight at all. So it's potentially a safety issue if you have a person bumping into it.",

It does tilt a bit but not much. It lets you lift it to access the inputs on the back of the tv but you are better off taking the tv down or plugging in the cords before putting it up. The access area is very small even if you have small hands. This makes it difficult to turn the cord in the direction needed. Overall I a great product.",

A few things that I love about this mount is that it's affordable, durable and it comes with an hdmi cable. I would highly recommend everyone to stop purchasing those expensive brackets at the stores and purchase these because they do the exact same thing and you save a lot of money.",

One thing to be aware of, if you have a 400X400 mount spacing, you will not have room to slide the TV either direction as the mount is just wide enough to allow this size. The picture shows a smaller TV mount pattern with the \"arms\" moved in. The whole bracket that mounts to the wall is around 17 inches wide so you may have a hard time hitting a stud on both sides of your desired mount area. I would guess that with two stud mounted lag screws and at least two to four expanding drywall butterfly bolts, this would still hold most TV's.",
