Truthfully I couldn\u2019t say enough about the parental controls and how customizable they are- specifically how they separate educational vs entertainment and you can set goals for kids to do x amount of minutes within educational apps/ audible books/ etc before doing entertainment stuff. This product makes the Helicopter parent in me so happy and feel incredibly comfortable with my kids having a tablet. Also- the fact that they aren\u2019t holding a $500+ iPad that they can crack the screen is well worth the price.",
