      "text": "I've had this since 2009. The mouse stopped working in 2012, but I had dropped it a few times. The battery life of the mouse was about 2 weeks. The keyboard still works fine, and the battery life of the keyboard is really good (typically 6 months with 4 hours of use every day). The bluetooth adapter is a Microsoft hardware, and the drivers lack any support for audio devices. You can only use the bluetooth adapter for the keyboard and mouse. A good deal if you only want to use the keyboard and mouse with the provided bluetooth adapter. The bluetooth keyboard and mouse did work with my Android 4 tablet. Windows 7 64-bit.",

      "text": "I bought this keyboard and mouse combo for one reason - to sit back in a comfortable chair and operate a PC connected to my 42\" LCD TV. For this purpose the system works brilliantly. It is light weight and much more responsive that the last bluetooth keyboard and mouse I purchased. The mouse is so responsive I can use it on the arm of my chair. Stylistically, the keyboard is so low profile that it is barely visible when sitting on a flat surface. However, this is NOT a production keyboard. Key travel is minimal, function and certain other keys are touch senstive and there is no numerical keypad. So don't expect to spend a lot of time typing",

Now it seems to have died for good and I'm calling Msft for support. I hope they take care of it. This stupid thing is only 5 months old! Oh, the keyboard is nice though, sleek and light and although there's a minute lag due to the Btooth, it's pretty useful. I prefer the raised keys but overall the kybd is pretty good.

The slight curve on the keyboard isn't ergonomic at all and there is no elevation change as you would expect from an ergonomic keyboard... so what you get is the worst of both worlds... people who want ergonomics won't get it and people who can't stand ergonomic keyboards won't like it either.
