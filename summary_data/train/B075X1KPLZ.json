So... it's me, not the blender. I guess I have to put less in the jar AND not turn on the blender until the blades are submerged to avoid spraying smoothie all over the kitchen. But, the blender is powerful enough to send a poorly-assembled smoothie mix to all ends of the kitchen and dining room. Once the volume of the jar's contents was low enough, the blender worked to produce a wonderfully smooth and deliciously blended smoothie. Now for the cleanup.",

At 500 watts it has serious power and it is super easy to use. I made tomato soup and it blended it in under a minute, then I just popped the bottom off and washed it! Super simple.

      "text": "Good quality, however, the issue with this mixer is the speed adjustments. There are 8 speeds setting, plus a Turbo button. The lowest speed setting is what I would expect the High speed setting to be. The lowest speed setting is so fast it throws whatever you\u2019re mixing all over the place with the whisk attachment. There is very little noticeable difference between the High and Low setting. If they could fix this speed issue, I would rate it higher, and use it more often.",

I got a nice consistency for my preserves with little effort.. very happy with this item and would recommend to anyone looking to make life a little easier.. sellers were great, too! Thanked me for my purchase..",

To be fair, I was using this blender twice daily to grind up a half cup of dry dog food. It wasn't on for long, but the matter being processed was not liquid or soft fruit/veggies. Would it have lasted longer if I'd been making smoothies? I'll never know. It was very easy to clean though, and easy enough to use although the cord was a little cumbersome. Will be looking for something specifically for nuts/hard items now.",

The black attachment piece that you put the whisk and frother into does not come apart, but of course needed to be cleaned after use. Water got stuck in the piece during cleaning. I find that rather disgusting and a major mold concern. Will be returning. The whisk attachment also fell off multiple times into the food I was making. It wasn\u2019t sturdy enough to mix with.",

There is a standard power speed which has a turn dial, and a turbo speed as well. Most of the time, before you start high speeds, you need to mix/emulsify slowly in order to thicken your solution before upping the speed. This emulsifier ONLY goes fast and will spray things all over you and the house and the counter. And I have tried many different mixing bowls and cylinders. Need a slow option as well",

It says you can put the blade end in the dishwasher, but I find it cleans very nice, if operated in hot soapy water, then rinsed.
