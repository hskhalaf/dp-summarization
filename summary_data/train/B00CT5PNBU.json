Before 2019 season, a firmware update that was pushed to the device apparently caused it to become inoperable hanging on the \"Loading RainMachine data...\" screen despite failed attempts to restore it to factory settings. Customer Support told us that we would have to pay to ship it back for evaluation and likely pay even more to have it repaired depending on the discovered issue. I would not recommend this product given the lack of customer support when the issue was almost certainly related to a pushed update caused by the manufacturer.",

I contacted their \"support team\" and they suggested by email that I delete and reinstall the app. I followed their advice and it continues to crash upon opening.

Quite faulty for quite a bit of money. (Also I should note, we live in Southern CA so \"rainstorm\" is an overstatement).",

Plus it is fun as can be to sit on your phone and remotely turn on the sprinklers when you see your kids outside playing!! One minor issue I found was that after a power outage, restoring connectivity to WiFi seemed troublesome. Easily averted with simply lookin on your phone after a outage to ensure you are still connected.",

The ability to control with mobile device for routine maintenance is alone worth the price. My wife says she finally is able to operate sprinkler system, which again is worth the price. The only difficult thing is programming your router(s) to allow access across town or the continent. RainMachine's support is awesome in helping you with this programming. You send in an email requesting support. Suggest you ask them right off the bat to access your computer and fix.",

Also to look out your window, decide the lawn is looking a little dry in that section and just add a minute or two to that program on the ipad is great. I also have trees that need water every 3 days, lawn every other day, veggie garden every day. Accommodates this easily and could have even more programs. I did mount it into the Orbit 57095 (but bought at local orange big box store). Fits easily with room to burn, although the transformer was at maximum height.",
