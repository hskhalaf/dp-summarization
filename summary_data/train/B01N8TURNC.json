If you do manage to place the baby in it without waking him, the slightest movement will shake the whole thing and wake him anyways. Also, it is so low to the ground that I imagine my back would be killing me if I had actually used this for any length of time. Waste of money.",

This bassinet is perfect because it is much smaller and does not allow room to rotate. Sometimes my son would push up and get his face against the mesh but it never left a rash or mark.

This is one of the only bassinets on the market with mesh around more than 75% of the sides and I honestly don't know why more don't do that. Our baby managed to mash her face into the side during several naps and I'm thankful I didn't get a bassinet with more solid sides.",

I didn\u2019t know it had a vibrating feature (my fault) but I\u2019m hoping it comes in handy! It\u2019s a bit shorter than I expected, fine for me as I\u2019m short, but my husband is tall so it\u2019ll be a bit harder to bend down. Again, not a big deal, but don\u2019t be alarmed when you open this to how short it is. Can\u2019t wait to use for baby #2!",
