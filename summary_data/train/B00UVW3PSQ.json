I haven't used the stand up position, but it is simple to put it in that position. I do wish that the seat by the handle would recline back a little, my newborn falls forward a little. But it easily changes to a position to place her car seat in. I do wish it was a little smaller when folded up, but there is probably not a double stroller out there that would be. Graco is my favorite traveler brand!",

But if there's every 2 or more of us going for a walk we tend to just put 2 single strollers in the trunk rather than lug this monstrous stroller around. Another important thing to note is the cupholder for parents is way too small, it would only hold something like a plastic dixie cup, no adult-sized water bottle.",
