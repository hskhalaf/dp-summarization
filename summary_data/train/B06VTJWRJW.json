When we returned to US from International trip we requested help again regarding this \"Lemon\" of a $350.00 32 G Wifi/Cell. To-day Amazon provided their solution an we received an \"All New Oasis\" which turned out to be a poorly boxed refurbished unit. A brand new top of the line $350.00 Oasis malfunctions out of the box and Amazon thinks a refurbished unit is a suitable replacement - it is not!!! I have escalated and will update on Amazon's further \"customer service\". Original Problem - brand new $350.00 Oasis Kindle. 4 hours reading on Airplane Mode and the battery is dead.

I wish I could read and listen at the same time--like with the Kindle App for Android and iOS. Maybe Amazon could implement that with the next software update.

In order to deal with the slippery body, I ordered two 5\u201dx7\u201d sheets of Talon Grip material (normally used to add customized grippiness to a pistol). It is super thin, super sticky, and made to be cut. I cut one sheet to make the back grippy, and a small strip to make the glass above and below the buttons grippy. (See attached photos). Now it\u2019s perfect (I could have made straighter cuts, granted). This is similar in result to using gaff tape, but I like this look better.",

You can add fonts. This is by far the best Kindle that they have made and worth the extra money!",

The paperwhite is terrific (no reaching for that overhead light) and with the gripping edge, it is so easy to hold and read. The only problem is with the cover - if you fold it backwards, it lies flat and you lose the gripping edge. I'm still unsure about Goodreads, and I'm still trying to figure out what amazon prime benefits I have if any, but so far, so good! If you are considering between the Oasis and the regular Kindle, the main difference is the up/down side buttons and the gripping edge, so if you don't need those, the regular Kindle is terrific also.",

At the rate it burns through battery power, a full recharge lasts mere days, not weeks.
