Apparently it has not been heat tested, because the glue MELTED and ran like water. (The tape is absolute cheap garbage compared to the actual equipment, but if something is going to be cheaply made, be glad it was only the tape.) I ended up buying a roll of grip tape from Amazon and using that instead. Looks and works perfectly. The equipment itself is very well made, and not terribly difficult to get perfectly level. It took me three tries to get it perfect, but hey, I'm a perfectionist.",

Also it supporting down my back and bottom is key. This is the total package.",

That can be replaced however. For the price, you won't be disappointed.",
