They don't pay for 'jacked-up' curls which is what this provides especially if your are moving fast to keep your chair filled. I love Conair but I DEFINITELY will be returning this wand. And by tha' way it might just be me...all wands should come with a glove.... a full.... hand glove. Not some 'cut-corner' piece of useless junk. Again, see video.",

I got my IP today amd decided to put it to use on my neice's hair (see pics). She was happy and even though I have to part the hair very thin to get a good press, it only took about 40 minutes (I'm not a professional you see\ud83d\ude09). All in all very happy with my purchase. FyI. Purchasing the HCI Argan Oil Thermal Protection spray was also a good idea!",
