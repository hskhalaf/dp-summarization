It\u2019s a great addition to our driveway and provides a lot of fun father son time after school and it\u2019s a good escape from the Xbox with his friends on the weekends. It\u2019s nice and sturdy and has already withstood some strong gusty winds. We filled ours (the base) with water.",

I suggest you allot enough time for the project. Also rather than fill the base with sand or water which makes the system pretty difficult to move around for me, I just placed 3 (40# each) bags of top soil on the base. Works well and I can move the backboard around, if needed. I did tell the kids no dunking or hanging from the rim!",

We've had a few strong storms here since and the wind hasn't been an issue. We like the adjustable height option, but haven't really used it.",
