I'm not too crazy about some of the engineering of the box either especially some of the compartments. I still have a couple of my Plano tackle boxes from when I was a kid so I am expecting this one to hold up just as well as it appears to be well made.",

The standard boxes that come with it are only 1\u201d high. Bigger items & plugs don\u2019t fit well. Standard box is not divisible like the standard 3750 & that is really handy.

All of my friends that I have suggested this box to all agree that this is the top notch tackle box.",

The picture is deceiving showing that the box is in there. The text is deceiving stating the top racks are included. This is a fine tackle box, but not hardly worth the expense without the additional storage. You can buy the extra box for about $11.00 plus shipping on Amazon, but who knows where you can find the top racks lol!",
