      "text": "The sound quality was good, but if you are choosing these over the DT990's because they are less \"open-backed\" be careful. I found they still leak a lot of sound. This would be an issue if - You need to share the room with other people - You want to monitor home recording I was advised to consider this range by people who assumed I'd be using them to mix music. I sent mine back and bought some DT770's instead which are better for sound leakage. Given these cost around 40% more than the 770 or 990 Pro models, make sure you check your requirements before choosing them.",

The build quality is excellent; more solid than the HD650 and they don't require quite as much power to drive them. My only criticism is that they tend to emphasise the treble and are a little lacking in the bass department and do not compare particularly well to the sound from a decent pair of speakers. Overall a great pair of headphones, but after a while I found myself reverting to the Sennheiser.",

Good for music production / mixing etc. and also nice for casual listening.",

      "text": "Bought these for the primary reason to complete my collection of what is known as \"old school\" headphones. They consist of HD 650's, K 702's and now the DT 880's. The 702's are my goto Jazz phones, the 880's more for rock and they are the best in the bass dept. The 650's on those lazy classical or soft female singers. The 880's actually work good on all the genre's that I listen to. They are wonderful headphones with a good soundstage, nice air around instruments and highly recommended for all your listening pleasure. I prefer them over my 650's.",

I also own the DT-770 and DT990, and I have to say this DT-880 250ohm pro is my favorite. I'm pairing it with the Geek Out 1000, which is also one of the best portable DACs I've found. It's also one of the few that has enough wattage to power a high impedance like 250 ohm. You might want to check your DAC/Amp to see if it can handle 250 ohm.",

      "text": "From the Beyerdynamic I own the DT-770, the custom one pro's the T70p and finally got my hands on the DT-880. They DT-880 even withought being fully burnt in right now are easily the best to listen to overall. The clamp is perfect for me, T70p were too loose and the DT-770 were too tight. The soundstage is brilliant and the clarity is great. Not overpowering in the highs, lacking a little in the base ... but that's what amps are for right? :D",

However I do not recommend these to people expecting them to block out noise from outside, they leak a little, but they are incredibly open backed, not a problem for me thus the 5 stars. All in all they are great headphones and they provide clear and precise bass, treble and the mids are nice and crisp for me. Definitely recommend to others.",
