      "text": "This case is nicely made. Not sure what the fabric is, like ballistic nylon but softer, more elegant. Has some, but not a lot of padding; not stiff. It has a small mesh pocket inside the lid suitable for cleaning cloth and/or carry strap storage. The lid covers well enough to keep out normal rain showers. There are loops on the back for belt attachment. It fits my vortex 10x42 binoculars (6.25\" x 5.25\" x 2.25\" w/ lens caps) with just a little room to spare, so you could probably fit something a bit larger. Probably not a 50mm set. Haven't seen anything better in a soft case--I would buy this again.",

The 10x42s do fit in the case but with very little room to spare. The original case easily allowed my attached Viper shoulder slings to fit inside while wrapped around the binoculars. This case will not, however, there is room to put the shoulder straps at the top of the case as long as the buckle strap is fully extended. Would have preferred one with the same dimensions as original, but this one will work.",

Even though mine is an 'earlier' model that is made in Macau rather than Japan, the optics are absolutely superb! Super crisp and easy to focus to tack sharp. It came with a leather strap but no case, so I bought this Vortex case to protect this super find. The case fits perfect with extra room on top to fit the folded strap into the mesh pocket.",

The Glass Pak has a weak bungee loop over a small open ended hook. It easily pops open if bumped. The Glass-Pak case also has no room for the nice neoprene Vortex bino stock strap without forcing it each time into the Glass-Pak case. This case\u2019s Pros: Solid locking flap latch, padded non slip shoulder strap (pad not shown in advertised photos of case), room to easily store the nice neoprene vortex binoculars strap supplied with my Vortex Viper 8X42, belt/backpack loops on back for better mobility if needed. This case\u2019s Cons: none.",

While it won't serve the use I bought it for it will carry some essentials ashore on a cruise or about town touring. Ample room for mid-day meds and valuables carried under your shirt or jacket!
