When I initially received them, I didn't expect much. I just needed something that could play music, but I can honestly say these come close to even popular brands such as jabras elite. They sound good, bass is actually very good, and omg they're actually comfortable. Some earbuds tend to become very obtrusive in the ear after and hour or soo of listening but these fit very snug and don't hurt my ears. I honestly do recommend these earbuds, they don't disappoint whatsoever.",

Furthermore, the earbuds come with four different sizes of eartips. Therefore, I believe that the in-ear fit is just about universal.

These aren't noise cancelling, but when they are in, they significantly abate outside noise. Much like wearing good ear plugs.

      "text": "Bought these for my daughter's birthday. Wasn't sure how they would do given their price, but they work great! The battery life is very long, and the noise cancellation and sound quality are excellent. A nice feature is that when you only use one of the earbuds at a time, the other earbud doesn't play and use up its battery. They are comfortable in the ears, too. We are very happy with the purchase, and we would highly recommend them!",

Sound quality is great, there is definitely some bass, and the case is rechargeable. With 2 hours daily commutes I really only need to charge once per week. Can't go wrong with these.",

I tried these out and they actually fit in my ear and don't fall out! I think the way it's shaped (with the long end) helps to keep it in place. The controls took some time to getting used to, but now it's easy to use. The sound quality is pretty good. Definitely would recommend for runners!",

I much prefer Anker Soundcore, which I had lost and replaced with these, trying to save a few bucks.",
