I am not a coffee connoisseur (I drink Maxwell House), but the coffee is hot and just as tasty as my old Cuisinart (>2x more expensive).",

Coffee flows fast from the Carafe! The coffee tastes great! We use the regular brew setting. It's very easy to use, I set it to auto program every night with just the push of one button. It is it is very light in weight. Not a problem for me, but some people might not like how light it is.",

I largely pour my coffee directly to a travel mug so I can't even microwave it because they all have metal on them. I've been using Hamilton Beach for at least the last 10 years and this is very disappointing.",

I slapped a piece of duct tape over the cutout and haven't had any problems since. The filter \"stick\" is also a pain in the ass to correctly put back where it goes after replacing the water filter. No good feeling of when it's back where it belongs. Just 2 design flaws, but it's still a decent coffee maker.",

This one is a great price, so incredibly easy to use and the coffee is fantastic. It also has a timer on it that lets me know how long the coffee has been brewed for. Overall I highly recommend this coffee maker.",
