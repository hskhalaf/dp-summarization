The updated version provides enhanced stability, cushioning and comfort. It is a great partner for daily running activity. Given the positive and negative comments from the users, the Wildcat 2.0 GTX still needs a few improvements.",

      "cons": [
        "The Wildcat 2.0 GTX has a narrow construction and not ideal for runners with wider foot",

      "text": "Be aware! I usually wear a size 8 1\u20442 or 9. These are size 9 1\u20442 and a perfect fit. Other reveries have said the same thing so buy a 1\u20442 - 1 size larger than you wear. This is my 3rd pair and there's good reason for that. They wear well, have great balance and I am still wearing my second pair, I just bought these because it looks like they are discontinuing the blue/black color. They have lasted a lot longer than other similar shoes I've bought and I'm frikkin' HARD on trail runners! Excellent purchase.",

I never thought I'd pay this much for a running shoe again, but I owned a prior version I bought on sale and liked them so much I wanted another pair when the others wore out. These shoes have a lot of cushion for a trail shoe. They are waterproof, the soles are sticky, and the tread grips incredibly well. The lacing pattern seems overly complicated",

Not very light, but a decent amount of motion control and lots of padding, great traction. A high-performance off-road shoe, but not a racer by any means. My feet are pretty narrow and I had to get a half size larger than usual.",

I thought it might be because it needed a longer break-in period, or different socks, or different terrain. These shoes are too small, and I ordered the same size I have used in all previous LaSportiva products. Now, given that I have exceeded the 30-day return period, I cannot get credit for the $155 I shelled out. Well you have screwed me as a customer, and I shall NEVER buy LaSportiva footwear again. I guess someone at Goodwill with smaller feet will see if these work for them.",

I used these in the snow as well and they tracked amazingly up and downhill. After 5-6 months of use and abuse they are toast. Soul is (seriously) half gone on both shoes, and what remains isnt pretty. Outer shell is half unraveled etc. etc. I got a bit of toe jamn,blisters, and the like, - but if youre gonna bomb down hills you should expect to break your feet in and not your shoes. Gooood overall, but I cant afford the price every 6 months.",
