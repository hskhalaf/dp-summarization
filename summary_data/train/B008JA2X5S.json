The frame where the stabilizers attach was bent, so I had to break out the vice grips to repair it. Also, make sure you get some masking tape and put over the holes between the fan and the drivetrain cover. Lost both a bolt and the Allen wrench into the whole and had to remove the cover in order to retrieve them. Pain in the rear.",

You would think they would redo it from the plastic part that gives way when you sit on the seat. Within minutes, I was sliding off the front of the seat. Very frustrating. The seat itself is very comfortable. And, so far after three days, the bike works well. It wasn't hard for me to put together myself. I ordered a new seat. We'll see if that solves the problem.",

Alot of good videos on great workouts on these airbikes. Great to use in high intensity training and intervals. Hope this helps.",
