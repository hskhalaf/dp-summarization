Folding it was a bit tricky, but I figured it out after watching a YouTube video (hint: after you fold it into a taco standing on its end, fold the top down into the middle of itself (like folding into 3rds) not folding into the middle). We wouldn't use this tent in the rain, but for hanging out in the backyard, it is great!",

Having a tarp in the trees above the tent could solve this, but then that zeros out the ease of automatic pop up. If you are planning all your camping trips around excellent weather forecasts then it's an awesome little tent.",

It also has stains. Quality of material appears to be subpar if compared to cheaper non pop up tents found in retail stores. The side windows also open from the outside and are not 100 percent sealable if it rains. Giving it two stars only because it pops up quickly and is light weight. The Concept is good but not worth the money spent in my opinion. Also, At first try not able to un-pop (dissemble) but this probably takes a lot of practice so not grading on that aspect.",

It was also handy to use when claiming camping site spot upon arrival, set up in 2 mn. Stayed in perfect shape and did not budge through rough weather. Super easy to set up and fold when done. Inside is large enough for not-so-tall person. Two people would be crowded in this. Both sides have mesh screen so plenty of air flow.",
