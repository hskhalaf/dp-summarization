The popcorn popper pot is very easy to remove to clean and the bottom tray that slides out is convenient for picking up loose kernels that don't pop. The bottom tray is easy to remove for cleaning you just need to take off the little front flipper door on the front. The popcorn popper works great and can be removed from cart to be a counter top model if needed. Construction is built good and the wheels are durable.",

Very easy to use, I recommend putting more oil than you think. The first couple of batches I went light on the oil and the popcorn came out stale. Now I use one cup popcorn, half cup oil, half a teaspoon popcorn salt. Now the popcorn is excellent!! (probably not healthy though)",

I used jolly time popcorn brand in the bag ( the cheap way to go) from the grocery store and it popped great so I guess the brand doesn't matter that much. I only used it about 3 times since I had it . so a month isn't really that long so hoping it keeps performing as it has been. seem like it will.",

As it's popping you see unpopped kernels flying out with the popped corn. Deducting 2 stars for only one problem seems like a big drop but 10% is a lot of waste.",
