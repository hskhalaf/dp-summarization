I\u2019d be careful when attaching it to the hose as it is plastic and the threads may not hold up over time.

It is also very annoying not to be able to maneuver it without kinking or turning off the water. Much better options of sprinklers out there - will maybe use this one as a pass-through for the vegetable garden in the back - hopefully, this at least works.",

The GrowGreen sprinkler is excellent if you have good water pressure to make it spin and drench!",

My only complaint is if you have to put it in an area between you and where you need to go, you'll get wet..... You can't wait for it to oscillate to one side and run, like side to side ones. BUT...... minor inconvenience, and I still highly recommend as it does a better job of coverage than the ones I've had that go side to side.",
