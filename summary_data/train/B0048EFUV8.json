There are numerous competitors in this class of small, handheld routers. I liked the DWP611 because of the variable speed feature and the built in light.

Going forward I will only buy DeWalt. I have an 18V Makita cordless drill that stripped the planetary gearset the first time I tried to drill a hole for a door knob. They would not repair it even though it was only 3 months old. It will be replaced with DeWalt!",

The square base on one side is also a great feature; it gives the unit more stability, and allows you to hold the square base for extra control, where needed. Also handy when using it with an edge guide. A round clear base is available as an optional accessory. Reasonably powerful for most hobby-type routing jobs.

But I also hate it because wrapping your hand around the router to hold it can allow your finger to contact the blade. I did just that and my finger required three stitches but I could have easily lost the entire end of my finger.",

    "title": "DEWALT Router, Fixed Base, Variable Speed, 1-1/4-HP Max Torque (DWP611)",
    "description": "Style:RouterVariable speed control with soft starting motor features full time electronic feedback that maintains motor speed through the cut. Dual LED's and clear sub base ensure maximum visibility, adjustment ring enables controlled bit depth changes, large, low-pressure spindle lock button, multiple shaft lock detents, depth ring, clamping mechanism and spring loaded release tabs. Specs: 7.0 amps, 16,000-27,000 RPM no load speed, 1/4\" collet diameter, 1.5\" plunge stroke, 4\" base dimension, 12 position spindle lock, weighs 4.1 lbs. Includes: motor, standard base, wrench and instruction manual.Plunge base incorporates fine-tune adjustment rod for precise depth setting. Aluminum motor housing and base construction provides long term durability\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\n\nCombining power, ease-of-use, ergonomic features and innovations designed for visibility, control and overall performance, the DEWALT DWP611 compact router can handle a variety of applications--from small bevel cuts to large edge profiles and heavy flush trimming. In addition to its beefy 1-1/4 horsepower motor, the DWP611 is equipped with dual LED lights for ample illumination. This package comes with a fixed base, but it's also available as a kit with both fixed and plunge bases.\n\n\n\nThe DWP611 with fixed base (view larger).\n\n\n\nDual LED's and clear sub-base ensure maximum visibility (view larger).\n\nPOWER AND PERFORMANCE\nThe DWP611 compact router features a 1-1/4 peak HP motor that delivers significantly more power than competitors' models to help you be as productive as possible. The variable speed control helps you to better manage the tool and determine the speed that is best suited for the application at hand. A low, contoured grip that is close to the work surface also contributes to an excellent level of control--providing both precision and productivity on the job site. The soft starting motor features full time electronic feedback that maintains motor speed through the cut. An adjustment ring enables controlled bit depth changes to within 1/64-inch.\n\nCOMFORT AND CONVENIENCE\nThe fixed base's dual LEDs and clear sub-base ensure maximum visibility in operation. The extended 1/4-inch router collet provides greater bit contact with the bit shaft than traditional routers, allowing you a firm grip on the bit and less vibration. The D-shaped sub-base provides stability and flatness when running edge profiles, and the spindle lock has been designed to greatly improve the ease of bit change by incorporating a large button that can be actuated with the same hand that stabilizes the router. \n\nThe router also features two tabs that allow for a quick and simple base release, and a new base/adjustable clamp design so the motor location is maintained through the toughest applications.\n\nWARRANTY\nThis DEWALT tool is backed by three-year limited warranty covering any defects due to faulty materials or workmanship (from the date of purchase).",
