So when my Panasonic electric shaver of 11 years was finally not holding a charge, I ordered the ES8243A as well. As expected, this new electric shaver is wonderful. Shaves close.

I do use Williams Lectric Shave as I have for years and it works well. Thanks to the other reviewers here that pointed out they liked this one better than the 5 blade because as wide as the head on this, I don't think the wider 5 blade would of worked as well for me. I've had this for a couple of months now and am very happy with it. Recommended!",

It isn't super close, and it has irritated my skin a number of times. The shave quality is pretty comparable to the about $30 Remington I was using the past few years. Thankfully I got this on sale at a good price.",
