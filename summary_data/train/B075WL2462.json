I don't even use it for wheels, only the tires. 4 Sprays around the tire for each, 16 sprays total. Instant browning, some agitation with a stiff brush and they are clean and black, no additional browning, ready for protection. I've done 4 cars and still have about 50% of the bottle left. It's inexpensive and economical. If they sold this in a gallon form I'd gladly buy it in that size, shame turtle wax doesn't do more for us in that way.",

It was able to take off terrible brake dust off of a car that I was working on. Amazing! The only downside it that you need quite a bit to get it clean and because of that, this only lasted a total of three washes. I will be repurchasing but not as a duo as my tire shine is still completely full.",

I wanted something that was an all it one. It works fine on my wheels and tires, but honestly, I do not have faith that it will work on heavier brake dust or tires that are especially dirty. It is a bit tough to get the previous applied tire dressing off. But look, for $4.00 it's a good deal. If you are looking for deep cleaning, spend the extra money and look elsewhere.",

I rated it a four because the main purpose for using this is for the dark sheen we all like on our tires. Didn't rate a five because of the buildup.",

Not \"grungy\" caked-on layers, but a definite brown tint. It would wipe off easily enough, but with the nooks and crannys its a bit of a pain. I purchased this hoping to reduce the effort required. Applied according to directions, and it seemed to clean the sidewalls of the tires but it did *nothing* to the brake dust. Not even a little bit. A second application did not help, nor did longer soak times. Very disappointed in this product.",
