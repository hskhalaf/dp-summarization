So after I returned this product, I ordered the next wider size from Zappo's as they weren't available here, and they were still too narrow. I was also dismayed by the poor quality of the leather and workmanship which do not justify a steep $395.00 price tag. Supposedly AE does not have a quality control department; quality is adjusted according to customer feed back and returns. Let's see if my two returns create an uptick in that area.",

As one reviewer previously stated, I always purchase a 9.5 (e.g. NIKE) but as recommended by other reviewers I purchased a 8.5 Allen Edmonds Men's McAllister and they fit perfectly. Highly recommend this shoe to anyone looking for a shoe built to last and is appropriate for graduate school or any other business setting.",
