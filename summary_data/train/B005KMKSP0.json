If you measure the actual space where the food goes, they are 6-1/2 x 3-3/4 x 3/4 inches. If you plan to cook single-serving enchiladas, lasagna, etc., these will not work - they are far too shallow and even if the sauce didn't gush out, you'd need two of these to make a single serving. Shepherds pie? Forget it, they'd be 1/2\" tall after cooking. This might be good for a large creme brulee, or a small piece of fish, but that's about it. I will be returning them.",

I was looking for something the same size and these are larger than what I had but so much nicer. I like to make individual servings of mac & cheese or scallopped potatoes, etc. and these dishes are excellent for that going directly from the oven to serving. They are dishwasher safe, microwave save AND oven safe. I like plain white because they go with whatever color or theme dinnerware I'm choosing to use.",

But when I used water to measure, they should be able to hold as much as our old dishes--just not anything with a lot of sauce, which we don't normally do. I will be using these for individual servings of enchiladas, casseroles, and desserts. The benefit of them being more shallow than our old dishes is that they heat up faster, you get more crispness, and they stack very well and take up less room in the cabinet. Very happy with this purchase--especially with the fantastic price.",
