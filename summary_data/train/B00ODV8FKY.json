We sit him down and rationally explain why eating foam rubber that comes from some unspecified country of origin is maybe not the best long-term health plan. He's been remarkably responsive.",

I had been using pipe insulation which did a good job protecting, but looked a bit tacky for the long haul. It is a bit tedious to place the tape strips on the long edging pieces but they seem to be holding well. The color blends well with our brick and it looks much like nice trim. The corners make the job look very finished. Time will tell about durability, but it has stood up to a busy 20+ pound guy pulling himself up and cruising along the hearth on several occasions. That's a good start. It definitely softens a dangerous hazard in our home.",

I found that heating the edges of a knife and than immediately cutting the edge protector to size made it an easier process. Be very careful if you choose to do this.",

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it requires you to adhere the double sided tape yourself and it is a tedious, slightly tricky task to do by yourself. Otherwise, would definitely recommend. The color was a nice neutral that blended well with my white and grey/beige fireplace and didn\u2019t draw a lot of unwanted attention.",
