If you have a protection cover you have to push a little harder but it's not bad. Since i dont have an ipad pro, i use this pen for the procreate app and it's pretty good. The only sucky thing is that it doesnt have that pressure sensitivity obviously. I love how the pen feels when I write, the quality is also good. I just hate how it turns off automatically after 120 seconds which can be annoying. Overall, I like this pen! I love the tip of then pen, very good and durable!",

(Disclaimer: I don't know how it acts when doing notes and drawings, as I only demo-ed it for a while when my grandmother visited.

I\u2019ve gone back to using a cheapo but reliable $5 stylus. I really wanted to like it but can\u2019t believe this stylus received so many favorable views. I would imagine this stylus would be a nightmare for drawing as well! I have to go over letters multiple times so drawing or sketching might be annoying.",
