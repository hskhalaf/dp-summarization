Nice to know you have that extra range of power if you need it though.",

A three gallon tank (which is a smaller one) will weigh about 10-15 pounds full and will last for many hours, even if you simultaneously run a propane camp stove with it--this latter use requires a distributor (also called a tree) and another hose. All pretty simple to use. Read all the safety regulations that come with this gear, especially as regards use in an enclosed environment!",

The gas valve attachment to the propane bottle leaves the lamp slightly cocked to the side. The base is too big to securely attach to the standard green Coleman propane bottles that they have a blue million of at Walmart, Academy Sports, etc. I think you can get a cheaper Coleman lantern that does just as well, or maybe another brand or LED model.",

    "description": "The next time you're enjoying the outdoors, take one of the brightest lanterns available\u2014a Coleman NorthStar propane lantern. It lights easily without matches. Just push the InstaStart ignition. The lantern is designed for just the right light. Turn it up to its highest\u20141540 lumens\u2014or dim it as low as you need it. Careful construction also allows you to take this lantern with you in any weather. Thanks to the Perfectflow system, your lantern receives consistent fuel, no matter the conditions or fuel level. Protecting the light, a high-temperature globe, metal guard and durable porcelain ventilator offer quality that will have you lighting this outdoor companion season after season. A folding base offers stability when the lantern is in use and low-profile storage when it's not. One 16.4-oz. propane cylinder will power the lantern for up to 4.3 hours on high and 9.25 hours on low. Insta-Clip tube mantles are our easiest to install.",
