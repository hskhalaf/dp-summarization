They are VERY sharp on the edges. There are warnings all over the packaging and instructions about sharp edges. Be careful when opening, removing the protective vinyl film, and installing.

As another reviewer already pointed out they really do make a difference in distributing heat more evenly than the worn, original equipment bars and look like they will be more durable. They also protect the burners below much better in preventing food drips from causing no flame zones. I highly recommend these as a simple and inexpensive way of restoring your aged grill to peak performance.",
