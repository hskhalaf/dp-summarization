My wrist size is 6.5 inches and I also used the printed size chart directly from the Fitbit website...which My end result was a large...It fell just on the large side of the little coloured bar. I decided to get a small...and I made a right choice. With the small, I can wear as they recommend. Not to snug, not to loose. Plus I have an excess of 4 more holes remaining to choose from.",
