      "text": "Best part about this kitchen is the storage and it's size. For how thin it is it can store a lot of fake foods, which is great. It doesn't stick out from the wall much at all and it offers all the bells and whistles of the bigger wood ones. Building it was a breeze. If you don't have a power drill, it will be way more work for 2 reasons: 1. You have to put in about 40 screws, a lot of them are 1.5 inches. 2. Most of the screw holes are NOT pre-drilled, so using a basic screwdriver would be extremely difficult I believe. Buy a Ryobi!",

Not too many pieces nor too hard to put together for assembly. The features such as the turning knobs, the boiling sound effects for the pot and pan, and the faucet nozzle turning sounds made it seem very realistic to a 13 month old. Our son absolutely loves to watch us cook and little did we know just how much he was taking in. He LOVES this. If you're stuck like we were, on which kitchen set to pick, this is a great one to purchase.",

Also, the hooks for the utensils are very hard to snap in. I've had it for about 4 weeks now and had my husband try several times, but still can't push them in. Other than this, I am very pleased.",

      "text": "I'm not sure if it was the manufacturer or the shipping handler, but there are several places in which it was dented, making it nearly impossible to assemble. There's also a long scratch on the side by the refrigerator that I had to sand down so the 2-year-old this is intended for doesn't get scratched. It's cute, and I'm not denying that, but it came in terrible condition.",
