My kid has been obsessed with sporting a kind of faux-hawk after seeing Hawkeye (his favorite avenger), and the hair held all day. He has been so proud running around and showing everybody. Smell was nice, it didn\u2019t smell like chemicals. Easily re-shaped after just wetting my fingers. Held the whole day. Most importantly, a CLEAN PILLOWCASE! My kid went to sleep without washing it out and it didn\u2019t flake or leave a residue. God knows I don\u2019t need anymore laundry to do... Would recommend.",

Needed a product that wouldn't dry his hair out and would keep his curls. After a good co-wash, I put this on and it kept his curls for about two days (which was great). I did put a leave-in conditioner on before it which may have impacted the duration of hold, but healthy hair is my primary goal. Recommend keeping it moisturized as it can be a bit drying as most gels.",

We needed something to hold his bangs up so it wouldn't keep going in his eyes - this worked perfectly! We tried the gel version first - it's good for styling, but doesn't have holding power. This comes out like a soft paste, but is not too tacky, and it's very easy to use. Lasting power is what you'd expect: better than a gel, not as long as a product made for spiking. We live in Hawaii, humidity didn't have a negative affect. We will def buy again. =)",
