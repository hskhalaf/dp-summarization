The outsole also gained conflicting reviews because there were claims that it provided adequate traction while others stated that it did not have any grip on wet floors. The durability is another point of contention. Though the Avi-Union II was generally comfortable, its durability and outsole quality were factors for some people not to repurchase this model.",
      "pros": [
        "A majority of the reviewers were impressed by how comfortable the Avia Avi-Union II was for long periods of walking and standing",
        "The fit was considered to be perfect by numerous users",
        "A fair number of folks claimed that the outsole provided adequate grip even on wet surfaces",
        "Some buyers lauded the durability of the product",
        "The upper was deemed supportive by a few wearers"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "A significant number of shoppers complained about the durability of the Avia Avi-Union II because the sole unit detached from the upper with just a few months of use",
        "The outsole was said to be slippery on kitchen floors, as stated by some service crew purchasers"

Its no fault of the shoe..its just that when I order them they didnt have just Wide..it was only extra wide..so I thought I would give them a try..Well they are really too wide for him and wished they had the Wide option..I just pull the velcro really tight and he seems ok with that. Im not sure if thats good either..but again..I love the shoe just not the option I had for the size. Its a new brand for us and I like them alot better than the other.",
