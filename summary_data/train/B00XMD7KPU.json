However, it has only the 4 USB-A ports, with a total power limit of 900 ma. and no way to supplement it. That's not enough power for the typical peripherals with a 2-in-1 laptop.

Rating for this Item 5/5 from packaging to product this thing is good, will def be buying more anker products in the future, i already have my eye on another hub ;)",

Our individual chargers worked better, I know there are multi chargers out there that work great but this isn't one of them. I will say that the cord could be longer too, I gave it 2 stars because it seems like it's durable.",

As others have mentioned, this may not power all of your devices that require a powered hub, but if you put your lesser power drawing items on this and connect anything more power hungry to the computer's USB you should be fine. Update (06/04/18): It's been a year. I bought a second one. Still great.",

So once I plug in just two sensors in the hub, one directly and the last for the vr headset and hdmi cable, it actually works. So clearly the hub is the bottleneck here. I bet it'll work for other things though, so I'll be keeping it. Though it's a bit disappointing that I can't use the sensors with it. **Update** Customer support contacted me and informed me that the specs are not designed for high voltage. So yeah I think my review has less ground to stand on based on my oversight so I'm adding one more star.",

The hub looks there great as you can see in this attached photo. I have used these hubs a hundred times already, they work well, look great, and the way I have it mounted is very convenient for me.
