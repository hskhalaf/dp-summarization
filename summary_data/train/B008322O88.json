He was wearing it when he slid across the pavement and although his new jacket was shredded, he walked away with only a few small areas of road rash. It could have been much worse. I truly believe this jacket saved him a trip to the ER!",

      "text": "I originally would prefer leather but when I got my hands on this jacket I found the mesh material to be pretty sturdy. It comes with armor padding for your back and shoulders too. It may take some getting used to but if I ever took a tumble on my bike I reckon I'd be very happy to have the extra protection. Since I come from a pretty hot climate I also like the ventilation which keeps me cool when the sun is especially harsh on those cloudless days. When I go highway speeds the vents and fittings help so I don't feel like a wind sail too. Overall happy with my purchase.",

My only concern is if the mesh would evaporate on road contact but those areas most likely to hit have fabric and armor. It's definitely much better, much safer than riding in a t shirt (we've all been there, right?) and the mesh let's in about the same air as if you were in a t shirt. It's not cheap but for a motorcycle mesh jacket it's nicely constructed and I feel safer riding with it than without. Definitely not for fall or winter, you'll freeze in it.",

Plenty of snug points to tighten up the fit. A good thing probably, because I think it runs a hair big. If you have a belly, it\u2019s probably pretty forgiving, but I have to cinch it quite a bit. Construction seems good. We\u2019ll see how it fares over time. Not having to buy armor separately is a nice plus. Like I say, just a good all around value at ~$120.",

The only thing I'm not fond of are the foam protection pads. While I'm sure they would provide some protection, I much rather prefer kevlar. The only problems I've noticed is that my elbow pads and shoulder pads get twisted up when I'm putting it on. Over-all, I gave it 4 stars. It's not as expensive as kevlar jackets so I have to give them that and you don't get hot while wearing it, but there's just something about it that makes it seem uncomfortable to me.",

      "text": "I have had several bike jackets in the past and I gotta say this one is the best. I was not wanting to spend 300-400 dollars on a fancy overpriced jacket by a different brand. It's very comfortable, not to mention looks cool when wearing it. I definitely appear a lot more buff with it on haha I am 5'8 170 pounds and the medium fit me perfectly. Includes a waterproof liner which will keep you warm in cooler weather. This jacket could easily sell for at least twice as much. Always happy with Joe Rocket. Shipping was extremely fast as well!",

The pads stay where they should and do not interfere with movement. The nylon liner is a nice addition however it will not breathe so keep that in mind. Only complaint is the zippers are plastic and not YKK, but the quality of the jacket overall is good.",

It was a hot summer, and mesh during the day was nice and adding the wind proof, and rain liner at night was great. I wore it almost everyday. The liner is difficult to place back in the jacket, but it works perfectly as a separate jacket. Zipper works great as a two piece layer. Easy done...Made my hot summer! Best choice!",
