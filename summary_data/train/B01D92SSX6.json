It was fairly easy to assemble and there are plenty of guides and videos on getting it setup with Linux or anything else your heart desires. You will need to get a fast SD card (purchased separately) or you will notice performance issues.",

The case fit the Pi perfectly which is good because it only came with two screws to attach it to the case, and neither fit, too small. But the board snapped into the lower very tight. It didn't come with the little rubber feet, like the CanaKit, not a big deal for me. The cutout for the pins is larger than the CanaKit so that may be a plus for builder wanting that access. I've bought one Cana and one Vilros, for cases, I'll probably keep looking, but I'd buy the Cana before this again.",

Have to say the Raspberry Pi 3 is delightful and fun to work with. It's fast (boots in seconds) and can do a surprising amount. It's running Linux Debian. One thing it won't do: open lots of tabs in the web browser. It quickly runs out of memory and gets unhappy (non-responsive). I tend to have lots of tabs open; have to watch that. Otherwise, It's quite a capable little box.",

The case is a cool touch, although it doesn't seem to be nearly sturdy enough for a device so small. It also lacks covers for the ports which is a bit disappointing. If you're going for a more portable raspberry pi I would get a different case. As far as the device itself I'm using mine as network storage for a couple of home computers and a minecraft server for the kids. So far so good.",

When I configured the second pi3 I found that the operating system software had undergone major improvements, and so I reconfigured my original pi3. (much better now) I have outfitted the second one with cameras for my home security and environment controls. my only minor hangup is that it would be nice to have analog mic input.",

I did have an issue with accessing my DNS server where the /etc/resolv.conf symlink was referencing a location that was not there. After several troubleshooting attempts I was able to set the nameserver using the dhcp configuration file. I don't believe this was due to the hardware but a misconfiguration from the install. Now everything works great and the ARM programs run smooth from the pacman ARM repo. I did set a schedule to reboot daily to clear the memory. No other issues, good buy!",
