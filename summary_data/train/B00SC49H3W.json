      "text": "Great first racquet for kids. For my eight year old daughter, I purchased the 25\". It says that size is for 9-10 year olds, but my child is tall and I figured she will grow into it. The racquet didn't seem too large at all. It gave her confidence on the court and made her feel like a tennis star. I would suggest ordering a replacement grip because after a week of use it was filthy and lost it's \"gripiness.\"",

He has no difficulty using it and he is actually better with backhand than forehand. Like my racquets, I added a tacky grip and cheap vibration dampener for better control. However, the rest of the racquet is perfect for his size and learning level.",

I also liked how the story is told from two different perspectives, one from a good character (Agatha) and one from an evil character (Sophie).
