      "text": "This rack has met or exceeded my expectations (especially at this price point). It is very sturdy and able to support my weight easily (220#) while doing pull-ups. The finish is nice and is holding up well- I've had it for several months. The Instal was straight forward, but did take 2.5 hrs. A helper is required. The only things that could be improved: the spacing of the holes is a little far making precise bar heights challenging. Also the pulley system for the curl bar is a little tight but not as others described - adds 5 to 10# of resistance max. Overall very pleased!",

So I did install it correctly and everything fell in place. Also saw a commmet about dip bar too small. I experienced it too. But later it was a mistake I had attached the handles other way round.",

Ideal would be pulleys that swivel. 3. Some components are poorly assembled. The screws keep falling off one of the components. Still a great purchase. Much less exoensive than similar machines.",

      "text": "Easily one of my worst purchase decisions. I have only had this for a couple of weeks, but regret it entirely. If you want to do a bench press, you are going to run into a very specific problem. The bar holders (no idea what the technical term is) stick out about 6.5 inches. So when you grab the bar, you have to bring it forward a bit. Lowering the bar is fine. But then pushing the bar back up often leads to you hitting the holders from the underside. And then when you go to place the bar back, you really notice that 6.5 inches. I would not recommend this for anyone doing bench.",
