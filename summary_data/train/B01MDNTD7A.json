The seller of the fog machine contacted me via email right after I posted my review and offered to replace it without requiring me to send the old machine back. I just received the replacement, one a Sunday, two days after they shipped it, and it works perfectly. Needless to say, I'm very impressed by the level of service provided and I'm a very happy camper.",

IF you are going to use it indoors then you need to push the button for a second of fog/smoke, any more and you'll create a problem indoors for your smoke alarms. Using it outside on a still day, I had people stop by and ask if the house was on fire. Great fog/smoke output. I seem to be the hit of the street this year! Great machine and glad I bought it.",
