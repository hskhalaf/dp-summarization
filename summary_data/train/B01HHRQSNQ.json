It is kind of clean but a bit masculine. It reminds me of the Bath & Body candles- mahogany teakwood or black tie. The scent doesn't linger for long after applied. It also does help to keep his beard under control also.",

I actually usually just trim my mustache because I don't care much for them, but thought I might give it a go. My mustache continues to just stick straight out. Maybe I need something tougher?
