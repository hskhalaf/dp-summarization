The handles are not round and not very large so someone with big mitts may not think they're so great. When I've used them to cut near the size limit of the tool its better to put the anvil side on the ground and push down with the blade. That keeps the pressure on the branch with no twisting. Even so the lopper might groan and squeal. If such a larger branch is still on the tree or bush its better to saw it off.",

I was really surprised and pleased how well this lopper cut through small saplings and brush. It made my yard work much easier, reducing the amount of time it took to clear about 3 acres. The item came quickly and was packaged well. If you're looking for a great tool I strongly recommend this item.",
