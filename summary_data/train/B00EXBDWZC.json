      "text": "I bought this little guy in June of 2015, and flew it mostly inside \"walking the dog\" and amusing the cat. On July 4th I took it outside at a friend's house and lost it over a fence. In trying to climb the fence I hit the throttle losing it forever to the either, or so I thought. This spring my friend had his 2nd story roof inspected and found my little hubsan. After a quick clean with a dry tooth brush the thing flys like new, even after a harsh rainy and icy winter. Well made. Five stars. #don't drink and drone. PS I spray painted the safety ring red and white to better orient myself.",

For the price you can\u2019t beat this mini quad copter, the camera on it is to be expected and is a pretty good quality. This is my third Hubsan H107c 1) lost in high altitude (120+ft) & high wind. 2) tree in my front yard in high wind. So I won\u2019t be flying this one in high wind! It\u2019s fun and powerful as many other reviewers have said, it sounds like a swarm of bees. Definitely recommend!",

Make sure you get a few propellers and extra batteries along with a multi charger to keep your flight time going.

The video recording on it was also FAR better than I expected, considering I didn't realize that it was the .3mp version. One warning, however, is that you should not fly this when there is much breeze at all, especially around trees, as he lost this one evening just before dark, over the trees near our home. The wind caught it a bit, and it got out of range quickly, then disappeared. We have not found it. I felt bad for him, so I bought a replacement, but got the 2mp version. Will review that separately and comment on video on that, too.",

I'm a horrible pilot. With that being said, I have beat this thing up and only had to replace the guard and some props. The \"legs\" have \"crumple zones\" that help minimize impacts so that is a nice feature for an amateur like me. The camera works well so far. The power button is a bit difficult for someone with size 11 fingers to push, but it is manageable. The time stamp on the video files always starts at 1/1/1980 12:00AM, but I'm not concerned with that.",

The expert mode really allows the advanced flyers show their skills doing flips and quick direction changes. I like how a prop guard is included into the packaging. The camera on it isn't that great unfortunately. The flashing indicator lights are a good feature allowing me to know when the battery is almost drained.",

He learned that the hard way, lost it in the woods within 24 hours but we ordered a new on that same day. You can purchase a crash kit separately and I do recommend it. Also a good idea to order extra batteries, it seems to only last about ten minutes on a full charge. Well worth the money!",

Great little machines but the smaller they are, the quicker they maneuver, and they don't have GPS stabilization like the DJI quads. Of course they don't cost as much either.

Then change it as you progressively become more used to the drone. Hope this review helps!",

The other problem I have is the propellers fly off a little too easy, but I guess that's better than breaking off.",

Flying it around with the camera on is also a lot of fun. I'd recommend another battery and the blade guards. Also buy more blades, they are very durable, but crashing is bound to happen. The unit itself is very durable, I've crashed it from many, many feet up and it always survives. I've had to take it apart a few times to put the plastic back together under the blades, but it snaps in pretty easily. Must buy for this price!!",

The first time I went outside, it shot up like 100 feet and onto my work's roof. I was able to still control it, but the wind took it again and it flew another 100 feet and crashed to the concrete parking lot. I got back in range and it still worked without a hitch. Great quality!! The concrete will split the rotors though, so be careful. But that was my own fault. Great buy!!",

The little drone is capable of surviving some serious crash landings, but the propellers are a bit more fragile than the body of the drone...Over all, this is a great starter drone, and being that it is so small, you don't have to worry about registering it!
