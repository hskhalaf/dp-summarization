The way that the carrying handle is mounted is the side is perpendicular to the way that most such handles are mounted, but it is still possible to carry it with the handle. I ordered it from Amazon Warehouse Deals, and it arrived with no problem or damage. It rolls very easily, and the handle deploys and retracts very easily. It fits in the overhead compartment of an airplane with no problem. The inside has 2 pockets for shoes, one visible in the pictures above and one on the other side. I highly recommend this suitcase.",

They haven't been abused by baggage handlers; they haven't made it onto an airplane yet. They were only used on 2 short road trips and, already, both have defective zippers. Samsonite refuses to honor the warranty because they were not purchased \"new.\" We were screwed twice - by Amazon for representing the suitcases as \"like new\" (they admittedly did look new) and by Samsonite for refusing to warrantee the defective zippers. We have purchased Samsonite luggage for many years but no more.",
