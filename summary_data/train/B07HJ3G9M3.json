Next I went to a golf ball sized dent in my tailgate. I ran out of time, but the dent is much less noticeable. Not bad for a first attempt. Overall a good kit for the money",

Used different attachments to see if they would work better, but needless to say they all work poorly. Followed the direction to the T, and before it could take any of the load to pull the dent out it would snap off of the glue.. Not pleased with the results.",

I'm not sure if there is a difference between the two types of glue, but so far, I only used the black glue sticks. A couple of the purple pads stretched or broke before their dent popped, but that is my only complaint. I have not used them all and still have most of them. I wish this came with better instructions or links to videos. It would be helpful. I am waiting for warmer conditions before I try to tackle any more dents.",

Use the alcohol to remove the wax or you will end up scratching your car. Read all of the instructions. I watched the video. Really useful information.

I was impressed with the packaging, everything was there, I would buy again, but hopefully I won't need too! Airstreams have a super soft skin, so take your time, test a unseen area, then go slow!
