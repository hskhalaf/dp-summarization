The product definitely improved the appareance of the table, it darkened the trouble spots and it made the wood shinier, but didn't completely cover the marks and scratches like I saw in some examples here. I guess I was hoping for a miracle. I still recommend it to fix minor issues, though.",

I finished it off with the recommended Feed N Wax, and now water just beads up instead of further damaging the wood.",

    "description": "Size Name:16 oz| Color:Golden OakIn 1969, Douglas G. Howard set out to solve this dilemma: how can you eliminate blemishes in wood finishes and restore the original color and luster without removing any of the existing finish? Unable to find an answer at his local hardware store, he went to work in his garage to create his own product. His goal was to make something that would be much more than a surface treatment, yet nothing like a stripper or a refinisher. The key was to develop a formula that could clean and polish the surface, penetrate the finish with stain, and leave the original finish intact. The end result was Restor-A-Finish, Doug Howard's first in what would become a complete line of wood care products. For over 40 years, Howard's Restor-A-Finish has been a standard in the antique industry. Because Restor-A-Finish preserves the original wood finish it also helps preserve its authenticity and value, whereas stripping the finish may literally strip the piece of its value. Almost any existing wood tone, from a Birdseye Maple to a Jacobean, can be closely matched using one of the nine available finish colors. Trying it on just about everything with a traditional wood finish, antique dealers, refinishers, and homemakers have found it to be a safer and easier alternative to stripping and refinishing.
