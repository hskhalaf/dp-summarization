One tiny quibble; the USB dongle supplied is a little wide and will use up two ports if you are using a USB hub where the ports are close together. Other than that, a great little scanner.",

This is a must have item for stock control and stores. Its plug and play, the offline barcode needs to be activated by scanning some barcodes in a plastic card provided.
