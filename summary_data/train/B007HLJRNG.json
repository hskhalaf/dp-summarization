When you store it, be sure to drain out the oil or keep rags under the blade because it will all drain out; also, pretty normal for a chainsaw.

Would have been nice if they had figured a way to put the electric motor at the user end of the pole, and run a shaft up through the pole to power the chain. That would have increased the cost and complexity of the saw. Other than that, this is a good product.",

It doesn't come with chain saw oil. Overall very satisfied.",

It has started to get dull and is a little hard to sharpen. It does leak oil if you don't store it correctly. With those few drawbacks.... this was a great purchase",

    "description": "When you need a little more reach, Remington has you covered. The Remington RM1025SPS Ranger 2-in-1 convertible pole saw/chainsaw has two adjustable aluminum poles that extend 10-feet to give you improved reach and stability while trimming. The instant-start, electric 8-amp motor powers through limbs quickly and the low-kickback 10-inch bar and chain give the machine more stability while lopping and pruning. When you\u2019ve finished using the tree trimmer to remove branches from above, flip and lock clamps allow you to immediately convert the pole saw to a chainsaw and begin cutting the downed limbs. The Ranger is equipped with anti-rotation pole design for stability and a non-slip grip for added comfort. Includes bar and chain oil. Please refer to operator\u2019s manual for guidance on use, maintenance, troubleshooting, and safety. Manufacturer\u2019s note: It is normal for bar and chain oil to seep from the unit when not in use. Please take this into consideration when storing the unit. Backed by a 2-year limited warranty.",
