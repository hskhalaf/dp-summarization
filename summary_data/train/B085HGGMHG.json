I opened the box regardless hoping the mattress would be fine. 5 days later it still has not taken shape fully. After contacting casper.com they confirmed the mattress was likely damaged but I would have to deal with Amazon. Shame on casper.com to allow old stock to be sold through Amazon.

All of Casper\u2019s sleep products are developed in-house by our award-winning research and development team.\n\nThe Casper Original Foam mattress is the perfect combination of support and cooling. Our ZonedSupportTM has three areas of targeted support for proper spinal alignment. Soft foam around the shoulders provide more relief to the upper body. Firmer foam under the hips, waist, and lower back help align your spine. AirScapeTM is present in the top layer of the mattress. The perforated breathable foam helps reduce heat. Tiny holes move hot air and body heat away, keeping you cool throughout the night. This premium foam is plush, yet resilient and conforms to your body to relieve pressure. The durable base foam prevents sinking and sagging and supports the whole body. The eco-friendly cover is made with recycled materials and easily zips off. It's designed to withstand years of use. The knit mattress covers have four way stretch, so you feel the full benefits of the below layers.\n\nStill unsure? Rest easy with our 100-night trial and free returns.",
