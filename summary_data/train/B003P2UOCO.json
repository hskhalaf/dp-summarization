The back panel of the bin itself has molded in drawer dividers you can cut out and put in the drawers to split multiple parts in each drawer. You can hang them on a wall or set them on a shelf or tabletop. These are well worth the money. Will buy again when needed.",

      "text": "I freaking love this thing. I bought them to organize/store my collection of D&D miniatures, and it's literally the best solution I've found. The individual drawers are very deep, so it's beneficial to buy the separately sold dividers (even the larger drawers). For example, I have a drawer for Dwarf minis, but also divide the drawer in half to separate the genders. Allowing this level of logical division makes it so much easier to find specific minis when needed. Furthermore, they fit perfectly on the shelves of my game closet perpendicularly, not parallel. So I have several of them in my closet side-by-side, like you would with books, making a perfect filing system.",

Somebody put these drawers in like this and thought they would be acceptable. Image comparison - Added a photo of the original drawers and 2 photos of the new ones that show some of the bad edges. Overall seems more cheaply made and I would not recommend this product going forward.",
