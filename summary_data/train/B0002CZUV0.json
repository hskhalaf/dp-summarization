And I find myself playing my Epiphone more often. I've played many electrics and I love the feel, Look and sound of this guitar. I put brand new super slinky nickel wound string on it right when I got it. Highly recommend it. Don't but a les Paul standard unless you have the money. I put cream white pick guard, new knobs, switch washer, hum bucker covers, and fret decals. It looks great.",

      "text": "When I got the guitar I noticed a rattling sound. The action looked okay, so I decided to troubleshoot it and see where the noise was coming from. Turns out that two of the tuning pegs were rattling because the screws weren't holding them firmly down onto the guitar. I tried tightening the screws but they just swiveled around and wouldn't tighten anymore. The actual holes in the guitar that the screws go into were stripped on those two pegs, and that's why the screws wouldn't stay tightened. I tried swapping around different screws since the other pegs were secure, but it wasn't the screws, it was the holes on the two faulty pegs.",

What I can tell you is that as a total novice to guitar playing, this LPSII feels great. The weight and feel of the neck just work and it almost feels natural to start playing. I only have about an hour of playing in so far due to soreness on my left fingers, but I look forward to learning to play and build up my guitar fingers.",

If you're looking to add a Gibson to your collection and don't want to spend $2000 on a Les Paul Standard, this is really a good way to go. I promise you won't be disappointed by this one here.",

I bought this to learn using Rocksmith on the PC. pros: 1) did not require any adjustments or setup (action, and in-notation was already ok from the manufacturer's package) 2) guitar looks and sounds awesome cons: 1) amp cord jack is on bottom of the guitar (which may limit where and how you can sit down)... you may need to buy a guitar stool to properly use this sitting down. 2) no others that I can think of I am really enjoying this guitar. I hope it was built to last. If it lasts... I may only buy Epiphone guitars in the future. \"\"",

I'll have to get a proper setup on it. Not ideal; I don't know how that passed inspection. Otherwise this is a great value for a starter guitar. Bought the Line 6 Spider IV amp and Rocksmith 2014 to help rock out to.",
