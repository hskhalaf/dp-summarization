This was a great purchase I wish I would have made years ago and saved time and muscles.",

In addition to gardening, I\u2019m using it to dig rocky terrain while metal detecting where it has shown itself to be quite tough. The length is perfect, too - acting as a walking stick while metal detecting. I looked at countless shovels in hardware stores prior to buying this one - they didn\u2019t even come close. I\u2019m 55, and I\u2019m sure this shovel will outlast me.",

I do most of my gardening on a stool ; I've used a regular short shovel for years but this one ..... far exceeds the performance of my old one. I had to plant a nandina in the vicinity of where a 15 ft. blue spruce had to be taken down and stump ground. I have heavy, clay soil with lots of rocks; this shovel cut through all the small remaining roots of the spruce and was able to extricate a medium size rock with no difficulty.

We live in New England, it has just turned April, and it was what she wanted for Christmas (who am I to judge). She hasn't tried it out yet but When she does, I will re-visit this review.",

    "title": "Spear Head Spade - Reinforced Fiberglass Gardening Shovel with Cushioned D Grip - Award Winning Shovel - Model SHFD3 Yellow",
    "description": "Color:Short Handle - Model SHFD3YELLOWAll Spear Head Spade blades are designed from the ground up to handle your most difficult digging situations while reducing effort by up to 80%. The blade profile is so special and effective , it has not one but 2 patents. It has the impressive ability to auto-seek the path of least resistance and then gradually ease, wedge, and cut through the most challenging of conditions. Spear Head Spade blades are made of carbon manganese steel that is 33% thicker and 25% harder than normal shovels. They are sharpened from tip to tail at a 35 degree angle to give them an effective and durable edge. They are powder coated with an epoxy resin for durability and ease of cleaning. Generous forward bent foot rests make digging more comfortable, prevent entanglement with roots, and enable the blade to hold more soil. All shovels are made with reinforced fiberglass handles. You will find that they are among the lightest and strongest shovels on the market. They are also highly weather resistant, low maintenance, and non-conductive. Please note - although the fiberglass handle is non-conductive, always contact \"Call Before You Dig\" before digging and be extra careful when working around electricity. The new and improved SHFD3 model has a larger and softer cushioned D grip, designed to make it easier and more comfortable when doing tough digging and also accommodates gloved hands. The grip also has UV inhibitors that allow it to withstand the harshest outdoor conditions.",
