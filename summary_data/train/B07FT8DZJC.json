I even put a towel underneath it in case it leaked a little bit but the amount of water that was surrounding the humidifier was not what I expected. I was hopeful about this product due to all of the good reviews but be aware of this before you buy. Needless to say I will be returning this product.",

There is obviously something defective in the manufacture of this humidifier if two in a row die for no reason. Even the little blue night light died. Very disappointed.

On top of that, it drenches any surface it is placed on. Clearly this is a flawed machine. This was purchased a couple months ago in preparation for my baby to arrive. When I first got it, I filled it, plugged it in and turned it on to make sure it worked, and because it did I set it aside thinking I was good to go. Now that I actually have to use it overnight, and it's not working as advertised, it's too late to return. I'm very disappointed.",

The water tank lasts for three days so I don't have to change it all that often. Also, the humidifier is pretty quiet so kids are not distracted from studying and sleeping. Cleaning is pretty easy since I don't have to remove and clean the filter. All I do is soak the base and the tank with vinegar for 7-10 minutes. I'm happy with the humidifier so I'm planning on buying another one for mine and my husband's bedroom.",

Other than that I have to refill the tank up every other day even though I keep it at the lowest it allows me to. I bought this specific one because of how big it is and thought I didn't have to refill it often. I do like I can turn the light off. So 2 stars off, one for having water on bottom and one on how much I refill it.",

It is 100% superior to a regular mist with the heavy drops. My preference is a warm mist because it holds more water in the vapor but the ultrasonic does a superior job to even the warm mist.",
