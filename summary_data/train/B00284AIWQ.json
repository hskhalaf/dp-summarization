They are dishwasher safe (although I hand-wash them) and they really have a nice balance and feel to them.",

Be warned, these glasses are not only beautiful and made of wonderful glass, they are bigger than most wine glasses the average wine drinker will encounter. We are a big fan of this, but others may not be. The size not only adds visual impact, but also gives the wine more space to breath. After nearly 60+ bottles of wine through a set of 6 glasses, not one chip or crack, let alone a broken glass. Overall, this is better than any Riedel glass I've ever drank wine out of.",
