We could compare because tried to buy similar item from another seller last year, but it arived in damaged condition twice!!! Because of very bad packing. This seller takes care about good packing and already makes first steps of assembly. So, thank you and five stars!!!",

FWIW, I am not a heavy person at less than 170 lbs. So you may want to consider a different product or some sand bags/weight bags to hold it down. It's a too big a pain in the butt for me to disassemble and return but I hope this helps others.",

Sturdy build, use it a lot, good foam wrap-around to cushion palms, though as with any pullup bar, you will probably develop calluses.
