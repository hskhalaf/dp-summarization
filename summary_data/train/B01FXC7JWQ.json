The only basic functions that I will still get are the live feed and the treat dispenser. Which arent the best video quality to begin with. But the person alert, barking alert, selfie alert, are now part of the premium package which they just announced they will be rolling out and charging Furbo customers for. I am returning my Furbo as I find it ridiculous to have to pay every month for the basic functions that the Furbo is supposed to offer.",

      "text": "I bought this device to keep an eye on my pups while away from home. First thing I noticed was the horrible video quality (720p). The minimum should be 1080p resolution for such device, but that was my fault for not reading the specs first. Second, was the tosser. It stopped launching treats after a short amount of time (not covered by warranty anymore) so no i'm stuck with a huge camera. I do NOT recommend this product- I suggest you purchase a regular 2 way camera with better video quality for a lot less.",

Even after unplugging from the power source and doing hard resets, the unit will only stay connected for less than a day and I have to the process all over again.

I can turn the wifi off and use mobile data and then it will work half of the time. The only fix is to be on mobile data and close all your apps and make sure it's not open in the background before opening it. This probably eliminates the bark notification from working if you constantly needing to make sure the app isn't running in the background.",

The video part still works fine, but the treat dispenser mechanism (which is really why you buy the thing) died in a little over a year. My wife then contacted support in March 2020, and got a replacement unit for about 60 dollars. It's since died, too. That second unit died back in May (it's now July) and furbo support hasn't responded to any of her requests. So ... If you want to spend over $100/year for this thing, go for it. But I'm looking for alternatives as the quality is subpar, and the support is seriously lacking.",

Only complaint is you cannot adjust the camera eye. In other words, her dogs are medium in size so she had to set it up on a TV stand to keep dogs from getting to it to eat all the treats out of it at one time. When it\u2019s up on a 4-5 foot stand, you can\u2019t aim the camera lens down. Instead you have to place a book or something under it so that the camera lens is pointing downward. Other than that, it\u2019s an awesome product!",
