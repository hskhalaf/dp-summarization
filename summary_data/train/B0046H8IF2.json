On two of the four paddles the glue started letting go after only 3-4 games. One additional paddle started letting go after another couple of days. Today is 12/29/15. This is completely unacceptable for a product of this caliber. These paddles are an easy 4.5 - 5 star product except for the Q/C issues. Maybe we got some old product ...maybe not. If not, they have not fixed the quality control issues that were identified by previous buyers.",
