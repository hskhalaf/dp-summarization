I strongly urge you to watch their video on lock installation if you have not installed a digital lock before. The front hole takes a brass rivet which is poked in with a plier, the back handle is secured with a threaded Allen rivet. I highly recommend this lock, all functions worked first time out the gate, and Amazon helped me fix the confusion on door handle.",
