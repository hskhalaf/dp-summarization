I have dropped my phone pretty badly quite a few times and the phone has remained in tact. The only issue is that the front plastic that protects the screen does get scratched easily. My keys were able to scratch it up bad enough just from being in the same pocket.",

Whenever I make phone calls no one can seem to hear me, and I have determined that it is not an issue about the strength of my reception. When I took the phone case off of my phone during phone calls, I could suddenly be heard by the people I had called. Also, the side buttons are hard to press, and the silent switch is hard to reach ... for some reason this case also interferes with the raise to wake function, which only works occasionally.",
