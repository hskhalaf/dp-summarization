It would be tough to install without someone(s) helping you get the slack out of the line, but that is to be expected. Trying to figure out how I can install a second one. Our house is the envy of the neighborhood. The first day, our kids (plus half the neighborhood) road it for about 5 hours straight, even in the rain. My kids run out and ride it in their PJ's first thing in the morning. You can make it as \"exciting\" or \"ordinary\" as you want based on height form the ground, angle, etc.",

I had to return other zipline kits because of conflicting weight limits. This is a solid setup - well built, easy to install, and importantly safe with the included brake kit. In addition, customer service was great in terms of customization of the product. My cable was 15 to 20 ft shorter than I needed between 2 trees. They shipped me a longer cable to meet my needs.

We also put it on a steeper hill than probably recommended, so we added 3' piece of 1\" pvc between the bottom tree and the spring for a little more cushion.

      "text": "What better yard activity could there be but a Zip-Line?! I had the line set up in about an hour, pretty simple, just follow the well written instruction booklet. Your tree cannot be much larger than 24\" around at the starting point though, the origination line will not be long enough, I used a thick branch (At least 16\"). Every thing feels like quality material and sturdy. My kids love it, and I find it a lot of fun too!",
