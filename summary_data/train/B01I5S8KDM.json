It comes with black removable padding and the drawers do come all the way out. You cannot flip it upside down due to how the drawers slide in the the small ridge intop to hold the top piece. The bigger drawers will come out and stop at a slant and my makeup does roll to the front, but I am okay with that. (Last picture)",

I\u2019ve had makeup storage problems for years as my collection has grown, and this organizer has solved most of them. The color is gorgeous and matches the color scheme of my vanity perfectly. The only thing I would possibly change is to make the drawers a bit deeper for larger makeup palettes, but that\u2019s a minor complaint and I\u2019m incredibly happy with the set. It\u2019s a bargain, especially considering how many smaller, lower-quality acrylic organizers are sold at even higher prices.",

The box is sturdy, well built and it holds just about everything. I wish it was a little bit bigger or that it had another drawer because I wasn't able to fit all of my lipsticks, but that's not a big deal. Overall I'm really Happy with this! And it was only $30!",

      "text": "I used this product to reorganize my explosion of makeup and replace the mishmash of containers I'd cobbled together. The size and quality is perfect, and my makeup takes up less than half the space it did before. I'm able to fit all my pallets of various sizes within the drawers. The divided container on the top would be improved if the sections were a bit deeper. I didn't like the way my brushes fell to the side, so I'm storing them in another holder. Overall, I'm satisfied with this purchase.",

It's really cute and holds everything well so that top cracking makes me sad because it will definitely have to be replaced now. It sits on my dresser and no one has touched it. Very minimal amount of items in it. Not sure why it broke on it's own. Some others have reported this issue so I think it may just be a manufacturing issue. But I do love this organizer.",

I had no where to put my makeup and everything was just unorganized and gross looking. It\u2019s sleek, cute, and really helped me get rid of the pile that was on my bedroom floor. My bedroom is space themed, purple and black, and this fit perfectly with the aesthetic too. 100% RECOMMEND (p.s. you can see that larger palettes (typical morphe sized ones) won\u2019t fit in here!! Also ignore my swatches on my hand i was decluttering as i was organizing!!)",

The individual holes up top are larger than your average concealer or mascara tubes, so they sit very loosely in there. I have a tin bucket from Target that I use in the large space up top to corral brushes and liquid eyeliner, with less frequently used liners behind it. I like that it fits in my window sill (I bought it to replace a smaller, similar organizer I'd had for years which was starting to crack).",

The drawer will fall out when you open it if the drawer above it is removed. Other than that it seems pretty perfect",

I think most women keep lipsticks with them, to reapply during the day. This space would be better used for taller vertical storage for makeup brushes, or open space like the left side. The drawers are deeper than some other models, which makes them more versatile. A great piece!",
