It is also important to make sure the frame is at the correct angles when anchoring it because the middle bar from where the swings hang, is two pieces. If the frame sides are too wide apart, the top, middle bar can buckle.",

There are some things to know though: the seats are designed for small children (probably under 10), it\u2019s a little wobbly and lifts off the ground slightly with 2 children swinging together (even with the stakes in the ground), and the swings are pretty close together so it\u2019s easy for kids to crash into each other if either begins to swing slightly crooked. That being said, it works great for what it is and our kids love having their very own swing set in the back yard!!",

      "text": "UPDATE: We changed our review from 3 stars to 5 stars. Customer service at Movement God contacted us quickly when they saw a bolt was missing in the original shipment. They sent a replacement bolt right away and have stayed in contact with us until we had the replacement in hand. Customer service is extremely important when doing business and we must say Movement God is outstanding. We would definitely buy from this company again. Thanks so much for standing behind your product. The swing went together easily and works great. It was missing one of the bolt and washer sets though. I'll have to go to Lowes to buy a replacement.",
