A large piece was stuck in her throat!!!!!! I was able to get it out but it scared the crap out of me. I will never ever recommend.",

Human grade nutrition, NOT made in China, Not smelly, easy to break in pieces, great for travel, and of course because he loves them! If you own a white dog who has food sensitivities and has a tendency to get tear stains, try this awesome dog treat from The Honest Kitchen. Watch my video, that is Oliver at the beach!",
