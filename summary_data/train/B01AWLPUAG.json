The music and sound effects of a movie do not cover over voice dialog. No more turning the volume up when someone is speaking and having to turn it down because the sound effects are to loud. 4. Auto shut off. Walk away and it will turn itself off after a period of no activity. What more do you need?",

Our favorite feature is the dialogue mode which really helps make spoken voices pop against other background sound. The one draw back is that there is no visual representation of sound level changes. Also, we do not have cable but stream using a Firestick and the universal remote does not work with that so we do still have two remotes.",

Con: Unless you want to keep two remotes around, you have to use the included universal remote. It takes four (!) buttons in a particular order to turn the cable, TV, and soundbar on. On the bright side, no one will ever be able to watch your TV without detailed instructions.",

No other fine tuning. \u2014The clear Voice is only slightly better than the normal mode and barely better than the bad TV speakers. \u2014The remote is Huge and only good if you\u2019re going to use it as a universal remote. In my opinion, this is not worth the $160 that I paid for it. I am not happy with it.",

It's engineered to help clearly reproduce everything from dialogue to details. And for even more clarity, its dialogue mode makes every word easier to hear. This soundbar is so versatile you can place it almost anywhere. And with Bluetooth connectivity, you can play your favorite wireless music through the speaker, too. The sleek design of your flat screen TV is beautiful to look at. Unfortunately, there's little room left for speakers. That's why dialogue and quiet passages can be so hard to hear. The Solo 5 TV sound system is an easy solution, with advanced technologies that deliver the clear audio your TV can't. And dialogue mode makes every word even easier to understand without having to adjust the volume from scene to scene. If distorted sound secure cable connections on the sound bar and TV or other connected sources. Troubleshoot if the sound bar is connected to a TV output labelled variable reduce the TV volume. If wall mounting the sound bar, adjust the audio If you remove the sound bar from the wall, repeat to return the sound bar to default audio settings. Unplug the power cord for at least one minute and reconnect. NOTE: Kindly refer the user manual before usage of the product and High efficient Bluetooth connectivity acquired at maximum distance of 30 feet and also troubleshooting can be found on page 30. The simplest way to connect the Bose Soundbar 500 is via the supplied HDMI cable to your TV. If your TV has an HDMI ARC or HDMI eARC connection, you should use that connection.
