Other fish that I have caught are Himara (wolf fish) and Arowana with this reel. Once had a bad snag that broke the rod and warped the frame. Called Okuma and they sent me a new frame for free including shipping. Because of the price I can afford to have multiple spools so I switch out line according to conditions or fly.",

The reel's got plenty of room for a WF-2F line and some backing (though backing probably isn't necessary on a 2 weight setup), and there is plenty of room. The adjustable drag system provides a good range of drag as well. I imagine this is a great reel in the larger sizes as well.",

Didn't have any major reel-burners on, so that may be the defining matter, but for some small Trevalley it worked awesome.

My favorite feature is the round dial for the drag, as compared to other reels who typically use a star or similar knob design (easier to adjust for me). My only opposition is the composition of the reel, but you get what you pay for. Being cast aluminum it is very light, and will not rust, but is also prone to breaking and bending as opposed to other more expensive reels.",

It gives me flexiblity and the ability to make a quick line change when I need it. Akuma SLV equipment is excellent. Akuma gear seldom shows up on Amazon as 'used' because it is very well built, durable, and easy on the wallet.",
