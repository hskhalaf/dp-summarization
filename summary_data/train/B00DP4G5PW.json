      "text": "We were excited to install our Ke\u0304vo. It worked great for about a month but now the fab has stopped working and unless the app is open which it sometimes won't do easily or at all- you can find yourself standing on the doorstep freezing or soaked trying to get the lock to open. I have had to wake up sleeping family members to come and let me in. The lock also randomly locks or unlocks if you happen to get too close with your phone while sitting on the couch or walking past the door. Not happy.",
