I was skeptical of how moisturizing an all-in-one product can be. Unfortunately, my instinct was right.

When I saw this shampoo, I thought I had found the answer. Unfortunately, it doesn't work as well as other \"regular\" dog shampoos. She starts smelling sooner and worse when using this product. I'm still looking for that shampoo that will enable me to go at least a few days longer between baths for my \"baby\".",
