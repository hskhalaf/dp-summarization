For the price you can't beat these, and the light is a nice bright white, not blue-ish. It really made our kitchen look better, and was super easy to install, just be prepared to have to add a little tape if needed. Also the included splices made it easy to run the 22ft section I needed. I used this power supply:  and this RF remote:  and its awesome. You can't beat under cabinet lighting for $22 and less than an hour of work. I will probably use these lights in my workshop to add some light",

Absolutely no chance of sticking to my glass display case shelves (which I have 24 shelves that multiple sets these lights are being mounting to) so I am now having to buy reliable 3M tape to get these lights to hold. The added price for the replacement tape now makes each strip light cost more then planned. $9 for the strip, $12 for the power supply and now $9 for 5 meters of 3M tape brings these to $30 per setup.",

The reason for only 3 stars is because the brightness is not even. LED's become dimmer towards end of the strip. There are 2v drop, 12v in the head and 10v in the tail. I then measured the resistance of the line. It's about 100ohm, which is way too high and that's the reason of uneven brightness. For that length, the resistance should not be measurable.",

Had to cut off a couple of feet at the end due to the length of the trailer but the cutting spots are clearly marked and easily cut. Much less expensive and better than what I could find at any local store. Highly recommend these lights to anyone looking for this type of lighting!",

The Yuji LEDs are so accurate you can hardly tell the difference between them and natural daylight from the window.
