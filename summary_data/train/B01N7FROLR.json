They look like they're for children, and they feel pretty lightweight too. We have an amazing bar, and needed something that looks \"stronger\" and more substantial. But since they are still great stools, we will keep them and use them for now, while I look for other bar stools. I will use these as a size reference.",

Before you screw the rest of the screw in the other 20%. These chairs are as comfortable as heck.",

Not to my surprise, it was easy as ever, however many of the bolts and tools provided were either missing or so cheap that they would not be able to tighten sufficiently to strengthen the chairs needed to stand. There was multiple bolts missing leaving one chair completely unassembled until they sent what was owed to me. Not the happiest",

Most often my experience with the bar stools of this height, I am afraid that i would topple backwards. Well designed and well built. Best part is it take only 10 screws to install.so far the easiet and sturdy install process. I strongly recomend these chairs.Hassle free packaging. I have to mention about some sand that came with packing probably due silica packets. No big deal.",

Would not be able to tell the difference. The stitching on the leather makes it look high end for an economy chair. Just enough cushion to be comfy but not squishy. The back has a nice slope for relaxing, supports lower back - does not go too high. A little restoration hardware look, without the price. I just got them, so no notes on how well they'll hold up - but I'm pretty pleased with the price and quality.",
