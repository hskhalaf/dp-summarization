This is one of the best pair of running shoes I have ever owned. You can actually feel the extra bounce they put in your step. The only reason I gave them four stars is because they are not very good for cross training but they are amazing for running!",

Also, I got them one half size larger for the perfect fit because unless they say wide fit, adidas tend to run small for anyone who doesn't have a narrow foot.",

I also have a women's version of this site and love mine as well. We even convinced a friend of ours to buy \"boost\" shoes for her boxing class and she loves hers too. We all highly recommend this product to anyone!",
