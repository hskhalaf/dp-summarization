This is because over time the fur on the inside of the boot wears down over time and the boot would slide off my heel a little and scrape the floor when I walked. That being said, buy the size you would typically buy, if it is snug that is good! Since I stayed true to my size these boots have lasted more than one cold season. Comfortable, cute, and go with any pant. Love, love, love them!",

The Care & Fit card that came with them stated, \"We recommend an initial tight fit in our suede/sheepskin footwear. Over time the suede will stretch slightly and the sheepskin will mold to your foot, making it the perfect fit.\" Initially, they were a tad snug but still very comfortable. Now after weeks of wearing them, they are perfect and sooooo warm! I will definitely purchase Bearpaws again!",

But I keep buying them because I know what I'm getting with them, it's a good product considering the price. I usually wear a size 9.5 but these loosen up a bit once you wear them in so I buy a half size down, that's just me though! Also, I suggest water proofing them! They'll look nice longer.",

The grey looks like a dark charcoal but what I received is a very light grey. Not an end of the world issue by any means and I'm definitely keeping them since they're so comfortable. Just be aware the pics of the colors may be a little off!!",

Its that time of year again and she's pulled them out! I'd gladly purchase another pair! Great price. Great product!",

I bought a 7 and they fit me perfectly. I do not personally plan to wear thick socks with these since they\u2019re already lined with fur, but I still could if I wanted, the fit would just be snug. If you plan to wear thick socks size up at least a half size. I have been contemplating Uggs for a few weeks but found these instead\u2014I am very happy I went with with Bearpaw and not Ugg, and only paid $39 as opposed to $159!",

My size is usually between 7.5 and 8. I ordered the boot in size 7.5 and they fit perfectly well. Just that since the fur lining is thick, to have a little more loose fit to wear thick socks (that I dont think youre gonna need them), I would recommend ordering at least half size more than your usual fit.",

Definitely wouldn't call them charcoal. Nevertheless, I'm keeping them for a comfy winter boot.",
