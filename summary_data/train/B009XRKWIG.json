It also cleans as well as the powder Tide my mother used when I was a child, possibly even better, and I'm 44 yrs of age now. This almost instantly became my favorite detergent just from the smell, but when I saw how well it cleaned, that clinched it for me. Definitely going to keep buying it, wherever I can find it for a reasonable price.",
