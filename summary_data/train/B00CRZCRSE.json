But after wearing it for a week or so, I don't even realize it's there. I get compliments everywhere I go and I can't ever stop looking at it. The price for this watch is so cheap for what it is. Be warned that you with need to have it as a tight fit, because when it slams against the top on your hand, it hurts. Overall. I recommend this watch to anyone looking for a huge, heavy, and flashy watch.",
