Also the backing camera won\u2019t always turn on. It seems the software freezes as I\u2019ll press buttons to try to wake the screen to see the rear view but it won\u2019t respond to input, just stays blank.

I would also offer 5 or 10-second preview as shortest instead of 30 seconds, USB cable instead of the hardwired charger and straight connector instead of the left angle so it goes directly toward headliner.
