I only have to charge it once a week. This is easily one of the best purchases I've ever made.",

It is quite possibly the best product I've ever purchased from amazon. 5 minutes with the product and you'll too see why this thing is incredible. The documentation is outstanding, every single thing you could possibly need to know about the scanner is laid out in detail, while still being a super simple read. Making the scanner work with any computer is as simple as plugging it in and scanning 3 codes. I'm going to be buying at least 4 more for my company.",

I do wish that there were a few more settings regarding beep volume and power options. A dedicated power switch would also be nice, to prevent it from turning on in a bag. Would I buy this again?
