The little things on the top of its head are nice because they can reach in the back of her mouth. She chews on the ears, legs, and really anything that she can fit in her mouth. I think she also likes it because it's a lot bigger than the other ones she has. (Also makes it easier to find. \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude09) The color is very vibrant, as well...

I've discovered that all of my babies' favorite teethers are hollow (which this one isn't). Simply put, you're much better off spending the money and paying up for Sophie the Giraffe.",

I love how he can easily hold it. It\u2019s very light and the contours are easy to hold. It\u2019s a quick clean up too. Whenever he drops it, I\u2019ll just wash with soap and water. The funny this is, this teether makes him sleepy while eating it.",
