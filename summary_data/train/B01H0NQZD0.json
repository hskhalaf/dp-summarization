      "text": "Tablet did come upgraded to Windows 10 as specified and worked fine for a while. I really only got to use it a couple times before it stopped holding a charge. It would be connected to the wall charger and show to be charging but would still drop in battery percentage even on standby. Then after that the tablet stopped charging at all. Requested a refund and was told I'm outside of the warranty period, of course. If it stayed working this would have been a great tablet.",

Be sure to register the tablet with whatever email you will NEVER change and are ok with being open all the time in Outlook.
