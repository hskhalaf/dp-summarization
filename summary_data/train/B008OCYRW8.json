Nothing is worse than trying to figure out the math for the lap split (before actually seeing it at the end of the lap) in the middle of a workout with other groups also practicing. The third line of the watch allows me to do this with a simple click of the watch in the middle of a workout. This is great and pretty hard to find!",
