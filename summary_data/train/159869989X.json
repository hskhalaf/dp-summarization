This book explains a lot of rules but gives you such a small amount of vocabulary and not even in an easy to remember format that it is almost useless. The first 2 chapters you basically just learn 'What is your name?\" and \"How are you?'\". Very disappointed and going to order a different book right now. :(",

The book also seems resistant and I haven't had any sheets rip from the book.

For a beginner, it would be great, as it highlights the similarities between English and German and makes the language more approachable. I have two other books by Ed Swick, German Grammar Drill and German Pronouns and Prepositions and think that all of his books are excellent.",

There may be more advanced texts available, but this is an excellent starting point.",
