The carrying bag isn't good for the drill bits or smaller components and the hammer is less than good quality, starting with the cheap and thin handle that's harder to grip. The tools inlcuded, in general, are much cheaper and lower quality. They all say \"China\" on them, which is typical, but the old set was far better quality. The only upside to this set is that it's a 20v, rather than a standard drill with a plug in charger and no removable battery.",

Also, the storage bag rips easily if you put all your tools in it which that's what you're supposed to do. I would recommend adding extra storage layers to protect the bag from sharp tools. As I said if this is your very first home tool kit go for it. If you already own other major power drill brands then look somewhere else.",

      "text": "WOW, WOW, WOW!!! What a wonderful assortment of basic tools as a bonus when all I really needed was to add the FABULOUS Black & Decker Lithium drill to my growing collection of other B&D Lithium tools. I LOVE the B&D batteries--they hold their charge, charge quickly, and don't tend to die on the third use like the other assorted tool batteries do. The drill itself is light duty, but that's all I'm asking of it. Thanks Black & Decker!! And special thanks to Amazon for this delightful assortment at a particularly reasonable price!",

It successfully built desks :D Update 2: Drill is good, we build more desks and we unscrewed a door to move a fridge in and then screwed the door back in",

My only issue is that the set came open-box when I purchase new. The packaging seal had been broken on the box and someone repackaged the tools. The instructions manual is all folded and there's a loose bag in the set. Doesn't seem like I'm missing anything and not worth the hassle of return. Contacted Amazon support and was able to get a small refund similar to the \"Used\" price. So i'll just live with it. If there are any issues, will return. May come back to update review if the tools are good.",

I usually end up having to use the pliers to get the screwdriver head out. A holder that spaces the pieces out a little farther would help a lot...or something. But the current design is difficult to use. The drill is great. Like the ratchet style turning mechanism on the screwdriver. Makes it easy to use in tighter or hard(er) to see places.",

If it was a hard case or opened wider or was sectioned, it would be perfect. The way it is made is dangerous. You can cut yourself if you are not careful as there are sharp things in there.",
