      "verdict": "PRO-Keds Royal Plus Suede flaunts an authentic vintage glory, from its rubber toe cap, pronounced midsole, to the two distinctive stripe details on its white sole. The luxurious suede cover, premium leather accent on the heel, and breathable textile lining create a sense of refinement to this rather straightforward and basic sneaker. One core element of this Royal Plus remake that causes it to be desirable is its contoured and cushioned footbed. Its toe box tends to be roomy that sizing down helps even out the minor flaw.",

        "The PRO-Keds Royal Plus comes with a reasonable price tag",
        "Many mentioned that its exceptional comfort is incontestable",

        "This sneaker allows the feet to rest on a cushioned interior for long hours in a day",
        "Some emphasized that the rubber toe cap in the front adds protection in that region",
        "The removable footbed is incredibly squishy, pointed out by in a couple of reviews",
        "Some wearers said the sticky rubber outsole keeps the feet stable",
        "According to several owners they liked the feel of the padded collar and soft fabric lining on their skin",
