Contacted New Balance twice, expecting them to honor the waterproof guarantee. Unfortunately, no such luck. They told me on both occasions that I should return the product to the retailer. Obviously, they won't stand by the guarantee, and of course Amazon won't do anything after 30 days. I've flagged the listing as fraudulent and hopefully people will avoid buying these shoes.",
