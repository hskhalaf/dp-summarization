Two of the wheels have a manual \"brake\" on them to prevent you from rolling around which is a great feature but one of these brakes automatically will flip which stops me in my course of rolling which is inconvenient. If they could perfect the brake wheels I would give it 5 stars.",

I have only used for a week but can already tell a difference. It makes it very easy to sit up straight, and I would definitely recommend to anyone with neck/upper shoulder or lower back pain.

Now after sitting for long periods of time on the balance ball I am no longer stiff when when I stand up. I\u2019ve also heard I\u2019m burning 3x the calories than I used to. Additionally, recently being pregnant this is a great option for mom\u2019s who sit all day, sitting on a ball is good for strengthening your core which is necessary for birth and helps baby to stay/move into the correct position for delivery. Best purchase I\u2019ve made in a long time.",

As for the negative reviews about the ball not being big enough, I don't know what you're talking about. Maybe you missed parts of the directions. In general, well worth the purchase.",
