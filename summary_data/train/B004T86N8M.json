    "description": "Style:5-Micron Bag Filter KitWe see a future built on great brands, great products and great people. In every facet of our business we leverage the strengths of our global infrastructure to maximize the benefits of all three.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nJET\u2019s DC-1100VX-5M dust collector features Vortex Cone technology, which improves chip separation to prevent clogging of the filter and increases packing efficiency of the collector bag. With a collection capacity of 5.3 cubic feet and a 1.5-horsepower motor, the DC-1100VX-5M provides a combination of size, accessibility, and power that makes it both productive and easy to use.\n\n\n\nDC-1100VX-5M\nDust Collector\nAt a Glance: * Eliminates rapid performance drop due to premature filter clogging \n * Captures 98% of 5-micron particles and 74% of 1-micron particles\n * Dual 4-inch dust port allows for simultaneous connection of two machines\n * Sound rating of 70 to 80 decibels\n\n\n\n\nJET\u2019s DC-1100VX-5M dust collector offers superior particle collection thanks to its exclusive Vortex Cone technology. View largerConvenience and Common Sense\nMany of the design features of the DC-1100VX-5M allow for straightforward and expedient use. The totally enclosed, fan-cooled, 1.5-horsepower motor is rated for continuous duty with plentiful horsepower for efficient air movement, while the precision-balanced, all-steel impeller maximizes air intake. The see-through dust bag helps prevent premature bag change-outs, and the sewn-in snap ring makes for rapid insertion and removal. Plus, four heavy-duty casters make for easy mobility around the workshop.\nBenefits Behind the Technology\nFirst and foremost, the Vortex Cone technology eliminates filter clogging, which in turn improves ease of use, strengthens performance quality, and extends the lifespan of the machine. It dramatically advances chip-separation efficiency in single-stage dust collectors, and it aids quick fallout of chips into the collector bag. Fewer bag changes are required because of the reduction in violent airflows that increases packing effectiveness.\n\nWhat's in the Box\nOne JET DC-1100VX-5M dust collector, 1.5HP 1PH 115/230-volt, 5-micron bag filter kit.\n\n\n\nJET\u2019s Vortex Cone technology makes a visible difference to chip separation and filter efficiency. (Click each to enlarge)\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe Jet DC-1100VX-5M features the exclusive Vortex Cone, which improves chip separation to prevent clogging of the filter, and increases packing efficiency of the collector bag. The filter bag captures up to 98 percent of 5-micron particles. The high air velocity (CFM) stands up to any competitive specifications, and the industrial controls are designed for years of durable use. Collection bags have a snap ring for fast installation and removal. Casters offer maneuverability within the shop.\n\nSee more",
