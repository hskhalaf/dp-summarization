All the food items that he has cooked in this cooker have been cooked to perfection and with the best flavor imagined. Everyone who has eaten food from this smoker can't believe the flavor, and texture. Of course he experiments with flavors and different smoke flavor, but there hasn't been one meat item we haven't liked. He is getting so much use out of this smoker. I am glad I purchased it for him. A great Christmas gift for anyone who loves good food.",

I do recommend monitoring the temperature with another thermometer (seems to be a common issue with all smoker thermometers). The unit was very easy to assemble and it is easy to use for a beginner. You can get up to 4 full racks in the smoker if you can maneuver them properly. Overall I would definitely recommend it so far.",

Racks can be removed easily for ribs. It can fit a lot of meat on despite it's slender appearance.",

Haven\u2019t used yet but somebody is slipping on wuality control and inspections! Ordered in plenty of time with 2 day shipping so I could smoke a turkey for thanksgiving. Guess I will be using my oven. Was told that it would be 7-10 fays before the ignitor wire gets here! Very disappointed! If it had not been so hard to assemble I would send it back!!!",

Returning and won't be reordering.",
