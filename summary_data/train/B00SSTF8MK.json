The bag is nice quality and was a good choice. It is not a hard case, soft and pliable. It was described perfectly. It has great little pockets to put accessories of any kind. I would recommend this to anyone.",

My bag holds about 10 brushes of varying sizes/uses, moisturizer bottle, two types of powder, several types on concealer, blush, highlighter, brush cleanser bottle, a couple of large eyeshadow palettes, mascara... and more.

The open flap contains the brush slot holders, which are too big for the brushes that I have. There are two small flimsy compartments inside of the cosmetic bag, they are not sturdy and have started tearing. Lot's of storage inside the bag.",
