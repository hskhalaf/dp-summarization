I will second his comment about a few menus that might be better designed. One thing I couldn't find was a way to shut off the audible \"Call from X\", but somehow it went away, thankfully. The only other thing I'd add is that once or twice I did miss video capability. Alas. It does take an ok photo, however. Combined with a change of carrier it gives very reliable service and very good coverage.",

So I went shopping for Verizon prepaid deals & this showed up. Dynamite phone, price & prepaid no-contract data plans [for me]. I pay $2 for unlimited use only on the days I use it. I got a feeling the phone's gonna sell out fast at this price. I don't think I'll ever use anything other than LG or Verizon again unless iphones become essential.",
