I was worried about the smell I read in previous comments but to be honest I didn\u2019t get anything like described in other reviews. I maybe got a faint smell of plastic but I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s from the heavy duty plastic bag it comes in.",

Sadly the reviews are definitely spot on, this would probably be best with a foam pad. My dog thinks it's the best thing ever though.
