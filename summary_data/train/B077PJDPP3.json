I've used this awesome round one several times in my 12 inch cast iron skillet and it works perfectly. It only takes about 6 minutes to cook thick slice bacon and if you like your bacon crispy, using this press will make very crispy bacon. It is a cinch to clean up. I honestly have not washed it even once. I treat it like I do my skillet and just wipe it clean with a paper towel. I can't wait to try it on some pesky pork chops.",

Fried bacon now takes about as long as frying an egg and making toast...5 minutes. I wipe the press with a paper towel or cloth, keep it seasoned and store it right in the iron pan. I will use it for burgers and cutlets later on, but it's performance with bacon is worth it for me.",

For just 2 pieces of meat for the SO and me, the grill press covers it enough to act as a splatter shield to a good extent. And the weight helps flatten the meat and prevent curling so I get a pretty good even sear. If I had one complaint, it's just that it's one more (heavy) thing to find a place to store when not in use. :-)",

As long as the press sits flat and is within 1/2\" of the skillet's edge, will work fine. Con: 1) Grooves, which are used to drain grease, are a bit difficult to clean (however, this should be expected) 2) Odd shape makes storage a bit difficult (this is a just a whine, but something to consider)",

      "text": "I bought this product because I was tired of my bacon constantly curling up. It does exactly what it's supposed to do. Only downfall was my own fault. My plan of choice for cooking bacon didn't have a large enough base for the press to sit in. I didn't think this through when I bought it so my only suggestion is make sure it will fit all the way to the bottom of your pan. I just changed plans and I love how it works. I usually sit it in the pan to get it a little hot first and it cooks the bacon super fast.",
