You can download the software offline but I wish it was a little more complex but then again you can just use other software. Very user friendly and easy to operate, it provides great prints. Great for beginners or recreational hobbiest. Only downside is the filament is tagged so you must use their filament instead of any brand, but that's a small price to pay. Especially since the printer to so cheap. Good buy.",

The best advice I can give you for getting started with this unit is to clean the extruder after each print. This doesn't take a lot of time to do and it really helps insure a good consistent print.

The instruction manual was cheaply produced and tossed together in a hodgepodge manner. I spent 6 hours trying to get a usable scan and had zero success. The printer was slightly better but still produced a mess of a print. Makes me think it's better to buy a scanner separately. I'm definitely returning this device.",
