Also the attachments are cheap and thin. The storage for the cord is hard to use. I really despise using it!

It's a fantastic mixer that really holds up. I've used it in place of a stand mixer several times as well, and it always performs admirably. Whenever this one dies, I'm buying another. My mother coveted mine so much I gave her one for her birthday and she was delighted. I would love a spatula attachment to be able to use it more like a stand mixer, but that's a very minor thing.",

It could cause some unintended messes if you're not careful. Beyond that, I would definitely recommend this product to anyone in the market for a hand mixer.",

To control the speed it is digital so you gradually go higher, but if you need to shut it off immediately it has an easy on and off button. Best feature so far.

Not sure what that means since I just got the mixer, but if it is anything like my previous Cuisinart hand mixer, I'll be more than happy. UPDATE: July 2014. Excellent mixer, no issues at all!!!!

Previous reviews are right, it can be tedious trying to get the cord in to snap on the lid and the lowest setting does move faster than I'd like. You have to be careful to avoid dry ingredients flying out of the bowl on the first setting. It can be done if you finesse it but if the blades spinned slower on the first setting you wouldn't need to be careful. Apart from that it's been fabulous.",
