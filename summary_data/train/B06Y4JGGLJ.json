I get whiffs of the smell walking past it. I am very pleased with that! However, I had it burning for ultimately 5-10mins and it went out. Perhaps the wick wasn't the best but now I can't use it without the flame going out in only a few minutes. For the price this shouldn't be happening. I really want to love this candle but I can't use it.",

The only thing I don\u2019t like is that it burns VERY quickly, so it doesn\u2019t last long at all. We received this just last week and there\u2019s about an inch of wax left. (They recommend not burning past a 1/2 inch.) I\u2019m not overly price sensitive, but $14 for a 6oz candle in no frills packaging that\u2019s nearly gone after a week of use is a terrible value. I like it, but it won\u2019t be a long term solution.",
