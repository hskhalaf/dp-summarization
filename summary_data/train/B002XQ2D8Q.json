      "text": "At first the kit is shiny, new and gorgeous. Tools are perfect, no problem with them. My problem is the case. It's is mostly made of cardboard, so if stored in a humid environment, like a shed or garage during hummind summer days, IT WILL GROW MOLD. I used it a few times and it was fine. But after a very hummind, rainy 2 week period, opened the case to find lots of fuzzy mold. My suggestion is to store in the house away from moisture or pull out the black tool storage liners (2), pull the cardboard backing off and put in a new case. Other than the tool storage case issue, the tools are perfection.",

The tongs are very flimsy and immediately bend when you try to close them to pick up whatever it is you are using it to pick up. The only \u201ctools\u201d in this grill kit that I found useful were the corn cob holders and the basting brush. The spatula is alright with me but im not a fan of the serration on the side of it, but the bottle opener was a great idea just weird placement.",

Either way throw the case out as soon as you get it, or if you can just buy the spatula and tongs separately.
