The 980M has been excellent for video acceleration. I have done any gaming on it so I can not comment on that. The DVD/Bluray drive is too sensitive with the button. a light touch will open it. It gets opened almost every-time I sit the computer down. I'd like ASUS to make a firmware update for the drive and then a companion software to run on the computer that could disable the hardware button and just eject on the computer. I don't see that happening though.",

The power connector is a tad loose and can fall out more easily than it should. It could have benefited from a touch screen since Windows 8.1 is difficult to use without one.
