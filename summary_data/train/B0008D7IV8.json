Now the lavender scent separates from the polish and makes a sticky gooey mess. I have to squeeze out half the product just to get some good polish without scent smearing all over. I've tried to contact the company three times without response. If you can find it without scent, you should order some. With lavender scent, save your money.",

A perfect reason for Amazon's existence, as this polish disappeared from my Ace Hardware and Fred Meyer stores since I last bought it.",
