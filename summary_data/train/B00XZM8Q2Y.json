Professional grooming can be expensive, so I had a hot water option added to my outdoor hose connection so I could bathe them, myself, with warm water, when the weather is appropriate for outside bathing. The trick was finding a tub / pool, sturdy and suitable for them and me. One of them loves bath time, and gets pretty rowdy with the tub. Not only does it stand up to his shenanigans (I'd post a video of him roughing the tub up, if Amazon supported videos, but I'll post a pic), it drains easily, and folds nearly flat when not in use. I highly recommend this product!",
