I would have been happy to have an included memory card, and the battery does not seem to be taking a charge, but these are incidentals and I do not recall the ad saying it came with a memory card. Over all I am very happy for the price I paid, this camera looks and performs from some initial tests as new. Very satisfied.",

Yes, I agree with others, the lag time is somewhat daunting, but for most applications it is acceptable. The overall excellence in picture quality alone, especially with regard to clarity and exacting color, should thoroughly delight most discriminating photographers. The camera is extremely sensitive to very subtle light sources and automatically adjusts to accept poorly illuminated environments. It is hard to believe that anyone would not be happy with this camera.",

    "title": "Nikon Coolpix P5100 12.1MP Digital Camera with 3.5x Optical Vibration Reduction Zoom",
    "description": "Camera, coolpix p5100, black, 12.1m\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nThe Nikon Coolpix P5100 is the new flagship model in the Nikon Coolpix lineup, designed to satisfy photography enthusiasts. Built on a custom application of Nikon's innovative EXPEED digital image processing concept and incorporating the precision optics of a Nikkor lens, the Coolpix P5100 is built to realize optimum performance and maximum image quality.\n\nClass-leading imaging ability begins with a full 12.1 effective megapixels of sharp resolution and a new digital image processing engine that reproduce the finest details and subtlest tones with precision and clarity, even when taking advantage of sensitivity settings as high as ISO 3200. (ISO 3200 is available only for image sizes of 5 megapixels [2592 x 1944] or smaller.) It also includes the compositional freedom of the 3.5x Zoom-Nikkor lens and compatibility with various converter lenses that further extend wide-angle and telephoto reach.\n\nIn addition to a variety of automated and scene modes, four advanced exposure modes offer both enthusiasts and more advanced photographers greater personal control over the camera. The Mode dial provides easy access to these modes, reflecting the Coolpix P5100's logical design that works to simplify and streamline operation for the photographer.\n\nOptical lens shift VR (Vibration Reduction) image stabilization counteracts the effects of camera shake in lower light or when shooting unsteady subjects to help achieve sharper results. Active full time, it also stabilizes images displayed on the 2.5-inch high-resolution LCD monitor with wide 170-degree viewing angle for easier framing and more reassured shooting.\n\nThe quality-crafted body is made of solid magnesium alloy (Mg), featuring a quality finish, a comfortable grip covered in grid-pattern rubber, as well as an optical viewfinder to aid composition, particularly in brightly lit conditions. The built-in accessory shoe adds support for Nikon Speedlights and advanced i-TTL flash control.\n\nNikon Coolpix P5100 Feature Highlights\n\nSuperb image quality\nExcellent imaging quality is a priority for the Coolpix P5100, from the 12.1 effective megapixels of imaging power produced by its 1/1.72-inch RGB CCD and new digital image processing engine, to its powerful 3.5x Zoom-Nikkor lens and optical lens shift VR.\n\nShooting modes that give the user greater control\nFour exposure modes accessed via the Mode dial provide greater control over camera operation. Programmed Auto [P] mode automatically selects the optimal shutter and aperture settings. Shutter-priority Auto [S] lets the user select shutter speed, while the camera sets the optimal aperture. Aperture-priority Auto [A] offers 10-step manual control over the aperture setting to let the user decide depth of field, while the camera automatically adjusts the shutter speed. Manual [M] exposure mode provides full control over both the aperture and shutter speed settings.\n\nProven lens shift VR image stabilization\nOptical lens shift VR (Vibration Reduction) is field-proven technology originally developed for interchangeable lenses used in Nikon SLR camera systems. The VR technology provides the ability to shoot at shutter speeds as much as three stops slower without blurring the image, as well as producing a smoother viewfinder image which aids composition. Nikon's exclusive VR system also yields sharper results when shooting in low light when using the 3.5x Zoom-Nikkor lens, or when reaching farther with an optional telephoto converter lens.\n\nISO 3200 capability\nExtended light sensitivity range up to ISO 3200 adds the power to shoot more effectively in lower lighting conditions or to capture fast moving subjects with outstanding clarity. And the new image processing engine produces clear results, even when shooting with high ISO settings.\n\nThe convenience of system expandability\nOptional system components further expand the photographic possibilities of the Coolpix P5100. Nikon's 0.67x wide-angle converter (WC-E67) and 3.0x tele-converter (TC-E3ED) lenses are available to extend the range of the attached 3.5x Zoom-Nikkor lens, while a built-in accessory shoe supports the use of Nikon's advanced i-TTL flash control for external flashes, including the Speedlight SB-400, SB-600, and SB-800. These accessories are not included and must be purchased separately.\n\nOther features\n * Three unique Nikon image innovations: Face-priority AF with improved speed and efficiency, In-Camera Red-Eye Fix, D-Lighting \n * Optimize image for shooting monochrome photographs using a choice of 4 different filters for creative effects, (yellow, orange, red, and green) \n * Continuous flash shooting helps capture the action by allowing a burst of consecutive flash shots without having to wait for the flash to recharge \n * 1:1 size format allows photos to be shot using 1:1 (square) perspective \n * Distortion control corrects for barrel distortion in images shot and even displays the corrected image on the LCD in real time \n * Macro shooting from as close as 4 centimeters (1.6 inches) \n * 4x digital zoom extends compositional freedom \n * Improved menu interface, available in a choice of 23 languages \n * Time zone function for easy setting of multiple locations \n * SDHC card compatibility \n * Approximately 52MB of internal memory \n * PictBridge support\n\nWhat's in the box\nNikon Coolpix P5100 digital camera, UC-E6 USB cable, EG-CP14 audio-video cable, EN-EL5 rechargeable li-ion battery, MH-61 battery charger, AN-CP16 strap, Software Suite CD-ROM",
