They feel substantial and seem well constructed. I've had none of the problems mentioned in other reviews here at Amazon: lids fit well, no discoloration even after washing in the dishwasher. I also like the pasta basket, which I hadn't used before. I am following the manufacturer's advice and not using excessively high heat (my range is gas) to avoid damaging the pans. I plan to update this review if I encounter any unexpected problems in the future. Update: 3 years in and still no problems. Highly recommended.",

After a lot of research and reading reviews, we settled on the Duxtop SSIB-17 Professional 17 Pieces Stainless Steel Induction Cookware Set. I had never heard of this brand before, but took the chance due to the positive reviews. Our experience is that the cookware is a bargain compared to some of the other name brands out there. The pieces are beautifully crafted, heavy duty and cook nicely. We looked at the Wolf cookware to match our cooktop, but was really put off by the price. I believe we made the right choice by choosing Duxtop.",

The saute\u0301 pans are less noise and almost tolerable. All induction ranges make noise, but this is awful and most likely produced by the irregular surface on the bottom. My smooth bottom. cookware, including cast iron does just fine. Worst of all, I find out when I tried to return it that this item cannot be returned. Grrrrrrrrrr!",

I do get some spotting on the pans - not sure if it is the pan or how I am cleaning. I would recommend!",

The bottoms are smooth so they don't scratch my ceramic stovetop. Even though they are not non-stick, I have not had any problems with sticking or food cooking onto the pans. I would highly recommend this cookware to anyone looking for quality cookware. I expect it to last a long time.",

They have an induction cooktop that they were having troubles with cookware sitting properly and operating on it. This set operates perfectly, looks beautiful, cleans up perfectly. I did buy the bar top cleaner for them but I think hot soapy water works at clean up most of the time. There is a little bit of a learning curve for cooking with stainless steel but it's better for your health to cook most food at lower temperatures anyway.",
