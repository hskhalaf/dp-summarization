The previous one I used had a small \u2018tank\u2019 that had to be removed and filled. When that tank got dirty, it required more effort to clean. I can just replace the plastic bottle on this one.",

    "title": "Sense Magic Humidifier with Water-Bottle Tank Adapter, 360 Degree Rotating Mist Spout, Easy Dial to Control Mist, Easy Breakdown for Easy Clean-Up, Helps with Dry Skin and Dry Nose (Blue)",
    "description": "Sense Magic Humidifier uses adaptors that fit most water bottles as its water tank and produces a superfine mist, increasing the humidity to any room. Easy to use control knob allows you to adjust the humidity levels. Mist spout rotates 360 degrees, which allows the humidifier to aim in any direction. This model is easy to disassemble, allowing for a significantly easier time to clean and wash the humidifier, water bottle adaptor, or the mist spout. A humidifier reduces the risk of infection from air-born viruses and bacteria, which are known to travel less freely in moist air. Moisture is drained from your skin in a dry atmosphere, often leaving it dry and irritable. A humidifier can bring moisture back into the air, leaving a more vibrant skin. Dry air can cause a dry nasal passage. Sleeping with a humidifier can help relieve the sinus. A humidifier is not just meant for the people living in a household. They can also help house plants flourish. Please use Tap Water or non-purified water. CARE INSTRUCTIONS: To ensure proper use and maintenance, please keep the water tank of your unit clean from debris, dust, and mineral build-up. If there is mineral scaling, wash your unit with a mild detergent as soon as possible before hardening. Do not use harsh cleansers or abrasives as this can easily damage the misting mechanism.",

      "Sense Magic Humidifier uses adapters that fit most water bottles. There is no need to wash out a tank if dust or debris get into the water. Simply throw out the bottle and replace it with a clean one. Replacing the water is also very simple. You just take off the bottle cap of the water bottle and screw on the mouth of the adapter and place it into the reservoir opening. A spring pressure cap prevents the water from gushing out when inverted. PLEASE USE CORRECT CAP OR IT WILL LEAK.",
      "Sense Magic Humidifier uses a rotatable mist spout that can be pointed 360 degrees. It is easily detachable for easy maintenance if something is spilled on it. The humidifier uses ultra-sonic pulse technology that creates super fine mist increasing the humidity in any room. THIS UNIT DOES NOT CREATE STEAM. The omnidirectional mist spout allows you to aim it in any direction.",
      "Sense Magic Humidifier reduces air-born viruses and bacteria by increasing the humidity in the air. A healthy choice for those suffering from asthma, dry skin, sinus issues, sinus infections.",
      "Sense Magic Humidifier does not use filters. You DO NOT have to buy EXTRA FILTERS. If the \"tank\" (water bottle) gets dirty, you can just dispose of it and use a water bottle you already have available in your home. Low mineral Tap Water is recommended for use. DO NOT use pure distilled water or the electric charge will not pass as easily through the water. NO EXTRA PURCHASES REQUIRED to operate this unit.",
      "Sense Magic Humidifier is easily disassembled to help facilitate easier, faster cleaning if required. All the parts slide in and out of their positions so that unscrewing or unlocking components is not necessary. Please review the care instructions in your Operation Instructions for further details."
