Very disappointed. I work hard for my money and this was an investment to help increase revenue, and sadly it turned out to be a loss.",

Have my own camera stand by Manfrotto (which is excellent!) but I'm sure the stand that comes with it would work just fine too for indoors! Only additional recommendation is that I did buy the five extra large backdrop clamps to hold up backdrop, as the ones that come with the kit are a bit smaller... Highly recommend this set!!

Really helps the light to diffuse evenly if you make the backdrop as uniform (flat) as possible. Consider dropping a connector from the cross bar, which leaves it more like 8' wide. This makes it a little easier to bungee and use drape clip to stretch the 6' wide muslin to the vertical supports. Or later you could invest in a 10' wide muslin cloth, and use the one that comes with this kit for covering stools are whatever.",

The backdrops are thin ..so expect that. They may be washable, which is a plus.",

I do wish the screens were a little wider as well, considering how wide the base is capable of being, but it fits my current uses perfectly for now (Not using it for large scenes or large group pictures, which would require a wider screen in my opinion)",
