It's too late to return this, but I can't advise anyone buying a bocce set that can't handle ball-ball contact. That's half the game! I expect something sold by Amazon to have a better return policy, and would change this review if they would replace the set [or at least the broken ball].",

After reading other reviewers' complaints about the bag falling apart, I noticed when it arrived that a problem is the bag has no structure: the balls don't and can't stack neatly as in the product pictures, but collapse down and pull out the sides. I'm guessing that puts stress on the seams. Realizing this, I saved the inner box that the balls came in inside the bag, tore off the top flaps, and am using the box as an insert. That provides structure and keeps the balls upright. We will see if that makes the bag last. It certainly makes the set easier to carry around.",

The only reason I can't give it five stars is that, at least for me, it's really hard to get the balls back into the carrying case, since it's flimsy nylon. That said, there is an easy solution: when you get the product, you will open the carrying and see the balls in a box. I recommend just cutting off the top panels off the box and simply leave it in there, as it will give the carrying case the rigidity needed to easily remove/replace the balls.",

I would recommend cutting the flaps of the cardboard box inside the carrying case and use it to house the set, as the carrying case is a little flimsy and the balls would shift around a lot while carrying it around without the cardboard box reinforcement inside. Looking forward to playing at my HS reunion!",

His first comment was \"these are smaller than the balls I remember playing with.\" I don't know how big they are supposed to be, and we didn't measure them. Anyway, we have really enjoyed playing with these! These are heavy for throwing but not too heavy, I think they are perfectly sized and weighted. We play with our adult friends and our friends with kids. The kids can throw the balls too. The balls get scuffed up easily but it doesn't affect the gameplay- just appearance. Also the bag is terrible- leave the cardboard box in the bag for extra support.",
