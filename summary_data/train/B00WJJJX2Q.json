Product has a 1-year warranty so I thought I'd contact customer service. No response after their website promised 48-hour turnaround on inquiries. Product is sturdy and works fine otherwise but maybe the seller should change it to a 3 month warranty if they're not going to honor their 1 year warranty. Update: Customer service never responded. I applied skateboard grip tape on it to replace the grippy surface. Works well with that intervention but otherwise don't count on it lasting more than a few months with daily use.",

This is sturdy and challenging, and is an excellent addition to my daily exercise routine and I have found that it not only improves my balance, it also tones my core.

My core is strong, but something has been missing. After a couple weeks of short 5-10minutes of just trying to stay balanced, everything suddenly clicked yesterday, and I balanced for about 20 min.

      "text": "Absolutely love this piece of equipment. Who knew something so simple could make you feel this amazing! I feel that standing on this while using my stand up desk allows my feet, legs, knees, and back to feel at ease. I am now standing up about 45mins more than I normally would. Did you know balancing on this board alone is still considered exercise, I'm sure you wont lose a hundred pounds in a month but it does shed a few calories.",

I would definitely recommend it!",
