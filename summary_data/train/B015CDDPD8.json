      "text": "Very easy to use NAS. Have not had a QNAP before but I have been very impressed with the functionality of this unit. Lots of applications in the store to boost its function - especially handy is the Linux and Virtualisation station options. Plug in a wireless keyboard, plug in an HDMI cable, fire up Linux station and you have Ubuntu 18 running directly from the NAS. Had tried a few Windows VM's but the H/W is a little lacking to get any nice performance out of it. Would recommend going for as much RAM as you can - I upgraded from 2GB to 8GB and the difference in performance is very noticeable.",
