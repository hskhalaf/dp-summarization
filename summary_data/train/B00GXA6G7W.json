It also has guiding wheels for vertical operation, say at the sideline of a lawn. It does not need a lot of electricity, so the battery (even if you use the small 20 V one) hold the charge very long. The string will adjust automatically, so there's no hitting the ground all the time to extend the string, as with the older trimmers. A great, quiet, and powerful weed eater without the nuisance of an electrical cord.",

This trimmer however is an absolute pass, as the \u201cautomatic feed\u201d makes it completely worthless. Manually feed out 3-4\u201d of line, start the trimmer up, trim a few feet and the string is down to about 1.25\u201d, and it stays there. The feed line is *never* more than 1.25\u201d or so which means it\u2019s got an effective trim width of about 5\u201d. Talk about making edging a chore.",

The trimmer is difficult and tiring to use because of the way the shield blocks the view of where I am cutting, forcing me to hold it in an uncomfortable and tiring position. But the final straw was the way it stopped feeding the string even though the spool was still half full. Even after replacing the half full spool with a full one, the new spool would not feed either. Attempts to call the company for help were fruitless as I was always placed on hold. So now I am have a hardly new tool that is useless.",

Greenworks should start putting an instruction sticker right on the trimmer housing - obviously a lot of folks have this problem.

This trimmer, however is not worth the hassle. It does not auto feed as described. If you follow instructions and start/stop to feed additional line, the line actually retracts, then disappears. This requires you to stop every few minutes, turn the machine over, take the spool off, pull line out, and start again. It's horrible. Do not buy, unless you are prepared to deal with this hassle.

There is a loop near the handle to help stabilize the cord, so it doesn't pop out - nice feature. Dislikes - The handle you hold to steady the weed eater is plastic and not engineered in a stable manner. It will wobble on you. This is minor, but a flaw that should've been addressed by the engineers. The handle operates as an on switch. This is a bit too large of a switch and can accidentally be triggered when handling the device. I would've preferred this to be smaller.",

After much effort we were able to reassemble the shift. All is well. However still not happy with the support we received from Greenworks and the idea we had to pay for advice.",

Considering I was using a heavy duty craftsman before, I was skeptical this small whacker would keep up. I was pleasantly surprised. It took out all those heavy duty weeds and grass like they weren't there. The automatic feeder works amazing. It was lightweight to use. Love it! I was afraid with all the catching up I had to do, the poor thing would break. It didn't, but if it had, I would have purchased a new one without hesitation because I did beat it to death. You won't be sorry buying this weed whacker!",

On anything even vaguely tough it will bounce off (if you're lucky) or (generally) snap immediately. Aside from that the build of the trimmer is decent, but, what does that actually matter? I should have bit the bullet and bought the EGO, which is great for whacking small woody plants as well as sturdy weeds. It costs considerably more but on the other hand it works. Oh well, lesson learned. Maybe I will try some stranded wire (and wear some very tough pants and/or shin guards).",

The auto advance feature works fairly well and replacing the string is easy (though it lasts a good while). Again, didn't think such a cheap tool would be \"buy-it-for-life\" but I can't see anything taking this down as long as I keep using it for light yard-work.",

The handle and such is comfortable to use. The not so great part is - the single-string trimmer part. It really needs to be a two-string trimmer. It is just a bit weak, but does normal grass trimming. Larger stuff requires you to hold the trimmer in place until it clears out the spot. On the plus side, you can use it right up against an above-ground pool and you won't damage it.",
