There are two rectangular hard plastic parts on the heel of the shoes that have started sticking through and scraping off layers of my skin. I'm not 100% sure why they would even put something so hard and sharp on such an expensive running shoe. I take responsibility in not returning them sooner, but unfortunately I cannot recommend these shoes just based on the design decisions alone. I can see this happening to anyone that purchases these shoes and uses them consistently like I have.",

Because they have the knit, they stay true to shape. The arch is kind of low, probably ok for people with normal arches. I have a more flat foot, so I had to purchase higher arch sport insoles, good that the existing insoles are removable. A+ shoe",
