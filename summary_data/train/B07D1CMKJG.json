There was no extra packing material in the box however. The hangers will end if you're not paying attention, so they are not thicker than normal wire hangers, but they're not so thin that your clothing will bend them. I got the 200 pack because I needed hangers to place kids clothes on for consignment. These worked perfectly.",
