I just wanted a picture & short description book to identify edible vs inedible mushrooms. DO NOT Buy this book looking for a simple field guide, but a detailed PHD analysis of fungi. I did not return it because the costs of shipping exceeds the cost of the book. Maybe I will find someone who has the time and intellect to like this book.",
