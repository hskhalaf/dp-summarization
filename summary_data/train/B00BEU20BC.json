I have had a rug from this Safavieh Courtyard collection in the past that survived Hurricane Florence, and I expect the same toughness from this one. However there are 2 flaws in the weaving that are very visible on the reverse side of the rug, and minimally on the front side. Since there is so much variation in the pattern which masks the flaw, I am probably going to keep the rug rather than going through the hassle of returning.",
