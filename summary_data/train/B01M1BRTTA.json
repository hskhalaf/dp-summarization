I've used my RTIC 30oz tumbler every day since I bought it and it still looks new. Bought two of these and gave one to my husband. He works in an un-airconditioned factory with temperatures well over 100\u00b0 this summer and the cup kept ice through his entire 12hr shift and way past. It's been a life saver for him. Wish I got this last year. Thinking of getting more for Christmas gifts.",

You can buy third party lids to make it more of a travel mug. I've not used this for cold yet but it keeps coffee warm for 12 hours so it works! I don't mind the size but be forewarned this is a big mug! Item does fit in the cup holder of my truck due to its design with a slimmer base.",

We filled this brand and my yeti with ice last night and guess what this morning they both still had ice in them. I would highly recommend this brand instead of spending 40.00 on a yeti cup, because I wish I would have found this brand earlier. I would have bought this instead of my yeti to save some money. I will be purchasing another one for myself. Great buy for the price, if you do not want to spend that kind of money on a yeti.",
