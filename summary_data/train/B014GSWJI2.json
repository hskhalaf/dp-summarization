The original formula almost completely relieved my symptoms and greatly improved my everyday life. Recently however, they made some kind of change to their formula and now my relief is not as complete, and I have for the first time started to experience some side effects such as heartburn and itching. There has also been a huge price increase. I wish they would return to their original formula. If they don\u2019t, I may be forced to start looking for another product.",

      "text": "This has made a significant difference for my arthritis. I had stopped using for a bit and even \"the shot\" did not help the pain. I had moved to turmeric alone. It took five weeks back on Zyflamend but pain very manageable. I should add that this is not my only supplement and that I am not allowed any over the counter pain meds. I do water exercise 3 times weekly... excellent instructior Zyflamend does have turmeric in it",
