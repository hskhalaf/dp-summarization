Now, I quickly learned you do have to really tip the bottle over to make the wine swirl as it should to properly aerate - much more so than if you were pouring direct from the bottle. Additionally, on the practical side, you will have no drips; on the aesthetic side, it looks graceful. At this price point, it's hard to claim a nice aerator is too expensive to have on hand. If you like red wine, get an aerator!",

We lightly used the product for 2 months then randomly found ourselves with wine soaked hands as it started leaking! We examined the pieces and found that the plastic top piece was no longer attached as the barely threaded attachment had cracked. Not sure how this could have happened as we were extremely cautious with use, gently rinsed after each use and allowed to air dry. I don't think we could have been much more careful with it, so I believe the plastic pouring piece is poorly made.

The plastic construction may put some people off but it doesn\u2019t take away from the function. I noticed in some other reviews that people complained of it breaking when opened. While I see how this is possible, as long as it is not brutally twisted or forced I can see the product lasting quite a while. The product customer service also seems to stand by their product which is great in a seller. I would buy this again and not be disappointed.",

My aerator test is always Beaujolais Nouvea, so I pulled out a fresh bottle of 2019 and tried it out. It's not a complex wine, but it does typically open over time and I didn't find that with this aerator. The flavor remained, which tells me it's a high-quality wine product.",

      "text": "I purchased this aerator in January of 2019. It does a great job of aerating the wine. Cleanup is easy as it separates in half. However this is its Achilles heel. To reassemble you must line up markings on each half and twist. Most of the time the aerator leaks after reassembly. I'm only able to use it over a kitchen counter to avoid staining our eating table. It would be a great device if only they could figure out how to make it leak proof.",

As a beginning test we tried on a $3.50 bottle of Pinot Noir. Tested right out of bottle, then after using Vintorio. WOW, completely softened the texture and flavor, taking the bite out...we are believers. Since our initial test, Vintorio has been used many times on more expensive reds and one white with fantastic results. Shipping, delivery and aerator have been as promised and spot on, thank you.

Very good purchase and you can't beat the price and space that it consumes as opposed to a carafe.",
