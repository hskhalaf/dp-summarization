      "text": "I purchased these stools to work with my Arcade1Up games and they have worked perfectly. They have been used by small kids all the way up to 300 lb adults and are sturdy and comfortable. The bright colors look great with the games and they were a big hit at my recent company potluck (see photo). The stools received steady use for about 3 hours by about 150 adults and performed without issue. I had a bit of trouble getting the plastic off of the legs because the plastic surrounds the screws but found that if I scored the plastic at the screw location it was much easier to remove. Highly recommend!",

I wanted them in all red and at least 6 in the package. I want to see if they hold up after a few months of use. I\u2019m pleased. This was a good buy.",

It would be easy for them to move them around because they are so light but I would like for them to have seats where they need them.

You literally have to disassemble each still if you want to remove all the plastic cover, because it\u2019s screwed into the stool itself. So if you don\u2019t have a screwdriver you will be annoyed. 2) several of the stools have screws that were over-screwed, causing the plastic ring underneath to crack. This means you can\u2019t really tell how far to screw in, and thus can cause some unevenness",
