Not only will a wobble like this not cut straight, but can also be dangerous due to lack of control, and will inevitably lead to it wearing out early as the angles cause extra stress on it. Will be going back.",

The handle is unique non slip design and perfectly weighted so the knife is well balanced. Makes for efficient cutting action now that I've used it for a few days. Can't judge a knife by its sharpness alone is all about the weight and this is near perfect at such a great price. We've used more expensive knives in the kitchen and have to say this easily matches those. Very satisfied customer!",

The cover is definitely needed for something as sharp as this in the cutlery drawer. The handle is also very nice premium black finish seamlessly moulding into the steel of the knife it's quite pleasing to look at and very nice balanced weight when using full stop the box it came with also makes it a very ideal gift with premium packaging and compartments cut out for the knife for the information booklet and for the cover of The Knife",

However, next thing I know I was thanked for my feedback by Waleed the owner who was very quick to dispatch another. If they continue to offer this level of service with quality products then I can see them going places. So nice to find a business that cares, they are rare these days!",
