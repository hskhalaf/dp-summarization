The new generator uses more oil than I've ever seen a generator use. Generac used to be the name to trust for many years. I no longer hold that opinion.",

If the draw gets anywhere close to the 14 amps, it will trip the breaker. This generator may run a refrigerator or two, lights, etc... but will not run anything that takes quite a load. Compressor, AC, etc... Save your money and get one with a bigger breaker. This is a very well made generator. 3 pulls, and it started. I am really disappointed in the design.
