We contacted the company Zero G as the hose was warranted for 5 years normal use. They replaced the hose. Even though it developed a leak we are still happy with this hose for all the reasons stated above, and also because Zero G took care of the problem. I recommend the hose 100%.",

The traditional plastic hoses were getting too heavy for us at our age, plus they always kinked eventually. The wife got one of these lightweight hoses in the spring and loved it. Doesn't kink nearly as easily, and doesn't hurt her arthritic hands. After a couple months, we replaced every hose on the farm. They roll up nice and compact so you can get quite a long length inside the hose roller box thing. These have really made farm life easier.",
