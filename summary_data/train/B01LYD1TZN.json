I was doing a triple sifting of about 5 cups of flour. After the second sifting, I put it down and went back to my old sifter where the blades graze the wire mesh pretty much throughout. The old sifter was a lot faster. So I returned this one. This may have just been one bad one, but no matter how pretty and large, a sifter that doesn't sift well is useless.",
