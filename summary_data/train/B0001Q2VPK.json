This thing is as quiet as any large or small compressors. We were running 3 bostitch roofing Nailers. Shooting 40squ in 2 days with 3 Nailers going full time is usually allot to ask of compact compressors. The makita is WELL worth the $ to add this tool to your small business. Update-So I've had this all summer now. I used it to put down about 30,000 squ off shingles. We've ran up to 3 guns without a hiccup. Great tool, get one!",

She only has a 4.5 tank but cycles and keeps line pressure up for no miss fires or jams in nailer or staple guns. If I ever do buy a larger one it will be a Makita. Customer for life.

The Makita fit the bill perfectly and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. It's quieter than what the online videos portray. I was really shocked at how quiet it is. All in all I highly recommend this compressor and have no regrets.",

I have a HD 2500 Dodge 4x4 that requires 60-pounds pressure in the front tires and 80-pounds in the rear. Although ultimately successful, it struggles to fill the tires to that level, taking about four - five minutes per tire.

The machine is much beefier; gauges and drain are better protected Has an air-filter (doubt I need it) Weighs a lot more. This machine cost 2x's the PC, but it appears to be well worth it.

I prefer a oil-lubricated compressor because of better longevity and lower noise level. So far I used it with a brad nailer, finishing nailer and a stapler, soon I plan to purchase a framing nailer and use it for basement finishing - framing interior walls. The compressor is portable, but on the heavy side (a good thing, does not wander over the floor).",

      "text": "After about 4 months I noticed paint had flaked off the end of the lower tank. Other comments mentioned paint issues, thus I deducted a star from the rating. I touched up the tank with a name brand anti rust paint and have had no further issues. I had to snug up the fittings to stop some bleed off when it was new. Otherwise, I am quite happy with the compressor.",

      "text": "I bought this from amazon.com about 7-8 months ago and I was replacing a 2 gallon air compressor so this was definitely a step up. I was looking for something that wasn't too noisy either. MAC2400 is quiet in comparison to some other compressors but it's still pretty noisy. Seems to have to refill often too. Very sturdy and heavy. If you're a professional and had to bring this to a job site you most definitely could. I use it in my woodshop(garage) for multiple purposes. So far so good, I am a Makita fan.",

    "description": "Style:MAC2400Portable Electric Oil-Lubricated Air Compressor, Twin Stack Tank Type, HP 2.5, 115VAC Voltage, Full Load Amps 12.3, Free Air CFM @ 90 PSI 4.2, Max. Pressure 130 psi, Tank Size 4.2 gal., Weight 77 lb., Cylinder Material Cast Iron, Lubrication Type Oil Lubricated, Motor RPM 1730, Avg. Pump Life 2, 000 hr., dBA @ 3 Feet 79.0, Overall Length 19-3/8 In., Overall Width 18-3/4 In., Overall Height 18 In., Compressor Oil Includes.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nMakita's 2.5HP Air Compressor is equipped with Makita's Big Bore engineered pump cylinder and piston for higher output for two nailers, with less noise and improved job site performance. The MAC2400 delivers industrial power and results with improved durability under tough job site conditions.\n\n\n\n2.5 HP with Big Bore Engineered Pump\nThe MAC2400 is powered by a 2.5 HP motor. The Makita Big Bore engineered pump with cast iron cylinder has greater bore and stroke for increased compression, faster recovery and less noise. The cast iron construction is engineered for increased durability even under tough job-site conditions. The MAC2400 has an oil-lubricated pump and is equipped with a large automotive style filter for increased air intake and greater efficiency. The Big Bore oil-lubricated pump is also more efficient: the MAC2400 runs cooler and at half the RPM of most competitive units, resulting in greater motor and pump life and lower noise. The 4.2 gallon twin-stacked tank sustains an operating pressure of 130 PSI, and delivers 40PSI (4.8 CFM) and 90 PSI (4.2 CFM), enough for two nailers. The low AMP draw reduces instances of tripped breakers and voltage drop that can cause premature motor failure. The roll bar handle provides portability and additional protection, helping it withstand harsh jobsite environments. Additional features include a convenient oil drain and oil sight glass, a tank drain valve that supersedes standard petcock design for easier maintenance, and finned discharge tubing that dissipates heat more efficiently.Versatile Design for a Range of Applications\nThe MAC2400 is engineered for low noise, high output and less maintenance, and delivers industrial power and results with improved durability under tough job site conditions. The MAC2400 is just another example of Makita's commitment to innovative technology and best-in-class engineering.\n\nAbout Makita Big Bore Air Compressors\nMakita Big Bore Air Compressors deliver higher output and less noise for improved job site performance.
