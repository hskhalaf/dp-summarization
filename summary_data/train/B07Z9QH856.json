He didn't want to get rid of his last pair even though they were a size and a half too small because he loves them so much. Slip-on sock design means there's no tongue adjustments. Low profile design and lightweight build make these perfect for speed play and low fatigue. Definitely worth the investment",

We usually get a season and a little more out of them but we play in a lot of rain, which shortens the life of all shoes. We bought a shoe dryer this year and it has really helped with these. overall we will continue to get these.",
