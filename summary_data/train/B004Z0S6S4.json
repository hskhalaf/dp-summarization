      "text": "It has worked flawlessly for over 6 months now (over 4,300 hours powered on according to SMART). I installed this in my new HTPC which runs an underpowered AMD E-450 APU. HDTune shows 75% of the drive running at 240MB/s and 25% of the drive running at 130MB/s. The drive is partitioned using GPT and booting fine in UEFI mode. I've installed/re-installed the OS several times (supports TRIM), and currently using about 25% of the drive space. Is this the 25% that is running at 130MB/s? I don't know, but it runs fast enough for my purposes. The access time is 0.3ms which helps the underpowered APU feel almost snappy.",

My only substantive complaint is that 60GB is not enough for Win 7 pro, Office 2010, and a game. It's not OCZ's fault, but a word to the wise, 120/128 is pretty much a minimum size for a modern computer, 60GB is really not enough. Solid Reliable Affordable FAST 60GB is too small Peace.",

It is important to do the firmware update though -- drives often remain in the warehouse for many months before being sold and you cannot do the update once the operating system is installed. Without the firmware update, you WILL have data loss issues. With it, you have a solid and dependable drive you can count on for many years to come in the average enthusiast's home system.",

You need to first change bios to use ACHI instead of IDE driver, then update firmware by downloading an OCZ tool (basically a lightweight Linux that runs from CD), then reset cmos on motherboard (if first time using ssd, sata3). Not sure why it is this complicated. Make sure to get 3.5\" to 2.5\" hard drive kit and sata cable since it does not come with anything (even though it is retail packaging).",

It's backed by a 3-year limited warranty.\n\n\n\nThe OCZ Agility 3 2.5-inch SSD (view larger).\n\nSUPERIOR PC EXPERIENCE\nIn addition to maximum performance, an Agility 3 upgrade promotes cooler, quieter, and more energy efficient conditions compared to traditional mechanical hard drives. With no moving parts, SSDs provide peace of mind with their superior durability and reliability. Read more about SSDs below.\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE SPECIFICATIONS\nRELIABILITY/PROTECTION\n * Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF): 2 million hours \n * Data Path Protection: ECC corrects up to 78 random bits per 1 KB sector (BCH) \n * Product Health Monitoring: Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology (SMART) Support \n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n * Serial ATA (SATA): Fully compliant with Serial ATA International Organization (Serial ATA Revision 3.0) and ATA/ATAPI-8 Standard Native Command Queuing (NCQ) \n * Operating System: Windows XP 32-bit / 64-bit; Windows Vista 32-bit / 64-bit; Windows 7 32-bit / 64-bit; Linux; Mac OS X \n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\n * Native TRIM support (requires OS support) \n * Shock resistant up to 1500G \n * Low power consumption (2.7W active, 1.5W idle) \n * Service & Support: 3-year warranty, toll-free tech support, 24 hour forum support \n\nTHE SSD ADVANTAGE\nWhether you're refreshing an older laptop or trying to maximize the potential of the latest platform, SSDs provide substantial benefits over traditional hard drives.\n\n\n\nGREATER DURABILITY\nSolid State Drives feature a non-mechanical design of NAND flash mounted to circuit boards, shock resistant up to 1500g. Hard disk drives consist of various moving parts making them susceptible to shock and damage.\n\nFASTER PERFORMANCE\nSSDs have 100 times greater throughput and instantaneous access times for quicker boot-ups, faster file transfers, and overall snappier performance than hard drives. HDDs can only access the data faster the closer it is from the read/ write heads, while all parts of the SSD can be accessed at once.\n\nLESS POWER CONSUMPTION, SILENT OPERATION, AND LIGHTWEIGHT\nSSDs use significantly less wattage at peak load than hard disk drives--less than 2W versus 6W for an HDD--delivering longer battery life in notebooks, less power strain on system, and a cooler computing environment. With no moving parts, SSDs run virtually silent in your notebook or PC case to eliminate distracting noises during gaming or entertainment. And SSDs won't weigh down your laptop, netbook, or tablet PC when you're on the go.\n\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n\nOCZ Agility 3 SATA III Solid State Drives are designed and built to provide an exceptional balance of performance and value. The Agility 3 Series implements the cutting-edge SATA 6Gbps interface to deliver excellent sequential and random data transfer rates, significantly improving your computing experience over hard drives.\n\n\n\nProviding an exceptional balance of performance and value\n\nIn addition to enhanced performance, an Agility 3 upgrade promotes cooler, quieter, and more energy efficient conditions compared to traditional mechanical hard drives. With no moving parts, SSDs provide peace of mind with their superior durability and reliability. Unique and innovative, Agility 3 SSDs deliver a one-of-a-kind storage solution.\n\nRELIABLE, FAST STORAGE\nThe Agility 3 makes an SSD the ideal storage alternative to hard drives and delivers the quality, reliability, and durability demanded by consumers that will not settle for anything but the best.

Get fast, durable performance in a drive that won't weigh down your laptop or notebook.\n\nLOW POWER CONSUMPTION\nFor all their power, the Agility 3 series of drives consume very little. Agility 3 drives only consume 2.7 watts during operation, and only half a watt in standby.\n\nRAID COMPATIBLE\nWith a 3.5\" adapter for desktop drive cages (sold separately), so you can use the Agility 3 in desktops as well as laptops. The drives are RAID compatible, so you can slot them into a desktop RAID configuration as easily as into a laptop.\n\nAVAILABLE IN A WIDE RANGE OF SIZES\nOCZ Agility 3 SSDs are available in 60GB to 240GB and come backed by a 3-year warranty and 2 million hour MTBF for ultimate peace of mind.\n\nWHAT THE CRITICS ARE SAYING ABOUT THE OCZ AGILITY 3\n\n\n\"It's becoming a bit of a repetitive story with OCZ's SATA III (6G) range of SSD products, but it is as simple as this .. no product out there can match the performance (at this time) and being reasonably aggressive with the pricing, OCZ really might have a big hit in their hands with the Agility 3.\"\n--Hilbert Hagedoorn, guru3D.com\n\n\"In the 4K 32QD tests with AS-SSD and CrystalDiskMark, the OCZ Agility 3 SSD nearly topped our charts and leads among the best high-performance consumer storage devices. With the results we've received in our tests, hardware enthusiasts can expect extremely high operational performance and storage functionality for demanding applications and extreme I/O environments. Considering the level of performance we've experienced with the OCZ Agility 3 SSD, it's easy recommend this solid state drive to high-performance computer hardware enthusiasts and hardcore power-users. The blazing fast transfer speeds and outstanding operational performance earn the OCZ Agility 3 SSD our Silver Tachometer Award.\"\n--Olin Coles, BenchmarkReviews.com\n\n\"\"It\u2019s easy to say that this is one fast drive. Just looking at the performance increase from the previous generation Agility 2, we can see that the Agility 3 can at times double the performance of its predecessor, both in synthetic and real-world benchmarks. In all, the Agility 3 is the fastest drive we have tested to-date, and an amazing product all around.\n--Chris Ledenican, NeoSeeker\n\n\n\n\nSee more",
