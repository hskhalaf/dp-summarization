But when I received this weekend, my daughter and I are totally disappointed because they are tiny small palm-sized books and its size is only about 1/4 of the original BOB BOOKS!! There is no description of the book size online. It is definitely not worthy of the money. We will definitely return of it.",

Early reading with reading concepts incorporated into them. Better than sight word books, easier and faster memorization of letters and sounds than learning using ABC phonic memorization. My 4 year old and 6 year old (who has a speech delay) and comprehending reading at rapid paces after starting bob books. They do the work for you!!!!",

They are really great books and helped him learn to read very quickly. They are arranged to build on what they already know and they have good use of repetition and similar words. I CAN NOT recommend these highly enough. We have the ENTIRE Bob collection and now our 4 year old is starting to read using these!",

I used these to help my 4yr old son start to read and he is able to do 1-3 books in a sitting before loosing interest lol The way the books use the same few blends over and over makes them good practice especially with kids who aren't picking reading up at a fast pace. I think these helped my son's confidence as well since he was able to say he read the whole book by himself. He now even picks them up on his own and is able to sound out the words as is proud of himself.",
