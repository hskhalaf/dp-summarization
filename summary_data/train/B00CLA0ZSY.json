I have a variety of shelters, some single occupancy and some big enough for 2 cats. I got this A-Frame a couple of months ago and it quickly became a favorite. It is rarely empty. I think the cats enjoy being able to sit up inside it. Mine is on a covered patio so I don't have to worry about snow but I feel it would perform well in rougher conditions. A great product and I may soon be buying another one.",

      "text": "The idea is fantastic. However the cord that comes with it is VERY short! It is not ideal for outdoors where you would need to put it for ferals and it burned up the extension cord where it was plugged in. It is not recommended you use one, however there is no way to plug it in otherwise unless you are right next to an outlet, which in most cases is not likely! I used it in my garage for my ferals and thankfully did not have a fire. I would not get this unless you are planning to use it indoors in an outlet.",

When its really cold (below zero) he prefers the insulated container I made with the K&H heat pad and straw added, but most nights (teens,twenties) he's in this one with the big ground level opening (he can scoot out quick-so I think that makes him feel safe)",
