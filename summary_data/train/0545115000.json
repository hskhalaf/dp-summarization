It will be simple to adjust chores... add or take away, re-distribute, etc. Couldn't be happier!",

All I had to do was print and cut them out. So far it has helped a lot and I give myself rewards at the end of the day and I take away stickers (my favorite ones haha) or go to bed early to punish myself if I don't follow my schedule.",

As a hugely successful company, Amazon should be doing better at resourcing items and watching the waste it creates. Not ok! The photos I have included show the actual item (flat and somewhat flexible) and then the packaging....oversized box & WAAAAAAYYYYY too much paper!",

Although it's not a horrible product, I was a tad disappointed, because Scholastic is a name that I rely on when purchasing classroom materials. I'm usually super happy with Scholastic products.",
