While it matches the body in appearance, it cheapens the feel of the product. It makes me wonder how long it will last. Second, the power boost button only works one way. Once power boost is activated, the only way to go back to regular stream is to turn the water completely off and back on again. At first I thought my faucet was defective but I called the manufacturer and they confirmed that it's actually a feature and not a defect. \ud83e\udd14",

I used it with the escutcheon (deck plate) to cover the 3 holes, but you could use it without if you have a single hole. FYI, there is a matching bar faucet that's just a bit smaller which I used on my island sink.",

Yes, Moen will send me a new cartridge but as other reviewers have stated they will not accept responsibility for water damage done.

      "text": "Beautiful faucet and works well. I liked it so much I bought two more. I am short so we cut an 8\" length of chrome colored shower curtain rod with the silver end cap on one end to extend the handle and make it easier for me to reach. I wrapped the original faucet handle underneath with tiny bubble, bubble wrap so it would not be damaged before sliding on the \"handle extension\". I have this faucet at home, in my office kitchen and in a rental apartment I have. The plumber easily installed each of them.",
