      "text": "Really wanted to love this chainsaw since for the menial tasks I would throw at it, the price couldn\u2019t be beat. Upon receiving my SECOND saw, I found that both would not lubricate the bar and chain. I tried several viscosities of bar/chain oil, but neither worked out. At one point while cutting, the blade and bar began smoking and the \u201caroma\u201d of an in-oiled chain was obvious. Kudos to Amazons return policy, but I have to give this 2-thumbs down for my experience. (( also, as others have noted, bar/chain oil is not included in the purchase))",

I started it again and the throttle speed increased again with no user interaction. These MTD/Remington Chinese made saws are also heavier than the competition with no more power to show for the weight. It had trouble doing what a 32cc saw does. Also, the oiler is a bad design, one cannot keep oil in it while it sits or else it leaks. Not worth the aggravation!",

This would not have been a Big issue for someone with more experience using and maintaining a chainsaw. The instructions that came with the saw were not very helpful. After several tries, I was able to get the chain back on and working correctly. I would recommend this unit to anyone that is willing to learn and not just use!",

The only thing I experienced that I learned to deal with is....if you've been using it for a while and then shut it off...plan on letting it sit for at least 30-minutes. It WILL NOT RESTART until it has cooled sufficiently. Since I'm a senior and a novice at this...the break worked out just fine. So...no real harsh complaint...just a learning curve that has not made me wish I had purchased another brand.",

Cold Start on second day needed a little more effort. Went through a few beech trees and chain has dulled after a total of 4 hours. Saw is not too heavy or loud which is a plus when working for extensive time. Only real complaint is how quicklybchain has dulled, perhaps this is standard for factory issued chain.
