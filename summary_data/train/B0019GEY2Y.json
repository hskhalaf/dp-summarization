I throw this back and forth with my 10 year old after doing a session of long toss with a regular baseball. After finishing the heavy ball training, then we go straight to mound practice with a regular baseball. Over a few sessions we have already noticed a slight velocity increase. Be careful when starting with heavy ball training and start at a low number of throws, working your way up. As long as it isn't overdone, these can add a great addition to your pitching training.",

It puts added pressure on your shoulder, so you need to focus on form and not overthrowing. After 20-25 throws with the weighted ball, a regular ball feels like a whiffle ball. Haven't used the 12 oz. ball yet. Maybe when my son is older, but at 12 years old, the 10 oz is plenty heavy enough. I'd rather they sold them separately for a cheaper price, but at $11.99, it's not like it's that cost-prohibitive.",
