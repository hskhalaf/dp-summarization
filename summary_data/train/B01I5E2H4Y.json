I also find that stretching the muscles is as important as strengthening them, and for this reason I think the Balance Board is far superior to doing planks, which are static and do not stretch the muscles.",

The instruction sheet on balance and core exercises is very informative. I use this board with my standing desk and I find it very compatible.",
