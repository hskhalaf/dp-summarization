However, the reported drawbacks might scare potential buyers away. Its flawed fit and sizing were not received lightly by consumers. All in all, getting a pair of Evasion 2 Aero may require a bit of an effort. Trying it out on a local store to get the best fit will help. Also, users may still have to put up with its break-in period.",

The only thing I miss from this pair is the speed lace which wasn't available at the price I paid, I mean these were quite cheap by Salomon standards.",

They look well made as you would expect from a this brand. What I can say is that they are definitely incorrectly sized. I bought these for my father who is a uk6, having read the reviews I bought him a uk6.5 which were still too small so I ended up getting him a 7, which fitted him ok but not with walking socks. So I would reccomend going for at least 1 size above your usual size. And if you're after water resistance go for the GTX version.",
