I work full-time and when I get home from work, I\u2019m too tired to walk my dog, it\u2019s IFETCH time! This of course is not a replacement for walking your dog however this is an amazing exercise they truly truly love! 5 stars, don\u2019t hesitate to purchase because it is worth every penny!",

The first one I ordered didn't throw the ball consistently but the customer service was great and they sent me a replacement promptly. I've had no problems with the replacement product.",

    "title": "iFetch Interactive Ball Launchers for Dogs",
    "description": "Size:Large\n\nThe iFetch Too automatic ball launcher is a big dog\u2019s fetching dream! Once your dog places the standard sized tennis ball into the top of the iFetch Too, this interactive dog toy throws it 10, 25 or 40 feet. (Or set it to \u201crandom\u201d to keep your pet guessing!) Features an internal rechargeable battery and distance setting changes with a touch of a button.\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\n\n\nFetch-a-holics rejoice! The iFetch Too is perfect for big dogs who love their tennis balls! Change the launch distance to 10, 25 and 40 feet with the touch of a button. It\u2019s that easy! There\u2019s also a random distance setting for more fun. The iFetch Too launches immediately, to minimize the chances of the ball hitting your dog at close range; but we recommend training your dog to drop the ball in from behind, as good practice. Comes with a built-in, rechargeable battery that can last and last (we've counted over 300 launches!). Bring it to the park and watch the dogs come running. Happy fetching!\n\nAward-winning ball launcher! The iFetch Too won \u201cFirst Place\u201d in the New Product Showcase dog category at SuperZoo, the pet industry\u2019s largest trade show, and \u201cSecond Place\u201d at the Global Pet Expo\u2019s New Product Showcase. The best praise for us, though, is seeing online videos of dogs enjoying the iFetch Too! We care about safety too. Under the power/distance setting button, there is a button you can slide to lock the distance to 10 feet. No matter how many times you press the button to adjust distance, it will stay at 10 feet. This allows easy play indoors and is recommended for early training until your dog learns to wait behind (or beside) the iFetch Too when it launches.\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: DROP Train your dog to \u201cdrop!\u201d the iFetch tennis ball into the top of the iFetch Too. We recommend using another ball (showing another pretty blue ball will make them drop the one they have) or using treats (yum) for motivation.\n\nStep 2: FETCH Encourage your dog to \u201cfetch!\u201d once the ball launches from the iFetch Too. You may need to launch a few balls from the tennis ball machine at first, showing your dog that his new toy actually throws the ball \u2013 it doesn\u2019t eat it.\n\nStep 3: REPEAT Now, coax your dog to \u201cbring!\u201d the ball back to the iFetch Too for more fetching fun. Again, try using another iFetch ball or treat to get them back behind the launcher again and ready to drop. And don\u2019t forget to shower your dog with praise!\n\n\n\n\nA family company on a mission to create better dog toys. We started the company with a grandfather / grandson tinkering project in the garage, followed by a successful Kickstarter campaign, and now almost four years of experience under our belts. There are a lot of dog toys on the market, but we strive for new and different. All of our products require some level of training to be able to play with the toys independently, which we think creates a wonderful bonding opportunity for owners and their pets. Even if your dog never \"gets\" the idea of dropping the ball into the top of the toy, you can still play and interact with them through the toy. These shared experiences are special. We like to think our toys are special too.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Startup Describe your product in 3 words.\n\nHealthy, fetching fun.\n\nHow did you come up with the idea for this product?\n\nOnce we developed the iFetch ball launcher for small dogs, we were flooded with emails from customers wanting a larger version for their big dogs. After another successful Kickstarter campaign, we launched production of the iFetch Too.\n\nWhat makes your product special?\n\nWe think our iFetch Too ball launcher is an engineering work of art. We designed the launcher to only launch one ball at a time on purpose. The mental energy it takes for a dog to understand where and how to drop the ball so that it is automatically thrown for him is pretty amazing. And mental stimulation is so important for a dog's well-being. \"Use it or lose it\" applies to dogs as well as humans. Our iFetch Too launcher is portable, durable, and features an internal, rechargeable battery. All of these features were important to our customers.\n\nWhat has been the best part of your startup experience?\n\nThe best part of our startup experience is seeing the videos owners post of their pets playing with our iFetch products. Watching dogs get so excited waiting for the ball to launch makes all of the hard work worthwhile. It is truly a family affair at iFetch. Denny, though supposedly \u201cretired\u201d, is the CEO and patriarch of the company. His daughter, Debbie left her medical practice, to help run the company. And Grant, the idea originator, has returned as our Sales VP to \u201claunch\u201d his career with us (pun intended). It's been a wonderful journey.",
