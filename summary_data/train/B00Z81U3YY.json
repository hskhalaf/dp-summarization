Just plug it into it's charger and boom it's working again! Another thing we love about this keyboard remote is that up top in the middle, it has a mousepad that works exactly like a lap tops does! Double tap it it'll select what you're trying to select, Use two fingers and slide down on it it'll scroll down. Just absolutely geniously made and very happy with this purchase!",

I especially like the media keys and the three different ways the \"mouse buttons\" can work (touchpad, near top, and on the side). It has two light-levels which is nice, but I wish it remembered the light level chosen previously when it is power cycled. The keyboard is larger than a game controller, but smaller than a DVD case. The lighted keys are a nice bonus when using it in a darkened room. A very nice product.",

The mouse pad is straight forward and precise, and in the upper left are easy to navigate Media Center controls. Internal rechargeable lithium battery. 2.4GHz USB dongle. A special USB cord allows charging while still using. Just a super little device. -June 2020 update: I've since purchased a couple more, to use, and as a kind of hedge against future unavailability or failure. I still like this gem as much as the day I first used it, it still takes a full charge, and I still use it every day.",

I've only had it about a week and I've used it everyday so I can't really say anything about battery life. I turn off the device when I'm not using it. I LOVE the backlight also! Convenient when watching a movie at night - I don't have to get up to turn on the lights to see what I'm doing. Best purchase ever!",

It does work, but some of the buttons do not do what they are supposed to, so you have to find out where the real OK button is. The qwerty keyboard does not work at all for any 3rd party apps. So you will have to resort to fishing for letters and numbers the same way you did with the default remote on YouTube. Oh yeah, this is the best- there is no OK button for Hulu, so you will still need your old remote for that.",
