This futon, however, was a nice 3\" thick and very sturdy and comfortable. It is very large, being a queen size, as I am used to sleeping on a traditional full-size mattress. To get an idea of the size, I had my 3 year old son lay on it for the picture.",

I believe this product is in no way reflective of a traditional shikibuton. Typically, a shikibuton acts as a mattress and lifts and supports and individual off of the floor. This product is nothing more than an extremely expensive cotton comforter. So, imagine sleeping on the floor, or a wooden platform, with only a comforter. Does that somehow help your low back pain? Nope. But it certainly gives you rib, neck, shoulder, knee, and much worse back pain! I don\u2019t see any real shikibuton on Amazon, but this thing is a useless piece of garbage that will cause you endless pain.",

There is a wonderful balance between firm and softness when set on the floor. Perfect for anyone looking to save space during the day and not sacrificing a good nights sleep. I have slept on different guest beds ranging from air mattresses to sofa pull-out bed over the years and this has been my favorite so far. I may be purchasing another in the near future.",

I did some research and kept finding that traditional Japanese futons are supposedly good for the back and help with back pain. I was a bit skeptical, but decided to go for it because I couldn't deal with the other mattress any longer. I am so glad that I did. I have been using this futon for the past week and a half along with a traditional buckwheat hull makura pillow from Beans72, and I can say with confidence that I am sleeping better than I ever have, ever.",

In fact the thickness is more like 4cm, which is the half of 8cm on product description. I think the seller needs to correct this error. It's not going to be 8cm even if you expose the futon to sun. This kind of slim futon is called \"senbei buton\" in Japan. Senbei means a hard snack. So... it sure is an imported product, but I feel it's well overpriced.
