The whole thing took over 3 hours to assemble and the pieces were laid out in the cheepest way possible. They should have used better predrilled holes, and gotten tighter angle brackets. Better yet they could have used some kind of tongue and groove system to make sure all the pieces were flush. The whole thing came out a bit crooked, and one of the doors does not sit flat. Luckily one thing saving this product's review is that it looks great put together. Thankfully all of the scars and cut corners don't show.",

The finish is attractive and the doors open and close smoothly. It is a few inches taller than most stands, which proves me with a the viewing angle I want. Mine is placed in a difficult corner so stand is a couple inches short of being pushed tightly into the space. However, with that small extension into the room, the stand easily and safely accommodates my new 48\" t.v. I couldn't be more pleased.Thank you Sauder!",

I wish it came with more shelves for inside the cabinets - there\u2019s a lot of wasted space if you\u2019re storing DVDs or Blu-ray Discs in a row (like normal), but I just stacked them on top of each other. 2 shelves per cabinet instead of just 1 would have been perfect.

Door just doesn't fit right and too much space showing around door. Attached pic cause hard to explain. Following these directions exactly and thought I might have done something wrong - the back is perfectly aligned and I can't see where I could have made a mistake. Disappointed but luckily its next to my desk and not that noticeable. The other thing is the back is not in a V type shape to actually fit flush in a corner. (added a pic showing the problem but only the pic of the good side appears!)",
