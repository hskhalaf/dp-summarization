      "text": "We have owned these boots for a little over two months. The get frequent wear and have wore down more than would be expected. They also leak!? Which really is disappointing. They are rain boots and my son's feet get wet when he wears them. This is the second pair we have owned in this brand. Our last leaked as well, though I assumed it was because they were old (1yr of use). Though, now I believe it is just the brand. We will be searching for a new pair now.",

The quality is very nice but the boots are somewhat heavy; my toddler has no trouble walking or jumping while wearing theses but his legs seem to get tired fairly quickly from the weight of the boots. He definitely does not prefer to wear these for a long time. The boots run large. If you want the perfect fit, order down or at least true to your child's current shoe size. I personally ordered a size up to accommodate my child's fast growing feet.",
