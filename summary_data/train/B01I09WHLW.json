I may buy another to use as a slave. Yes, it requires batteries, but at this price, who cares? BTW, I use mine with a Canon 5D Mark II.",

What really happened was evident. One of the internal electrolytic capacitors, possibly the one storing the charge for the flash, had exploded and leaked electrolyte. Absolutely cannot recommend this product. Returned for credit.",

      "text": "After barely six months of irregular use (mostly light testing at home and maybe once or twice for actual very low impact amateur photography), this thing is already falling apart. I wanted to test it out as a slave flash (will be shooting my company group portrait), and when I dropped a fresh set of batteries in, one of the contacts just dropped out. Just like that, it's rendered non-operational. Will stick to my name brands (have Nikon, Sony, and Canon DSLRs and speedlights) from this point on.",

      "text": "For the 17 months that the flash lasted, it was a great bargain. It swivels smoothly in all the expected ways, and provides reasonable coverage with a 35mm lens on a full-frame DSLR (some light fall-off at the corners, but nothing that can't be dodged away). As far as I could tell, the stated guide number was correct; it's not the most powerful flash, but good for most reasonable situations. It's not made of particularly durable-feeling plastic, and after 17 months, the tube seems to have gone bad: the control LEDs light up, but no flash.",

Now, I'm on the hunt for something that will hopefully offer some overheating protection and last me longer than six months.",
