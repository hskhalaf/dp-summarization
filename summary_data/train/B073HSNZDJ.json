She slipped out of the house during a furniture delivery a week ago, and needs daily medication, and we were frantic to find her, but she was scared and wouldn't come when we called. The Pixel on her collar allowed my husband and I to figure out where in the neighborhood she was hiding, and get her home safely. That's amazing to me. Every pet needs one of these on their collars, mine definitely will.",

I'm really happy with how easy it is to find my keys, where I parked my car, where my insurance information is for my motorcycle. Paying attention to battery status is painless and swapping takes about five seconds once you get the hang of it.",

I am constantly traveling for work related purposes, I slap this thing on luggage and never worry again. I've tested it out on pet collars too and it worked perfectly. I was skeptical at first but now that I have one, I think I'll be getting more for family and friends. This thing is super tiny and doesn't bulk up existing key chains, etc. It's affordable and worth the purchase if you're having any doubts.

The \"free\" battery wasn't free. It was $1.99 and the shipping was free. Not terrible, but definitely not at all what they advertise which was frustrating and impacted the score I gave them. The battery in the Pixel is also really difficult to replace. There are several recommendations on ifixit.com (the tape method ended up working for me).",

So TrackR's will also save you money in the long run. Battery life for Tile and TrackR is one year.",
