I am not over-stressing the shelves (bottles of motor oil, polishes etc.), but they're holding up well. I have the 10\" side into the wall, and the 12\" side out for a longer shelf, which will be the weaker combination (stronger combo would be 12\" in wall, 10\" of shelving)... but doing well. Metal is slightly soft under tight screws, but this is useful as it twists the shelf into shape if a screw is slightly off. So 5/5 rating - all good!",

Basically, when securing to 2x4 studs in walls, the single bottom screw hole is great but not the two upper screw holes at the angle. Due to the space between the upper two holes it is nearly impossible to secure both screws to a 1.5 inch deep 2x4 stud. Had to drill a separate hole just above and between both of the upper screw holes. Then, would secure bracket using the new hole and one of the two upper screw holes.",
