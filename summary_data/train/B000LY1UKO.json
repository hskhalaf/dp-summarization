The new batteries lasted only 2-3 days and I only used the camera for less than an hour. I bought a charger and some rechargeable Ni-Mh batteries. They don't fare any better than the alkaline. I very seldom use this camera and the batteries go dead just sitting in the camera for 2 to 4 weeks. I would not recommend this camera to anyone I liked.",

This camera comes with some of the best software available in my opinion. The E30 is also durable. I accidentally slung it across the sidewalk about 15feet (it slipped from my hand). Just a minor scratch is all that happened. For $115.00 this camera is a bargain",
