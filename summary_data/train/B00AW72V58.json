Ft area and didn't slow dwn at all. The one gripe I have is the height and angle of the handlebar...needs to be shorter and leaned back more for easier handling. It is also lighter than the little mantis but both bucked about the same when I hit some cornstalk roots and this has wheels, the mantis u have to carry because it just sits on the tines.",

Battery recharges in only 2 hours and runs for the entire 40 by 80 foot garden. It does not do well with compacted soil ,sod, or high weeds but if you allow it to go slow enough it will chop these up as well. Overall, it's a great tool for the money and this fits in perfectly with our off grid PV system. We also have the lawnmower and pruning saw in this series and are happy with everything. Goodbye gasoline!",

I have very rocky soil, and although it jumps a little when it hits a rock, it is easy to handle. It saved me hours when I needed to dig out a trench for a path in my garden. I dug up the path area and then the dirt was easy to shovel out. I love it. So worth the money.",
