They are the most comfortable shoe but this time around the front seam where the toe and tongue and sides meet across the top of your toes you can feel it. Comparing my 2yr old pair and the new one it seems like there is one seam holding everthing on new ones and 2 seams so that it would be flush on the old pair.... looking at the detail they seem more rushed than the last many pairs. But im hopeful the seam can flatten down some over time with wear and the fabric relaxes",
