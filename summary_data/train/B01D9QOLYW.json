(Benedict Cumberbatch lego mini fig!?!) All of the details of the set are fabulous and pretty accurate to the movie. (i.e. references to the library, mystical objects, letting the mini figures fly and fight, and a monster coming out, the window) Not sure if I'm just going to display this as is, build a house/building for it, or add it on to another building. But I love it and really glad I got it after seeing the movie!",

The tentacle monster coming out of the wall has a gear mechanism on the back, so that when you turn a wheel, the tentacles wiggle around. I thought that was pretty neat. I'd highly recommend this for any Lego Avengers fanatics.",
