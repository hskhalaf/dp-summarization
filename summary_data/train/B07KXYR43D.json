      "text": "I do a lot of Nordic walking on sidewalks and other paved surfaces, and my other trekking poles - also Black Diamond, and great for the trails - were producing so much vibration that my wrists and even thumb were beginning to hurt. The Pro Shock Trekking Pole has a sort of air cushion at the first joint of the pole that works beautifully to prevent the vibrations from traveling up the shaft and into your hands and arms. Highly recommended!",

It could fail. They should put their tried and true locking mechanism on both parts of the pole-it doesn't save much time!",

      "text": "The older version of these poles had the upper and lower section Flick-locks so you could adjust the upper and lower sections.

Well, I am 5 foot 7 and these are way too long for me when the top is fully collapsed and I am climbing uphill on steep terrain. Very disappointing design.",
