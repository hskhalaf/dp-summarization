Dual SIM means I'm virtually guaranteed voice coverage wherever I go but I must admit I've hardly used the second SIM and could get by without it. Picture quality and speed of processing much better than the g5 was. Battery life good. USB-C a great improvement.

I rest my case.",

Also, 64GB storage for \u00a3200. Amazing!",

Having to consult help pages and relying on Android/Google AI, you're not sure of the implications of all your choices. Overall, incredible value for money.
