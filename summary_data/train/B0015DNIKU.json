We've bought a couple other Canon cameras this purchasing this one including a very nice SLR. This little camera remains my favorite. It's small and fits in my pocket which makes it the perfect vacation camera. It's super easy to use so if you ask someone to take your picture it's not a problem. It also has been very durable. Plus the thing takes great pictures. Granted not as nice as our SLR but that won't fit in my pants pocket either!",

      "text": "Nice little camera. Takes decent pictures. But the flash is anemic (don't use it for subjects more than 8 feet away) and doesn't like to be turned off. In fact, there doesn't appear to be a way to keep the flash off when using the camera in automatic mode. Each time you turn the camera on, it defaults to auto-flash (which usually produces poorly exposes pictures), so unless you remember to manually turn the flash off each time, you'll waste battery and get bad pix. The only way to override this is to set the camera to manual mode, where the flash-off setting will remain fixed until you turn the flash on. Really annoying. Otherwise, a very nice camera.",

He has found it mostly intuitive to use and hasn't really found anything yet that he doesn't like about it. He really likes the fast response between pressing the button and taking the photo as we also own an older Sony that has a moment's delay that he finds annoying to use. He also likes the compact battery recharger. Perhaps best of all, the quality of photos he has taken so far has exceeded his expectations. As for me, I think the camera was a great price from Amazon at $159.00.",

I compared the quality of images (including low light conditions) with SD880 and G9, and surprisingly the SD770 did pretty good! (And they were much much better than Nikon Coolpix S550). The size, although small, might not be very convenient to take pictures sometimes (Need to get used to it). Overall, 5 *'s from me.",

Takes great pictures, is fast and responsive (for a compact, not as fast as a DSLR), the screen is bright, and videos are surprisingly good. No complaints. For the price we paid ($144 on a gold box special) this was a GREAT buy. No \"cons\" or complaints.",

A few differences are the 10MP vs 8MP, the slight size/weight drop of the 770, the color schemes of the 1100, and more importantly, the better battery life on the 770. If the price difference is still negligible here on amazon I'd say you can't go wrong with the 770.",

The features are amazing and include a function button, a grid if desired, histogram, IS throughout all modes - not just a designated mode as I've seen on other models, plus many more. The picture quality is excellent for this type of camera. Battery charges quickly and it turns on very quickly. Well worth the price!!!",

    "title": "Canon PowerShot SD770IS 10MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black)",
    "description": "Color:BlackCanon 2600b001 10.0 megapixel powershot sd770is (black)10.0 megapixel digital elph; 2.5\" purecolor lcd ii screen for bright, accurate color with great viewing from a wide range of angles; packed with a powerful 3x optical zoom lens & optical image stabilizer to reduce blurry images; improved face detection technology sets the focus, exposure, flash & white balance automatically, allowing greater freedom of shooting before, during & after taking the image; motion detection technology automatically detects subject movement & optimizes exposure control & iso settings to reduce image blur; digic iii image processor for superior image quality & improved functionality; print/share button for easy direct printing & downloading; features id photo print & movie print with select pixma photo printers & selphy compact photo printers;black.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n Instantly recognizable, the classic \"Box & Circle\" ELPH design lives on in the PowerShot SD770 IS Digital ELPH. This sleek, slim head-turner is the perfect everyday camera. High-end specifications include 10.0-megapixel resolution and a 3x optical zoom lens. Spectacular images are easy to create thanks to advanced Canon technologies like Face Detection and Motion Detection Technologies that eliminate blur. \n\nPowerShot SD770IS Highlights \n\n\n\n1x zoom/3x zoom 3x optical zoom and Optical Image Stabilizer The PowerShot SD770 IS Digital ELPH\u2019s 3x optical zoom is a clear winner when it comes to getting up close and personal. And Canon\u2019s invaluable Optical Image Stabilizer reduces the blur of camera movement, even in tricky low light situations. \n\n2.5-inch PureColor LCD II screen for bright, accurate color The PowerShot SD770 IS Digital ELPH gives you a large 2.5-inch LCD screen for excellent control when framing your shots. Canon\u2019s PureColor LCD II offers more spectacular color, resolution and contrast even when viewed at an angle (compared to PureColor LCD). The screen is highly durable and easy to see in any light with a scratch-resistant, anti-reflective coating. It also features Night Display for easy viewing in low light -- a perfect feature for gathering friends and family around to see your images. \n\nMotion Detection Technology automatically detects subject movement and optimizes exposure control Life doesn\u2019t stand still for picture-taking. That\u2019s why Canon included its advanced Motion Detection Technology in the PowerShot SD770 IS Digital ELPH. This sophisticated feature works in the background to instantly evaluate how fast your subject is moving. Then it automatically selects and sets the optimal exposure and ISO settings to keep everything looking sharp and clear. When you need higher ISOs for action-stopping shutter speeds, Motion Detection Technology provides it. But when no movement is detected, it allows lower ISOs for excellent color and detail. So whether you\u2019re shooting a bride walking down the aisle, a ballet recital or even a child\u2019s soccer game, you can relax and shoot with confidence knowing you\u2019ve got the picture you intended. \n\nWith Canon's Face Detection WB (right), skin tones are not affected by overall lighting Improved Face Detection Technology sets the focus, exposure, flash and white balance automatically Canon's powerful Face Detection Technology delivers even better results with the new SD770 IS Digital ELPH. The Face Detection Technology continues to recognize faces in a scene, and concentrate exposure (daylight or flash) and focus upon them. But the SD770 IS Digital ELPH adds more: Face Detection WB means the camera concentrates upon faces when calculating white balance for the best possible skin tones. Face Select and Track lets the SD770 IS Digital ELPH user highlight one face among several in a scene, and the camera concentrates on that person, even as they move around the scene. Face Detection Technology is a powerful contributing factor in Canon's new Motion Detection Technology. \n\nDIGIC III Image Processor for superior image quality and improved functionality With DIGIC III, your images boast superior quality, the camera operates at top efficiency and battery life is enhanced. What\u2019s more, DIGIC III enables Canon\u2019s Face Detection Technology and Red-eye Correction to give you better, more true-to-life people shots. Simply press the Shutter Button halfway down, and the camera automatically pinpoints the faces in the scene and chooses the ideal focus point. The camera controls exposure settings and flash to keep every face looking bright and natural. Red-eye Correction can be handled in-camera, in two ways. The entirely new Red-eye Correction during shooting uses the Face Detection Technology to recognize and remove red-eye from flash images as they're taken, before the file is written to the memory card. It's also possible to correct red-eye during image playback, using simple settings in the SD770 IS Digital ELPH's menu. \n\niSAPS Technology is an entirely original scene-recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos, iSAPS works with the fast DIGIC III Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy, as well as exposure and white balance. \n\nRed-eye Correction provides three options for removing red-eye from subjects in flash pictures. \n1) The new Red-eye Correction during shooting actually identifies and corrects red-eye in human subjects as pictures are taken.\n2) The SD770 IS Digital ELPH can be set to automatically detect and correct red-eye during image playback.\n3) The user can manually locate any red eyes in a scene during image playback on the LCD screen, and command the camera to remove them. \n\nPrint/Share Button for easy direct printing and downloading The PowerShot SD770 IS Digital ELPH's Print/Share button makes direct printing easier than ever. Simply connect the SD770 IS Digital ELPH to a Canon PIXMA photo printer or SELPHY compact photo printer or any PictBridge compatible photo printer, press the lighted Print/Share button and print! Also use the Print/Share button to transfer images to a computer (Windows and Macintosh). \n\nPrint your own ID photos in 28 different sizes or use the Movie Print function to output multiple stills from a recorded movie on a single sheet with a Canon SELPHY compact photo printer.",
