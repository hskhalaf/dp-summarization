It\u2019s made for 1-3 (4 at the most if you have smaller than average children). My recommendation is to not bother purchasing as it\u2019s a waste of money.",

The seat cushions are a little squished from side to side to get it to fit. One cushions Velcro straps on the back is actually too big so the cushion is moving, the other cushion Velcro strap fit perfectly. Really awful quality of a product and I will NOT recommend this to anyone. (Having issues uploading more photos:sorry)",

It\u2019s lightweight enough to move with one hand but sturdy enough to not blow away in heavy wind & not tip when kids are playing. Can\u2019t really recommend unless it was a foot longer at least. There\u2019s no finish on it so can splinter & the cup holder edges can definitely scrape the skin.",

The wood itself is a strong, hardwood not cheap pine. The pre-drilled holes match up almost perfectly which led to frustration free assembly. A tip is to use wood glue when screwing pieces together, I've done this in the past with wooden furniture like this and the end result is much better, no twisting or distorting and the thing holds up very well outdoors for years when you do this.",

It's very well made, but did require quite a bit of assembly. Light enought to take in and out of house depending on the weather. Fabric is a great quality. Just wish they had other color options. He actually likes it enough to climb up in and sit in it himself. Everyone comments on how cool it is and I hope he enjoys it for a few years. Now we just need one for the grown ups.... :)",
