      "text": "I always loved Pioneer products. They are quality products and a very respectable manufacturer. A couple of issues with this one. First, the bluetooth only works when it feels like it even after firmware update. Secondly, a lot of times, it seems the unit doesn't recognize the fact that i have answered the call and keeps beeping which forces me to hang up and call back. It also feels slightly cheap and plastic. Usb works like a charm, aux is sweet and bluetooth audio works well, when it decides to find the phone.",

I installed it in less than an hour and did the basic setup, it runs smoothly. Whenever I turn my ignition on the radio detects my iPhone and connects automatically. If I don't have my iTunes on it will open it for me and play my music, I never have to touch my phone at all. I have the Bluetooth mic under my steering wheel and wired through the interior access ports.",

There is an issue with the antenna ground, Google it to make sure harness is connected correctly, otherwise radio will under perform. Connect it correctly and it will work extremely well. This has to do with antenna boosters on modern cars. Be careful to not cut your fingers, metal can be sharp with all items like this. Veridad out",

Installed with JBL GX600C in the front and a couple polk 6.5 inch in the rear. Nice and loud, no distortion. Highly recommended. Bluetooth is fantastic and works exactly as you expect. The hands free calling is very nice. The provided microphone is not the best but it works. You could easily upgrade that part as it's just plugged into a mono 3.5mm jack in the back of the stereo. I'd recommend a shotgun or directional mic to prevent ambient noise pickup or maybe just a higher quality mic would work.",

The original sound system was the \"audiophile\" package from Ford so it has two sub woofers on the rear deck. Sound produced through the Pioneer head unit is clear and bass adjustment gives a great bottom end. The only area where I was disappointed is the CD player. While I use an iPod often, occasionally I listen to CDs and especially during set up of the unit. I went over a couple of what I consider mild bumps and the disc skipped! I was shocked, I've never had a CD skip in a head unit on mild road bumps before. Otherwise a good value.",

I like how you can change the display colors so that I can match the color on the rest of buttons and displays in my truck. Radio reception is good, audio quality is good as well. Bluetooth takes a bit of time to learn. But overall it's all pretty simple to operate even if you didn't read the manual. The only issue I had, if that, is the instructions didn't have color coded wiring instructions. But I've installed dozens of radios in the past so I know already where everything goes.",

The light shows are nice but a bit gimmicky to me. The one thing that I don't like with this unit is that it has no dedicated mode buttons, so you'll find yourself pushing one single button to bet from radio to Bluetooth audio to pandora and so on. Something else that's a bit annoying is also the time between pushing a button and the unit actually responding. Kind of reminds me of dial up internet, it works but its slow.",

Well now that my whole dash is torn apart and everything is ready to go the product doesn't work at all. Plugged in old radio and it works so i know its this POS. Spend a little extra money and buy something that the manufacture actually test their products. Could me just my luck tho I guess.",

      "text": "The radio functions work fine, but the blue tooth hands free part is terrible, it works at best half the time, and there seems to be no rhyme or reason to when it works. I would not by this unit again nor recommend it! If your just looking for a radio there are less expensive units with the same functions, and if you are looking for a unit that will allow you to legally take calls while driving this will just frustrate you. And for reference have one phone synced to this unit, one, and it still is super glitchy. I personally am steering clear of Pioneer after my experience with this radio.",
