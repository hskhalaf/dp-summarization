I typically have to change them once ever couple of days (I keep forgetting to turn it off). That is a huge bother and expense! That's on average 2 AAA Batteries a work week. Still though for the price this is an awesome headset!",

The sounds quality through them is also really good. Only problem is that the buttons on the side are really small so I tend to have to take them off to use any of them or I don't know what I am hitting. Love the fact that even if the battery dies I can still listen to music through them. Great headphones.",

I wore it for the entire length of the flight without any discomfort. Their airplane adapter works too.

If that little plastic snaps (and it does very easily), the headphone pops out -- and the phones thus are unusable. For the price paid, I would have expected a much more robust, lasting product.

      "text": "Got this for my college-age daughter. She wanted noise-canceling headphones so that she could study in her noisy apartment instead of studying at the library. These may be good for listening to music, but failed at noise-canceling. I couldn't even tell when they were turned on. I had better results putting my fingers in my ears. I bought these because they were less expensive than another well-know brand, but I had to return these and buy the other brand anyway. These did come with a nice traveling case, though.",

      "text": "This is more of a review of Amazon than of the MDR-NC200D headphones, which I have not used and will be returning. Amazon advertises these headphones with \"See a newer model of this item\" alongside the listing for the Sony MDR-NC60, which are evidently discontinued. The MDR-NC200Ds are NOT a replacment for the MDR-NC60s, which are over-the-ear headphones. These are ON-the-ear headphones, which are nowhere near as effective are reducing ambient noise. You can't tell this (at least I couldn't) by looking at the pictures. I bought these because I have the MDR-NC60s, love them, and wanted an additional set. I trusted Amazon, and in this case that was a mistake. Hopefully they'll make returning them to J&R Music easy.",
