I am very, VERY disappointed and if it did not cost so much to ship back, I would have. Won't be buying any butters from here again. Clearly, the Best By date is a JOKE!!!",

On that note you could probably also use it to style your hair, as it sets pretty nicely. I worry because I have seen some claims that this product actually isn't fair trade.

      "text": "I just received Sky Organics Shea Butter this evening and was pleasantly surprised by the scent. Having tried other shea butter that smelled rancid, I found this one has a woodsy smell, which I really like. I've only applied it once so far and it seems to moisturize well. My palms are cracked from playing an African drum and I think this will work well to heal them. I would recommend it.",

Also it it difficult to spread, but I can't wait to get this off of me.",

I used to like sky organics product I once tried the coconut oil however, I\u2019m not trying to shop again form sky organic after my bad experience with the very bad quality of sealing !! I feel like I wasted my money !!",

It feels oily and greasy and acts like coconut oil. It seems to be making my skin break out too. Not sure what I\u2019m going to do with two jars of this stuff now. It\u2019s also kinda smelly, but that\u2019s what shea butter smells like.",

I've purchased other brands before, and not only did they not have as good of a texture, but they also had an unpleasant scent, even while being \"unscented\". This shea butter does not have that. It has a natural, very light, nutty smell. I will absolutely purchase this again.",
