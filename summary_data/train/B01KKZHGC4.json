The tingle-action of the bubbles really make it feel like the product is getting in there and doing its job. When I wiped it off, I tested it with a cotton pad and I could actually see how much it cleaned from my skin. So far this product is great!",

My skin is a little sensitive and I did find the mask started to burn (just a little) after about 10 minutes but again, my skin is a little dry and sensitive from the long winter. I think this mask will be amazing in the summer, though.",

It did not do anything for my pores or redness/inflammation. Instead it left my skin feeling stripped, which is common when I do purifying masks, since I have dry/sensitive skin, but other masks at least do something. However, it is not irritating and it is kind of entertaining to see the bubble foaming. This mask probably would be better for people with oily or combination skin, and whenever you want a fun, quick mask to do at sleepovers.",

Only reason I didn\u2019t give it 5 stars is because I don\u2019t care for how it dispenses. Whole top pushes down and comes out in the center of it. Seems like I use more than I would need and then I end up having to wipe off any excess so it won\u2019t gum up the top. Otherwise another great product from e.l.f at a great price.",

Two, the application was patchy at times- could have been operator error there. And three, it wasn\u2019t very easy to wash off- It left a bit of a gel coating.",

I have bought the whole Elf line and I highly suggest their moisturizer after this mask. The packaging is awkward but I am sure it\u2019s due to the fact that this liquid reacts to water and oxygen.
