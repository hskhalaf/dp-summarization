      "text": "First, the positives...I ordered the red storage bench and it looks very much as pictured -- the faux leather is a nice deep red, and not cheap looking. It was in good shape. But, the dimensions of the bench are completely inaccurate from what is included in the product description. It was off by more than two inches in height, and smaller in width as well. Since it was so much smaller, it did not cover the part of the wall we intended to use it for. Amazon needs to update the description to accurately reflect the item.",

I like this because the top is heavy. - The overall weight is good. Meaning it stays in place and doesn't slide around when you bump it as you walk past.",

I'm so glad I did because the legs are so stable and line up perfectly. This bench is exactly what I wanted and fits 3 bed sheets with 4 pillow cases per set and I also keep my 2 decorative pillow in it. It's comfortable to sit on and fits nicely at the foot of my queen size bed. I love that the top doesn't need to be held up when putting things inside and that it doesn't slam down when closing it.",

I plan to force another coat to fit inside it as well. I wanted a storage bench for this reason. It definitely meets my needs! We don't have a coat closet. +Lid lifts easily and stays open!

I have a family member that had to put their dog down after it broke it's back jumping down off of a high bed. The bench is working perfectly for my dog I lay a towel over the top to prevent the tufted top from getting dirty, and I now have the extra storage as a bonus.",

      "text": "Storage: This ottoman is perfect to store my son's many toys at a moments notice. We can fit his tractors, golf ball set, footballs, tool set, popcorn popper, small barn, and more into this ottoman. Helps keep our living room looking clean! Function: It also opens and closes slowly which makes it safe and easy for my son (21 months) to access. High quality, durable fabric and hardware! Color: The color is true to the picture on Amazon. There was a lot of time spent reviewing and debating over the perfect ottoman for our small, rectangular shaped living room that would be classy and functional. This ottoman met our expectations and we are very pleased with this purchase!",
