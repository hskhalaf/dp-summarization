The self propelling triggers are very responsive and you DO have to pay attention as this mower will get up and go.",

I've gone over heavy roots and even big rocks (accidentally) and the blades are still intact. This thing will suck up pine cones, sticks and heavy leaves and mulch like a pro. We got a ride on mower but I decided to keep this because of its dependability and strength.",

Loved it. then I cleaned it using the Hose Connector, again Great, so Now I go to Put it away and the Handle is too long. and it won't Collapse either, I have to Completely Remove the Bolts to fold it or take out the \"T\" Bolts to remove the Entire Handle from the Mower to store it, this is a Big Issue for Me.",

    "title": "Troy-Bilt TB330 163cc 21-inch 3-in-1 Rear Wheel Drive Self-Propelled Lawnmower",
    "description": "Troy-Bilt can help you comfortably accomplish your lawn mowing jobs this season. The TB330 self-propelled RWD lawn mower is powered by an easy-starting 163cc OHV 725ex Briggs & Stratton engine with ReadyStart technology for added ease. The single lever variable speed drive control is equipped with four top speed settings for individualized comfort and control. This rear wheel drive mower is equipped with a 21-inch TriAction complete cutting system: a rake bumper to lift grass upright, a specially designed blade for a finer mulch, and a symmetrical deck for superior grass flow, eliminating clumping or patches in your lawn. The TB330 is equipped with integrated deck wash and the ReadyStart system is a mechanism that automatically senses engine temperature and adjusts the air/fuel mixture to suit conditions perfectly. No hassles, no guesswork, no worries: To start, just pull the cord once for power - the ReadyStart starting system will do the rest. The 1.09-quart fuel tank and 1.9 standard bushel capacity grass bag mean it's unlikely you'll have to waste time filling up or emptying the TB330 mid-mow. The TB330 features 8-inch front and 8-inch rear wheels for easy maneuverability in uneven terrain. The single-lever deck height adjustment allows for six different grass height settings, from 1.25-inches to 3.75-inches, meeting all your length requirements. Troy-Bilt's TB330 is backed by a 3-year limited warranty.",
