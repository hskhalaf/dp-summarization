      "text": "I am a beginner in flying drones, and this was actually my first one. It is extremely easy to set up and more importantly it is easy to fly it. Of course the multiple youtube reviews helped but the learning curve is very fast. The (4K) video surprised me, it is beautiful. I am amazed at the stability of the drone in the air, even when there is a moderate wind. This translates in the video quality. The drone is well built and seems very sturdy. I strongly recommend it.",

      "text": "There are a lot of things to love about the Mavic Air and there are some quirks that you just have to figure out. I found that the drone has issues with connection to the remote when it doesn\u2019t have an SD card installed or if the onboard 8Gb of memory is not frequently cleared. Follow me mode is somewhat flakey and I\u2019ll have to work with it some more to find the optimal way to use it. Overall it is a fun drone with an excellent camera.",

Ive purchased a few bundles from them including the sony without complaint a7II. I opened the packages and attempted to unzip the bag only to have the zip come apart immediately. I'd rather not have a bag added than you add one and its crap. The foam to hold the drone is the only good thing about this bag. Thats y i gave a 3",

He loves photography, he has a professional camera and a go pro and still thinks he needed this. So I guess it\u2019s worth it. He said it is. First time he flew the drone inside the house smh and didn\u2019t activate an option that it has like to avoid walls and big objects. So REMEMBER to activate it. After that, he flew it outside. It went great!!",

It's a durable little unit that should give years of use. Almost perfect.",

Set in a triangular formation, gimbal dampeners help create even steadier shots. 32 MP Sphere PanoramasIn addition to Horizontal, Vertical, and 180 degrees panoramas, the Mavic Air stitches 25 photos together in just eight seconds to create crystal-clear 32 MP Sphere panoramas.
