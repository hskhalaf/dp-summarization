      "text": "I am amazed by the quality of the sound. I have owned a few different kinds of headphones, but these are by far the best. There are so many background pieces in songs that I have never heard that I can now hear with these Sennheisers. The quality is also really nice- all aluminum frame. It does have a non-detachable cable, but as long as you're careful it shouldn't be a problem. In addition, the clamping force is pretty strong coming out of the box, so I would personally advise carefully placing the headphones over something to stretch it out to avoid any earaches.",

As someone who regularly keeps a shaved head- these two points are a deal breaker as they just aren't comfortable for anything over 10 minutes or so.",
