I ordered the Medium size, I wear a 32 waist in jeans, the belt is the perfect size, allowing me enough room to wear a coat and still buckle. I looked at lots of bags, this is the nicest one I found in this price group. I'm happy!",

He has been building custom homes for over 20 years and I knew that buying a guy some new bags is kind of like picking out shoes someone will like. They have to be comfortable and functional and they have to have all the right pockets so tools are easy to grab. So far he has nothing but good things to say about these bags and they still look great. Very durable.",

      "text": "This is a much higher quality belt than you wou of get at home depot or Menards. Not quite occidental leather quality but really a good, quality framing rig. Thick fabric and heavy stitching have my confidence that this will last a few years. I've had enough big store bags to know that they aren't worth the constant replacement and sub-par performance even for the cheap price tag. Bottom line, these bags will save me money in the long run and they are laid out perfect for this full time framer!",

For those who left reviews saying it was big and bulky, I don't think so. It's not as slim as broken in leather pouches, but it's no where near as bulky as some occidental bags either. I say it's somewhere in between. I also ordered it with the trade gear suspenders which are also comfortable and adjust perfectly. I'm very happy with this purchase because I've been searching for a comfortable setup for some time.",
