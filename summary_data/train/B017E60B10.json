It is also awkward to use the string closure as it never tightens enough and I practically have to lay the mower back on its handle to get to it. Not particularly sold on the weatherproof claim either; I still find water puddles in bolt holes and on the top of the deck after a rain, but it's better than no cover, so I'll continue using until it needs replacing. I would suggest to the manufacturer to change the single string pull design to two pulls as it would make fitting this generic sized cover to a wider variety of mowers much easier.",

      "text": "Delivery was prompt, no complaints there! The cover seems to be of good construction and my guess is it will last longer than the Craftsman cover I got previously. Problem here is it takes time to know how it will stand up to the elements. I'll provide an update in a few years... The cover fits well, room to spare! I found it somewhat difficult to cinch the draw-string and getting it to stay fixed around the rear wheels of the mower. I've only used it once and suspect over time I'll figure out a solution. In my opinion a round string would work better than the flat one provided.",
