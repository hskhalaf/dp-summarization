I had to use a header for the rail because the door headers and studs were not going to line up. Luckily there was a house in our neighborhood being built was the same plan so I was able to see the inside layout to make the final decision. The door is very large at 42\" wide and 100\" tall so needed the extra support anyway plus I think the header finishes the look we were going for.",

Just pay attention as you thread your bolt in. You will not need it torqued down like crazy. Just my 2 cents If you're using a header board (which I did not need) you prob won't have any issues My door dimensions were 9' 5\" x 43.5\" Great hardware kit 5 stars.",

I just installed my second 8 foot barn door kit, and I still give this 5 star, but one recommendation for mounting your door is when you drill the holes for the door you are mounting, drill the holes larger than the bolt being used, and drill a small hole in between the bolts on the roller to secure a set screw. The reason is, like in my case, the door will be sliding closed onto a wall, and not all walls are perfectly plumb, so by drilling the holes larger, it will give you some adjustment to your door, and the set screw will secure your door when you tighten it down.",

My door is over 100lbs and it holds it no problem. My studs weren't standard distance apart so I just used a header board and it worked great. I would definitely recommend.",

My barn door was made locally and a bit smaller than most doors, so I had to recalculate some vertical distances for the rail height and roller height on the door itself. It looks great!",

Installation was a breeze, and the door rolls smoothly and quietly. Good, strong design with heavy duty rail and rollers. They look great. I have a wide door and subsequently realized I needed a rail connector so I contacted Wes from Industrial by Design (via email), who promptly sent me the part at no charge.

My husband made a mirror barn door for our master bath walk-in closet. The door was massive, 48\" x 84\". I was afraid that the hardware would not be able to stand the weight of this door, but I was wrong. I highly recommend Industrial by Design barn door hardware. It's inexpensive compare to what others are offering but really solid. Great buy!",

Everything down to the nylon spacers to add to the top of the door to prevent the rollers from popping off the track gives this set an A+ in my book. The video link was very helpful in planning the install. Good work guys!",
