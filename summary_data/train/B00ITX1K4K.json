Concentrate the \"seed\" stuff into a small pile in the center of the growing tub and you get a dramatic, spiky, crystal cluster that looks awesome.",

      "text": "it was really easy to grow these crystals in the fact that you grow them and then can display them in the same container is fantastic. Are crystals were a big success and my children have them on display 2 years after we ordered our first box. The colors have diminished in the blue crystals we made but my children really enjoy looking at them and the different shapes they formed. One of them grew so large that it grew outside of the liquid and started expanding like a mushroom cloud, which my children thought was fantastic. I highly recommend this as an easy kit for children around age 8 and above to be able to do on their own.",

When the crystal starts growing up the side of the container, be sure to put the paper circle around the top because it will spill out and make a mess of whatever it's sitting on. Other than that, we didn't have much of a mess at all.",

      "text": "I was Super excited to do this project with my kids. Albeit they were on the younger end of the recommended ages, they still had a good time. The crystals grew great and it was so fun watching them grow! The two things I\u2019m bummed about: is that we got two blue color packets, instead of one red and one blue, so our color choice was limited. But not a big deal. But the containers we are supposed to store them in are so hard to get together that the crystals ended up breaking. Still a great science gift, and i have 2 boys, so they would have broken anyways.",

Our home is a little colder than the directions recommend, so it took a few more days to grow, but we were not disappointed by the results. My son (7) absolutely loves his new crystal! He can't wait to make more. We love that the kit has multiple crystals to make so it's not a \"one and done\" kit. It also gives you multiple options for colors. The directions are clear and easy to follow. I would definitely recommend this kit!",

My son was already disappointed and we didn\u2019t want to make him wait for more time to use it. So we used the smaller containers. I advise to check the package before gift wrapping because there a huge possibility something will be broken inside. My son was little disappointed when his gift was partially shattered. I believe the manufacturer could improve packaging or the container resistance to avoid that problem.",
