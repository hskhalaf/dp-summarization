Its durability, waterproofing, and stability made its ultra-expensive price all worth it. Regardless of how astonishing it appears to be, it still has a few mishaps. It was weighty and a bit suffocating. Overall, the Danner Crater Rim suits those seeking for a tough, adventure-ready backpacking boot who can overlook its weight. Also, it might be best to use in colder seasons.",

For a $300 pair of boots I expected more. The Asolo's that I replaced with these were over 6 years old and the seems are in better shape than these boots after 100's of more miles on them. Will not be buying Danner's again, which is sad since I wanted to buy American made boots. The pictures show the stitching failure and as you can see by the sole and rest of the boot, there is minimal use.",

If you need a medium width you should absolutely go with the wide width. You would really have to have a narrow foot to use what amazon lists as a D(M) width. Better yet go to danners website and then cross reference the width you really need back onto amazons website, you'll see amazon lists widths that danner doesn't make.",

A little longer than I would like but my heels are locked in place and they are wide enough so my little toe isn't squeezed.

Some are made in China, so please buy AMERICAN - and be sure to read the description closely to be sure that the boots you're investing your AMERICAN money in are MADE IN THE USA...! Very nice boot, the craftsmanship and overall quality are there. The fit is great, one thing is that this specific model does run small - I normally wear a size 12.5 to 13, but these fit perfectly in size 12.",

      "text": "Danner is supposed to be known for making high quality boots for which you pay a premium price. However, their Crater Rim 6\" GTX boot falls waaaaaay short of justifying the high purchase price Danner set for it. I was quite shocked at the inferior quality Danner used for the lacing D-rings, as well as the very thin material used for the boot's tongue. I wasted no time in packing the pair of Crater Rim GTX's I received and sent them back for a refund. Danner sure missed their usual high quality mark by a mile with this boot.",
