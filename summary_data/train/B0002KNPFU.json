The screens are a little thin and while it doesn't block light, it does provide complete privacy. Just make sure you bend it enough because if almost straight , it'll topple over. It's long enough that it almost blocks off my full-sized bed (in length). This was definitely worth the investment.",

The hinges on one section in the main one (that we use to block off part of a room for our pet rabbit) are a little stiff so it can be a pain to maneuver. Another hinge squeaks. Perfectly fine if you don't plan on constantly adjusting it. Very light weight. Easy to just pick up and move.",

I suppose there\u2019s a more diplomatic way of describing a cheaply made product, but I am rating these for the privacy they provide, and it does that well. So for that much, I\u2019m happy. I\u2019d be ecstatic if they sold for $20-30 less.",

Actually bought this to help shield computer area from sunlight glare (streaming through high windows in the morning.) Works perfectly, and looks beautiful in our living room. Will use this for many years to come.",

However, if you want something that is sturdy, this isn't it. I have to re-position the folds so it won't fall over every once in a while, and one time it fell over and the wood split on the edge. It still works but doesn't look as nice. Good as a privacy shade.",

Cheaper than anyone else I got such an excellent product bigguer(4 panels) and cheaper than all comoetitor. Thanks to fedex too. The divider looks so nice in my living room to hide my bf file cabinets. Buy it from this seller and amazon.",

If I were to see it in a local store, I'd be comfortable paying $30-$40...so with shipping added...the price is just right. Great buy for my need.",

We've had it for a long time now, and have no complaints. They're pretty and are easy to manage. Although, be very careful when placing them very close to windows. If it's two close, the molding corners can puncture holes if someone bumps against it.",
