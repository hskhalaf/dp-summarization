The Delta18-900L uses an old school belt drive but it works flawlessly and changes speeds easily. The LED light along with the dual lazer make the Drill Press very easy to use. The Drill Press Table is large and rotates 90 degrees if needed. The Drill Press depth adjustment is awesome and it has a long quill travel of up to six inches.
