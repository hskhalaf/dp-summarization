I would have liked some kind of self-cleaning brush or something to clean the brush because my daughter has long hair, and it gets tangled up in the brush. However, it does pick up a lot of the hair. I bought my mother-in-law a Shark, and it is just ok because of the pattern.",

      "text": "For the past few months, we have wondered why Neato seemed to have lost suction. After calling Neato robotics directly, we were connected with a very friendly Irishman named Dermot. Not only did he quickly diagnose and remedy the problem over the phone (the 5 year old's Beyblade was lodged in front of the intake area behind the brush), but he did so without treating us like idiots. He also helped me update the app which includes features I almost paid $100+ for previously. We purchased the Neato off a recommendation from a work friend who had researched (and used) a number of robotic vacuums. Our Neato is fantastic and the new features in the app make it a steal!",

I was pleasantly surprised that it was able to get over the 3/4\" lip in my doorways (makes a huge racket hobbling over it but who cares if I'm not home?). this guy runs everyday in my ~450 apartment and cleans the whole thing in one swoop, parks itself back in the dock, and I only have to empty it every ~3 days.",

Bedrooms are cleaned separately. The ability for the Botvac to correctly survey the room and clean it is astounding and was the reason why I returned the Roomba vacuum. I wasn't too keen on splurging $200 more for the D5 for a bigger battery and a spinning side brush. Battery life on the D3 is my biggest complaint and wish it could be upgraded but it can't. Ultimately that means it takes a bit longer to clean the house than the D5 would. All-in-all, a great performer.",

Despite missing those things, it cleans exceptionally well. I actually like the app better for the D3.
