The jugs balls are much more consistent. I'd say on average 8/10 are strikes. Pretty great machine for the money. Talked two other dad's into getting for their kids pretty easily once they saw some videos of my son using it. Here's the Jugs balls I got. Others may work similar styled as long as diameter is the same. This machine works off friction between two rubber spinning donuts just like a mini Jugs pitching machine.",

Unfortunately however, the machine stopped working after only 2 days of use. We attempted a battery switch and made no difference. Though this machine is not expensive, it should last longer.",
