I had owned this same model for several years before it stopped working for me (I believe there is a problem with the on/off switch connection). Before it stopped working these headphones were perfect, so I ordered the same model in May 2017. By September 2017 they stopped working (same problem, I think). It's too late for a refund from Amazon, and I haven't yet tried to contact Bose because they're an older model. I'm sick over this purchase because I loved my first pair and don't know how to replace them/find another brand that I like as much as these when they work.",

I sat through a 2 hour flight with a screaming baby behind me, an overly PDA couple beside me, and a loud snoring guy in front of me, but couldn't hear a thing with these on and music playing.

I listen to everything from dubstep, country, pop, rock, rap, house, trap, Norwegian death metal, country, to classical music and these headphones produce great sound for them all.",

Buyers should realize, though, that these are not designed for canceling human voices (so not a great help for coffee shops, say, or cubicle offices). NOTE: AMAZON-RECOMMENDED ACCESSORIES ARE ALREADY IN THE BOX! The headphones come with a carry case and separate 2-prong airplane adapter. For no clear reason, Amazon recommends that you buy these two accessories as part of a special bundle. I trusted them only to find that the box already included the accessories. Grrr. Guess who has to pay the postage to return the duplicate items that Amazon lured me into buying? Grrr again. Oh, and the recommended bundle is STILL shown. Pretty irritating.",

It came with a nice hardshell case to prevent damage when tossing them into a bag or briefcase. The battery life is excellent and I think I've only changed them 2x in the past year with considerable use! As a note - always keep a spare battery (AAA) on hand - if the battery dies you won't be able to use them.",

An added benefit that I didn't anticipate - wearing the headphones by themselves, without music, for noise canceling sanctuary of silence. Don't expect it to cancel out all noise completely. You will still hear high pitched noise. It will block out significantly, noise from outside your home (lawn mowers, screaming kids etc.), the rumbling of your refrigerator, air conditioner and other extraneous noises, and the ever complaining housemate, wife, mother etc. (just don't let them catch on ;)",

The hard part is remembering to turn them off when not in use. If I remember to turn them off, I can use them on long flights and for a LONG time. If I just leave them turned on for 24 hours straight, well, one teensy battery doesn't make it. But the fact they run on one teensy, easily transportable, readily found battery makes them light and convenient. (AAA). They are worth the space in the carry on, and few things are.",
