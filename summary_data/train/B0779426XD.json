This generation features a new, aggressive style and powerful performance. The large titanium club head is 460cc for maximum playability and confidence at address. An Ultralite titanium core strategically moves weight to the perimeter of the club head for more forgiveness as well as higher launch and greater control. TaylorMade also includes their revolutionary Speed Pocket to promote higher launch and less spin to increase distance.
