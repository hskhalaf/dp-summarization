These glasses I really liked the design and quality of them.

If you have a smaller size head they are great glasses.",

Until I put them on. Frame came warped one side being higher than the other. Put them on a flat surface and one side doesn't even touch the surface. It isn't damaged, it has to be a manufacturing defect. Possibly a one-off occurence so I am reordering hoping Carrera isn't a two-time dissapointment.",
