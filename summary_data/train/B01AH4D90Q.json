Also, being a person without hair...I did notice that not having any padding on the interior of the headband bothered me after an hour or two of use. Now have a pair of Bose .. .more expensive but so far a better buy.",

It has two layers on the head band, so it would still be usable if not for the load on top of my head of the heavy weight that give me head aches. It would be good if the head band was of better quality. And I am very careful with my things.",
