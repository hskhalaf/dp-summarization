The leg is a little big so if your table is narrow there might not be enough space to comfortably fit a keyboard, otherwise this is a great buy. Also the price is pretty low compared to same sized monitor of other brands. The speakers i haven't really used, but is a very nice touch considering the insanely low price, which makes this monitor the best choice for users on a budget. Would definitely look into getting another if I ever need to use dual monitor.",

The white looks just a tiny bit dull to my tastes, but nothing that gets in my way. Overall a great deal! One very important note: if you try to use a single-link DVI cable with it at full resolution, you'll get unstable, flashing pixels. Make sure you use a dual-link DVI cable (see pin diagrams on Wikipedia), which can handle the bandwidth required for this wide-screen monitor.",

Creates a real slick three monitor configuration. Setup was very easy, HDMI, DVI and VGA inputs. Monitors are lower powered LED which saves power consumption not to mention no noticeable heat coming from the monitors. Only con would be that the monitors are not height adjustment, even though they do have a tilt adjustment. Not an issue with me... Started with three monitors and not have nine monitors for use in both of my offices. Hope this review helps.",

No separate screws to mount the monitor to the stand, simple to set up and install. However, the ports are extremely inconvenient and the power and adjustment buttons are hidden, poorly lit and difficult to access. I needed a flashlight to see the ports and the vertical position they are in makes cord insertion a lot more difficult than it should be. Poor instruction manual.",

My only observation is that the setup buttons are not located on the screen frame, but on the center panel just above the speaker.

      "text": "Use of VGA cable on this HD screen will create a shadow effect on text (this occured on two monitors - same model). You will need to either use the HDMI cable the monitor comes with or purchase a DVI cable seperately, which will also provide the digital HD signal required to solve the shadow/blur effect. I'd have given the monitor 5 stars if it came with a DVI cable (I couldn't use the HDMI cable included with the monitor on my laptop docking station) - not sure why they include a VGA cable with the monitor since VGA only allows for an analog signal and makes the monitor's image appear much inferior to the monitor's design capacity.",

The replacement had a damaged screen even though the box was not damaged. The replacement for that one is here and working fine. Very bright and controls easy to use. Windows 7 and up allows you to scale the text up and is very clear. The LED backlight won't dim like older monitors with florescent backlight.",

This does not bother me, but some may get irritated by this. In addition, the fact that the power button is touch sensitive and close together with the other buttons requires your index finger aim to be precise. The button does light up once pressed. Other than that, there were no dead pixels and the screen display is absolutely stunning. Very happy so far.",

ViewSonic VX70 series SuperClear IPS monitors feature a frameless edge-to-edge glass faceplate with an ultra-slim bezel beneath the glass. With their sleek, eye-catching design, our elegant IPS monitors look as good as they perform.\n\n \n\n\n\nWHAT IS A LED MONITOR?\nThe term \"LED monitor\" generally refers to a monitor with a LCD panel and a LED backlight. A typical LCD monitor uses cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFL) as a light source to illuminate the LCD panel. In an LED backlit monitor, white LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) are used as the light source. Environmentally friendly LED backlights provide the following benefits: \n\n * About 40%* less power consumption compared to traditional CCFL monitor\n * 30,000,000:1 MEGA Dynamic Contrast Ratio \n * Environmentally friendly mercury-free backlight\n * Low EMI (Electro Magnetic Interference) \n * Slimmer design\n * Weight reduction\n\n \n\n\n\nSAVE CASH AND SAVE THE PLANET\nWith its mercury-free backlight and low energy consumption, the ENERGY STAR certified VX2770Smh-LED saves your electricity bill. The savings of LED can add up to thousands of dollars saved for large install bases, such as big corporate buildings or schools. The savings can be as dramatic as $20,000 in five years!\n\n \n\n\n\nSRGB COLOR CORRECTION TECHNOLOGY DELIVERS THE MOST ACCURATE COLOR PERFORMANCE AVAILABLE\nViewSonic LED monitors embedded sRGB color correction technology reproduce 100% sRGB rich color for color performance matching original input sources without decreasing or leveraging color quality. sRGB ensures all displayed images/videos are as natural as the original sources, displaying real color for captured camera and camcorder content.\n\n \n\n\n\nMEGA DYNAMIC CONTRAST RATIO\nOne of the great features of VX2770Smh-LED is its ability to dim the backlight completely for pure darkness during dark scenes, such as a night shot in a movie. Contrast ratios refer to the ratio of the brightest color to the darkest color. With traditional CCFL backlit displays, contrast ratios are limited to the fluorescent lamp\u2019s ability to dim, in order to reproduce darkness. However, with the LED backlight, each LED has the ability to completely shut-off allowing for a near infinite ratio of black to white contrast. The end result is true blacks that result in greater overall image quality.\n\n \n\n\n\nFULL HD 1080P RESOLUTION\nThe VX2770Smh-LED features a 27\" widescreen with 1920x1080 resolution is capable of displaying a native Full HD 1080p image. Today, devices that can display Full HD content output are getting more and more common. However, without a native Full HD display, you will not be able to experience the picture clarity and the details of the 1080p content you view.\n\n \n\n\n\nECO-MODE FOR UP TO 30%* ENERGY SAVINGS\nViewSonic\u2019s proprietary Eco-mode function comes standard with the VX2770Smh-LED. When you don\u2019t need all the power the VX2770Smh-LED has to offer, you have the option to reduce the monitor\u2019s brightness, save energy, save the planet and prolong the lamp life. You can select one of the \"Optimize\" or \"Conserve\" options and save up to 30% energy. Especially under low ambient light conditions, adjusting the brightness will improve visibility by reducing eye fatigue. Reducing brightness will also prolong the monitor\u2019s lamp life, improving your return on investment.\n\n \n\n\n\nPixel Performance 17\" / 19\"\n4:3 or Wide LCD\n\n20\"+ Wide LCD ISO9241-3:2008 Standard\n\n3 Bright\n3 Dark\n5 Total\n\n3 Bright\n3 Dark\n5 Total\n\nViewSonic Pixel Guarantee\n\n2 Bright\n2 Dark\n3 Total\n\n2 Bright\n2 Dark\n3 Total\n\nINDUSTRY-LEADING PIXEL PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE AND 3-YEAR LIMITED WARRANTY\nOne of the aspects that make ViewSonic a market leader in displays is its dedication to quality.
