I tried all suggestions, including turning off the phone and restarting. Nothing has worked and now the screen is mostly blank and when it does come on its mostly green. A screen replacement, to start, has been suggested by my local repairer. I believe the supplier of the phone should send me a replacement screen",

Despite low ambient temperatures I keep getting warnings during regular use that the phone is overheating and taking steps to cool itself. While on Skype or navigation, with no other apps open, the back gets really hot and the only way to really mitigate it is to open up the keyboard to let a bit of heat out. Apart from that it's everything and more than I wanted from it. The keyboard is brilliant and the performance overall is very good. I just hope it doesn't catch fire one day.",

Wi-Fi calling option was a crucial element in my choice and works really well. The Hub is as the Blackberry strength and all is customised but not as far as in the BB10 which was simply a world apart. Phone quality excellent and battery very good.",
