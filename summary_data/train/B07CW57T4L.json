The bottle has recently started dripping from where the lid screws on. Yes, I make sure it's on correctly and tightly. When drinking I end up with water dripped all over me. Very disappointing :(",

That was a big plus, as I have arthritis issues that make most bottles difficult to open. The size of the bottle is large enough for me to have plenty of water, but still comfortable to hold in my hand. The full length infusion rod holds a large amount of fruit, and helps to ensure that all of my water is nicely flavored. The hook on the side also makes it great to take along on a walk! I will definitely be buying these as gifts for my friends!!",

I typically just threw my fruit into the bottom of a large bottle and went about my day, this infuser is good sized and doesn't take up the entire bottle. I love ice cold drinks, and this works great with ice as well. Crushed ice works better, but wedge ice works too, just don't put too many in it. I've gotten many compliments on it as well. It's easy to clean and I don't need a special bottle brush to clean the inside. There aren't any extra straws or valves to clean either. Highly recommend this bottle, oh and the fact the company sends a water infuser recipe e-book, is GREAT!",

You\u2019re almost better off just adding fruit to your water bottle and not spending extra money for a container that goes in the center to hold your fruit.

Maybe if it was made out of glass instead of plastic it would be worth it....... anyways I will say I love the fact that the lid does not fall on your face when you go to drink from it. A definite plus but otherwise I\u2019d say save your money and buy something else. Not a terrible product, but in my opinion definitely overpriced.",

The chamber where the fruit goes is easy to clean but be careful not to poke at it too much as it can break. My only complaint is there is not enough room to add ice. So I compromise by adding shaved ice or freezing the bottle for an hour before taking out. Overall, this is the best bottle I have found.",

Please make available on the amazon app or iBooks. Also if there is some type of sleeve for installation that will work with bottle would be great. I use my bottle everyday and just the o e small improvement would make this the best infusion bottle.",

      "text": "I am continually trying to drink more water and this infusing water bottle makes it easier and more enjoyable. I love the infuser so that I can add my favorite fruits to flavor the water and I especially like that it's clear/see through so that I can see how much I'm drinking. It's a great motivator to keep me drinking water all day. I like the size and pop top opening. I look forward to using it each day and trying different infusing combinations. I would highly recommend it.",
