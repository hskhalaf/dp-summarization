I decided to test it by throwing every single Skyrim graphics mod I could find, fully expecting it to be choppy at best. There were NO hitches in performance whatsoever. It was beautiful. I think I may have cried a bit. Bottom line: Outperforms anything I've gotten my hands on, and it's not terribly expensive. AMD pumping out cheap graphics cards that do what they're supposed to, like always.",

I am running Linux Mint 17 Qiana and I had to search for a minor tweak for the HDMI audio because the audio was scratchy and distorted. The tweak required modifying two files: The file /etc/pulse/default.pa need one line modified. The line reading: load-module module-udev-detect needed to be modified to read: load-module module-udev-detect tsched=0 The file /etc/modprobe/alsa-base.conf needed the following line added to the end of the file: options snd-hda-intel vid=8086 pid=8ca0 snoop=0 The sound was flawless after those modifications and a reboot.",

If/when it works it is an amazing card for the money. However do not buy this thinking you will be lucky enough to get one that will last.

      "text": "I am thoroughly disappointed with my first Radeon card. Performance is alright, some modern games require pretty low graphics to play smoothly and I've had other issues that I suspect are related to the card. Linux support is abysmal; in fact, I was not successful in getting any of a number of distributions to run stable. Readers will have to take my word that I am computer software/hardware savvy. I will not boycott Radeon just yet but this card was an awful disappointment.",

Since i bought this card i have been experiencing tons of problems like black screen freezes, video flickering, BSOD that happens randomly. I took my PC to tech help and they haven`t seen anything like this before! Its not like the card is DOA, i can flawlessy run some benchmarks, but the drivers are completely messed up!! None of them works properly, and i have tried them all!! If you google 270X Problems you will see many guys with the same problem as i. If you don`t want to waste your money... Don`t buy this.",
