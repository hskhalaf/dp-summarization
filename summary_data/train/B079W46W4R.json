Unfortunately, I replaced my Britax Parkway SGL with the Britax Highpoint (after a car accident) and it is very difficult to get the seat belt tight around my daughter and the belt positioning clip is difficult to use. We did not have any issues with the Parkway SGL. Still love the safety, the look, and the comfort of the new Highpoint but more difficult to use.",

(Even with the starting weight 40lbs child) Definitely need a maturity of understanding when using a lap belt booster.",

Knowing how crazy some people are driving and seeing what could happen to the car in these accidents, I feel my 9,5 y.o. is much safer in high back booster sear. He is average 9 y.o. and this seat works perfectly for him! He takes high back booster seat over any booster because of comfort level. Now, I am not so sure about cup holders on this seat, we used to Pioneer and Frontier where it's not removable and larger, but it serves the purpose. Highly recommend this seat!",
