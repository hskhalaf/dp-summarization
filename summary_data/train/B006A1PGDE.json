I'm very disappointed in this product and now regret getting 2 of them. But it's still nice to have a good blanket in the car during winter here in Minnesota. I did not contact the seller to tell them of my disappointment because it had been almost 2 months before I used one for the first time. I should have checked it out when I first got them. The 2nd blanket is still in the package and may work as intended... I don't know yet.",

I think what little heat was being generated was immediately wiped out by the cold air and without any temperature control it wasn\u2019t producing enough heat.
