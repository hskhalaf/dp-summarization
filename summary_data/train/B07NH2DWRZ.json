      "text": "Our kids school used to provide snacks but with Covid they are now asking that the kids bring their own. They don't have room in their lunch boxes for AM and PM snacks so I purchased these. They are GREAT! Easy to clean, has a little handle so on days they don't bring backpacks to school they can just put them on their wrist to bring into their classroom. I would for sure recommend! Really cute prints too!",

It was disappointing because the walls of the pouch are very thin, and did little to keep these items cold. It also is completely flat. If you put items in that have thickness, it takes up a lot of the length and width of the pack.",
