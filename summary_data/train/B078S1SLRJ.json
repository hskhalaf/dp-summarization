I really did love the bag so I was going to order another one when I came across this kea baby brand that looked similar and decided to give it a try. I love the larger size and extra pockets that this bag has. Can easily fit everything I need for my three-year-old and baby plus I love the backpack style! I am very pleased with this purchase and will update with time once I see how this bag holds up to daily use.",

It is light weight and can hold a ton of stuff. My old backpack diaper bag fit way less in it and was much more bulky. I like the color and design and so far it has held up great. The zippers do need to be used a couple of times before they run smoother but that is no biggy. I think it's a great bag and at a great price! Would recommend.",

I am super pleased with the quality of the material and zippers, the sturdiness of it, and the fact that it makes everything very easy to find and keep organized.

If your item is not up top you can unzip and get tp your item on the middle or bottom of the diaper bag through this zipper pocket! which is a BIG plus for a diaper bag :) highly recommend it i use it for my two and one year old combined and still have some space left!",

      "text": "I love how much space this diaper bag has. I have another bag that looks very similiar that I've been using for a few months and I like this one so much more! It's comfortable to wear, the middle storage space holds a lot of things without the bag feeling bulky. It really helps the weight distribute evenly. My only concern is that some of the zippers did arrive off track but once I used the zippers for the first time, the problem seemed to resolve. I will keep an eye on their durability.",

With KeaBabies he wears comfortably and it fits the blanket plus has pockets for my phone and wallet (cause we won\u2019t carry purses anymore). #2) Fabric is durable and so is the inside fabric with tons of pockets. #3) Back pocket access for the bottom of the bag and there is a metal rim to help it not fold down on you.",
