It grinds well when it actually grabs the peppercorns, but 90% of the time it takes 10-15 turns of nothing and then a few good turns of pepper are ground, then nothing again. It does this no matter the coarseness setting or orientation of the grinder, even with the peppercorns that came with it! I'm not sure if I got a lemon on this one, but I'll be going back to my reliable Kuhn grinder.",

The grinder sits on the part you turn, so you're not left with pepper on the table or counter. The cap for refilling removes easily and covers a fairly large opening for easy filling.

The force to turn the grinder goes to near zero and looking at the inside, it appears the grinder has difficulty letting new peppercorns drop into the burr grinder. The throat is narrow. I even tried just a few peppercorns, thinking they mighy be jamming. Same result. Scrambled eggs would be tolerable. A Sunday roast will be annoying. Grinding pepper for a BBQ rub is awful. Maybe nobody actually used it to grind pepper before hitting the go button. The cap seems hard to remove for refills. I'll be buying another peppermill at some point in time.",

      "text": "Others have noted the feature that sets this pepper mill apart: You turn it upside down to grind, so that when you return it to its upright position, whatever loose bits of pepper remain don't end up on the table but remain on the top of the peppermill. It has a solid feel. I have tested all the gradations from fine to coarse and it really works. You won't get the fine and uniformly ground pepper that comes ready-ground from the market but one assumes you're not looking for that in a grind-your-own device.",
