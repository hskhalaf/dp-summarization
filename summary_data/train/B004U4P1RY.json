They look as though they'd be soft, and therefore easy to chew, but they are harder than even normal crunchy cat food or treats! My cat used to love these because they were soft and manageable, but it's really unfortunate that something has changed and now he can no longer chew them at all. Having a powder and gel formula doesn't help because he doesn't like those types at all (tried both of those versions) so until this problem is fixed, they are not something I'd buy again because they are no where near edible in their current rock hard state :(",

One cat would eat them if only if I cut them into smaller pieces; the other wouldn't eat them at all. But they LOVE these treats! These are about 1/4 the size of the other treats, and they love the taste. I put them in their treat puzzles and they go wild! I alternate between using these treats and a lysine gel for daily maintenance.",

      "text": "I moved to these treats from another provider. The other provider supplied larger and drier/harder treats that didn't get received by my cat beyond day two. My pet did use these for most of a week, but I reverted to the paste supplement. But if you need to supply Lysine and your pet isn't a bit of a diva, you will be able to get by with these. Properly sized for the average short hair and moist enough to be consumed.",

But for the cost is seems like the treats go a bit longer per dose than the paste. This virus is a pain to deal with, but these products really help keep it in control.",
