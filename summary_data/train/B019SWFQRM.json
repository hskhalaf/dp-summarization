This terrarium gets compliments all the time from house guests. The terrarium was also shipped with a free tiny owl, which made my day, as owls are my favorite bird. It promptly became the centrepiece of the terrarium. I have no complaints about this product. The quality is great, and it looks exactly as advertised!",

Had I realized how small this terrarium is (which again, was my fault, not the sellers' fault), I would have thought that it was pretty expensive for what you get. You will not be able to fit much in here unless you are using truly miniature plants.",

The seller even included a small owl figurine (very nice). The other thing I need to mention is that I purchased another terrarium planter (a bit larger) from a local craft store. I got it home and was doing a little cleaning of the glass and noticed gaps between the glass. I had to seal it with silicone. This terrarium was completely sealed and I didn't have to take that extra step. I really like the quality of this planter. I would purchase from this seller again.",
