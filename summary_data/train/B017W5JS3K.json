The Chemical Guys wheel brush I bought has also been a disappointment. The bucket and lid are great. The cleaning products seem fine. Hopefully the towels hold up to the test of time.",

At least it smells good.",

I can see the difference in the formula versus other soap brands that leave a film of residue, plus a little goes a long way don\u2019t be fooled by the small bottle - great job chemical guys I have not seen my car this clean since I took my baby out the Toyota show room !

I use the Chemical Guys soap in the Karcher foam cannon. This gives me a better wash than any drive-through and it will easily pay for itself in cost and time-savings over this summer. The microfiber towels are enormous and the two are enough to dry a medium sized car wonderfully. The quality of everything is fantastic and I think this kit would make a fantastic gift for someone who's bought a new car or for your own car care.",

I would not give them a try again until they can consistently deliver.",

    "description": "Style:Wash Bucket KitNew to detailing? Using dad's old rusty bucket and dirty rags to wash the family car? Don't know what the pros use for the perfect detail? Chemical Guys has you covered! Chemical Guys have combined the best-selling fan favorites and newest car wash products into the Best Car Wash Bucket Kit. A perfect scratch-free shine starts with proper car wash and dry techniques and products, and the all new bucket kit contains everything you need for a weekly wash on any car, truck, motorcycle, or SUV. Rinse away dirt and grime and add deep gloss and shine with the slick Mr. Pink car wash shampoo. Choose Citrus Wash & Gloss for removing heavy duty stuck-on dirt, bugs, and grime. Hold mountains of foamy car wash suds in the Heavy Duty Detailing Bucket, and drop in a Grit Guard insert to hold abrasive dirt and debris at the bottom and away from clean water and soap. Separating dirt and debris away from the premium Chenille Microfiber Wash Mitt reduces the amount of dirt rubbed back onto the paint to cause swirls and scratches. Car drying is another crucial point for preventing scratches, so lubricate the surface and release stuck-on water with After Wash spray and a premium Miracle Dryer Microfiber Towel. Snap on the heavy duty Bucket Lid and sit on the top to easily clean wheels with Diablo Wheel Gel to remove nasty dust and grime from alloy rims and steel wheels. The Best Car Wash Bucket Kit is the one easy-to-use kit that allows any detailing enthusiast to get professional results with every car wash.",
