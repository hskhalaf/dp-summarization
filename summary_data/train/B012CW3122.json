I think I could have ordered an XXL and it still wouldn't have stayed in place - it would have ridden up due to my body shape alone.",

You see, when you put stuff in it's very difficult to make sure the belt is all on the same face- once you wear it a couple times there's no stiffness, so you have to carefully untwist any bunched up parts. Maybe that's fine for some people, but for me, a big sweaty guy, this makes putting the belt on weird. And the sides aren't easy to uniformly flip to- it's not hard to get it stuck in the middle.",
