It still looks like new and hasn't warped in any way or lost its shape. Our family is bigger now and we wanted another one, to put around the fire pit. We keep our fatwood, matches, and other stuff in it and all stays dry. Yes, even when we had 8 inches of rain last month. Great product.",

I do, however, recommend using a power screw-driver to insure the screws are adequately installed.",
