      "text": "I LOVE this printer/scanner/copier. I've used it over and over again to print large and small jobs and to scan dozen of documents. My only complaint is that Cannon hasn't provided a \"two-pack\" for the black ink or colored ink cartridges. Instead the only two pack they offer comes with photo paper - something I definitely do not need. But other than that, the ink usage is good and keeps printing until the streaks appear from \"no more ink\". I especially like this since most printers stop before the ink is actually gone which wastes ink. I would recommend this printer to anyone who needs good quality printing.",

Now, I could certainly understand this omission from the product if it were a wireless printer. But it's not. So why in bloody h--- would you sell a product without some of the equipment needed to use the darned thing? Is it worth making customers mad when they realize \"you do not include this needed part\" for a $3.00 part? Really???? And don't tell me \"look at the box\" because I do not get to see the box until I receive it! I will not buy another product from Canon-------------",

However, Canon is a very good brand and I think I'm going to have a good run with this printer.",

The two test pictures that were printed looked amazing compared to the 5 year old printer it replaced. I don't need wireless so the fact this printer is cable only was not a problem The 5 year old printer was a Canon too and it still worked. It was thrown out only because new ink was so expensive it was cheaper to get this printer. So in my experience, a Canon printer will keep working until you don't want it anymore, and the picture quality is great for light usage like mailing pictures to people.",

The only thing I didn't know about was that it doesn't come with a USB cable to connect to the computer. If I had known that, I might have bought the wireless printer with the same company. But I'm happy with my purchase now that I have the cable! :)",
