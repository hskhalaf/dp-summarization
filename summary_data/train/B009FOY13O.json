It's a really great acoustic / electric guitar and I've been playing for 20 years. I recommend ordering good strings with the guitar- D' Addario Light strings are my favorite.",

Then when I do get a response it's vaguely on topic and questions me about whether or not I purchased a Jameson product. Very frustrating to deal with. Enjoy the guitar which I recommend for beginners or players that just want something to take on trips with no worrying about ruining your good instruments. The action is decent, maybe a touch high, and the intonation is close. Overall this is a great value for the money.",

We have a Gibson SG, an Ibizan and a Rickenbacker. This guitar is almost as easy to play as they are. I've seen the poor reviews, and the good so I took a shot. I'm very happy with this purchase.

The strings that originally came with the guitar might need to be replaced quickly - one of them snapped after 2 days\u2019 of light strumming.

He's a small 11 year old and this guitar is just right for him. The base is not as wide as some other guitars I have seen, but it's full size and as far as I can tell a great starter guitar.",

The pickup is under the bridge bone and fit was not that good but with a little set up time, I was able to make it comfortable to play for my 13 year old son.

Might have gotten sanded off when they did the finish. Maybe I'm just picky because I make, build and finish electric guitars and I make sure i dont sand paint when i do the finish. Overall, It's as expected for the price and it looks cool. If your an experienced player, I would recommend something else.",

      "text": "Playable out of the Box, color is a coral pink hard on the eyes except at a distance, some missed spray on sound hole, good quality gig bag 20-30 range, Neck is bit narrow good for small hands, has a rich sound for 1-250 guitar range, No Serial Number would be hard to insur. Good enough for stage/ recording. For the whole pkg., for a acoustic/electric regardless of colour is a respectable affordable guitar, one could give as a gift or have as a spare to take to the park, stage, record with. Good for beginner, Immediate, even exper. on budget",

Although we've not yet connected it to an amp, acoustic play is rich and lovely - not quite deep a standard acoustic guitar, but definitely performance worthy. My daughter LOVES it, so much she actually completes her list of daily chores without having a bad attitude and without being asked so she can earn \"guitar time\" each day. WIN! It came with a canvas gig bag, a couple of picks, a cord to connect to an amp, a cord chart and information from the company.",

To my surprise, the guitar plays beautifully. When hooked in like an electric, the sound is not as good as a higher priced guitar, but that is to be expected. The guitar is thinner and slighter smaller than normal. So it would be good for a beginner or a smaller player in general. I highly recommend this guitar if you are looking for something inexpensive and durable. I play mine almost everyday.",

It is, as the name and description suggests, thinner than your traditional acoustic guitar. As such, it sits more comfortably against the body when being played. It also can be utilized as an electric acoustic guitar because it can be plugged into an amp. Sound quality is excellent, both acoustically and electrically. The appearance of this guitar is nothing short of spectacular. Very pleasing to the eye.This guitar comes equipped with everything stated in the description. Excellent quality guitar for the money spent. Highly recommend...you will not be disappointed!",

However, I quickly forgot about that once I strummed a few chords. The tone on this guitar is amazing! I thought the stock strings weren't bad, but I replaced them anyway (Ernie Ball Earthwood Light) and the sustain increased even more. The only thing keeping this from being a five-star review is the electronics. This guitar has a passive pick-up, so I need to crank my amp volume way up in order to hear it. Otherwise, I'm very happy with this guitar.",
