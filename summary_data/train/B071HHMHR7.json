I put our blue harness over it. It does have a leash opening that can be used. I also love the pocket. The hood could be a little bigger as its a little challenging to keep on although it does have a drawstring. Overall very satisfied. I ordered a Size XXL for my 85 lb German Shepard.",

He stands still while it is being put on and when taking it off. He is much more comfortable going outside when raining. He still doesn't like the rain, but he does his business without freaking out. Should have bought one years ago. Now, for the only negatives. Our pit bull has XL sized neck and chest which makes the coat a bit too long and loose around the hindquarters. And he doesn't tolerate the hood. Still, I give the raincoat 5 stars for the negatives aren't showstoppers.",

      "text": "My dog is very hard to fit for coats but this coat is great. He\u2019s 100 lbs, on the longer side and has a barrel chest. I had a hard time finding a coat that wasn\u2019t too short bodied for him. I bought him the XXL because of his chest measurements. It is a little long for him but I prefer it that way. It\u2019s not a coat for warmth, just for precipitation. Very easy to put on. It doesn\u2019t get in the way when they do their business. I definitely recommend this coat for bigger dogs.",

It\u2019s made from high quality materials and the rear leg straps stretch for taking them on and off. Highly recommended.",

Very strange because she likes the sweater shirts we've gotten in the past but not this. The hoodie is short and not at full length, there's a Velcro strap underneath and a pocket on top.",

It has a little room to grow into. The strap on the inside is pretty big, but my dog is skinny and long so it might just be him. If he outgrows this coat, I'm definitely getting another!",

Saint Bernard, the neck was way too tight for him to walk around with it on & the stretch bands for his hind legs did not reach. I was able to pop his head through, however the fit was cutting it too close for his comfort. He looked absolutely smothered, and because of that I wouldn't reccommend this for Giant Breeds with thicker coats and massive head's. Other than that, if your furbaby is slim figured with a thin coat, this cute rain coat is for you!",
