I can boot windows super fast, all the apps open in less than five seconds. I believe the future of the hard drives will be ssd with multiple raid arrarys. I recommend this product for controls engineers that works at the field and use heavy software like Siemens step 7, Wincc Flexible, RSLogix and Factory Talk. This product improves my productivity.
