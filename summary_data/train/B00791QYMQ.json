I'm going to guess about 18 days since I received it because there's a little square on the inside of the watch screen that displays the number of days passed. Other than that - I love it!

She can set it herself and she's taught herself how to use the rotating dials on the face as a timer. This is GREAT watch. It's also waterproof which is great when your child forgets to remove her watch when she washes her hands or showers, lol.",

I'll keep using it through nursing school and likely need to replace it with a nicer, more reliable watch eventually.",

A customer should not be expected to pay to fix a product that was dysfunctional from the start. That should come out of the company's pocket.",
