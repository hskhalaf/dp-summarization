The 5 foot pipe allowed me to mount it 24\" into the ground.",

The post wasn't long enough for our liking so we did have to modify it in order to cement it in place.",

It does have weight, so prepare yourself when it's delivered. I love this grill and will get one for myself when I move next year.",
