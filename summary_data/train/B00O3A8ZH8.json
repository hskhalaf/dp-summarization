      "text": "First and foremost, the depth setting for the bits don't allow them to be raise high enough to work with material more than 1/2 inch thick. The router allowed the bits to wobble. This made the tool excessively loud and produced poor quality cuts. The clamp mechinism broke on the first use and now the router wanders down as I cut. Overall this product is nothing but a waste of money.",

Round over edges are okay, picture frames are not. Also, don't use 1/4\" bits.",
