These are all things we can do in the oven but this is so much easier. Happy... until today when it won't turn on.

I contacted cuisinart and they sent me another and after 2 uses that insert is bubbling up. I had high hopes that this would be awesome but is is not worth the money when every insert starts to bubble with minimum use. I would return the product if I could. I am certainly not going to cook in it anymore. Save time and money by buying the original ceramic slow cooker, they last for years.",

Amazon agreed to replace the item and for me to return the defective slow cooker. So far the replacement cooker is one for one on performance.",

This device allowed me to brown my chicken prior to place all the ingredients in to slow cook. The green curry literally took 30 minutes to prep and about 6 hours to cook. The green curry came out perfectly and the chicken was surprisingly moist. Clean was a breeze since it is a non-stick coating. I can't wait to try other recipes and also to try out the steaming feature of this appliance.",

    "description": "Size:4-Quart\n\nTHE CUISINART COOK CENTRAL 3-IN-1 MULTICOOKER\nThe MSC-400 Cuisinart Multicooker Create one-pot meals your family will love with the Cuisinart Cook Central 3-in-1 Multicooker. Three fully programmable cooking functions let you saut\u00e9 vegetables, brown meats and slow cook your favorite comfort foods right in the unit. Skip the stovetop with combination cooking -- brown your ingredients in the unit and then simply switch to the slow cook function. Use the Cook Central to prep any aspect of your favorite dish. Select the steam function to prepare stuffed artichokes to start a gourmet meal or to create a healthful vegetable medley side dish. The Cook Central can even do dessert. With numerous recipes to choose from in the included booklet, the opportunities are endless! \n\nThe Cook Central features Cuisinart\u2019s brushed stainless steel housing and a 4-quart nonstick cooking pot that lets you brown or saut\u00e9 directly in the unit. Once your meal is ready, the unit will automatically shift to Keep Warm mode so your meal is ready when you are. Serving your dish is easy -- just lift the pot out and take it to the table. Clean-up is a breeze with the Cook Central as the pot, steaming rack and glass lid are dishwasher-safe. \n\nMULTI-FUNCTIONAL\nThe first step to creating your meal with the Cook Central is selecting the cooking function. \n\nSLOW COOK\nSlow cooking is perfect for foods that require long, slow simmering, such as soups, stocks, stews, and dried beans. This function is also ideal when cooking tougher and less expensive cuts of meat like shoulder and pot roast. The Slow Cook function has three temperature settings -- High, Low, and Simmer. For recipes that need to cook longer, use the Simmer and Low settings. When starting a dish later in the day, select the High setting. A 24-hour timer and automatic Keep Warm mode ensure your food is ready to eat when you are. \n\nBrown or saut\u00e9 with temperatures up to 400 degrees F. Use the extra-large steaming rack to steam vegetables. Slow cook on your schedule with programmable settings. STEAM\nSteaming is one of the healthiest methods of cooking. No butter or oil is required and fewer nutrients are lost in the steaming process. To steam anything from asparagus to shrimp, insert the included steaming rack and no more than 1 quart of water or other liquid in the cooking pot and cover with the lid. Once steaming is complete, carefully remove food from the pot with a spoon, fork or tongs and enjoy. \n\nBROWN/SAUT\u00c9\nUse the Brown/Saut\u00e9 function as you would a skillet or saut\u00e9 pan on the stovetop for a variety of recipes. Prepare a quickly saut\u00e9ed skillet dish or brown food right in the pot as the first step of your family's favorite slow cooker recipe. You can use this function to reheat foods as well. Just use Brown/Saut\u00e9 at 350 degrees F and stir until all ingredients are warmed through. \n\nOnce you have chosen the cooking function that best fits your recipe, simply set the desired time and temperature, and then press Start. \n\nFEATURES AND BENEFITS\nGlass Lid with Handle\n\nCheck the progress of a dish without releasing heat. \n\nSteaming Rack\n\nPlace in the up position to elevate ingredients for steaming. \n\nNonstick Aluminum 4-Quart Cooking Pot\n\nSpreads heat evenly to perfectly brown and saute ingredients right in the unit. \n\nBPA Free\n\nAll parts that come in contact with food are BPA free.\n\n \n\nEasy to use control panel \n\nPROGRAMMABLE CONTROL PANEL\nCooking Function Buttons\n\nUse to select Slow Cook, Brown/Saut\u00e9 or Steam. \n\nTime Directionals\n\nUse to set your desired cooking time, be it minutes or hours. \n\nTemperature Directionals\n\nUse to set cooking temperatures up to 400 degrees F. \n\nStart/Stop Button\n\nUse to start and stop cooking function. \n\nBlue Backlit LCD Display\n\nSide-by-side display shows cooking time and temperature.",
