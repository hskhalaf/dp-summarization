Cons: - it's tight for 16 cans of soda, almost leave no room for cooler-ice-packs, so prepare to get a small/slim ice-packs or carry less items",

If you're actually putting ice in the bag, beware of melting ice water, which may leak from the zipper seams if you're shoulder carrying this bag and tipping it side to side. Only minor complaint is that I wished the shoulder straps can be longer, otherwise this is a great bag for a car trip, beach, camping etc.",

It takes the ice longer to melt, and I can always add more on top or ice packs. Of course, once the ice melts, if the cooler tips, it will leak, because after all - it's made of cloth.",

      "text": "I bought these for a golf trip / bachelor party, and these quickly became the crucial part of equipment that every golf outing should have: - they fit perfectly in the back cubby of ANY golf cart. Seriously, we haven't found a golf cart yet where they don't fit - the keep ice (and the drinks) cold for a whole round. Yes it melts a little, but it still has great thermal protection - Fits up to 16 beers, no problem and ice - straps and connections are solid, so no worries about this thing breaking any time soon (especially loaded down with 16 beers)",

I love that you can use the removable liner separately. we took it on our trip and used the liner for the pantry-type snacks, and used the cooler for cold drinks and snacks. kept everything cool for a 9 hour road trip! I just dont like the handles on the removable liner because they are so \"sharp\". I wrapped tape around them so i could carry it without feeling like it's going to cut my fingers off. Maybe if they added some padding or something around the handles, that would be great. but simple fix for me so i dont mind, worth the money!",

I like that you can remove the hard liner if you need more space. With the hard liner, I would say you can fit about 8 bottles or 10-12 cans, plus some other items like sandwich. The extra space at the top means you can fit some extra items in there which is a plus. Perfect for a day at the beach for two.",
