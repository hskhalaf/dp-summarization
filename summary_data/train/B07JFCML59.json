The youngest cat loves it, as soon as she hears the bits hit the bowl she takes off. Very, very happy.",

      "text": "This is my second review as I have to say this is a great company to work with. My first feeder had an impellar malfunction and the company sent me a new machine. Unfortunately, the new machine would not hook up to wall power because the adapter was missing. Instead of sending an adapter, they sent me more machines. I hooked up the new one and it works perfectly again so life is good with me and my kitty. This product is great and the company stands behind their products 100% plus they are very responsive to customer needs. I am very pleased with my experience and grateful for such great customer service.",

The manual feed/snack button can easily be trigger by a pet, but can be turned off in the app. I really like that the feed door closes after it depenses food, so cat paws can\u2019t \u201cdig\u201d for more food. The magnetic food tray comes off for easy cleanings. The replaceable descant keeps food fresh and I think it also helps to deter ants.",

One issue is that the quantity of food that comes out is dependent on the size of the food. 1/10 cup of small sized food is almost twice as much as 1/10 cup of larger sizes food after remeasuring it.An improvement would be accepting both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz Wi-Fi.
