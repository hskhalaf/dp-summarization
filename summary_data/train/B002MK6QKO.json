Accuracy is dead on and my husband, my two children, and I all tested it out numerous times, always the same readings. It's nice and sleek in appearance, very easy to read, and also easy to set up. I have recommended it to several friends since it arrived. Thanks EatSmart!!!",

It is very accurate to tenths of a pound, and has produced repeatable measurements with consistency. As a nice extra, they include a waist tape measure with the scale to help you meet your fitness goals. The function of the scale is easy. you don't have to turn it on by tapping it. You simply step onto it, and it powers up with your weight displayed. The first time you put the batteries in it, it does the zero calibration.",

I decided it was time to replace this very nice inaccurate scale with something I could trust. I read the reviews of many scales and was originally looking at the balance scales. There are some very nice well rated scales which seemed to be expensive, then I found the EatSmart Scale. I wasn't sure about a digital as I've had problems in the past with the technology (maybe 20 years ago). Well, let me say, this scale is awesome. Accurate, lightweight, good looking and inexpensive. Buy this scale, you will not be disappointed. Five Stars!",
