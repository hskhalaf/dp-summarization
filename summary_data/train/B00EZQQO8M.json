While this slicer is plastic and might not look like the strongest product ever offered, it has surprised me by taking on not only tons of eggs but also any fruit and mushrooms we have thrown at it. It has always been thrown in the dishwasher and it still looks almost new. I would recommend that, for fruit and mushrooms, go slow when applying the cut. I think that's key to getting this thing to last...and that's still better and faster than trying to do the same cuts with a knife.",

I highly recommend it, with one caveat. It's not as easy or as fast to use as it could be, because while it looks like the slicing discs are guided by the sides of the base, the slicing discs cut into the top of the egg before they engage the slots, so you have to carefully eyeball the alignment. If you could slide the disk into the guides before it made contact with the egg, I would have given this five stars.",
