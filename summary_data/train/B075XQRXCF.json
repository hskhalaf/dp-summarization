It is true it must be hand filled with water unless you come up with another way to fill the tub as the provided water cords are useless. It wasn't enough to lower my star rating. The machine is small enough to sit on an end table which allows water to easily drain from the machine into the bath tub. It seems it is no longer available how I originally purchased it. I certainly wouldn't pay the $300 plus one third party seller is asking. If it again comes available through Amazon, it is worth purchasing.",

I set the sink cover up on a folding step stool and place the washer on top of that, gives me enough height for draining into a collapsible dish pan, which I also use for filling it up since I can't connect to my faucet. The spinner will get nearly all of the water out of my hand washables and they nearly come out dry in some cases. It was a great investment!",

      "text": "It is pretty cool. Quick use.. I have used it twice to make sure but Mine seems to get stuck on 2 when I go to spin dry which for me isn't too big of a deal like not worth returning over... But all In all yes it does work it in one load It could hold 4 regular shower towels and 2nd load was 3 shirts and two pants and underwear. The spin dry does do good I'd say about 60% dry but if you ring them out first 75%dry it Dries well for thinner material. I would still recommend it though.",

I have mine on a wide side of the bathtub so it is close to water, no worries with draining and is out of the way eliminating the need of moving it. You will find your own tips for such things like amount and types of clothing to be washed at the time (sleeves/pant legs become entangled), cleaning the tub frequently, washing out the spinner helps with blockage accumulating along with some forceful water through the tub drain. I am more than satisfied.",

The dryer is where I had problems. With a dry cycle of only 5 minutes its very hard to get yiur clothes dryed. I was however able to rig the timmer so that it would go ubtil my clothes where completely dry. Which never actually happened. Hoping get a refund. Please stear clear from this one guys. :(",

Its faster and way cheaper your clothes get clean the the spin cycle is a hurricane so really dry to the touch I just hang them up and its all good. Best news is in 5 months it will pay for itself!! Drains well and no mess or water on the floor. Great investment.",
