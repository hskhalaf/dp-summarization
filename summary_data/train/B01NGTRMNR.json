One only needs to speak the following: \"Alexia play Kindle book (and then the title)\" at first I thought it wasn't working but it takes awhile to download on the first book.",

You could cover the cameras with little bits of tape too if you don't use them for anything. Other than this, It's a perfectly fine tablet and works nicely. Go away Alexa and stay away!",

      "text": "I own 2 of these devices, one purchased in Feb 2018, and the other in April 2018.. I have already had to have both of them replaced for the same issue.. The USB charging port is CRAP! After only a couple months of use, the connection became very loose and the tablets wouldn't charge. I've used only the factory charging cords that came with the device. I've owned 6 previous versions of Fire tablets and have always been very happy with them because they were affordable, yet NOT cheaply made. It now seems that while still affordable, Amazon has gone cheap on a very vital part on the tablet. These are the last Fire tablets I will EVER buy!",

I noticed that the tablet pushes alot of the amazon store front, which is ok but can be annoying specially if a child is using it. I wish it could be locked up and profiles be added for when my kid is on it.",
