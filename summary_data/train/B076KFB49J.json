Not a deal breaker, but not like the others I own which were clean inside and out. All in all, with all the accessories, it's a real bargain.",

Debating whether it's worth the trouble to send it back and go for something more expensive. Guess you get what you pay for.",

The ukulele I bought here has amazing reviews. I thought I couldn't go wrong. But after opening it, I immediately felt something was wrong. The main issue is that the sides of the frets all scratch you. I've now read a few other reviews that mention this. This issue alone makes this unplayable for me. The second issue is that the A string won't keep its tune for more than a few minutes it seems. Hopefully I can get a refund from this.",

The case is nice and the tuner makes it easy for a beginner to find the right tune. It does tune well and easily, but as I understand from reviews, some more expensive ukeleles might hold tune longer. It's a little touchy, but can play for a while with strumming and maintain. Customer service was very responsive to my question about strings. One was mis labeled. Comes with extra set for replacement. Very happy with purchase.",

I STILL use it, haven\u2019t needed to replace the strings, no damage on it so it\u2019s not bad material (and I am a very clumsy person, so it has hit some walls). Have zero need to replace it whatsoever. Has a really good sturdy feel and beautiful sound. If you wanna learn to play, this is perfect!!",

This Kmise soprano ukulele is wonderful! It has good sound, tunes easily, and is fun to play. I love the tuner that comes with it, too. Way better than the old pipe tuner I had with my guitar. Add to that the included case, shoulder strap and a small beginners book, this is a great buy!!",
