Surprised at the results. Use my favorite drink a coke with no ice. Took it out of the Refrig and it was 38.3 degrees. Poured equal amounts in both cups. After 1 min. 35.2 and 45.5 degrees. After 5 min's 33.6 and 48.2, After 10 min's 33.0 and 50.3, After 20 min's 33.2 and 54.8, After 30 min's 33.6 and 56.2 degrees. So Confirmed it does what is say's it would. That is all you can ask for.",
