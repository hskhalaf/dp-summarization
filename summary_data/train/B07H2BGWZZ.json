I bought them to wear while running, hiking, cycling and They have performed flawlessly at keeping my cool, dry and from chafing. I liked them so much that I purchased another seat, so I can use them for everyday use. They don't have the same level of anti-odor that you get from Merrino wool, but they are much better at blocking odor than my full synthetic Reebok boxer briefs are. These also fit perfect and have an excellent amount of stretch, I have large thighs and they stretch to accommodate perfectly. I highly recommend these, especially considering that other high end active underwear can cost you over $30 per pair.",

The seams along the legs are poorly placed, such that they run along the inside of the leg, through the crotch where the leg means your nether parts, and out the back - right at the point that sitting between your closed leg and man parts are going to get chafed something fierce. The waistband also sucks, being bigger than the described size. It's too bad, because I like the colors available and the price point is great too.",
