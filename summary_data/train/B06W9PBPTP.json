We really like the counter depth for our small kitchen, the draw back is there is no egg or butter compartments and no lunch meat drawer. It\u2019s just shelves and in door storage. The drawers in the freezer are really nice And...it is so quiet!",

We are really pleased with our new refrigerator. It's the right size for a couple, the freezer with it's drawers makes things easy to organize and find, and it has kept its temperature perfect.",

The refrigerator came with a 1 year manufacturer's warranty. A called Haier and they told me that the refrigerator was not designed to be used in the garage. It only works in temperature controlled rooms. That is information they should put in big letters. Anyways, I diagnosed the problem and it was the evaporator fan. Finding parts or a service manual is basically impossible. Bottom line is that this is a cheap refrigerator with poor quality and support.",
