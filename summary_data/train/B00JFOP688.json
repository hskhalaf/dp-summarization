However, we found its cable speed is slower than its wifi speed. Yes, I tried to test their download speed using a PC, with its cable and its wifi, respectively. Cable gives you only 5~6 Mbps while the Wifi gives you like more than 50 Mbps (the router provides > 70 Mbps ). How does this happen? I thought cable would be more powerful in streaming but it's NOT. Anyway, the wifi is still fast enough to support the streaming, so no complain... Overall its good for now.",

I decided to set up the AC1200 as an access point, hardwired to my main router (to avoid the connectivity and latency problems associated with range extenders that connect wirelessly). To accomplish this, i purchased 2 D-Link Powerline AV2 2000 adapters, from Amazon. I plugged one adapter into my main router, and another into an AC outlet on the other side of my house. I then plugged my AC1200 into the adapter's RJ45 port and presto... a screaming fast, latency-free extension of my existing network.",

I bought the TP-Link relay instead, which worked perfectly. I may have gotten a defective D-Link unit.",

I wanted to extend my existing wireless network for better coverage on the second floor of my home, as well as add Wireless-N capabilities to a desktop that only had an older Wireless-G card. The only downside is you are halving the transfer speed between extender and router. Even still, I went from a very unstable 100mbps wireless connection with buffering video streaming to a constant 144mbps connection that now works very consistently and smoothly. My results at SpeedTest.net also increased by about 5-8MBps on both laptop and smartphone connections while using the extender upstairs.",
