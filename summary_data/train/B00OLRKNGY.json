He is now 9 months, decided to get it out and start using and the whole side is ripped, nothing that can be done as it's past the return window. I am left to wonder if it was used, dropped, damaged, etc and am worried to have my son be in it. These are not cheap, so I am pretty disappointed.",

The line on the side that supposed to be your guideline can never be quite horizontal as it should be. Other than that, I do like it though, and I'm a big Britax fan.",
