I wish i had checked the Samsung/Apple compatibility issues (my fault) for the mic and volume remote. Annoying but not a deal breaker. I'll update when/if the headphone dies. UPDATE - a few months in - the jack connector started cracking, causing sound dropouts. However, since the wire is detachable (a very smart move), I'll spend $6 on a new wire vs. a lot more for a whole new headphone.",
