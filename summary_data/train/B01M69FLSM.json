      "text": "Had never hit a hybrid before, so wasn't sure how I would do with it. I usually hit 3 or 4 iron on long approach shots, sometimes even 2 iron. I have Cobra F8 Driver, 3 wood and irons, but liked the idea of adjustability that the F8 hybrids don't offer. Bought this club in 3/4 and after taking it out a few times, all I can say is I am in love. Never hit long irons as consistently as I can hit this club. Even picked up a 5 hybrid to go in the bag. Would have liked to get a 2-3 also, but just can't find. Couldn't be happier.",
