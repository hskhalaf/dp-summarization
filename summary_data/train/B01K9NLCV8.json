      "text": "I purchased this product in March of 2017, and SIX months later it would no longer charge and would not come on at all, no matter WHAT AC adaptor/USB connector I used to charge it. It would come on all of a few seconds and then power off. I was really enjoying this speaker and so disappointed that it stopped working. Shortly after expressing my disappointment in a customer comment on Amazon, a representative from the AOMAIS customer support team emailed me and offered to send me another speaker. I received a replacement speaker within a week and all is well. The speaker is working great, and my customer satisfaction has returned! THANK YOU AOMAIS FOR RESOLVING MY ISSUE!",

It's fully waterproof and is safe sitting next to the pool, beach or wherever your travels take you. Update (1/11/18): After owning this speaker for 3 months it developed an issue that if I tried to go above 1/2 volume it would cut out and turn off. After contacting the company they sent me a replacement free of charge. I appreciate a company that stands behind there product and even more importantly behind there customers! I hope to find other items down the road to purchase through Aomais.",

      "text": "These speakers are spectacular! Very satisfied with this purchase. The individual speaker sound is very good. Not exceptional, but very good, especially considering the waterproof design. However, when you purchase the pair of these and sync two speakers they play in STEREO sound, and the sound becomes exceptional. Small speaker - Check. Bluetooth - Check. Weather/waterproof - Check. Great sound - Check. Reasonable price - Check. The one minor complaint I have - getting the two speakers to sync together can be a bit clumsy. Every time you connect via Bluetooth you need to guess which speaker is the 'master' speaker or the stereo sync will not operate as expected.",

Since I made my review I've been contacted over a half year later to get a new speaker or a refund in exchange for making my review 4 stars or higher and saying just \"good product\" per there email. Buyer beware. Basically buying good reviews. Since they decided to contact me I believe I will go ahead and update my review. Taking away one star for durability. The speaker now has a loose part rattling around that's metal and when it contacts the speakers magnets it makes noise even when off. This is a possible fire hazard.",

I got these speakers so I could easily pair two of them, to reach between rooms seamlessly. Since this isn\u2019t possible, as at least one of them is bad/defective, it makes buying these speakers pointless for me. Perhaps I got unlucky and got a defective unit.

Only issue i had with them until one died was that the buttons are too close together and being under a thick layer of rubber you have to push the buttons hard. Also dont even think the \"bass\" speaker is even hooked up to anything or is fake. No instructions and learned how to use off a youtube video.

Researching online, reading the pamphlet more times than I can count. Even checking my phone's Bluetooth version to make sure it was compatible with the speaker. NOTHING. If I wanted a wired speaker I would buy a wired speaker. Not getting the one and only use out of this product I was looking for is so frustrating and I WILL be returning it.",

I don't know why they are labeled with the same model number. They are different speakers. It's a shame that the audio quality got worse.

I've used other Bluetooth speakers before and the problem has always been volume, they just don't have the sound, but the AOMAIS Sport II is perfect. It has strong volume and is waterproof. The other thing I love about it is that it pairs perfectly and quickly with my phone. That's been an issue with other speakers but not this one. This is one of the best purchases I've ever made and at an amazing price.",

Now it will not charge at all, and there is no way to replace internal battery. I noticed they warranty it for one year...how convenient for them. I would not recommend this item. Update: after the 1 star rating, I was contacted by the company and they replaced the unit. I am grateful to them for reaching out and fixing the issue, they didnt have to do that since it was technically after the expiration of the warranty... so for that, I am changing my star rating. Fingers crossed this one works longer.",
