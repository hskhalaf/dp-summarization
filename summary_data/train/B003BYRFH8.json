      "text": "I have seen mixed reviews regarding the use of Dremel Collets with this tool. I will do my best to help clarify the compatibility, as the collet included with the tool might last 3 minutes of normal use. The dremel 4485 collets are slightly longer, however they do fit and seem to work. The nut included with the 4485 kit does not fit, I believe this is what the other reviewers were referring to in previous posts stating that the kit does not work. I have attached some photos showing the wen collet in brass and the dremel collets in aluminum. The other pictures show the dremel collet in the WEN tool and with the WEN nut installed.",

Without the extension, the job would have been much harder to accomplish. I don't like the product being from China, as with almost every durable good I have purchased in the past ten years. It undercuts Dremel prices in a major way. But the cost of a similar setup on Dremel is beyond my budget for this project.",

The machine is reasonably powerful but I dare to rarely, if ever, use the max power because this brand is prone to overheating and breaking down. I can\u2019t recommend this product.

It's a 10 mm so not s huge deal on the wrench. But the chuck pin literally splits the unit in half while you try to tighten it. It entirely failed so bad i had to buy a new unit and went with Dremel \u00ae.",

Now the collet is stripped so it only tightens enough to use larger diameter bits, and even still it vibrates atrociously which makes it impossible to cut anything with a Dremel cutting bit. I kinda expected that at the very low barrier-of-entry so I'm not upset, but I would definitely recommend people hold out for when an actual Dremel goes on sale instead of buying this. You will find a million uses for this, it will fail, and you will end up buying a Dremel in the end anyway.",

I was using a saw bit to cut plastic and the tool shut off multiple times. Ended up using my 14 dollar Black & Decker rotary tool and it powered through no problem. If the chuck was so off center, I'd say this thing would be awesome for doing fingernails or some other extremely light duty work. But not for any real work or even crafting",

      "text": "This rotary device is perfect! No need to spend so much money on the Dremel brand when you can get better quality right here with this one. My Dremel finally gave out after about 10 years and I really didn\u2019t want to spend so much money on a new one. Found this one and so very happy with it. I think it performs better than my old Dremel. Plus the flex cable which I never had before, makes getting into tight spaces so easy. High recommended!",

I had a little problem with the flex shaft coming off, but that might not be the device's fault. I don't really need it all that much.
