I believe also that buyers of this product should be aware that it is no longer a true Corning Ware product. They are now made in China and I believe quality-control is no longer that of the original Corning Ware cookware. Only time will tell if the first casserole was an anomaly or if these casseroles are of mediocre quality.",

    "description": "CORNINGWARE ETCH 2.5-QUART SQUARE DISH WITH GLASS LID IN SAND\nThe original CorningWare bakeware which was first introduced in 1958, was made of a glass-ceramic material that could be used on the stove, in the oven and under the broiler. After World Kitchen acquired the brand in the late 1990's, CorningWare products were switched to ceramic stoneware production. Introduced later that year was the French White collection, which has been an all-time best seller among brides-to-be. \n\nThe CorningWare stoneware collections can be used in conventional, convection and microwave ovens as well for storing food in the refrigerator and freezer. It washes easily by hand or in the dishwasher. Non-porous, stoneware won't absorb food odors and resists staining. And it's non-reactive so acid-based foods can be prepped or baked in it. CorningWare bakeware, a perfect blend of style and function, is designed to be used for convenient same-dish baking and serving, whether for casual or formal dining.\n\nCreative, versatile, transforming- CorningWare etch bakeware gives you the edge. Premium crafted stoneware with artisan details and design that exhibits your good taste and fresh style. And, etch is CORNINGWARE bakeware so you know you can count on its high quality and performance. \n\n * The collection is designed with gently flared edges and easy-grip handles to make the dishes easy to clean and to handle. \n * High-gloss interiors.\n * Textured surface conveys hand-made, artisan quality.\n * Microwave, dishwasher & oven safe.\n * Blends with existing CorningWare pieces.\n * 1-Year Warranty. \n\nCARE AND USE\n\nAll CorningWare stoneware bakeware items are breakable. Failure to follow instructions may result in personal injury or property damage.\n\nCorningWare stoneware bakeware can be used for serving and reheating food. Some stoneware bakeware can be used in microwave, convection and pre-heated conventional oven. Some items may not be appropriate for specific uses. Review information on bottom of items prior to use.\n\nWash by hand or in automatic dishwasher. Load dishes to avoid bumping against other items during cycle.
