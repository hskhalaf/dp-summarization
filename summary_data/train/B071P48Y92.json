      "text": "Brought these on our vacation to Jamaica. They came in SO handy in the pool and in the ocean. People asked us where we got them from - everyone wished they had brought some! Saw a couple with the ones that have the 2 inflatable pieces that are actually a part of the float - For this one you put the plastic inflatable penis inside of the sleeve first, then inflate it. I think this one is better because if you get a hole in the inflatable part your whole flow isn\u2019t ruined, you can just get a replacement inflatable peace.",

But for me and my husband who like to float around to cool off after a hot round of golf here in the desert, these are perfect. You can lie on them like a lounge, or sit in them like a chair. They look nice in their bright stripe colors. You could buy ten of these for the price of one floating lounge. I have had a few of them for two years and bought more this year, and they still are fine which is almost a miracle here in a Phoenix summer. A great value for a small price.",

I might be a control freak :-) ... Forget using the airpump(s).. it is so weak and slow. I blew it up with my mouth in like 15 seconds.

I'm 5'11 260lbs and it supported me easily. Your body is still in the water but your head, arms and legs are comfortably supported. Buy extras. Make boats. Trust me. Tip: Put the floaties in the raft part before you blow them up. They fit SNUG.",
