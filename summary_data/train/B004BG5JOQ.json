The bags are large enough to keep their crafts and activities organized. The clear plastic material is thick and sturdy, and allows us to easily identify what is inside. The straps and zipper are strong enough to stand up to frequent use. The bottom line - these tote bags are well constructed. I would recommend this product and would definitely order again.",
