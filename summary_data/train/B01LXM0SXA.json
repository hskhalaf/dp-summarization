Drop your bulb in place, release the dirt back down by pressing with your thumb, step on it to pack it back down, and voila`, you're done and even your mulch on top had pretty much stayed in the right place.",

It works OK for pushing in the soil and pushing in circles BUT the \"grab the soil part\" doesn't work. it just falls out anyway. This could be user error because it takes a strong hand to squeeze it as well. You can get the depth but the soil doesn't stay in the tool, for me at least. For the cheap price i'll save myself the aggravation of sending it back. The tool itself seems like its sturdy so I have no problems with it's quality. Hope this helps, Kim",
