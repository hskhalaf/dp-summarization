As experienced and conditioned I am, I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve been able to make the whole backpacking trip with any other pack (perhaps the osprey atmos ag would be the only other pack). It held up, but not only that- it was fantastically comfortable even with 60lbs of load I ended up carrying for the whole trip. It hugs and keeps the weight close to body, the adjustable suspension works flawlessly and it\u2019s just a damn good lookin pack.",

The Baltoro always handled the load comfortably. Very happy with the design, packing and access to stowed gear. The water bottle pocket is very well designed for easy access and stowing when hiking. The three pockets on the brain is smart. Zippers, straps and material all held up great. One suggestion: make the pockets on the belt strap slightly larger.",

It took a lot of adjusting on the trail to get everything prefect, but after finding the \"sweet spots\" I was very glad I bought this pack. Tons of adjustment options on this thing. I received a lot of compliments from the veteran hikers I was with. Seems like a workhorse of a pack. A++",

Lotsa space and pockets here and there, separate zipper and compartment for sleeping bag is pretty neat. There are even two little easy access pockets on the waist belts. For the super organized the Sea to Summit Medium size sacks fit perfectly. Zero complaints!!",

The pack fit as advertised, and had just the right amount of pockets and side straps. I started our trip with a 48 lb pack. I would say this was at the top end of the weight this pack should carry, due to the lightweight waist and shoulder strap design.",
