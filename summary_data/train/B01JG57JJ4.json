Also, the opening to pour out the batter is too big and the batter comes out to fast and makes a mess. For me, it would be better if the opening was a little smaller and I could control the release of the batter and if the mixing ball was a little bit bigger. I have returned this product for a refund.

      "text": "I bought this a couple of months ago and just started to use it, LOVE this! It\u2019s such a brilliant idea. I used it to make waffles this morning and it was so easy; open the larger mouth, flip over and use the base as a stand, fill water to the measured line, threw other ingredients, closed the base, shook a few times and done. It squirted perfectly into the waffle maker and it was super easy to clean (warm water with soap and shake). I absolutely recommend!",
