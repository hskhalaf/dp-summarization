You have to screw off a part of the lamp and put the shade on, screw the piece back on and then put in the light bulb. The rocks are shiney but I like them. We have a pond and they look like wet rocks to me. I bought a low wattage bulb and plan to leave it on all night so my kids will stop leaving on the kitchen light. It is really pretty and fits great where I put it. Exactly what I wanted!",

It's not high enough for example, if you're buying a pair of end table lamps for the living room or bedroom. However, it's just a great smaller accent lamp. The colors of my rocks are gray, tan, and green. The rocks are a little too shiny but I don't care. This is a PERFECT accent light that enables you to bring a touch of the outside in to your house. Very original and unique. Worth every penny! Don't hesitate if you're kicking around purchasing this!!",

No problems with functionality, I like the color of the stones, and unlike some reviewers, I easily figured out the proper way to put the shade on it. The shade goes on first, the nut holds it in place, then the bulb goes in. The neck of the lamp is jointed to allow easy leveling and adjustment of the shade. I used a dusk to dawn LED bulb so it comes on when it gets dark, turns off automatically in the morning, and uses only 6 watts. Perfect for a hallway night light ...",

I have never heard anything like that on Amazon. So, I have one set up and waiting for the Home Depot lamp to arrive tomorrow. Bad business, in my opinion.",

My other complaint is that one lamp is approx 3/4\u201d taller than the other once fully straight. These issues could have been deal breakers but we decided to keep the lamps. Using one in each of our offices instead of in the living room. I\u2019m back on the hunt for black lamps with black shades for that room.",
