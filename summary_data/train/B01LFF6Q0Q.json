The netted pockets are great for assorted tools and hold a surprising amount. The bag arrived in excellent condition, with no fraying on the seams, no discoloration, and all of the zippers work well. So far I have no complaints... except I need more tools to fill it up \ud83d\ude01",

It carries everything I need to bring to my culinary classes (including my notebook, my apron, and my hat) so I don't have to lug around my big, unwieldy baker's toolbox this term. My order was processed and shipped quickly and the product meets all of my expectations. The shoulder strap feels a little bit narrow but that's almost certainly just because nearly 2 decades in the Army got me used to wider ones. It's more than adequate for just carrying it from my car to class and back and I'm definitely happy with this purchase.",
