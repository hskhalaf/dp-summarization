Ratchet feels good and sockets fit tight and are held until release button is pushed. Made in Taiwan and seems pretty tough so far. Not as good as SK, Snap-on, Mac but better than craftsman, husky, gear wrench. By better I mean build quality, clarity of markings, case, warranty and service overall fit on most bolts nuts etc. For a set to have in the car or truck this is a nice option.",

If you are buying this just for the tools & will be throwing away the case, then great. Otherwise, paying a little more for another brand might be a better deal.",

More of a nuisance than anything, it should be a more difficult than a tiny nudge to move the lever. Also, it'd be nice if ratchet itself was a bit longer and heavier duty, but it gets the job done for most small to medium jobs. Overall, pretty good deal for the price. I'll probably be replacing this ratchet with others though.",

There are always certain nuts and bolts that will require a 3/8 or larger drive or wrench for service. So keep the big tools.

This is a nice complete set, and the quality is pretty good and they are 6 point sockets. The ratchet that comes in the set is not the greatest, but I have another separate 1/4\" drive 72 tooth ratchet that I can use if needed. The only real complaint I have is I wish there was a carrying handle on the case.",
