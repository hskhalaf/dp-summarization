The bulb lights are really bright leds, and give off a lot of light. The only thing I wasn't expecting was for it to be so small. It would have looked awesome being a little bit bigger, or maybe if it had more branch extension pieces. I do love how easy it was to set up, and it comes with ample cord so you can pretty much put it anywhere.",

I would recommend this light. In fact when I get a bigger office, I am thinking of getting another one because you can configure them in many different ways.

The only complaint I have is that the wire is very sensitive and if the lamp is moved or bumped it is likely to flicker or turn off. Beautiful accent to my home, very worth the price.",
