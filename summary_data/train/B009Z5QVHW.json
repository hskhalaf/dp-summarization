      "text": "This item is a life saver. I really could not imagine that a product could help me to get ready of sweat smell. I just love it. And I am so grateful and thankful. I hate using deodorant, because the always mess up my clothes. But since I have been using this stone from day one, I am so happy. No more smell at all and it leaves you fresh and clean. Lol. FYI, I also tried it on my face, but it was just my experience. Since I have a oil face it helps me to not sweat too much.",
