It does sync well to the AT signal and is beautiful. If it had better hands it would be great. But as is it cost to much, especially with the bracelet. If you get one, go ahead and order a leather band to wear it with. Oh yeah and the lug with is 23mm so good luck finding a new band. There aren\u2019t many choices.",

A check of the serial number showed the watch I was shipped was at least 2, and probably 3, full release cycles old. I assume the supplier bought a lot of surplus inventory for pennies on the dollar from a bankrupt retailer. It's a good thing the return was free, including shipping. Definitely don't waste your time.",

I live in a transmission dead spot, only 1 tv channel, no cell, and yet the watches both pick up the clock signal and sync. This watch looks to be slightly more sensitive than the other. The only down side I see is I seem to press the top button through normal motion on occasion putting the watch into stopwatch mode by accident, and the lack of a luminous dial. Beyond that it is a winner.",

The second watch I received looked new but the second hand has again a slight offset with the printed mark. That would be OK for a $15 watch, it's not for a $450 watch. Other than that the watch is beautiful. The radio sync does not work during the day in Boston, but it works perfectly at 2am (auto-sync) so I can't complain.",

The face is large without being gaudy and is clutter free unlike most other watches in its class; it only has dials for what you need and care about. The butterfly clasp sometimes comes halfway undone when you bend your wrist just right which is my only complaint.",
