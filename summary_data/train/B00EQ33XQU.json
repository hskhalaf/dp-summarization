The claw was meant to open and close when you squeeze the handle mechanism but when I did that, nothing happens! Terrible seller, horrible defective product. It\u2019s going back!",

I found them instructive on getting the right technique. We have giant papaya. The picker works on them without damaging the fruit. Because of the extension required to pick the papaya, having a second person on the receiving end is helpful. The papaya are very heavy when they are so large. There are predrilled holes in the extension arm. They lock in. You must lock in to operate the squeeze grip. Overall, this has been well worth the money and I'm very happy.",
