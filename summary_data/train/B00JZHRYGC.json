There have been a few times when I've had to break suddenly and even at speeds under 50 mph, my purse, groceries, etc. go flying but not my precious buddy. I just ordered a 2nd tether strap, to introduce a friend and his new dog to good safety gizmos. One of the best things is that I got 24 hr delivery, so we can pick up the dog from rescue and already have the necessary gizmos in place.",

The length allows her to stick her head out the window a bit or lay down without worrying about her ending up on my lap or out the window. :) My dog is a medium sized terrier mix around 35 pounds. Also, I find this strap works much better than inserting the seatbelt through the harness, as she always managed to get all tangled up that way. Because this strap is attached above her head and to her back, she is able to turn around and change positions easily.",
