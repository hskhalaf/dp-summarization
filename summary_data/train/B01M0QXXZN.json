Bought them to brace / cushion loose bed frame against wall to prevent damage to the wall. Worked better than expected, the yoga block texture grips the wall a bit, perfectly fits behind the framing so it nestles in and is hidden, completely absorbs pressure so the bed doesn\u2019t squeak and the wall stays in tact. Awesome.",

I'm also pregnant and needed a block to sit on for my stretches. These are a bit thicker than I would like but that's ok they'll still work. They're very firm which is good I think. Also it came in a 2 pack which I found extremely awesome since I sat on one and it wasnt quit wide enough so I put them together and it works perfectly. There was one tiny imperfection on one of the blocks but they're foam so it's no big deal to me",

Now we slide a block under heavy bi-fold doors on the lanai (porch) keeping them in an open position. Previously, we used custom-cut wood blocks as stops, but they deteriorated in the rain and got a little slimy. The yoga blocks are much prettier, lighter weight, and can be cut to size with a table saw or perhaps an electric carving knife. When cut, you can see that the block is uniformly dense.
