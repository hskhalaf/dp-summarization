Now I can't read the time to set the device. In hindsight, that display runs 24/7, which may be the problem. Nelson should consider implementing some sort of stand-by mode to extend the life of the display.",

I am violating both #2 (60 psi is pretty low) and #3. So far so good, but folks should be informed of these \"restrictions\".",

I'd give it five stars, except that it uses an instant-on/instant-off switch, unlike the older Nelson timers that had a rotating ball valve. Ball valves turn the water on and off over the period of a few seconds. This one snaps it on/off, and if you've been running a large volume of water through it, the pipes in your home will shudder like they're about to explode. This is called \"water hammer\", and apparently it CAN break pipes. So...I limit the use of this particular device to very LOW flow applications. And for that purpose, it's great.",
