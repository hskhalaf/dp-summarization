As for its function, this item does dispense consistent teaspoon-sized servings of powder or granules. I use it for sugar and Splenda, but it could be also used for cocoa powder, matcha, or spices.",

It's really hard to fill it due to the slightly bigger particles of coconut sugar and the higher humidity. It would be nice to have a wider opening for the refill. I do love that it let out little quantity of sugar at a time, my daughter loves to use it on her pancake and oatmeal and just one or 2 pushes is all what she needs. No waste",

I am a very careful person, but the refill opening is extremely small and you basically need a funnel to refill it properly without making a mess. And on top of that it does not function very well. It sticks often and sugar leaks out of the bottom every time you pick it up.",

If you put the cap back on every time there is no leakage, I just pop the cap off and tap it on my cup so that the tiny bit of granules sitting in the cap go right in my cup. I dropped my dispenser and broke the top so am purchasing my second one today.",
