It fit well, I recommend ordering a cover that fits the size of your trailer, don't order a size bigger. It's been on all winter in the wind, rain, snow and sleet. No tares or worn areas. The key to these covers are to protect them from sharp edges and corners and a proper fit on your trailer.",

We decided to keep it since it was scheduled to rain for the following week and we wanted to put the cover on while the whole trailer was dry. Thank goodness for duct tape.",

This particular one will not hold up in the Florida sun and wind. I think perhaps the previous ADCO covers I had were premium version because they lasted for 2 1/2 - 3 years. Even those started looking weathered and had some tears after 18-mponths to 2 years. This one last just 14 months and the entire roof portion is in shreds. So if you live in the deep south, probably not the cover for you unless you're willing to replace it annually.",

This cover is essentially a parachute when in windy conditions.. Additionally, make sure you pad every sharp corner with something. I used painters tape. Cinch the binding clips down to avoid the cover rubbing and moving. The weighted throws for the under clips are nice but you need to have an clear throw. I had weeds and grass in my way. Overall, this cover looks great but is not the easiest for one person to install. I would recommend using two or more people to install.",

In a sense it may prevent you from over tightening, but do wish they were a little more rugged. Will update the review after the winter to see how it held up. Material seems pretty good and thick though so hoping it works out well.",

Not only did it rip easier at the corners, but the material was brittle and deteriorated. It wasn't as much the wind, as it was the UV that seems to have destroyed this one. I had a feeling when i bought it that it wouldn't last as long as the Tyvec. It just felt thinner all the way around.",

Only caution is if you have the drip gutters at the top end of your RV, you will want to do a thorough job of covering them up with bubble wrap or similar. I covered 4, and being in a rush, the bubble wrap eventually slipped away and the gutter eventually poked a hole in the cover. I think I can repair, but overall quite satisfied. Have seen no mildew, etc, under cover.",

It was covered by the factory warranty. Instead of a free replacement I upgraded to the ADCO 34843 Designer Series Gray/White 24' 1\" - 26' DuPont Tyvek Travel Trailer Cover. Customer service was excellent. They only required a couple pictures and manufacturing date for the warranty claim. Fast response to the inquiry. Received the new cover within a week.

It did a very good job protecting the cover. Gorilla tape helps with the tears. Placing the clear tape both on the front and rear of the tear. I think this cover will only last two years if l'm lucky. I will say ADCO makes a good wheel cover. I'd be willing to pay more for a more durable material.
