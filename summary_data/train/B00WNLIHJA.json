This device cuts so much it cannot be equalized properly. Terrible sounding thing overall. I doesn't expected much with this price, though. Just didn't expected it to be actually worse, than built-in. If you desperately need a preamp, you can buy it, I guess, but I recommend to try something else, maybe from higher price range.

GET THIS and a bluetooth speaker with volume control and a few equalizer music presets and your good to go! The other route we would have spent $160. We already had a nice bluetooth speaker so the GOgroove Mini Phono Turntable Preamp and a $6 cable was the perfect solution. Teenage daughter is happy......... this week. Dad too, $36 smile.",
