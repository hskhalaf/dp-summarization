      "text": "I live in CA really close to the beach. The house I'm renting doesn't have air conditioning and it gets hot! I bought a window air conditioner for my casement window....slides horizontally instead of up and down. As you can see in the picture....you can't lower the blinds over the A/C unit. I was trying to figure out a way to close the gap next to the air conditioner. These work perfect! You can trim them to size and simply stick them to the bottom of your installed blinds. Doesn't look perfect, but good enough! They keep the sun and heat out and give you privacy. Very happy!",

The stickies did not hold the first day, the shade dropped over night. Not sure if perhaps the they don't stick well to the type of oil based paint that is on the inside frame of my window? Not to despair, I pressed it back up and then pushed several evenly spaced white thumbtacks to secure it. Works great now, and lets plenty of light in. Very pleased even though I had to modify it a bit. Considering another one for the spare room. The price is right.",

Like the fabric but the 2 clips that come with it are not large enough to get the entire 72\" in them so that the shade can go all the way up during the day. It leaves about 15\" hanging from the top which is not acceptable. Also, 4 clips should be used for this heavier shade (vs paper shade) to prevent sagging on the 36\" or larger width. Any suggestions on what apparatus I can use to get all the shade up? These clips work fine on the 72\" paper shade, just not the fabric one.",

You peel the backing and stick them to the wall. Stick them crooked, not a big deal you can gently peel and fix it. They are a fabric blind not plastic, which after plastic blinds is a relief. No pesky slits to deal with, or strings to pull. They are crease-folded and stretch out with a gentle tug. They gently diffuse sunlight and the clips to hold them up are fairly thick and not heavy.
