      "text": "I have slightly larger ears than the average person and these headphone fit over nicely without causing any discomfort. I have only worn them in the gym so far and they were fine on cycling, running and rowing! They connected straight away via bluetooth and the buttons are easy to use unlike some other headphones I have had. The sound quality was good and a decent amount of bass. The \u2018cans\u2019 are a lot slimmer than the hesh 2 which I preferred making them a lot less bulky. If I were to mark them down anywhere it would be that they feel a little lightweight/ plasticy- but I suppose it\u2019s a trade off product weight v feeling cheap??!!",

I have relatively small ears but find them pressing into the cartiledge and hurting after a few hours. The only great thing about them is that the battery lasts a long time, they are versatile as they come with a cable too and they look nice. For \u00a350 I'm very disappointed with the sound quality.

Not the easiest location for glue either as it is close to the actually ear piece. I'll avoid Skull-candy again due to this, and although I'd read this issue existed in some reviews at the time, assumed as an adult a bit of care would help avoid the issue. They have been in a decent case and only used for work.",
