Unless you have a continuous row of cabinets, you need a separate converter and dimmer for each separate cabinet section. The \u201ckit\u201d comes with only one of each. I have 4 separate sections of cabinets meaning I had to order three extras to the tune of $45. What makes me mad is I would have ordered extras if this manufacturer had not concealed these facts to entrap me.",

The quality of the components exceeded my expectations. The color temperature is what I wanted (5000K). I used the double stick tape to mount the lights. Excellent collection of accessories. Small adhesive backed lead holder to dress the leads. I didn't need to use the extension cords. Refrig is to the left in the photo. Plugged the PS into the AC outlet used to power the refrig and then drilled a hole in the cabinet to route the PS lead to the switch. Installation took 30 minutes. Very happy with this kit.",

Had to buy the right angle drill attachment below to run the cable through the cabinet shelves. Also bought these just because of how my cabinets are all arranged.

If they had specified, I would have purchased two separate sets. The deal breaker for me was the size of the transformer.

The main downside is the ~0.75sec lag when you turn it on. I hooked up a set to a light switch and the delay is so bad it causes people to flip the switch on/off thinking it's not working.

It was super easy to install and the color of the light has just the correct amount of warmth without being too yellow. For a similar package, I was quoted about 5X the price at a local lighting store, so these are an exceptional value. There is no buzzing when they are dimmed and the mounting tapes and cable ties hold REALLY well. I will be ordering additional pieces for our garage workbench and dark closets.",

      "text": "I read ALLOT of reviews of LED light sets on Amazon before I bought this one. The 1\u2019 long fixtures are neatly assembled from off the shelf components. The cables and barrel connectors are goid quality CATV cimponents. The 12v 2A power supply is made by a supplier that gets good reviews on Amazon for priducts sold under two-year warranties. The kit carries a two-year warranty and has a better price than other kits with two-year warranties. It is easy to split the 12 little 333 lumen fixtures into smaller sets and drive them with 12 VDC power supplies. We have a drawer fulll of 12V2A power supplies from buying external hard drive units used in pairs for back ups.",
