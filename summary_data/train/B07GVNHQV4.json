      "text": "LOVE the battery life now that it is the same as the play. The faster CPU is always nice. The expandable SD Micro slot and 64 GB on board makes this a wonderful device to have for photos, downloads, etc. The fingerprint scanner went from the front to the side. The issue is that every time I picked it up or handled it, I was touching the scanner and inadvertently unlocking it too often. Love the opened up front though, with the swipe actions for back, windows/apps, home, etc. I used that on my Z2 Force, but the new layout makes it easier to use.",

Great seller great price.",
