Unfortunately you have to keep a close eye on each hook while knitting, because the yarn will sometimes skip a stitch leaving a hole in your project. I've been trying to make sure I follow all the directions exactly, as they explain how to use the knitting machine, and it still skips stitches even when it looks like the yarn has been hooked. So, I'm not 100% a fan of this machine, but it might be great for kids just learning about knitting.",
