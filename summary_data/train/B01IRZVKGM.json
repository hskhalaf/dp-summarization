      "text": "Enjoyed this product thoroughly for about 2 weeks until the first rubber piece \"split\". Overall this was still a great product for 3-6 months. As the rubber pieces started failing, the product became increasingly unstable. The alignment would slip and you would have to reassemble the unit, but it was still effective when put back together. In less than a year though, all but one of the rubber pieces have split and 2 of the plastic pieces threaded through them have broken off rendering the product useless.",

I also like how you can tilt back and forth with your legs, it keeps me preoccupied. I don\u2019t like the foot rests that are completely stiff and without the ability to rock your feet. I highly recommend buying this product.",
