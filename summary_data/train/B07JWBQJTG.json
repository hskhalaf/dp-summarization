Battery was drained within a couple days due to the switch issue. I asked first for company to replace and they are slow to approve a defective lock if at all. They have yet to respond to that decision. Be aware that the rubber seal on the shaft may be too thick for holes.",

Also says it is a trial version (which after paying for the lock you should get the full app). I think its a bit expensive to have these silly issues but the lock itself works great!",

Bluetooth works well, NFC works well, you can use with multiple NFC tags. Battery life is epic, with many others having to be charged every month or two. I rarely write reviews, but this one is well worth it, and recommend it highly for those who have been looking forward to a combo or key padlock replacement.",
