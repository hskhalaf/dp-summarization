I really love the 2 handles on the leash so I can pull her closer when passing people on the trail. It all seems strong and well made, which is what I need for my dog (she\u2019s 105lbs). It adjusts nicely so my husband and I can switch off. It\u2019s so nice to be hands free bc on certain hikes, I like to use trekking poles. A lot of people hate leashing their dogs for hiking but there are rules we need to follow and this leash will help.",

For us the bungee absorbed minimal tension from him pulling but it was still super neat to walk/ jog him hands free. Everything was great until it the bungee cord broke today while jogging with him, I honestly would've thought the clasp would've break first. I walk/ jog him with this about 2-3 times a week about 30 minute each time so it has been used at most 30 times before it broke. Needless to say I'm really disappointed at the quality of it.",

The bungee gives them some warning that they nearing the end of their leash, as the traditional leash seemed to cause them discomfort when it would suddenly tighten. The bungee is more comfortable for us, but also for our wonderful dogs. I would definitely recommend this leash.",

I tried another brand but it was way to stiff and too tight. Tried this one since it has more give to the bungee leash as my golden pulls, but not to hard. This works perfectly. When he does pull, it stretches just right. The waste belt stays tight and doesn't loosen up while running. The only negative is that is could be about a foot longer. I solved that by adding a short section of cord. Using a harness and this leash makes for great running.",

      "text": "Works really well! I chose this one since there was a metal ring on each side to keep the belt from coming off. I have a very strong dog and also board bully breeds and larger dogs. With this leash I can walk three decently sized dogs without an issue. The bungee helps with controlling the excitement of them pulling to pee on tree or greet another dog. I highly recommend this leash in particular. Very good quality and has extra D-ring for poo bag or another leash depending on the situation.",

For some reason, she doesn't pull as much when I use this and I really like that I can also hold the leash handle for a second support. The bungie is great so that I feel her pull before she knocks me over! Much better handling and super cool clolors! Super Great.",

The piece for your thumb on the snap, that you push down to open the clip, broke during the biatholon. But we can still use it. We have been using the leashes for bite work training and they are really nice. Overall, it really helped with the biatholon and I will probably use them to train for the next biatholon and get me a new set before the actual race.",

I have a border collie puppy who's only 30 pounds, but if she bolts towards something the leash does absorb most of the shock.
