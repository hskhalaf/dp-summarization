So the case is breaking and their website doesn't work. Pretty disappointed. I guess I will try and return through Amazon.",

You can mount a glass protector but this raises the viewing area to even with the wallets raised edges. If you drop the wallet on the phone face it will hit on the glass protector certain to cause damage if it hits a hard surface. Other than that I liked the storage area with the magnetic flap. I was able to get 4 cards and some folding money inside. However, I returned it without using it because of the flaw. If the manufacturer would redesign to fix that problem I\u2019d buy it and use it.",

The first lasted well over two years, and probably would have lasted a lot longer if it weren't for the fact that A) I crammed way more cards into it than you're supposed to, and B) I drop my phone daily. Sometimes multiple times in a day. I think that either of these alone would not have been a problem for this sturdy little case, but even so, it still lasted longer than any case I've ever had. It's got a good grip, and works well with the car mounts I've used. I would highly recommend it.",

The added functionality for magnetic car mount is great. Only negative side is that it is very bulky. Given it supports this many cards (up to 3) you got to compromise one way or another.

However if you want storage in your case then you may have to forfeit on smooth edges which I was willing to overlook. Seems durable and with the extra feature of a stand that my previous case did not have I am thoroughly impressed and satisfied. Also with PRIME my order was processed and delivered in less than 24 hours!",

      "text": "I wanted a wallet-style case for my phone, but I also wanted to be able to use my phone as a phone, and to be able to take pictures easily, etc. This fits the bill very nicely. The card slot in the back is secured really well with the magnetic cover. The case does add bulk to the iPhone, but not unpleasantly so. The case materials have a nice look and feel to them; nothing shabby or shoddy about them. Finally, the way the wallet cover folds into a little stand is ingenious, and just makes this perfect wallet + case combination.",

The problem, don\u2019t count on too much drop protection. Waist high drop to garage floor and corner of screen shattered. Not a direct hit to glass since there is a mark where it landed on the plastic surround of the case. 3 Star because it is a good case, just not great at drop protection.",

I have a feeling I will need to drop carrying th emergency cash because I believe it would be too easy to pull it out inadvertently as I am pulling my cc out. Perhaps as I get a little more comfortable getting my card in and out I will change my opinion on that.",
