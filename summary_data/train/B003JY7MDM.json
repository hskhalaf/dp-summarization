This tool has a sliding collar that engages and release a ball that hold the tip in place. I returned the tool because the collar would not slide over the ball, therfore the tip does not lock in. I returned this item and received the full price without problems from the seller.",

      "title": "Fast deburring on aluminum tubing",
      "text": "This works really good on deburring the inner diameter on aluminum tubing - even holes as small as 5/16's can be deburred, maybe smaller- and it does it rather quickly- The blades must be made from a hardened tool steel because they're still deburring after hours of use. I like the fact that I will only have to purchase the blades in the future and not a whole new tool. I find that it's only practical for deburring inside of a drilled hole or at the tube ends- for outer diameter deburring i use a different tool that fits over the end of the tube- either tool or tube can spin to deburr and create a finished look.",

Mine literally rusted up over night and I was shocked BUT works excellent and I do on the flip side love how well it works in deburring not to mention the quick release swap out cutting blades. They swivel easily on curves as well and despite the rust issue above, I would recommend this to hobbyists needing a deburring tool. For what it's worth, I use mine in coin ring making.",

Yesterday when I pulled it out thr sliding collar that locks the bit in no longer moved so the bit just fell out, meaning it was useless. I attempted to repair it but the spring refused to go back into place. It was promptly thrown in the can with the rest of the garbage.

    "description": "Item Package Quantity:1\n\nThe SHAVIV 151-90087 Classic Heavy Deburring Kit E includes one aluminum A handle, one E blade holder, and three E-series blades for heavy duty long-reach deburring of straight edges and hole edges. The aluminum A handle provides strength and wear resistance for heavy duty work and accepts all SHAVIV holders for long-reach applications. The E blade holder holds SHAVIV E-series blades.\n\nThe kit contains one each of E100, E200, and E300 high-speed steel blades. The E100 blade is designed for heavy duty deburring of straight edges and hole edges on steel, aluminum, copper, and plastic. The E200 blade is designed for deburring straight edges and hole edges on brass, cast iron, and plastic. It rotates clockwise as well as counterclockwise. The E300 blade is designed for simultaneously deburring the inside and outside of holes up to 0.24\" thick on steel, aluminum, and copper.\n\nDeburring cutters are hand tools used to remove sharp edges and small unwanted bumps, also known as burrs, from material. The cutter typically consists of two pieces: a handle and a blade. The handle holds a blade that is typically made from high-speed steel, carbide, or ceramic, and may have a coating to extend its life or for work on tougher materials. The blades have different designs for deburring in a range of applications, such as straight edges, hole edges, through-holes, slots, and corners. A blade holder can be connected to a handle to hold the blade for long-reach work.\n\nVargus manufactures cutting, grooving and deburring tools under the Vardex, Groovex, and SHAVIV brand names. The company, founded in 1960 and headquartered in Nahariya, Israel, meets International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard 9001:2000.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX?\n * (1) Aluminum A handle\n * (1) E blade holder\n * (1) E100 blade\n * (1) E200 blade\n * (1) E300 blade",
