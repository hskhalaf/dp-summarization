The support is great and I will re-order when they break down but going on a year and they're still good.",

I relied on the name brand and the type of company this is known for and expected the best... but nope... its sucks. And I don't always wanna wear the Teva Original Sandal, just wanted a comfy non-slip sandal. Disappointed. NOT GOOD FOR: The beach, the lake, the river, the pool, the after a shower walk to the bedroom, rain, standard foot moisture, and everyday use where getting wet or moisture is a possibility.",

The footbed is also really comfortable and the perfect balance of soft for comfort, but firm enough to provide support. The only reason for 1 less start is that the inside straps by the arch of your feet may get in the way. I.e. you step on them when walking. Though admittedly I haven't had flip flops in years and it may just need some getting used to.",

Also the thong between the toes chafes uncomfortably. The only reason I am not giving them one star is that the flip flops have not come apart yet.

Two concerns: They are folding upwards. Not that big of a concern because they flatten out as you wear them. They are very slippery on marble, wet or dry. Be careful if it is on a slant as well, you will slip.",

The only different is now im buying online because my local retail shop stop bringing them in.",

I was so thrilled to see they hadn't discontinued the Mush footbed I had to order a new pair. At first you think they're just another sandal, then after you wear them for a month or so, the footbed compresses and they feel like they mold to your feet. Then they become like a permanent memory foam and stay customized to your foot shape. I know I'll have these for years just like my old original Teva Mush sandals. They're the very best!!!",

The only complaint I have is that there is a logo tag on the heel of the top of both flip flops, and you can feel it while you're wearing them. It would have been so much better for them to put the tag on the cloth part and not the foam part. I haven't worn these for more than a few hours at a time but I have no other complaints about them.",
