They're just stocking caps, right? I was so wrong. Besides the color matching, these things are not snagging, ripping, running, or doing anything that a normal stocking cap would do when poked with wig combs daily. I can barely see the hole that I forced with the wig comb. I'm impressed. Oh and they're big head friendly.",

I was dying my hair dark brown to hide my grays so I applied my dye as usual and then had an idea to put one of the caps on while massaging in the dye. The cap color was perfectly dyed so I did it with 3 more for future use. When I rinsed the cap, the color stayed. So in conclusion, dye the cap when you color your hair or just dye the cap if you don't color your hair. either way, the cap dyes well.",
