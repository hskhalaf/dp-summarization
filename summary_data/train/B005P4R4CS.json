      "text": "We bought this bassinet and used it until my daughter was 5 months. I found it to be very sturdy and she slept well in it until she was too tall for it. She is big for her age or we could have kept her in it longer. I liked the color scheme its very neutral. I used the under storage for extra diapers and blankets. My favorite part was that the basket pulls out. I took the basket with me outside so she could sleep while her sister played on her playset. Overall I found it to be a great purchase and would buy again.",

I liked being able to use the basket in different places if necessary. Put it next to me on the bed for the 1st week he was home and transitioned onto the base next to our bed. Mattress is thin, but never seemed to affect his comfort level.",

We only used it for three weeks and then put our son in his crib, but it worked out well while we had it. I liked how it didn't take up much space as our bedroom as space is at a premium.

Also both pieces didn't include the inserts in the bottom of the legs for the casters. I'd send the whole thing back if I wasn't overseas.",
