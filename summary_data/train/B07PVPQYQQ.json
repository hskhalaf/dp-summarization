I would say overall for a size 14 it fits a little bit smaller than expected, which was probably right on since I usually wear a 13.5.

FlyteFoam\u2122 Midsole technology provides superior bounce back and responsiveness for any distance It utilizes organic fibers that help reduce packing out that can normally happen with softer, low-density foams. Guidance Line\u00ae technology employs a vertical flex groove that decouples the tooling along the line of progression for maximum stride efficiency. Guidance Trusstic System\u00ae integrates Guidance Line construction to enhance gait efficiency while promoting mid-foot structural integrity. HG10MM\u00ae Heel Gradient shifts body mass forward reducing the strain on lower limbs.
