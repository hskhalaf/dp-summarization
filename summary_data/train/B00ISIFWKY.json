I hang it places I'd have never thought to put a speaker as I working in the warehouse or on cars, and it's great! I'd love a way to link multiple of these together, even if they are on the same channel. There is really something to be said for battery power here... I have and enjoy daily whole-home Sonos, but for work this is perfect!",
