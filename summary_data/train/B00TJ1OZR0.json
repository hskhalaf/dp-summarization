My son's smoker ( also a Masterbuilt) lasted less than a year. Unless the company can fix this issue, we will not be buying another smoker from Masterbuilt.",

They then send you more parts but is still not fixing the problem instead of just giving me a new one I have now spent $300 and have no smoker And master built wont do anything. I also purchased the extended warranty through Square trade but they won\u2019t touch it until after the year warranty is up",

Get the connection and all is well while I'm standing right in front of the smoker as soon as I get foot inside to get out of the summer heat, bluetooth shuts down. If I have to stand in front of the unit anyway, why have Bluetooth? WiFi would be a MUCH better option.",

But, that is because I am mostly smoking salmon. For chicken and beef, it worked great without the cold smoke attachment. Highly recommend.",

I have used it 4 times since 11-2017. the last two times the temp goes somewhere over 300 deg. if you shut it off and let it cool it will work ok for about 30 mins and then start grilling food again. Probably just try another brand if Masterbuilt wont help.",
