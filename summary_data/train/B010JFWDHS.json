      "text": "This pump has 2 stages of pumping (which I was unaware of when I bought it). For fast inflation, you unlock the collar on the pump and the pump extends much further; twice as far I believe. This allows much more air per pump. Once you get to a higher pressure, you lock the collar back down and then pump with shorter strokes. I've tested it on my bike before a ride and it works well. This is not a replacement for your full-size pump, but seems like it'll be great when needed on the road!",

The reviews/description might make you think it\u2019s possible and while it may be rated to 120 PSI it is extremely difficult to inflate past 50 psi even with the high pressure setting on the pump. It took me well over 30 minutes to get my tires to 80 PSI (that\u2019s a LOT of pumps). Good for topping up on the road maybe but this will not replace a proper floor pump.",

If your looking for a small but capable pump for home or on the go, you won't go wrong with this pump.",

It's small, light, and easy to carry in your pack, if you don't mount it on your frame.",

The cover flap sucks, and I wish the pump handle locked in place for travel (it slides out very easily), but overall, it's small, light, and pumps the tire up to where I need.

Another thing is that when you're trying to pump air into the tire, it could be hard to pump the air by yourself since it requires some strength to pump air, and the way it is designed doesn't let you use your strength easily. It would help if there's some sort of extender between the air pump and the connector to the tire, unfortunately, that's not included in the package.",
