It's a real pain when applying and you have a tab and stuff attached to your hand because the material wasn't strong enough. I know a lot of people must like the fake-fabric stuff, for many reasons, but for me, fighting with getting them on, plus the leaking/weeping characteristic of that material makes me unenthusiastic.",

Cons: They dont hold as much as molicares, and the padding separates and clumps up when wet, making them uncomfortable after more than just 4 hours. So you either have to just deal with it, or change often. Also, they dont handle fecal incontinence as good as the molicares do.",
