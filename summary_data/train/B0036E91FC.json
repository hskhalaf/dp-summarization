      "text": "I rent a house that is a little over 50 years old and it has the original goldenrod shag carpeting. I use this regularly on the carpets and whenever people come over, they are amazed at how clean the carpets look. The carpets are ugly, don't get me wrong. There is no way to make yellow shag carpeting look pretty, but they sure are clean-looking. The smell of the cleaner isn't overpowering either. So, if you have butt-ugly old carpeting that you want to give a spruce-up, this is an excellent product.",

And it wreaks havoc on your vacuum filters when you're done scrubbing with the brush and have to vacuum up the powder. I seriously doubt my vacuum will ever be the same. Very, very disappointed.",

I did it in half sections as the directions indicated. 2 months later and my rug STILL smells fresh. My vacuum still picks up left over powder, but I\u2019m okay with that because it smells great every time I vacuum. If you have a pet or children or just a hard smell- TRY THIS!!! It works.",
