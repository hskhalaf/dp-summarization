My usual scent of choice is Kitchen Spice, but I ventured out for this one to replace a very expensive Volcano candle someone gifted me for luxurious baths. I was not about to drop $40 on a replacement jar candle, nosirree, so this Yankee candle, on sale of course, fit the bill. The scent is refreshing and sweet, but not too overwhelming, and it reminds me of strolling on the beaches of Hawaii, i.e. heaven. I also love the cute, millennial-pink color, and as always, Yankee candles have many hours of burn in them. I am delighted with this purchase.",

The fragrance is strong enough to be noticeable and pleasant, without overwhelming (probably since it\u2019s floral). I was nervous to buy this because other people seem to have received broken or melted candles. I didn\u2019t have this issue. The candle was in multiple layers of sturdy and supportive packaging. I wouldn\u2019t recommend leaving this product on your doorstep for too long on a warm day... I think that may be how people get melted ones. You can get a notification from amazon when it arrives so that doesn\u2019t happen.",
