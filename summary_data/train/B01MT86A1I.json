The biggest problem I have with it is that the weight fluctuates. I can weigh the same package 4 times and get 4 different weights. The weight varies by ounces which doesn't really matter when shipping UPS. It does matter when I ship with USPS though. So, I've been weighing packages several times, and I go with the highest weight so I don't put to little postage on packages. It also depends on how you place the package on the scale as to what weight you get. So, this scale isn't 100% accurate.",

I needed a new scale that could measure down to a few grams and up to around 50kg. This scale fit the bill. I've been using it pretty regularly now and I'm pleased that it is working well and it's size. I have one complaint: It uses AAA batteries instead of AA. It's not for no space inside the shell. I use probably 6 AAA batteries a year and 30-50 AA so they are always on hand.",

Place the box in the scale and push the hold button take the box off and read the scale display... no need for a remote display.",

As in I can put on the same thing 3 times and get 3 different readings. Also it beeps every time you turn it on, do a reading, press a button, and turn it off. Kind of annoying and I can't find any way to disable it. I imagine it does much better at higher weights.",
