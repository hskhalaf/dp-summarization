A minor negative if you put it in the freezer and are too lazy to put the strap in nicely to stick together and you have to free them apart,not a big deal.I use them three or four times a day ,almost 6weeks after my knee replacement.",

I found that the middle cell was a little lacking in gel, but it was easy to massage the gel from the outer packets into the middle packet, as suggested in the instructions.

It can also do a hot compress that I look forward to trying soon.",
