      "text": "These three pliers are not fancy, not top of the line, but they don't need to be. The bi-metal construction is surprising for such low-priced and mundane tools. Handles are comfortable and grip is fine. Bought these to replace 30-year old pliers that had loosened. I expect these to last that long and be in better shape. My opinion of Stanley tools has improved in the last few years. I don't care if they are made in China, so long as Stanley's specs are demanding and are applied diligently by the manufacturer. That appears to be the case here.",
