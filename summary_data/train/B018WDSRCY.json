Whether one intends to navigate the city or go for a day hike on light trails, this sneaker comes as a reliable companion as it is built with durable materials. This sneaker may be designed to be useful and practical, but Merrell did not fall short in delivering the aesthetic appeal of this silhouette in a lightly built structure. Certainly, this is a good quality sneaker that\u2019s not heavy on the pocket.",
