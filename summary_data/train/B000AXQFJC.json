      "text": "I actually bought this for the receiver only - to add to my existing Logitech \"music anywhere\" system which has the USB dongle to stream mp3s / WMAs from a pc. Now I have two receivers and so now two stereos (home theatre and stereo in back room) at opposite ends of my house can punch out playlists (at different times, can't pair with two bluetooth devices) depending on where I am working or relaxing. I've had both receivers working for close to 9 months now and apart from some very occasional interference from other nearby BlueTooth devices (I suspect in my neighbour's house) they've worked perfectly. Fantastic product, great sound, bargain price. About as good as it gets.",

      "text": "I use it in my bedroom to connect my iPod to my Bose Wave Radio/CD. I keep the iPod on my nightstand and the bose is located across the room (about 15 feet). The bed is between the units, so they do not have line-of-sight connectivity. The wireless bluetooth transmitter is able to locate the unit without issue and trasmits music clearly. This is very convenient since I can now control my iPod at night to listen to music without having to get up to change tracks, etc. I set both the iPod and Bose radio to go to sleep automatically after 90 minutes. The logitech detects when the iPod is off and shuts itself off after a few minutes.",

Instead of your iPod being wired to your stereo and TV (to allow you to see where you are browsing) and having a remote control to browse, the iPod now BECOMES the remote control! The sound quality is excellent... no loss of frequency range at all. It sounds just like it was wired up. And I'm pretty picky about sound quality. Plus, it is not iPod-specific. You can use it with anything outputting an audio signal. I have even used it as a wireless system for my guitar.",
