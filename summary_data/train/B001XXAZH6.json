But it might be important if you are in one of the numerous cities DirecTV does not carry the local HD channels. To me, an HD DVR is pretty useless without the ability to record the big network shows in HD. Meanwhile, this unit does not have dual live buffering like TIVO models. of course, the DirecTivo units don't have the capability to pick up the new HD channels on DirecTV; so everything is a trade-off.",

This is essentially the same as their HR20 unit, except this one isn't equipped with an off-the-air (OTA) tuner. I can get all locals via DirecTV here just north of Boston, so I don't need OTA capability. There's a little bit of a learning curve with the GUI on this box, but, besides that, it's proven to be a rock-solid and dependable unit. I highly recommend this box - especially if you want to receive all of the HD channels DireTV is offering now (which you can't receive with the HR10-250).",

The best part of this is it works with upnp sharing tools like twonkymedia. This allows the receiver to play music, photos and VIDEOs from your media player or Windows MCE. It plays MPEG2 and vob files. Generally speaking VLC does a great job of converting and Twonkymedia for serving. I have been playing movies for months on my HR21 - a great mix of a product.

On the positive side, I do like the black finish and when it works (most of the time), it does work great. DIRECTV is suppose to be getting me a replacement.",

It becomes unresponsive and gets stuck during regular speed playback, or while fast-forwarding, or rewinding. The only way to resolve it is to reset the unit which takes nearly 10 minutes and interrupts and programs being recorded. This is a shoddy attempt by Rupert Murdoch to make more money and force an inferior product on Directv customers. Bring back HD TIVO and stop forcing this garbage on customers.",
