      "text": "These are great but tend to run a little small. I thought I measured correctly and ordered a Larger size than I needed but I should have ordered 2 sizes larger. Apparently I have bigger arms than the average female. What I ended up doing is cutting off the top elastic part that goes above the elbow and it's fine. This is a great deal because it comes with the velcro tennis elbow band also. This is excellent quality with the added bonus of the copper infusion. This compression sleeve is very breathable and I can feel the air moving even through my jacket. I ordered two boxes--one for each elbow as they were both bothering me.",

I am recovering from a bicep tear, so this sleeve gives me the compression and confidence I was looking for. Highly recommend for sports as well as weight training.",

It was wet and wasn't holding as it did earlier in the match. Again, I expected this, but as a male sweat is always an issue and the velcro is unfortunately affected on the elbow brace.
