He couldn't connect the heaphones to his gaming system to interact with his friends online. Overall, I love this product and yes I would recommend this item to a friend.",

They just feel cheap. For what you're paying however I believe they are worth it just be prepared for them to not last as long as some of Skullcandy's other great products.",

I gave them to my brother, because the sound is still awesome, as I expect from skullcandy, and I just gave in and bought a pair of aviators. But for the price the sound quality and construction of these headphones (Which seems very durable) is 100% worth it",
