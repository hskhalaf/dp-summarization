      "text": "This is the perfect drone pad for my Mavic Pro. Because the Mavic is so compact and close to the ground, it's easy for grass, gravel, dust and dirt to interfere with its operation. I looked into leg extensions but heard from others that the extensions affect obstacle avoidance and make it hard to fold. I've used this pad at least 100 times and am very happy with it. It has stakes in case of high winds but have never had to stake it as it is sturdy and stays in place. Folding it is very easy. It is good practice to try and land perfectly on the X!",

The metal ring is very sturdy and while it takes a bit of manipulation to get it back to the folded state, this product turned out to be far better than I was expecting.",

One side note, with it set on the ground, no need to worry about it 'lifting off' and having to be staked down. If it's so windy you need to worry about this pad moving around (let alone blowing away), you're probably not flying your drone anyway.",

Nice design has plenty of contrast for DJI Precision Landing technology and keeps grass and dust/dirt from getting blown or sucked into cooling systems on take-off and landing. The included aluminum hold-down spikes are a nice touch for windy days. Fabric is much heavier and durable than the flimsy nylon used on some portable landing pads. This is a good brand with lots of size options, as well.",

    "description": "FlatHat 32\" collapsible drone pad is suitable for use with DJI Mavic, DJI Phantom 4, 3, 2, 1, DJI inspire, Parrot Bebop and similarly-sized drones. Contents include (1) 32\" FlatHat collapsible drone pad, (3) ground stakes (for windy conditions), (1) fabric carry bag. The FlatHat 32\" (80cm) collapsible drone pad is constructed out of durable, heavy-duty fabric sewn to a flexible spring steel frame. Weighing just 13oz (370g) , the 32\" drone pad collapses to 1/3 of its expanded size, storing quickly in an included carry bag that fits easily into a backpack or laptop sleeve. The 32\" landing pad size is perfect for mid-size consumer drones like the DJI Mavic, Phantom 4, 3, 2, 1, DJI inspire, Parrot Bebop and other similarly sized drones. The drone pad's bold landing pattern provides an easy-to-see target, and the pad can act as a designated 'return-home' location for drones with that capability. Created by ExpoImaging, FlatHat Labs develops cool gear for drone pilots. \"Flat hatting\" was a term coined by world war II pilots to refer to unauthorized low-level flying and stunting. FlatHat products aim to help drone pilots have more fun while flying. Learn more at flathatlabs.Com.",
