The cooking elememt (light) is not surrounded my any guard that could reflect the heat downward. Therefore, the unit only cooks the tops of food placed in it. Example: Meat Loaf did not cook at all on the bottom, and was still raw after the correct amount of time. The top was cooked somewhat. Second try: Baking sweet rolls. Also cooked only of the top, bottom was doughy as was the center. Really not the product we were expecting.",

For my mother I purchased a NuWave Oven for Christmas and so far I feel that this is as good.. It's easy to clean, its really easy to use and I'm quite pleased with my purchase. Right now I can't comment on durability for long-term use, so fingers crossed that it lasts a year. If it does it was definitely worth the money.",
