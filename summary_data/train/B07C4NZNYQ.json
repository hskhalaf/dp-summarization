The instruments that are difficult to reproduce well - the diaphanous saxophone, the wide ranged piano, and the wonder of the voice are all to be heard in their true tonality. This is no small accomplishment. Also remarkable is this speaker's ability to reproduce dense orchestral textures where the listener can easily differentiate the bass and sub-bass instruments such as the contrabassoon and the low clarinets.",

Worth every penny! 07/22/18 Update: I've had these speakers for about 3 weeks now and I continue to be amazed by how good they sound. You can really hear into the recording and get a real sense of the acoustic space. They don't add any artificial bloom to the sound yet sound just right tonally. The bass is not overblown yet really kicks when called for. If you want more bass you could add a good subwoofer and you've got a killer system for around $750.",

Some reviews said Low end was lacking but I find the bass satisfying and adequate for a small room . If your a Bass Head and listen to Rock and HipHop alot then you will need a sub. They look good and Sound Great. Very Happy with this Decision. After alot of browsing and reading reviews I'm glad I took a chance on these.",

I have them running off an older amp that sounds ok an older turntable with a mediocre cartridge and have them on shelves a little too close to the wall and despite all that with a recording that's top notch sonically these sounded pretty amazing. I would guess (and may try) to upgrade my cart and my amp and I would bet these will sound ridiculously good.",

The sound seems to envelope you in the listening space, giving a much larger spatial presence than you would expect from such small speakers. I do recommend the subwoofer if you like heavier bass, but these do a decent job on their own. The aesthetics of the speakers would fit right in with mid-century modern decor, from the wood-grain on the veneers to the rounded shape. They are very beautiful for speakers in the price range. I do like the magnetic grilles, but they are a little soft, and I am not sure that they appropriately protect the speaker cones from potential damage from a modest bump.",
