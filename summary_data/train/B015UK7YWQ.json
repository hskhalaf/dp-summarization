But there are some drawbacks: 1) The inner bag needs to be sewed more firmly as it had got torn in 2 month of use. 2) The outer bag is being made of synthetic so it might be too warm to sit in during a hot season and the fabric gets pulls and snags so after 7 months of use it looks untidily.",

They were loud, sticky, sweaty things that always split at the seams and ended up being a Frankenstein / duct-tape monster in the end. This is VERY different. Beads are small - same used in some types of pillows. There are two shells holding them with the outer shell being a rugged but comfy polyester. This is the same wicking material found on quality sport shirts with an added touch of some spandex. The result is super comfortable - a very nice improvement to the bean bag concept.

They pushed each other off, lifted the sides to dump each other off, jumped on it like a trampoline, and spilled on it. It took the abuse and kept its shape\u2014didn't collapse like the old beanbag chairs we used to have in the 70s. The cover comes off for washing. It doesn't show in the picture, but the cover is a kind of heathery gray - attractive, soft, and smooth.",

Incredibly comfortable (the micro beads really DO mold perfectly to your body) and awesome for kids to play on OR as bonus seating to watch a movie. Since you can adjust it to perfection, this would also be a really nice option for when you need to sleep upright due to a cold.",

This has become a favorite reading or tv watching pillow for my kids and my husband likes it as a footstool.",

Also, we love how the outer skin is not only soft, but slightly stretchy, and is removable for washing.",

I don't know where to keep this because it is kind of awkward, but as far as being comfortable, I like it a lot.",
