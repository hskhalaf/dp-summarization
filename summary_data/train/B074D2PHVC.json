I was skeptical of the active finish (fingerprint resistant) but it's legit, my 2yo opens it about 9 million times a day and it's still print free! The ice maker was extremely slow at first but we looked it up and learned the freezer may need to be set to a colder setting, so my hubby adjusted it and we haven't had any more trouble. It came with plastic covering the surfaces, everything as described, arrived on time and the delivery guys hooked it up with no trouble and were very nice. Highly recommend!!",
