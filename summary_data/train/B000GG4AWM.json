They came in a box and in the box they were in a zipped up travel/storage bag. The skins were a little loose but I think its so they don't get ruined during shipping. It comes with the tools to tighten up the skins. They sound great and the wood is shiny and look beautiful. These are a really quality and perfect for a beginner. I would recommend buying them if you are interested. If you found this review helped you decide, please hit the \"helpful\" button \ud83d\udda4 thanks",

Also, the tension rod brackets on the bottom ring were not welded pallel to the ring.. Even after retuning several times, the gap was still there. I never could get a good sound out of them.
