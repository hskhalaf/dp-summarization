Second the foam in the heel is lower on the instep, making the runners posture lean to the inside (pigeon toed on the right foot). Third, the 10.5 shoe is no where near a D width on the right foot - maybe an A or B width to the toe is really tight across the top despite having extra length. Of course the red tennis shows look great so if that's what you need, go for it - just don't try to run in them or wear them for more than 1 hour.",

I get the impression that these shoes were manufactured to fit a particular price range, so some compromises were made to keep costs down. Still, at least the cheap bits are easily, and commonly, replaced.",

To be fair, I do have custom insoles for my flat-feet, but they're not exactly that thick, which is why it surprises there's such a lack of ankle support. It hasn't caused any issues yet, but it is concerning for when I do more strenuous exercises such as hiking. Time will tell overall, but otherwise I think these are a fantastic pair of shoes.",
