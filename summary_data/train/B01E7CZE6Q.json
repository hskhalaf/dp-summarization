The one thing I like most is that you can see clearly thru window, better than previous micros. Hopefully it will last longer than the others.",

Is plenty large enough to hold a standard dinner plate. As mentioned in other reviews (and also the user manual) you must peel off the protective film from the outside of the unit, not a big deal but if you leave the protective plastic on it, it's possible (I think) to block the vents on the side of the unit. I'd buy it again.",
