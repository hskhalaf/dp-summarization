I removed the insole to see if something was under it, but whatever was there was inside the sole (the area under the insole is pressed paper, by the way). Anyway, I sent them back for a replacement. I received the replacement a few days later only to see that the leather on the side has a hole in it, and I'm not sure how it passed a simple visual inspection. Anyway, I was 0-2 on these and I'm not trying for the trifecta. They're cheap price-wise, but even cheaper quality-wise. Order at your own risk.",

      "text": "I walk in the Mojave desert for a living. These boots are pretty good, and really cheap. I got both the 6\" and 8\" and like them both. With some gel insoles they are super comfortable. The zipper is superfluous on the 6\" and and a likely weak point, so I don't use them; on the 8\" it makes it easy to take them off at breaktime. The soles are relatively soft and get beat up by rocks, so, shoe-goo. Otherwise so far so good; I haven't had any trouble with the uppers or with feared delamination. So so much better than similarly-priced options at Wal-Mart (Ozark Fails). No half sizes is a drag, I need thick sox.",

They included a pair of boot socks and some inserts for the boots which was a welcome surprise. The boots fit great and are very comfortable. The air holes make the boots breathable and not hot for my feet. I am very happy with this purchase and the product and customer service. I spent 15 years in the Marines and these boots remind me of my moon boots I used to wear. All around great experience. Will definitely recommend and rebuy in the future.",
