Slight delay when you honk because the compressor takes a split second to fire up, but it's faster than i expected. Mounted mine on the frame crossbar under the radiator with extensions on the stock horn wires. I recommend angling the horn slightly downward so it can't collect water.",

Down the road, I honked it again for the hell of it. 10-min into my drive home, some idiot cut me off so I 'attempted' to honk it: Nothing... radio silence. But for $27, what could I possibly expect?
