My next project is a greenhouse and I will use this saw for this project and all the others who will follow.",

I've used a few other \"budget friendly\" jigsaws in the past that felt as if they were going to either vibrate themselves to death or break the saw blade off before you cut through your workpiece. Neither of those sentiments are true here. This thing has all the beans. I really like the little hex key holder built into the rear of the saw too, for those moments when you need a quick blade change.",

Did what I should have in the beginning and bought this wonderful little saw. Does everything you need and is actually MORE than most of us will require. You can buy a more powerful jig saw if you wish but I have used this repeatedly on 3/4 oak plywood and with a good Bosch blade it just sails right through. I bought the Ryobi while in a hurry and essentially wasted $30. Buy this saw and chances are you will be using it ten years from now if you are a casual user like me.",
