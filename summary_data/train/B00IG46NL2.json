    "description": "Style:Standard\n\nThe Mitutoyo 500-196-30 digital caliper has a 0 to 6\" (0 to 150mm) measuring range with 0.0005\" (0.01mm) increments for precision and an advanced onsite sensor (AOS) electromagnetic inductive sensor for resistance to dirt, oil, and water. Its digital readout LCD shows inch or metric units for versatility, and allows either absolute or incremental measurement readings. The electronic caliper measures inside, outside, depth, and step values for versatility and includes a protective case and SR44 silver oxide battery.\n\nDigital calipers are measuring instruments commonly used for inspection in manufacturing to provide the precise measurements of an object. A pair of jaws attached to a long beam with a marked scale is used to take inside, outside, and step measurements. An additional depth probe slides along the beam to take depth measurements. One jaw is fixed to the end of the scale, while the other jaw slides along it with gearless precision to take measurements. The reading is electronically generated and displayed on a digital, high-resolution screen as a single value. Digital calipers can take differential measurements, which are used to determine the difference in measurements between two objects, by zeroing the display at any point along the scale. Some digital calipers can switch between standard and metric units, and some can output readings to a computer or printer for recording measurements. Compared to dial calipers, digital calipers provide measurements that are faster, easier, and more error-free, but they are more fragile mechanically and electronically, and do not resist coolant well. Vernier calipers are more durable than digital calipers because they do not have internal moving parts, but they can be more difficult to read. Digital calipers are commonly used in fields such as metalworking, mechanical engineering, machining, carpentry, and medicine.\n\nMitutoyo manufactures precision measuring tools, metrology equipment, and related systems. The company, founded in Tokyo in 1934, formed Mitutoyo America Corporation in 1963 with headquarters in Aurora, IL.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX?\n * Electronic caliper\n * SR44 battery\n * Protective case",
