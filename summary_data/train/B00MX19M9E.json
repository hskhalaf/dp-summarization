This works exactly like the spa version as far as sweat goes and it 100% relieved my joint pain. Keep in mind the price it is great for what you pay. The chair is uncomfortable and I will probably get a stool but other than that this is a winner!!!",

Update: I have used this sauna for about 15 months, daily, and this week the side panel went out, so the unit no longer heats enough to provide any benefits.
