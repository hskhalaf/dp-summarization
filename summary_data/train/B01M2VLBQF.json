If you get this you might order metal clips to avoid being out fishing and have your fish finder malfunction due to broken clips.",

Installation is a bit tricky for a first timer like me, but was manageable with some careful attention to the instructions before and during the installation process.",

Updated maps and getting maps for your favorite lake is really easy. My one issue with this unit is the SONAR that ships with it. The unit is a very capable digital SONAR CHIRP which provides better fidelity than the standard dual-band frequency. If you go on Huminbird's website, a replacement dual band SONAR is $10 less than the SONAR with the CHIRP capabilities. Why would they not include a CHIRP capable SONAR especially with only a $10 price difference?",
