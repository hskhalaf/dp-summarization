      "verdict": "Trail frequenters have a lot to love in the Trail 2650 GTX. Indeed, the shoe\u2019s resplendent comfort can woo in even the most skeptic of customers. It is also a remarkably lightweight hiking footgear that offers highly dependable water protection and arch support. That said, its narrowness might come as a big no-no for individuals with extra stout feet. Nonetheless, the Danner Trail 2650 GTX is a phenomenal piece whose qualities make it too irresistible a product to ignore.",

        "Based on several reports, the hiker\u2019s arch support is super reliable",
        "This Danner product is a relentlessly waterproof shoe, say a couple of buyers",

The shoe was still too narrow, which is disappointing for me because I wanted to wear them. So, Danner knows the shoe is manufactured too narrow but yet they have not corrected this design flaw. The shoe is expensive but if they are made in the USA, I could live with that but they are made off-shore and not the USA.",
