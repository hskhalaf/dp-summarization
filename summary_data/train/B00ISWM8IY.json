      "text": "Was in a car accident yesterday on I-4 outside of Tampa. All cars were stopped and this guy was speeding and did not stopped. He hit us and we flew into the median. Luckily, everyone was wearing a seatbelt, including our dog. We have this seatbelt for my 30 lb puppy. I can honestly say this saved her from getting hurt. Can't imagine what would have happened if she wasn't wearing it. I can honestly say this product works since I just went through a car wreck with my dog strapped in. My dog is completely fine today. Highly recommend this product. Have two of these for both cars. Remember to always buckle up your pet!",

I had the back windows down halfway to keep him occupied, and he quickly jumped out into an intersection for me to chase him down.",

Unlike other models it can be used in any car because it doesn't rely on the seatbelt receiver to work.",

My only suggestion to Kurgo (which is minor) is to include some kind of clip or band for adjust the length of the leash. Some cars are taller and others are shorter, so it would be nice to adjust the leash length in such a way that the leash doesn't have a lot of \"extra\" flopping around. Otherwise, this is a well-designed product.",

      "text": "I searched high and low for the best restraint system for our dog as we went on a 2,500 mile road trip. I ended up choosing this system because it seemed to be the most durable. I attached it to the hooks above the backseat doors and used it as a zip line our dog could freely move back and forth. It worked very well except for when our dog would turn around. The leash would get wound up so we would have to unwind it. It wasn't a big deal at all, but it is something to be aware of.",
