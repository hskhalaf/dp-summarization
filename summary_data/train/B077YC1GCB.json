It fits great and does give a bit of a lift from the padding underneath without looking fake or too busty. I had a Maidenform strapless underwire but without that bit of padding underneath\u2014-it was not flattering. This one is perfect.",

      "text": "This is my first time buying a bra online, and I bought it through the Try Before You Buy just in case. I don\u2019t wear it with straps so that says a lot about how well it holds up. It does have a \u201csticky\u201d strip across the top of the cups to keep them in place (the kind you normally see on the sides of the bra) so that took some getting used to. It took about 2 weeks of wearing it exclusively to break it in, but it\u2019s comfortable now. I\u2019m definitely buying another, because with my luck, they\u2019ll stop making something as soon as I find something that fits right.",

I ordered 32B one size smaller to what I normally wear and it fits perfect. My only concern is about the packaging which was very bad,without protection which gave some denting on the padding,but I am keeping it as I like it very much. Hope they concentrate on their packaging when they have such good product.",

Makes it dig in on both sides for mild discomfort- works well as a strapless, as long as you fill the cup, if not, it sticks out, but that's any strapless bra.
