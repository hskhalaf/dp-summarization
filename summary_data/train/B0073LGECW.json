I will say though, this stuff lasts forever, so if you just need a mild clean, this will do the trick.

It was kind of stuck in my washer so that after I switched back to a regular detergent, there were still some white streaks. Took about 4 loads to clean the washer. I like the idea of a natural, simple product but also want good results. We have hard water so that probably affected the success of the powder. Sorry!",

After opening the bag and smelling the peppermint I was looking forward to the smell on my clothes but it did not carry over. It\u2019s fine really. I have had to use 2 scoops instead of one on most of my loads. As of now I like it and plan on using the entire bag, with the intention of repurchasing!",

I had been using 7th Generation and OxiClean before, but I always had to dissolve the detergent powder to make sure it didn't leave a residue, and though it generally did a good job, sometimes I would have to rrwash items. Now there's no hassle and everything comes out really clean.",
