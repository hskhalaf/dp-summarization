I didn't knew about this brand until a friend mentioned it to me as an option to buy an Unlocked phone over Amazon, and check the features and I can guarantee that if you like to have an Android phone this is a very good one.",

This phone is certainly the upgrade I was looking for. It has fast facial recognition and it has a great camera. the double camera preforms great, and the video quality is great. The amount of RAM makes the phone super fast, and the storage is adequate for what I need in a phone. I wish the storage was expandable so I could buy a micro SD card and make the phone storage larger.",

There are minor things like external mics not being detected for videos but everything else is pretty much perfect for my needs. Battery is fine for me but maybe average for most people (I have a habit of charging fairly often), very good camera quality, rarely ever gets laggy, and lots of features. I think the only reason not to get it would depend on specific features you're looking for (ex. I don't think it has expandable storage, the thing I mentioned about external mics, you can't transfer files directly to the computer very easily, etc)",

It comes with a silicone case that fits really snugly, and they already applied a screen protector to the screen! So overall, I'm very happy with the device.",

I'm going to regret it when this phone finally does die (or, I lose it more than likely) because I do prefer a 35mm headphone jack versus bluetooth and OnePlus abandoned those with the 6. This is the second OnePlus I've owned (I was a One user) and I'll probably keep purchasing them as long as they're making top quality devices.",

I also pull up directions faster than my wife (still using the Moto G) even though we're on the same network.

Oxygen OS seems pretty good, but adding your own ROM will give you better assurance in privacy and possibly stability, speed and customization. Overall the phones good, especially for $435.",
