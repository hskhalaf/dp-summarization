I start on this thing and the shut right up and get their little tails in bed and I don't hear them the rest of the night. I've needed this for the last 6 months and didn't even know it!",

The Slate call sounded very realistic but the mouth call sounds best, or maybe it\u2019s just me.

I'm currently learning how to use the diaphragm call, so I can't speak too much to its quality, except for the fact that it has an annoying plastic piece on the top, which is really great at scratching the roof of your mouth and unseating the call. The box call is a bit too high pitched in my opinion, but I'm sure people have called birds in with worse.",

I am sure there are very few if any regulations since this is not a food product and the components (i.e., bright orange tape) are probably sourced from China. Use in the mouth is probably dissolving chemicals from the product that are not intended or safe for ingestion. Picture of the kit now shows the mouth call with a white tape instead of the day-glow orange i received. Maybe the change because of the same complaint?? I am a chemist by training so i have some background here.",
