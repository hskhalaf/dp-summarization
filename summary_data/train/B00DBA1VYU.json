Perhaps the only con is that the internal hard drive can't be partitioned...not through the setup assistant at least. If you're comfortable creating images, this can be done manually. Partitions are important so that the backups aren't taking up the entire hard drive. I created partitions by uploading images the same size as my computer's hard drive.

I did have to tweak the WEP setting of the Wi-Fi router that had been my only Wi-Fi router, but that only took a minute or so and everything was working fine throughout the house.

I ended up having this connected directly to the internal ONT from FIOS via ethernet and it performed excellently in that job.

      "text": "This replaced my prior Gen 4 time machine. It's basically the same, it doesn't have the same firmware version of my prior one, but I imagine that's because it's slightly different with the ability for wireless AC. I upgraded primarily because I got gigabit internet. Plugged in I top out aroun 920 mbps. On wireless I get near 300 mbps on a 2012 Macbook Pro with just a wireless N as the max. All in all, not too bad. I wouldn't say upgrade though unless your internet speeds are very fast though.",

Have 2 wireless networks created, N and 5ghz, so that our variety of wireless devices can be optimized (smart TVs, macbooks, iphones, ipads, Amazon Fire Sticks, and Apple TV). Also, painlessly set-up \"guest\" access to the network. Great reception throughout the home (2000sf one level).
