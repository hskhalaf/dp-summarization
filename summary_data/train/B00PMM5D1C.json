      "text": "I purchased another fog machine a couple Halloweens ago, but even new it just couldn't keep up. I splurged on the \"Fog Fury\" this year and was blown away by how well it works! Combined with the integral LED lighting, the effects are awesome and dramatic. Some day I might learn to take advantage of the DMX capabilities, but for now the included remote control works great! There are four programmable buttons on the remote for different color combinations on demand. To create a denser effect, I placed the Fog Fury inside a garbage can so the fog and lighting would appear even thicker. It scared the pants off the Trick-or-Treaters when I blasted the fog as they walked by.",

      "text": "I bought this fog machine to go with my Halloween decorations. I have my lights programmed to have a bit of fire theme, when I saw the promo video, I knew this is something I had to have. I had visions of mounting it above my front entryway so it would shoot down as trick or treaters approached, but when you flip the reservoir it kind of needed more clearance than I had available. Instead I set it up behind a pillar angled about 45 degrees so it would blast across the walkway. I programmed the remote channels to appropriate colors, and fire it as the kids passed it. This thing is awesome! The reactions made this worth every penny.",

It is very responsive, registers remote presses from at least 30 feet away, and jets fog out like nobody's business up to about 10 feet from the device when outside. ADJ has killed my desire for any other brand in this field. Great, tough construction throughout the device. Multiple ways to prop it up, or hang it sideways and even upside down. More color patterns than I know what to do with. And the machine stays relatively cool after hours of use. If I could give it 6 stars, I would. Awesome, awesome, awesome.",

      "text": "Just got this to replace my trusty Chauvet Geyser Jr. Works well so far and looks great! My biggest complaint so far is that there is no option to use the awesome amber with red for a fire color - you have 64 \"color macros\" to choose from, but none of them have amber and red together (only washed out with a ton of blue or green.) Come on guys! You built a flamethrower, give it the color it deserves! (Talking about the remote control options, I'm not interested in using DMX just to get the right color - other reviews mention problems with DMX control anyway.)",

Speed was essential since the local fire marshal had time expectations for alarm performance. This machine could set off a detector in around 30 seconds. Also, I was concerned about stinking up a new building with liquid smoke. Not a problem at all. Word of caution, make sure you bring substantial fans with you to clear out the smoke. I put so much smoke in three adjacent rooms that it took 30 minutes to clear them even with fans blowing.",
