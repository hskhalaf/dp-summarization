Yes you can stop the humming sound but it means unplugging the blue light module cable inside and no more button blue lights. But other than that it\u2019s a great model since nothing inside is different from the regular white light model.",

Also states that it's louder in some radios than others. I really love the look of this radio. Switching to \"PA\" turns off the face plate and the hum goes away.
