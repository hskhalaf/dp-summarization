On our second replacement, the auto-off never worked and after several months, it too completely stopped working. Call me old fashioned, but I have an expectation that if I am going spend a reasonable amount of money on a product I expect it to work longer than 8 months. Sadly, this was not the case.",

      "text": "I bought this iron after reading all the positive reviews -- and every one was true. Fastest turnaround ever on husband's shirts! Heavy (weighted with water) but slick on the fabric and easy to handle with fabulous steam and a substantial water reservoir that I only had to fill once for 14+ shirts! What used to be a chore that I put off for weeks (while the to-be-ironed shirt pile grew) was a breeze tonight -- and I cannot wait until the next laundry day! Love love love it!",

It is heavy, so it does a great job of pressing. The heat selection is also simple and straight forward; but it does still leak water on occasion. It must be the nature of how the steam system works, it's just a pain when not all of the water gets vaporized before soaking the clothes. That being said though, this one is really not terribly bad like our other one was. It is bigger than I had expected, but that's not a bad thing for us.",

I am every bit as pleased with this iron today as I was when I bought it. I have experienced none of the issues mentioned in the negative reviews. There's still plenty of steam and enough heat to crisply press my seams. I usually miss mine if I have to use someone else's. I still highly recommend.",
