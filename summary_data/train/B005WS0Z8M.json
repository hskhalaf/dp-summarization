I am also able to bend down a note by a minor third, which shouldn't be possible. 2 years after purchasing it, the saliva going out of the water valve is still black (I bought a black pBone). The slide is still scratchy and gets harder to move after playing for 30 to 45 minutes.",

You normally should have no problems with the slide sticking but if you do, then lubricate the slide with Yamaha's Trombone Slide Oil and after applying Yamaha's Trombone Slide Oil you will need to spray it down with water as needed to keep it from sticking.",

I do use a metal mouthpiece instead of the plastic one that comes with it. Honestly,. most of the time when I want to practice or noodle, I just pick up the orange trombone. Lots of fun!",

The only small problem we have with it is that the tuning slide doesn't always stay put and needs more frequent adjustments.

(The reason for buying a second one is so that he can have one at my house and one at his mom\u2019s house.) He can leave his standard trombone at school and practice at home with these. He does say it plays a little different than the standard trombone, but not enough that it doesn\u2019t work for practice. I\u2019m probably not the best person to judge the sound, but to my ear it sounds great.",

For what it is, glorified pvc pipe, it's amazing! Real trombone tone (when using real mouthpiece) that sounds pretty close to a metal horn (with some obvious tonal limitations due to the materials) at a fraction of the cost/weight of a brass horn. Won't replace my pro horn, but a fun, economical and lightweight alternative.",

You might want to put some slide o'mix on the slide, as it is initially a bit cumbersome in the far positions, but it will eventually wear into a nice smooth condition even without it.

      "text": "I first heard someone playing a pBone two years ago. Admittedly she was an excellent musician - but I was surprised how good the sound was. Last summer I used a friend's pBone during a parade and it was so light. My pBone has lived up to my expectations. It is light and easy to use. I do need to use a lyre that clips to the bell - but that's holding up so far.",
