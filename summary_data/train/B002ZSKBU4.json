Other brands will cost you three times this much, and are truly no better than this Valvoline Max Life brand. It indeed will help keep your automatic transmission in tip top shape, and will also extend fluid change intervals. It will also help your transmission components to last longer than non synthetic fluids will in comparison.",

      "text": "My 1997 Camry has 240,000 KMs on the original engine. Transmission fluid was never changed. It was dark brown but not black, so not burnt. There was no issues with the transmission at all, but I decided it was about time to give the car love. I changed the filter and transmission fluid to synthetic, used a WIX filter... the transmission is even slightly more smoother. I just used up my other bottles and changed out the fluid again in 3000KMs just to make sure the whole transmission got fresh fluid. No issues with the shifts. Hands down the Valvoline Synthetic Transmission fluid is the best value. Make sure you change your fluids!!",
