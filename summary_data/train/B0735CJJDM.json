I ended up making it longer and have plenty left over to make a top. As you can see we were able to bend some to make a tunnel and the girls love running around and going under it.

Now things are a lot more neat and easy to find. She doesn\u2019t have towels on top of clothes on top of covers on top of shoes. It certainly cleaned up this corner of our room quite a bit.",

It was easy and fun to put together; the pieces just 'snap' on to each other. It's not rocket science. The reason for my 4 star instead of 5 star rating is that our package was missing one piece of one of the cubes. After unpacking it and putting it together, I didn't want to ship it back, so I kept it. My recommendation is to count all the squares BEFORE putting it together. Other than that, it is a great buy and sturdy.",
