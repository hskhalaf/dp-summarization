Do yourself a favor, and listen to a THX demo on youtube. I could actually feel my head being hit with the low frequency sound pressure. Nice Bluetooth range, and no hiss. Quality build. Some reviews complain about the \"wobbly\", cheap feeling volume wheel. It's not bad, really...just some slop. Not a deal breaker. If you have a media streaming box, like FireTV, pair these up and enjoy.",

Only need to be charged about once a week, and this is with nearly full-time use at work. These also do a great job of blocking out noise in the room without having to turn the music up too loud.

The sound quality is great - I walked to the other side of my apartment (a bedroom, kitchen and living room between) before the song started to cut out. The only complaint that I would have is that the knob that turns the song/volume jiggles a bit when jumping/running. Since it's plastic on plastic, you can hear/feel the vibrations a bit. But perhaps that wouldn't be the case if the volume was up higher? Bottom line, these are a great product and much more affordable than the higher end bluetooth headphones!!!",

In any case, if you can score these for under $80 as I did, they're definitely a steal. The commonly listed $100 is also solid deal as there's a lot of great value for money in these. Build quality is great. If it weren't for the cheap feeling wheel control the build quality would be excellent. It's actually jarring how cheap the plastic feels to press and manipulate. Sound quality is excellent. Very clean and well balanced. I usually listen to a set of Bose QC15s which are definitely more full and crisp, but these are still quite good.",

I'm not an audiophile, but I really enjoy my music, specially bassy electronic music, and this headphones sound great. The sound is very warm and clear, and it can be SO loud. With the volume set all the way to the max on the headphones, I have to leave it on the minimum on my laptop.",
