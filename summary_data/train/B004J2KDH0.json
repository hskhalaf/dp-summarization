I not sure if it would fit 6 people comfortably, but at least 4 people with all the blankets and bags. Very easy to set up, I set up the first time alone and had no troubles, but i prefer to have another to help. The take down is easier, and fits back into the bag so easily. So far so good!!",

You can fit two people comfortably assuming the gear is outside but spacious for one person. It may be too heavy to use for backpacking but with some care, this tent will last for years and years.

I'm not a huge outdoorsman I'll admit, but in my moderate camping experience a rain fly is used when one wants to protect the tent from the rain, hence the name. It's never been my experience that a rain fly is necessary to make it so others can't see right into your tent. In other words, I always thought a rain fly was an accessory and not a necessity.
