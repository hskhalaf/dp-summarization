I'm very impressed with the finish - as good or better than what I'd normally expect on a wet horizontal bandsaw! Cutting action was smooth and free of any chatter. While I can't say any radial saw would be my preferred choice for cutting Aluminum this did a fantastic job. I do realize this is not actually meant for sections over 1/4\" but it works very well.

I got perfectly clean cuts through both the aluminum and the PVC trim that was wrapped around it. Because of the PVC being a finished product, I didn't use a lubricant like WD40 on the blade, but ended up not having issues with the blade gullets filling with metal. I also cut a few pieces that were 1/4\"x1 3/4\" solid aluminum and have no problems. Overall, I am extremely pleased with the performance so far.",

I was actually able to cut a 1/16\" slice off a 2\"x2\"x1/4\" square tube. And after several hundred cuts, it is as sharp as the day I bought it. It is a bit pricey, but super well worth the cost.

    "title": "Freud 12\" x 86T Thick Non-Ferrous Metal Blade (LU89M012)",
    "description": "Style:12-Inch 86 Tooth TCG Non-Ferrous Metal Cutting Saw Blade with 1-Inch ArborThis heavy-duty, non-ferrous metal cutting blade produces an excellent finish. These blades have custom designed gullets to minimize chip build-up and specially formulated carbide for long life. Freud recommends use of a liquid lubricant when cutting. This can be accomplished with a spray of WD-40 or other lubricant every 4 to 5 cuts. Wax sticks are not recommended\n\nAMAZON.COM\nThe 12-inch Freud LU89M012 Thick Stock Non-Ferrous Metal Cutting Saw Blade is a heavy-duty blade that delivers a precise finish when cutting aluminum and other non-ferrous materials. Featuring 86 teeth with TiCo high-density carbide tips and Freud's Silver I.C.E. coating, which helps reduce heat buildup and prevent corrosion, this thin-kerf blade is built to stand up to the demands of frequent use and tough applications.\n\n\n\nTriple-Chip Tooth Grind for Precise Metal Saw Cuts\nBuilt to make quick, exact work of trimming and reshaping aluminum, copper, or other non-ferrous metals, this blade features teeth with a triple-chip grind. In this configuration, each flat-top tooth is followed by a trapezoidal tooth that's slightly higher. The trapezoidal tooth delivers a precut slot that's narrower than the final kerf, so the flat-top teeth can leave a finish that's clean and true.Also offering custom designed gullets that minimize chip buildup, this blade is designed for optimal performance when cutting metal walls that are less than 1/4-inch thick. It has a 1-inch arbor and produces a 0.122 kerf.\n\nFreud recommends that you use a liquid lubricant, like WD40, when cutting metals with this blade.\n\nWell-Balanced, Anti-Vibration Design\nThis Freud blade is precision balanced and pretensioned for truer cuts under heavy loads. It also features laser-cut, anti-vibration slots that reduce chatter for a cleaner finish, longer blade life, and reduced noise while you work. And because the entire blade is laser cut from high-strength steel, you can trust that it will stay stable, flat, and true, even after prolonged use.\n\nHigh-Density Carbide for Maximum Cutting Performance\nThis thick-stock saw blade's 86 teeth are finished with tips made from Freud's application-specific TiCo high-density carbide \"non-ferrous blend.\" Formulated to extend tooth life in the face of demanding metalwork applications, this blend is extra impact-resistant--due to including more cobalt than other TiCo blends--and it still offers the mix of improved strength, density, corrosion resistance, and heat resistance that you expect from TiCo.\n\nWith teeth that start out sharper and deliver improved edge retention, the blade can go longer between sharpening, and will hold up longer--saving you time and money.\n\nSilver I.C.E. Coating Resists Corrosion and Heat Buildup\nThis blade is finished with Freud's Silver I.C.E. coating, which resists corrosion for improved performance over time. This unique coating also resists heat buildup, protecting your saw and your work surface and preventing the blade from warping. Its non-stick surface also helps prevent unwanted buildups. All this translates to less drag on the motor of your saw, which means longer tool life and longer blade life.\n\nThis industrial saw blade is backed by Freud's limited lifetime warranty.\n\nAbout Freud: A History of Innovative Manufacturing\nAn industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry. Freud is one of the few manufacturers of woodworking tools in the world that produces its own MicroGrain Carbide with Titanium, called TiCo, a high-density combination of Titanium and Cobalt.\n\nBy producing their own carbide, Freud has the unique ability to formulate each tool for each specific application, thereby maximizing the cutting life and performance of the tool. Freud's full line of high-quality, woodworking tools includes saw blades, router bits, shaper cutters, power tools, and more. \n\nWhat's in the Box\nFreud LU89M012 Thick Stock Non-Ferrous Metal Cutting Saw Blade--12-inch diameter, 1-inch arbor, 86-tooth design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nUse the LU89M series blades for cutting of nonferrous metal such as copper pipe, aluminum extrusions, brass plate, etc. These blades have custom designed gullets to minimize chip build up and specially formulated micrograin carbide tips and Tri-Metal braz\n\nSee more",
