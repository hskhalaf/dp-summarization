On the bottom, I keep all my bottles of wine and liquor. The tempered glass is solid and has not suffered a single scratch thus far. Rating 4 stars because the wheels stick, making for an inelegant glide over my hardwood floors; but the aesthetics are definitely 5 stars. Not hard to put together as long as you are capable of reading English.",
