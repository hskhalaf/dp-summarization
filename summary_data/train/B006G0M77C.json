You don't need another fall. Spend the extra money to buy an all terrain version with better tires.",

Upon receipt we assembled it [directions were poor] only to find that the brake lock would not hold. No adjustment seemed to help. Using the scooter without a brake lock would be very dangerous. Interestingly enough we happened to meet another senior couple at the surgeon's office with the very same scooter. When we asked about their experience with it, they immediately complained that the brake lock did not work and that he had tried every means of adjusting it for his wife without success. They were not happy with the scooter either.",

My biggest complaint is that the instructions provided for assembly are poorly written. I had a great deal of difficulty getting it together - as did three others. When I contacted the company they told me there was a website demonstrating assembly. That should have been the first line of the instructions. I could not find that fact in their instructions. I may have accidentally damaged the spring on the steering mechanism in my many...many attempts to assemble the product.",
