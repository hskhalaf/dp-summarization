It looks like a tripod and a T and comes with 2 clips to hold hold the backdrop. I wasn't happy with the backdrop I bought but this item is great. It folds up and comes apart so it doesn't take up a lot of room to store or to transport. It has adjustable height so it works with different lengths. I wish I had this years ago.",

It held up just fine with no issues. And the back drop I had on it had extra room on the bottom and even when my office chair wheels rolled over it nothing happened. Also people complained about the clips. I also didnt have no issues. IDK if I got lucky. I will keep you guys updated if anything happens. But so far for my use it was amazing. I will recommend this product to anyone.",

It holds the backdrop (a lightweight vinyl) easily with the included clips, and there wasn't really an issue with balance or weight. Very impressed with this product!

It would be good if the clips could be the same color of the stand/poles instead of the shiny silver that sticks out like a sore thumb. I gave it a 3 star because 2 of the 4 clips came broken and I needed to use today to hang a banner with my logo for an event today. So I have to go to the store to find a similar clip that would work to hold up the banner. I have sent a note to the seller to send replacement clips",
