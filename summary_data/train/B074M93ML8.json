She was chewing on this toy and then started coughing. Thankfully I was right next to her and finger swept it out of her mouth but this was very scary. This is a huge problem.",

      "text": "Skip Hop's Moby was too big for my slim bath spout, so this one worked better. It's cut narrower-- so if bath spout is similar in size to a slimmer sink spout, it's worth a shot. BUT-- you cannot adjust it. Major design flaw. Moreover the interior has a grid pattern that is prone to mold if not cleaned regularly. TIP: after every bath, remove it from the spout to let dry fully. A pain, yes. But it's the only way to avoid the mold which is inevitable in nearly any tub cover. Is it a perfect fit? No, it still manages to slip off if disturbed. But it's OK enough for the job.",

I removed it the other day after months of use, and there was barely and sludge/mildew built up. I'll admit I had been forgetting to check it, so I was worried about what I might find inside.
