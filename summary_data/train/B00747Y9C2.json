      "text": "I've been a huge fan of Apple for most of my life. When my old Mac Pro (the giant steel tower that could take over the world on any given day) started wearing out after ten years of heavy use, I looked into the new Mac Pros. Bought this one for $3,500, assuming it would do everything the old system did. I was very wrong. To this day (five years later) it still sputters, crashes, freezes, and generally fails to run all the programs I was used to running (Final Cut Express, Microsoft Office, etc.). I definitely get the feeling that Apple is moving away from computing, which is unfortunate. They were forerunners for a long time.",

No. 1 the attachments are limited, you may have to change some gear if you want to use it. My major criticism is that the technology is 3 years old. That is critical in today's market. I can see keeping the same model but the tech should be updated and improved year to year, even if they are little or minor imchrements. Nice machine but remember it is three years old, even if you buy tomorrow. You don't buy too many things that are three years old right off the shelf.",

When it got to the Apple Store this time, it wouldn't even start and the \"genius\" gave up and started a work order. Should have bought a Mini Thank goodness we still have the old machine",
