It's great white noise for sleeping plus keeps the air nice and fresh for easy breathing from allergies. I do check the outer sponge pre filter every month or so, hand wash it and let it air dry when needed which I think helps the HEPA work better and last as long as it does. I'd definitely recommend.",

Seeing as the cheapest filter is about 10$ each, it can become a bit pricey to maintain. I would rather have a filter that was reusable even if it meant diminished performance.",

I will update the review once I replace the filter and see how much stuff got filtered.
