The \"quickview\" button on the front of the monitor lets you quickly toggle between different color/brightness settings - great for switching between gaming, movie and internet profiles. Screen seems to refresh quickly - have not noticed any blurry motion during high speed scenes on my movies. Nice depth of color - blacks are black and whites are white. The 22\" screen is great - you'd be surprised how much more enjoyable it is to have so much more on your screen (less scrolling). If this one died on me I wouldn't hesitate to replace it with the same model.",

      "text": "The HP W2207 22\" LCD Monitor was just what I was looking for and then some. I haven't spent the time yet to get the rotation to Portrait mode set up, but that's just a bonus feature for me to use when editing portrait oriented Photos. The monitor is bright, clear and is very sharp with good resolution. This monitor replaced a 15\" non-widescreen HP monitor that I liked very much. The only thing that I have been disappointed about is the instructions for setting up the auto rotate feature to allow me to switch between landscape and portrait orientation and vice versa. I'd recommend this monitor to anyone who needs a large monitor, especially for editing photos.",

It not only has excellent adjustments for height, tilt but the screen can be rotated 90 degrees as well. This is a big plus that you will not find in monitors of this price. Just watch the back lighting and this monitor is almost the best on the market. The HP w2207 LCD Monitor would be perfect, if it had a better refresh rate, even if it was 70hz.

The screen image is crisp and the color vivid. In scanning original artwork (using HP Scanjet G4050) the color rendered on the screen is excellent compared to the original document.

You will find obvious differences in image projections based on settings you may default to. If this 22\" HP lasts as long as my previous flat screen CRT, I will then become ecstatic over thrilled...
