But the comfort level is insane, I have been buying soccer cleats for 18 years now and this is my favorite pair I have owned in terms of both comfort and traction. I recently wore them at an Ultimate Frisbee Tournament, playing for 8 hours straight for two days. No blisters, and even on the mildly wet conditions I did not slip at all. I cannot speak for durability as I have only had them for a few weeks. The shoes seem like they will last.",
