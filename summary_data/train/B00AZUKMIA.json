However, please note that what you receive from Amazon is not the same as what is shown in the photos. Either the photo is a new model or an older model. The bag received does NOT have side compression straps and the top handle does not have a hard plastic reinforcement. The handle has a canvas like wrap that is not the same as pictured. I purchased this bag specifically for the compression straps but since it did not come with these straps, it is going back to Amazon. Thanks!",

Mine is the surface book 2 15'' inch and its been kept safe and in perfect condition despite my filling this bag to the brim with gym equipment! Although I don't suggest doing that because your gym gear might be different from mine. Nevertheless this thing is sturdy, has many pockets and looks sleek to boot!",

We even pack his lunch in one of the pouches with a small ice pack and the padding keeps it cold. Well worth the money.",

      "text": "I have to disagree with other reviews that gave this backpack a high rating. Two of the zipper tabs came off a couple months after I bought it. I was able to have one replaced although the red and black cloth pull on the tab will not stay on. The other tab was lost when it fell off so I have to grab the small piece of metal the tab attached to to open that pocket. That may not sound like a big problem until you realize how often you get into the pockets of a backpack. I recommend you find another brand that is higher quality.",

None of them have better design or more space. I'll use this bag until it wears out, gets too dirty or until Ogio designs an even better bag. Then, I'll buy another Ogio. So far, I think it's the best bag I've ever owned and, without question, the best value for the money. Congratulations to Ogio!",
