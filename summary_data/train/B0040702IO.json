I LOVE it. It fits into my pocket and takes 2 AA batteries. It is idiot-simple to use. I can capture candid photos. The camera takes only a moment to activate. Compared to video cameras that are several hundreds dollars - the warm-up time is impressive! If I 2 seconds to anticipate something I want to capture then I can whip it out and grab some authentic moments. This is a great little camera.",

I expect if I go on a long trip, I'll just bring one of my netbooks with me to offload the videos from the camera. The FlipShare software that installs from the camera seems easy to use. Note: it will try to update the FlipShare software immediately if you are connected to the internet.",

So I bought the Flip Video Rechargeable Battery Pack (separately) when I bought the Flip UltraHD Video Camera, but it does NOT work with this camera. Not only does it not work, it doesn't even fit into the battery compartment. The camera is great, but the suggestion to buy a battery that doesn't work for the camera is not. If we are supposed to purchase something else, it was totally unclear.",
