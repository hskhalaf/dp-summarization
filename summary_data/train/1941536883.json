However, I'm giving it only 3 stars because the quality of the book is awful. The binding started coming apart after only 1 week. Since its a cook book that has the potential to be used a lot, you would think they would spend a little bit more on the binding. Otherwise, the recipes are delicious, not overwhelmingly seasoned or complicated. Wish I could give it 5 stars but Im disappointed with the cheap quality.",

I was diagnosed as a Type 2 diabetic in 2010, and my disease was getting worse, so I knew I needed to change my diet. Anna's book was the answer to my prayers. It is easy to follow, lots of my favorite recipes modified to eliminate grains and sugar (NSNG) and still have lots of flavor. I made the Green Bean Casserole for Thanksgiving, and I make the ice cream all the time. I highly recommend this book for people wanting to make healthier meals for themselves.",

Trying to adhere to the NSNG (no sugar, no grain) lifestyle can be a challenge, but Anna's book makes it much easier. She's also very responsive answering questions on FB on Vinnie Tortorich's no sugar no grain. I'd buy it again in a second.",
