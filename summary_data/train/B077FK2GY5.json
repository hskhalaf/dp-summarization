She's had a rolling backpack for several years now and she likes how much sturdier this one feels compared to the J World rolling back pack that we replaced. She also likes that the zipper doesn't go all the way down to the bottom of the backpack as that feature always made the backpack fall over when it was unzipped all the way. She loves the Galaxy print. I got her a Tardis patch to put on the front pocket as she's a Whovian.",
