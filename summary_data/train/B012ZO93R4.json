Can't recommend it. **Update** Great customer service. The company reached out after my review and offered to send two more lights, which I accepted. The lights work just fine. I guess I had received a defective one. I want to commend the company for their quick response. I recommend the company and the product.",

Quite the contrary: these lights work exactly as advertised. The thing that I really like is that both the solar collector and the lights themselves are adjustable. You can move the solar collector over 180 degrees to capture the position of the sun. You can also adjust the direction of the lights. I have only had them in use for one week but thus far I am extremely happy with my purchase.",

I have a red maple that looks an unnatural purple-green in its light. So, I moved it to highlight a different tree.

I've bought a total of 3 sets of these lights. One set had a broken light at the hinge when it arrived. The other set, only one light worked for a short time. The other light would come on, but turn off in about an hour. The last set works, but only if it isn't cloudy or it doesn't rain. Either I had a bad batch or this product is faulty and not properly tested and checked before shipping.",

I have two under two-year olds and from what I've noticed, full sunlight for the day will get the lights to last the entire night (6 am and they were still on, on the brightest setting). Another one in a less advantageous position (probably 4-6 hours of direct sunlight and 2-4 hours of indirect sunlight) gets it to go from 6:30 pm to about 4 am on the bright setting. The lights are fairly bright. Bright enough to read by and honestly, if you had enough in the right places, probably enough to play basketball to. I will try and keep track of how long these last.",

But these lights have big solar panels that completely recharge on a cloudy day. The batteries last forever. They work every day, providing light without fail, and the batteries are going strong. Only problem I have is with the coating they put on the solar panel. It doesn't last. But the solar panels last, so I don't care.",

The ability to adjust the light angle and the solar panel angle are nice. My first concern is the durability, they are plastic. A loose basket ball could destroy one, but at the price point they are reasonable. My next concern is the battery life, how will they hold up after a year of use? Note: photos are in dim setting, phone camera doesn\u2019t quite do justice, actual results are better. I bought 4 to test out. I think I\u2019ll buy four more to complete my front yard.",

That said, the item description would really benefit from some clarity about the color temperature of the lights: these are very cool / blue-ish, which does not look good with some types of foliage and vegetation, IMHO. Be aware that URPOWER also sells a warm white version of these lights... which I wish I had realized before ordering. These have a very sterile/clinical color cast, which clashes with the warmer lights I am already using and doesn't flatter the types of foliage in my yard.",

My update is this. Both of these lights have stopped working. They just didn't hold up to the elements here in Hawaii. I don't know if it was too much sun (the solar panels are both bubbled), or the 70\" of rain annually where I live, but they've both died. On the otherhand, the Keynice Waterproof IP65 light that I bought is still running like a champ, and visually has held up much better. The Keynice also had a much sturdier feel.",

The one design flaw is that the solar panel faces the same direction as the light, which means the light needs to be facing south, give or take several degrees to the southwest or southeast, for optimal solar collection. The solar panel can be adjusted between horizontal and vertical but not for direction. So if you need south-facing light, I would highly recommend these.",
