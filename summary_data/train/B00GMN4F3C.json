    "title": "TEKTON 30709 Dead Blow Hammer Set with 16, 32 and 48-Ounce",
    "description": "Size:Set\n\nSteel shot inside the head of these specially-designed dead blow hammers eliminates post-strike rebound common with steel and other solid-head hammers. Controlling this rebound conserves the energy of each blow, redirecting it completely into the work piece. This means fewer blows are needed, reducing the chances of deforming the work piece. At the same time, work surfaces are protected by the high-impact poly jacket that completely encases the all-steel head and handle. This jacket gives a positive strike while preventing marring of softer metals like aluminum. The handle is finished with a comfortable diamond tread pattern for a non-slip grip.\n\nSet Includes:\n\n * (1) 16 oz. dead blow hammer\n * (1) 32 oz. dead blow hammer\n * (1) 48 oz. dead blow hammer",
