Right out of the box, I tried hooking up my binocular and one end had come undone. After a hike that weekend, the other set came undone as well. We were able to sew the straps back together and reinforce them so that the binoculars wouldn't fall off of their harnesses but it was a bit concerning and a little bit of a hassle that we had to repair a brand new product moments after using. After the repair they worked great, though they do get hot on your back after wearing them for a while.",

These are sturdy, easy to operate, and easy to use in the field, as well as, you hardly notice you're wearing a set of binoculars! They definitively take the load off of your neck and are easily worn from first light to darkness. Get a pair, you'll thank yourself after the first hour of use!!",
