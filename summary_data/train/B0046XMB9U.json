Since I'm having to use it in my garage it does slide a bit and has to be readjusted, but that's to be expected on a cement floor. Plus it does have poles to store your plates and weight it down even more, which would solve that problem, I just don't want my weights in the garage. On a carpet floor I'm sure you wouldn't even notice.",

I suggest if you do buy this, plan on making your own platform from 3/4 inch plywood and buying an actual speed bag hanger!",

I can work with it, it just gets aggravating at times.",
