As a bartender, I\u2019m always on the lookout for a comfortable (all day) sneaker, as I\u2019m on my feet long hours and these definitely provide that. Great cushioning, bounce, and style. I will say that Puma\u2019s run about a 1/2- 1 size smaller than most brands. I can usually wear a 7-7 1/2 in men\u2019s sneakers (9 in women\u2019s) but after buying a 7 1/2 I had to exchange them for the 8 men\u2019s.",
