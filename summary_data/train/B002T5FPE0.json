I keep it stored under the bed and then pull it out when we are having parties or when the kids get bored. The product has taken some serious abuse from excited kids and has held up well. I highly recommend this product for anyone that wants the fun of having air hockey table but the convenience of storing it away out of sight.",

      "text": "I bought this for my 3 year old grandson and my 7 year old granddaughter. They play it together all the time. I polished the top with wax and the puck slides great now. Love that it is really easy to put away when they are done. Doesn't take up too much space. I recommended buying the offered additional pucks and controller, as they are much higher quality than the pair that comes with this set. Worth getting. The pucks are bigger. I was a the best Nana ever when this gift was open. Not only that, all the kids at the party were anxious to get their turn to play this. BIG HIT",

Fan was installed correctly! Now for the life experience part! This little Air Hockey table was a huge hit during the holidays! Everyone played it at least once. Great for kids from 4 to 16! And honestly my 18month old had a great time with it too. The curve corners make all the difference! So great having people not zombied out in front of a video game or TV movie. Get one, get playing, get laughing, get communicating!",

It is sturdy, and the perfect size for either table top play, or floor play. The fan is powerful enough to float the puck, which glides nicely across the \"rink\".

I tried to put the threaded pieces back in the particle board and it just broke again. Such a waste of money. Go buy the plastic one, at least you won't waste your money.",

What was supposed to be entertainment for the 5-year old boys ended up being a duel between kids vs. grown-ups on whose turn it was to play. We were fortunate that neither table had the \"upside-down fan\" issue that so may others' seemed to have. The tables arrived in timely fashion and in good packaging. My only complaint is that the table materials are of cheaper grade and won't last as long as we'd like.",

We moved the fan, screwed the holder back in to cover the air entry hole completely, and voila - the table worked perfectly. Lots of fun for everyone from my 9 year old son to my 58 year old husband.",

I would highly recommend it.",

The table is of sturdy quality and the air flow is adequate for the small pucks. The only drawback we have found is that due to the size of the table and \"goal\" it is very easy to block all scoring attempts by simply placing your paddle in the center of the slot... Even with that, the table has already provided hours of fun for our family and our daughter's friends.",
