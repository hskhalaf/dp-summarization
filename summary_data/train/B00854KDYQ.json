I have always used 1 famous known product line, but now my skin has gotten so familiar with the same products that it doesn't perform the same(and the prices now are SCARY). I brought a few of these items AND BEAUTIFUL RESULTS. Who ever you are THANKS ANDALOU!!!",

I use it twice a week and even some personal clients. It\u2019s worth more than what it\u2019s sold for. My favorite mask but still use a calming mask afterwards since it does tingle a little from the Glycolic acid.",
