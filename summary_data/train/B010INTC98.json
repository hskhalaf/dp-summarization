Second, easy to apply and doesn't streak (This does take some time getting used to applying. If you have never applied before, you may see some streaks or areas that didn't go on even. Use an exfoliator the next day and reapply and problem solved). Third, the color is natural and looks great. It's not an orange like some get. Give it a shot and you will not be disappointed.",

Everyone comments how natural the look is and I put it on my face every other day instead of putting on makeup. No streaks, I always use gloves to put on, even a light layer will do-it dries instantly. Honestly just buy this tanner bc it is the best I\u2019ve tried and no chemicals makes it a no brained.",

I\u2019ve used it on hot days where I get sweaty and it stays on pretty good without sweating off much.

      "text": "So let me start off by saying I like this tanner because of the natural ingredients. If you are in a hurry to get some very natural, bronzey looking color, this is it. However.... if you do not spread it quickly and evenly, you will wind up streaky. Also keep a loofah or a washcloth nearby to get the color off your hands, asap. I tried using gloves and I just can\u2019t spread it properly with gloves on. One more thing, if you sweat at night, it will get on your sheets. BUT, it does all wash out. So all and all works great, but with some caveats. Oh and it lasts about a week before having to reapply.",

The only thing is I seem to almost stay a little sticky from it longer than I'd expect but that may also just be me not allowing it enough time before I'm on the go..either way it doesn't bother me and I've been wearing shorts after applying so not worried about any rub off.

Good for those of us who want that California tan, but don't want to hang out in the sun to get it or be explosed to harmful tanning booths or chemical spray tans.

Gloves are recommended, however, I used bare hands and scrubbed well with warm, soapy water afterwards. I found the seller to be quite responsive and helpful.

This was easy to put on and my color after just two hours is beautiful! I can't wait to use it on the rest of my body, not just legs and arms. I will be reordering again. This is one to try if you are looking for more color.",

      "text": "This product has no harmful ingredients. That was the reason I purchased it. When you open the bottle you will see that it has a dark tint and that will help you see how well you are distributing it evenly over your skin. The color of your tan will appear hours later and the tint from the product will wash off in the shower, leaving only the new tan which will last for several days. It takes practice to decide how often to reapply, but start out slow and gradually increase the frequency to your own liking.",
