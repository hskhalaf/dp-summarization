I will try again, but the first time was pretty much a mess, I don't know, perhaps I just need practice. If you are trying to wax all your body you would need to buy more wax and more strips, the product that comes in the box is not enough. Also, make sure to put some magazine paper, old boxes or something beneath if you don't want everything sticky.",

It's a solid pot, lasts for years (when let's be real, using this twice already pays for having eyebrows professionally done), and is easy to use. This particular set is nice because it comes with lotions and powders to use before waxing, and to help get extra wax off your skin or counter.

Yes, of course it was a bit messy on the first try, but once you get the hang of it it's pretty simple to avoid getting the wax everywhere. I use this for my eyebrows, sideburns, and upper lip and have great results. Saves a ton of money in the long run! The only thing I suggest is to supply more wax collars. You'll definitely need to purchase a few extras if you plan on using this kit long term.",
