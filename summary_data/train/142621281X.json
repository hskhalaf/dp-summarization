A real plus is that it is indexed by color which simplifies finding a flower that nothing else is known about it. (I wish I could find a bird book that did the same!)",

The list of flowers is color coded so if you see a purple flower look in the blue/purple section. Each Flower comes with the plant classification and range. It as a breif description of the plant, a drawing, a picture and key facts. The book covers 160 species so it is not a botany textbook but is nice for hiking and enjoying nature.",
