Not only that, but because the threads are some plastic material, it disintegrated all over my seats. I had to clean to this big mess everywhere. Looks like this thing is not very durable and one little snap will leave you with a big mess to clean up. I have some pictures to attach of the damage.",

Sure, we could use it hooked solely on the back headrests and drape it on the floor, but that's not the point of this product, not to mention a new product shouldn't break so easily. I will update this review once I hear back from the company.",

The side flaps hang down the sides of the seat, and the velcro slots are great for locking a tetherS into the seat belt lockS. The anchors slip down into the bottom rear of the seat to keep the cover from pulling forward, and the straps for all of the headrest fit and work great. My Great Dane puppy slips around a bit on it, so I am going to add a blanket to help with that, but overall I am very impressed with this product and the value I'm realizing from it.",

      "text": "This product has done a great job preserving my car seats from the messy dog AND keeping the dog from falling between the seats in the car! He basically has his own little \"hammock\" now and loves lounging comfortably in the backseat on road trips. Pros: Easy to assemble/install, colors blend in well with the backseat, non-skid bottom is helpful for keeping it in place, effectively keeps the dog mess off of the seats! Cons: unsure how well it would hold up in the washing machine, the straps (for the headrests) do stretch out a little over time (to be expected)",

The length of the cover is just a couple inches too short so the side flaps end up covering a very small portion on the top of the seat. Husband was fine with that so we kept the cover instead of ordering the larger version.",

Obviously our second seat cover was much worse quality. I really think that anything less than a year worth of use is unacceptable.",

My Golden Retriever doesn't slip and slide around on it, and it remains securely affixed to the seat via the plastic dohickeys that push between the cushions and the straps attached to the seat backs (front and back). I particularly like that it will protect Bailey from a fall between the seats should I hit the brakes (which has happened). I am happy that it has a zipper that will allow his occasional visits to the front or accommodate a person sitting on one side and Bailey on the other. Very satisfied with this purchase!",

      "text": "I haven't used this type of cover before so I didn't know what to expect. It serves the purpose and seems to be durable. It is rather stiff and the part the goes up on the backsides of the front seat just slops down in front of the seat if you don't want to use it as a hammock. It would be nice if it had some way to roll it and tie it so it can be out of the way. I do like the waterproof feature, I don't really need it for the dogs, I need it for elderly parents. It works great for that.",

      "text": "I'm very happy with the quality of this seat cover. This cover fits my 2016 Subaru Forester. I researched many covers and found this one equal to $100 covers. It can be adjusted to fit the height of the backseat and has two toggles, on the backside, that stuff into the bottom of your seat so the cover does not slide off the seat. The fabric is sturdy and will be an excellent way to keep the mud and dirt off of my seats. Both of my dogs shed so the section that attaches to the back of the driver and passenger side will help keep the fur from getting onto the floor and every nook and cranny. Highly recommend!",

The first one (a different brand), was probably the least costly I could find, and only had it a couple of weeks before it developed a big rip in the fabric. This time, I am so glad I spent a little extra money to get this one!! It is so worth it to get one that has the quilted multiple layers for longevity, and all the features that keep it in place, just where you want it. This is a fantastic product, and I most certainly would buy it again (only this time I'm sure I'll be good for for at least a few years!!!",

The cover was easy to install and she is very comfortable on it. When needed, we just detach the cover from the headrests and pull it out to give it a shake and voila, ready to go back into the SUV.

In addition, the fur that gets caught up in the seat cover is almost impossible to remove. It sticks very well and no amount of brushing or scraping will completely clean it. In fact the static from using a brush will just cause all of the fur to cling right back onto the cover.",
