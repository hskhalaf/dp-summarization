Very poor workmanship: the battery cover falls off, lucky to find it between plane seats, the material covering the foam started to peel off leaving black residues on my head and clothing after one year of use. Recently ordered replacement foam pads from Sony Customer Service that contracts with a company named Encompass. The price of a replacement was $21.56 that I made the stupid mistake of agreeing to pay. It turns out that they are not the advertised size and they only sent \"one pad\" as if we humans have just one ear!! Beware!",

      "text": "Great headphones so far! I have own quite a few headphones, and my issues with them range: headphones are too large and/or uncomfortable, they do not block out sound enough, etc. I really like these. The style is pretty sleek compared to some others, the earpads are comfortable, no problems adjusting the length of the frame. It also blocks out sound really well. I have a loud household, but background noises fade when I put music on and even more so when I flit the noise cancelling switch. I think it was well worth the price and would definitely buy this again, provided that the quality doesn't decline. We'll see what happens in the next few months / year,",

The NR seems to reduce some background noise, but real test will be on upcoming air travel. Lightweight but doesn't seem cheaply made. Sound spectrum seems well balanced; the NR does slightly brighten the sound. Biggest complaint: description by this & other vendors (& even some Q&A respondents) clearly states \"around ear\", but these are absolutely \"on ear\" (unless your ears are the size of a mouse's!). That was pretty disappointing but fir the price I've decided to keep them.",
