The metal is so light gauge I could simply slap it back into shape (close as possible)with my hands. The sides are soooooo cheap. I'm not using this cart for work or ever approaching its claimed max weight. Really not satisfied at all. I thought somthing called a Gorilla cart would be way tougher. You can see the sides are made by c shape pieces of thin metal welded together to make square stock.",

I caulked where the mesh is held into the frame on this one so hopefully that rusting will not occur. I will grease/lube the wheel pivot points, etc., more often but this unit has a better design/construction there anyway so I expect many years of service.",

I really, really like this cart and I'm so glad I made this purchase. It's worth every penny.",

The box was a little beat up, but when I opened it I could see someone put a lot of thought into protecting the parts during shipping. Assembly was easy, took about half an hour. The design is simple and strong and it looks well-made. The sides remove easily, a clever design. The pulling handle can also be easily removed without tools so you can hitch it to a lawn tractor. I got it as a \"gold box\" deal, heavily discounted, with free shipping via Prime, a heck of a deal.",

I had a load approaching 200 pounds with 3 points of contact. One of the pressure points landed in between crossbars and near the outside frame, and broke several welds on the wire loose.

The black plastic cover for the bottom is broken from the bolts as well. Now I have to take this huge pile of junk to UPS to return it.",
