      "text": "This is my third purchase from Amazon and the first from Cove Creek Outfitters of these same, Maui Jim HCL Bronze Lighthouse sunglasses. My first two pairs lasted many years but arrived feeling flimsy and easily breakable. Perhaps MJ has improved on its frame design because these glasses are ultra-sturdy and strong. The lenses are spectacular! Pricey, yes, but worth every dollar. If you want to see the world in a beautiful way, you must own a pair of Maui Jims. And if you go with Lighthouse Bronze you will look good in a beautiful way also.",

When these new ones arrived, I compared them to the sunglasses I bought directly from the Maui Jim website. The lenses are significantly larger, and the lettering/ words on the sunglasses arms so not read the same. There are not two different sizes of these sunglasses on the Maui Jim website. This causes me to believe that these sunglasses are knockoffs. I have returned them for a refund. I will order another pair from an authorized Maui Jim dealer, and pay full price. Sometimes when a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is....",

I did find them at sunglass hut, and since I was able to try them on there I patiently waited for a sale to no avail. If I include taxes the savings over sunglass hut's retail price was $90. This is my first pair of maui jims and I now see why they are priced high, although it still seems a bit ridiculous to spend so much on glasses when the cost of production in japan is likely under $10. Outside of cost I am a big fan of the glasses.",
