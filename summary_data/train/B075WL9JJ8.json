My friends had fun picking out an emoji to use and liked knowing which glass was whose. The kids got jealous of us and put them on their juice cups. They stick very well. Perhaps a little too well...I sometimes found it a little difficult to remove. They are bigger than expected but that makes them easier to spot and easier to remove. Overall, a great, inexpensive gift!",
