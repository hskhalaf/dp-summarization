      "text": "Great size. Decent brightness on the laser, I haven\u2019t tested it outdoors yet. I thought it arrived DOA but I think it was the batteries it came with. It required not cheap batteries to measure correctly or else I would receive error \u201cINFO 401\u201d. Now that I have it working, it measures larger by 1/16\u201d-1/8\u201d from 12\u201d-72\u201d. I can\u2019t find anyway to manually calibrate it. It feels very sturdy and light. **UPDATE** I\u2019ve owned this for a few months now. Original was DOA. Laser works great outside (San Diego) but is usually 3/32\u201d larger, or right on with measurements. I can\u2019t trust it for small accurate projects.",

      "text": "I purchased Dewalt's DW03050 just over three years ago. It never left the home, was never dropped, and was seldom used... 20 or 30 times max. It's basically in new, mint condition physically. Two months outside of the 3 year warranty it died.... nothing lights up even with fresh batteries. I contacted Dewalt about a replacement or repair. Since I was just outside the 3 year period Dewalt stated that they would not help me. Now I have a $100 paper weight. My 5 dollar cat laser pointer has worked longer! Be careful about buying Dewalt Laser Measurers.....hopefully their newer models are built better!!",

There are plenty of equally accurate laser measures available for 1/3 the cost, but we wanted something durable and we were willing to pay extra for something designed to take the wear and tear of a construction site. Unfortunately in its 2nd month of use this $99 unit fell 30\" onto a linoleum floor and the screen broke. Now it's in the garbage because it was made in CHINA and clearly never intended for real life.",
