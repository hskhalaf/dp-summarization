Very nice, subtle design, solid construction, and very simple (l chose the version without a mic and controller on the lines, because I was looking for a set that was as simple as possible, but Marley sells both styles, if you need that). The fact that Marley makes great, eco-conscious headphones and contributes to the Marley Foundation makes these earphones the best choice out there.",

      "text": "Good sound overall. Has a strong bass, however my pair broke down after three weeks. The wood gives a stronger sound meaning you can lower the volume more. I just got a set of Griffin earphones and the quality of sound it's a lot better. In comparison, the Griffin wood earphones are best compared to this model.",

I have tried contacting the manufacture with no response. I am surprised that a company with such a reputation would have such a faulty product and not stand by it. May have been a faulty item from the seller? Either way, he is out a pair of headphones and I am out the $$.",
