      "text": "This thing actually works. You just have to use small strips of hair, which the directions explain, and make sure the hair is brushed. The steam works and does not burn our hair. We are hispanic and have a lot of long, thin hair. My daughter puts in about 10\" of hair at a time and it curls the entire strip. The machine does not seem to get hot on the outside. It only takes about 8-10 seconds per strip for a good curl. That's about the same amount of time as I use on my curling iron, but this gives our long hair that pretty long curl look. Works great!",

My hair does not curl well in the chamber.\nPlease select the right temperature(between350\u2109and 450\u2109) and the curling time(0,8,10,12s), the longer the hair stays in the chamber, the more defined curl you will get, So release the hair in your hands right after the clamp is closed, and let it get rolled in the chamber to enjoy the curling.\n3. My hair is too long/too short, too thin to curl?\nIf your hair is too thin or too short(less than 15cm), you may not get the ideal curl you want.\n4.
