We use the included cup to hold his fat crayons so he can use the desk surface for coloring books and have the crayons at hand. He likes the bin under the seat; it is generously sized and durable.

The droor on the bottom kinda just slips right out the back but we don't care about that mainly cared about durability and safety. Very sturdy seat",

My husband ended up barely tightening hardware and augmenting joining with construction adhesive. One piece also required shimming to fit properly. I wont recommend against buying - the desk we ended up with is beautiful and solid - but buyers should expect extra care and effort may be required to get a solidly-assembled desk that can stand up to a rambunctious child!",
