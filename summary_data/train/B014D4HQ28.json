Only thing it doesn\u2019t really live up to That. It has a hard time rocking at all and it\u2019s pretty much a joke. Especially if you have slick flooring like wood which i have. If i put it on a rug it does kind of rock just not well.",

With the back down and the chair in non-rocking position it is like a baby recliner and is great when baby is sick with a stuffy nose and can't sleep. My older grand kids call it their beach chair and sit in it to read or watch tv.",

I was hoping that there was a way to let her sit in a more upright position since it says it is for infants to toddler, but that is not possible. Also, she can bat at the toys but cannot actually grab the toys that hang on the chair. I have a grandson due soon so perhaps he will get more use from this seat.",

      "text": "I Purchased this for use in my in-home daycare so it gets above average use on a daily basis. We love the fact that both infants and toddlers fit in this nicely. Unlike other rockers this one will not tip. I also like the fact that It has rubber feet and will not scratch my floors. The liner is easy to remove and launder. This is hands-down the best and safest seat we have ever used. We liked it so much we bought another one immediately.",

We didn't plan on using it for whole day, but we are sure will use it more in the next few months. It's solid and looks nice, I like the size as well, not too big/heavy. Will recommend it to my friends-- if the baby would like to stay inside, I' ve heard some babies do not like to be put in the rocker.",

The batteries it reacquires are not the type that one would typically have in the home. It's really cute. The straps are great. The animal toys on the bar do not come off.

My chair also seems slightly lopsided as I read on another review after I'd ordered. But I bought it to rest my newborn so she's not in her crib all day. I trust it will be sufficient for that purpose.",

The reason I gave it four stars is because the instructions for assembly are a bit confusing for such a simple seat. It also was missing a screw, so I've got to find one that will work.",
