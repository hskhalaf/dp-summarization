My baby would not sleep on her back in her bassinet... it\u2019s just not a natural position for them in the early months... so this helps her feel a little more \u201csnuggled\u201d. I was worried she would be able to get her face stuck against the side but there really is no way. We use the Snuza monitor on her anyway so there is a happy baby and peace of mind for mom! I was going to deduct a star for price but products made in the USA are inevitably more expensive and I would rather pay the higher price to have it made here and not penalize the company for doing so... so 5 stars!",

The bottom is not cushioned at all so be careful what you lay it on and how hard you lay baby down in it. The cover is easy to remove and wash.",

I ended up returning it unfortunately. I know all babies are different and I am happy for those that this worked for, but that wasn't the case for us.",

Recently she had started rolling around in the bed making me nervous she would 1. Roll off the bed 2. Roll under the covers 3. Get squished. This 100% eliminated all of those issues PLUS it helps her fall asleep and stay asleep better. She digs the closeness the pillow provides and is safe in the family bed. I also move it into her crib during the day to help her nap- seems to help with the transition.",

It's easy to squish into a suitcase and then we don't have to lug a bassinet or pack n play around. Instead, we just put her snuggleme on a separate bed, or in bed with us. She's never been able to roll out of it, so for now it feels plenty safe.",
