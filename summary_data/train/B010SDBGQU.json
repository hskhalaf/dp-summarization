Now I have to wait for Garmin to decide if they are going to repair or replace with a refurbished unit??? Garmin quality has gone downhill since I had my 800. I wish I\u2019d never \u201cupgraded\u201d to a new model.",

Bluetooth sync works great with my iphone 6, whereas I had issues syncing both my 500, 510 and 1000 over bluetooth. The one thing I miss from the 1000 is the wifi connectivity, it was very handy to finish your ride at home and have it auto upload over wifi... otherwise, great device! I have not tried the strava segments feature yet, so I can't speak to that.",
