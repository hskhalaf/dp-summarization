I bought the same bottle at Sephora a few months before this and when I got this in I\u2019d spent so much I used it anyways since I couldn\u2019t buy another bottle at the time. I ran out faster than I did before and had to use so much more than I had used with the one from Sephora. I just returned to Sephora to buy my third bottle and there is a marked difference. If you want to try this product go through Sephora not Amazon as it is not the same.",
