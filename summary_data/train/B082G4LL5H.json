When I tried to re-attach it to the plastic tube in the tank, the tube disintegrated. So now the dilemna of should I bring it somewhere to be fixed and maybe get a $150 bill to fix a $125 (new) chain saw? Probably not, so it becomes a throw away item.",

The factory chain will dull quickly, so definitely pick up a spare aftermarket one. 2. When the saw gets hot, it becomes exceptionally difficult to start. I noticed the gas in mine was boiling and it was probably vapor locking. For the occasional limb or tree, it is a decent saw. But if you need to stop to refill, you may run into restarting issues like mine.",
