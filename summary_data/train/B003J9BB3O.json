In itself is a heavier truck/handcart, however, very adaptable and worth every penny spent. After hunting for weeks, we are extremely pleased with this product. Thank you Harper Trucks for an excellent product!",

Will the deep scratches through the outer coating advance rusting?",

The plastic wheels got a bit chipped here and there on the rough concrete but held up to get all of our furniture over to the new place. Some of our furniture was right around 500 lbs and this cart did not bend or break under the weight.",

      "text": "Product feels great but both of the lower wheels have broken internally so it can now only be used in the up right position. No more than 150 pounds at one time has been on the dolly so I have no idea why the wheels would suddenly crack. It's past the return deadline with Amazon so I'll see if this is covered under warranty or just get some new wheels.",
