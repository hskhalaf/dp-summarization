Any adjustment to the size of this device to anything larger than its original size, including using the strap that is enclosed with this product, leaves portions of the hooks\u2014hooks (think scratchy end of Velcro\u00ae\ufe0f) and loop closure\u2014exposed, which in turn catches on anything soft.
