I did a fair amount of research regarding different cycles, wheel size, etc as I wanted one that was great for beginners but also would remain fun and be good for tricks etc as skill level increased. This unicycle perfectly fills that need and has been a blast accommodating everyone in our family from the youngest at age 13 to adults. I would highly recommend.",

After a few months, she completed that goal and we purchase this is a reward! Since then, it\u2019s taken a real beating on our driveway, but still going strong! It\u2019s nothing fancy, but the adjustable seat works very well! It was a bit too tall for her, so my husband sawed off a few inches of the seat so it could lower to her height.

The inside packing box had some damage, wish that had been noted by Amazon before packing into the larger crate for shipping. This very heavy item just had too much jump around room in the larger crate and a tighter pack was needed. All in all, good product for the price and appears to be well made.",
