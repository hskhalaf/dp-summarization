It also comes with cursive days of the week and months, along with a pouch to store those in as well. My only qualm is with the stand for the felt board, which is seems very flimsy, but obviously it\u2019s not intended to support anything except this light board so I think it will hold up just fine.",

It's a little annoying because now I either need to put the symbols in with certain letters or put them in a separate baggy and hope they don't get lost.

No broken plastic was in the box and the box was undamaged, so it was obviously cracked before being packaged. Additionally, the scissors that come with it fell apart twice so I gave up using them. Also, the tail that holds the letters in place on the board are VERY short and some of mine kept falling so I have to gently move it once it\u2019s all in place so it doesn\u2019t mess up.

The letters fall out of the board too easily, and since I had to clip the sprue remainders on each letter, I'd rather have had them on the sprue at a cheaper price. Then I could have clipped them into groups and kept them organized. As it is, the characters come jumbled together, and organizing them is time-consuming.",

      "text": "This letterboard was packaged nicely and I was so excited when I opened it and found all the goodies for such a reasonable cost. It came with a 10\" letterboard, easel, 3 sizes of letters and a nice wooden box to house the letters. Not to mention the tons of differnt symbols, emoji's, and other characters included. This letterboard is a STEAL!! If you weren't sure which one to buy, choose this one...you won't be disappointed.",

I was disappointed as it was a gift for a friend and didn't realize until I tried to put a birthday message on it. I contacted Little Hippo and they promptly sent me a new set completely free and gave me a small refund. The replacement board and letters are awesome. They stick perfectly and there are so many fun sizes and cute accents. It is truly a well thought out product of great value if you compare to other companies and what is provided. I will be purchasing more in the future.",

It's okay for what i bought it for, but i was expecting much more with all the positive reviews this received.",

The actual board had loads of sawdust on it and is impossible to remove it all. A small bag is included that i'm not sure exactly what it's for but is falling apart. Frame on the felt board has some slivers. It does work just fine but if I would pay a bit more to get higher quality if I were to purchase again.",

Only downside is the letters are all mixed together in the holders so it could be a bit of pain to find letters. It's a difficult problem to solve, though, as you can't have a slot for each letter or the holder would be GIANT. esp with multiple letter sizes and different symbols.
