      "verdict": "The Asics Gel DS Trainer 23 received mostly positive reviews from consumers. They welcomed the snug and locked upper of this stability running shoe, emphasizing its capacity to accommodate lateral foot-movements. People also lauded its versatile design, functionality, and durability. There were a few complaints about the lack of additional colorways, but that didn\u2019t deviate the shoe\u2019s status as a worthy update to the long-running DS Trainer series of road running shoes.",
      "pros": [
        "The upper unit of the Asics Gel DS Trainer 23 wrapped around the foot surely and securely, stated several consumers",
        "Some runners noted that wearing this shoe for various running sessions and gym training felt agreeable",
        "Most testers revealed that the in-shoe experience was instantly comfortable, that it didn\u2019t need a break-in period",
        "The lightweight nature of this product gained some fans who desired functionality and style in an insubstantial package",
        "According to several users, it worked admirably as both a trainer and as a racer",
        "The durability was lauded as it resisted wear and tear satisfactorily",
        "A purchaser reported that the upper\u2019s secure yet uncomplicated fit permitted lateral movements"

      "cons": [
        "Some people lamented the drought of colorways",

Had tried a half size initially as ASICS are notoriously small, but that was definitely not enough! Nice design though. Fingers crossed they perform well.",

The manufacturer has emphasised lightness at the expense of build strength. I will go back to Brooks, or New Balance.",
