Many people said they had a hard time assembling it but we didn't find that to be the case although the parts are not labeled. We were concerned that our wine glasses might not fit because of their height (9 inches tall) but they fit perfectly, all 12 of them. The opening for the glasses is 17.5 inches wide X 10.5 inches deep. It will hold glasses up to 9 inches tall.",

I had to follow the advice of another reviewer and put it together in a different order than the instructions called for. The hex screws were a pain, and there are a ton of them! Also, the stain on one of the sides didn't go all the way down so there's a white line. Thankfully, that side went against the wall so I was able to use a furniture marker to make it work. Once everything was together the unit looks nice and works well.",

I am very upset as I bought all 3 of these as a set and now I have to put my glasses elsewhere. Do not purchase if youre planning to buy expensive glassware chances are they dont fit because these are probably made for the real basic wine glasses. And i have cats so placing them on top I might as well break them myself.",
