Sometimes I need to work late, and I don't want to disturb my wife, so I bought these as an alternative to a desk lamp so I can see my keyboard. I mounted them under my monitor so they light up my desk directly below the screen. Being able to choose different colors and adjust the brightness is awesome. Also, I was able to trim it to length by cutting at the contact points between two LEDs. If I ever need anything like this again I wont hesitate to purchase.",

I purchased the one with the remote but unfortunately it wasn't there. i checked the only bag but only the actual led strip was inside. I'm a little disappointed that i'm not going to be able to use the other colors. As of right now the color is blue. I guess i'll either return it and buy it again hoping the remote comes with it or stick with the color for the time being. Other than that, it works just fine. A shame indeed.",
