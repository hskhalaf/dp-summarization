I've read that in the future they condensate, in hoping that's not the issue, but speaking as of right now, these things are incredible!!!! They look so good and are so bright, I'm very Happy! They fit PERFECTLY in the factory fog light holes for a 2003 to 2007 silverado.... I HIGHLY recommend these for the money.... NOW 6 months down the road will I still feel the same way, idk..... but I sure hope so!",

I have a backup camera but I can not see anything at night because the stock backup lights are too dim and they are too high off the ground to light up the road/driveway behind me. I added these under the back bumper and they are awesome! Super bright and they look pretty good. I might have purchased the smaller ones (in hindsight) simply for esthetic reasons, but I can't complain. I am thinking of ordering a couple more for the bed of the truck, under the tonneau cover, so I can see easily at night. I would definitely order again and would recommend!",

It whistles something fierce on the highway but black automotive door edge trim on the bottom and top two fins got rid of it. The Rigid rubber isolator didn't work to stop noise on this bar.

If the lights are on we lose ABC. I've tried a different power supply and installed a filter. It's the LED lights causing the interference.

Hopefully this will help some in their decision for this light bar. Due to location the light bar only illuminates forward area but I will be placing side lights in the near future to help see the mower deck.",

We used these lights for setting up our campsite in the dark almost every night of a 9-day road trip, and couldn't have asked for more. The only issue is that two of the lights show water inside, almost immediately after installation. I waited 9 months to install them so I can't get them exchanged, but I would still highly recommend these lights.",
