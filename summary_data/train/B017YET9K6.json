I did get 40 packs but it seems the asparagus was duplicated and I didn't get any arugula. The packaging is nice as is the booklet and I love the little clippers. It's an excellent starter kit and although I haven't planted all 39 (I don't have enough yard space!). I did the tomatoes, lettuce and peppers and they all had a good germination rate. The only type that hasn't germinated for me is the snowball cauliflower but I will give some of those seeds another try. Looking forward to doing the melons next.",
