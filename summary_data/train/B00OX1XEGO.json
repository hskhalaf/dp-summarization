We are coming to the end of our fourth week and have had TWELVE dry nights. We are amazed, my son included. If only we would have heard about Therapee sooner. We've tried restricting fluids after 6 PM, taking to the bathroom in the middle of the night, alarms and medicine. Even titrating to a higher dose of medicine didn't work. If you're reading this, you know how devastating this can be for your child. Yes, this treatment is a bit pricey however, so are the countless pull ups ...well worth the investment!",

After 2 weeks he stopped wetting the bed and has had only a handful of accidents since. I recommend this program without reservations.",

I rarely write reviews but this program and the service you receive is deserving of one. I was having some problems with the alarm and emailed the support contact. They were very responsive and actually ended up calling me to resolve the issue. The error was mine but they were helpful in resolving it.We followed the program as closely as possible and it worked well for us. I am pleased and my son is happy that he can go to camp without worrying about bedwetting!",

The device triggers an audible alarm when it feels moisture so you be woken up from a deep sleep night after night for the first week or so. Just like Pavlov's dogs - a bell rings and they salivate. In this case, an alarm sounds to wake you and help your child to go to the potty. Don't let that deter you! THIS PRODUCT WILL HELP YOUR CHILD STOP WETTING THE BED! That is the prize, after all - so don't give up!",

Within 10 days, she was completely \u201ccured\u201d - it has been 6 months & she has not had an incident since! I was shocked at how well it worked & how quickly! Highly recommend.",

We log in our daily progress, listen to each video session, and after beginning the exercises recommended, my son is doing much better. It has been a month since he last wet his bed, he seems more confident, and I am a happy mother. TheraPee has been a great investment, and I highly recommend it.",
