They want you to unscrew the unit yourself, remove the HD and do all kinds of things and it takes a day to get an answer to the next step. In short, you are your own repair person to get it working. Had I known there is no phone tech support I would never had bought it. I am still trying to get them to replace it according to their 2 year warranty replacement policy but I don't know if they will honor their promise. Will update later. Buyer beware.",

Will need to set cameras to \u201crecord motion only\u201d in order to store video for longer periods. System does not come with mounting boxes for cameras. You will need to purchase mounting boxes separately if you wish to hide the camera wire harnesses. Overall, a decent security camera system at a decent price.",

The picture quality is great, and being POE powered means you can expand it easily by connecting cameras to a PoE switch, and there's only one wire to run. You can extend the reach by simply joining standard network cables together if the included 100ft. cables aren't enough. The only thing I really wish for was a 2x/4x/8x speed playback option for playback, instead of having to jump to certain times. I'm currently running 6 cameras on my system and love it.",

The phone app makes it simple to connect and see what's going on at home at any given moment or if I get an alert that I want to check out. I am looking forward to some even higher resolution cameras to see if I can read license plates at an even further distance. Just make sure that you have enough internet bandwidth to handle all of the cameras.",

You don\u2019t have to hook up where your router is. Just buy a WiFi extender is what I did. Best unit I ever had. Well worth the price!!",

I pulled the Samsung system out and sold it to buy two more cameras for this system. Way to go Reolink!",

I then placed RLC-423 and a bullet on trees about 20 feet away from The 2 main entrances to our house. This was to give us another angle prospective. For the cameras on trees I dug and placed the wire in conduit. I had done much research prior to purchasing This system and 9 months after the install we are still very pleased.",
