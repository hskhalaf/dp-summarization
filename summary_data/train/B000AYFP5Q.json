If you use the included software, the photos print just like they look on your computer screen and are excellent quality in terms of color and resolution. (If you print from photoshop or some other program, you may have to spend time adjusting the colors of your files to get them to print correctly.) Also, the ink cartridges are ~$14 each and you need refills rather frequently. I've also had a hard time finding these refills-- it seems that these ink cartridges aren't as popular as those for other canon models and are often sold out or hidden at the very bottom of the shelf.",

It produces wonderful photos on photo paper, although the quality on plain paper is less striking. Prints relatively fast, the thing reads all cards other than xD, and the screen is very userful.",

I don't know if any of you have had this problem. But any how back to this KICK BUTT photo printer, the photo's come out looking like what you would get if you develop them at the store. GREAT for Scrapbooking, & doing fun things with you photo's.With PC or with out PC(to just print photo's) VERY EASY TO USE, very easy(my 11yr son use it). WELL WORTH THE $$$$$$$$$$$$$",

      "text": "The PIXMA iP6600D photo printer is the quintessential printer. Your photos will impress and everybody will want to know what photo printer you have. This PIXMA model makes you a creative artist. I wouldn't want another brand other than a Canon. I own this printer and I was convinced upon receiving my first developed photo that Canon need not worry about the competition. If you want a photo printer that is going to make you #1 with photo enthusiasts, the PIXMA iP6600D is the only way to go.",

      "text": "I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the photo prints from the PIXMA iP6600D. Good saturation without being cartoony. Smooth prints with the Canon Photo Pro paper. Great options whether printing from a camera or from the desktop. Quick, too - I have a G4 Quicksilver Mac with only USB 1.0, but 4x6 borderless prints take less than 30 seconds to come out. I have had trouble getting good prints from Photoshop but that probably can be fixed by fiddling with the color profiles. Better documentation on how to fix colors from different applications would have been appreciated. Still, a great printer for the price.",

Replacement cartridges can run into big bucks, especially if the printer only takes 2 tanks and you have to replace the entire color one even if only one of the colors run out. This printer uses multiple tanks, which is good, BUT I could find no generic/compatible cartridges available for it yet. Try looking on the web for the CLI-8 cartridges and see how much they cost. The other Canon Pixma's like the 6000 have compatible cartridges that are available very cheap, so watch your wallet when considering this product.",

Canon Help Center happily offered to send me a refurbished printer, in place of my \"new\" one, or suggested that I personally take is to a service center. How absurd to suggest either choice at my expense? I am returning this printer direct to Amazon, asking for a replacement. I can only hope that I get a truely new one.",

    "description": "Premium Performance with 3.5\" Color LCD Viewer for Easy Photo Direct Printing\n\nAMAZON.COM\nThe PIXMA iP6600D Photo Printer is a photo-printing powerhouse, with incredible quality and high end convenience. It delivers an amazing resolution of up to 9,600 x 2,400 dpi, for detail and clarity that will surpass your expectations. To achieve this, Canon Full-photolitho-graphy Inkjet Nozzle Engineering (FINE) uses a next-generation 3,072-nozzle print head that ejects precise, consistent droplets as small as one picoliter. Plus, we've added high intensity photo cyan and photo magenta to the conventional four inks, to increase the accuracy of color values. \n\n The high performance doesn't stop there. The PIXMA iP6600D Photo Printer can produce a beautiful photo lab quality 4\" x 6\" borderless print in approximately 46 seconds. Plus, its advanced paper handling provides you with several smart printing options. The dual paper path allows you to keep two different paper types always loaded and ready to print. You can even create two-sided photos or special photo albums with select Canon media. \n\n With the extra-large 3.5\" LCD color viewer and control panel, you can evaluate and enhance the images on your compatible memory card before printing! For viewing, just insert the card into one of the built-in card slots and select the images. As needed, the PIXMA iP6600D Photo Printer will automatically correct for red eye, improve sharpness and enhance the light values on your subjects' faces. Or, you can fine tune the image yourself using the easy control panel. Then, print directly from the memory card! You can also print directly from a PictBridge compatible digital camera or DV camcorder. \n\n The Canon ChromaLife100 system combines the PIXMA iP6600D Photo Printer's FINE print head technology and newly developed inks with select Canon photo papers, with results rivaling that of many conventional photos. And with the new smart LED ink tanks, your LED lamp flashes when ink is running low, and flashes even faster when nearing empty. \n\n What's in the Box:\nPIXMA iP6600D Photo Printer, iP6600D print head, power cord, FINE cartridges: CL-51, documentation kit, easy setup instructions, Canon Photo Paper Plus Glossy for Borderless Printing 4\" x 6\" sample pack",
