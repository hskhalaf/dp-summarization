They came in a small, sealed see-thru plastic bag with no water. But that's okay since Marimo moss balls can be outside water for up to thirty days. Fast shipping and delivery! I've immediately added two of the largest in the 40 gallon Angelfish tank and one large and the tiny bonus one in with my King Betta (Blue Boy) in his Baby Biorb (which he loves). Should I need more Marimos, I'll be sure to order from this vendor again! Five stars!",

I rinsed them in water and they are sitting in water in a plastic container at the moment. However upon inspection they seem to have acquired some hitchhikers in their natural process. They did not come off with the simple rinse and soak. So I am treating them with parasite medicine. I'm not to upset as this is a natural product and these things happen. I will update after treatment.",

Some months later, after persistent and vigorous cleaning, I tried a betta fish. It was originally in a separate tank and thriving, but when I put it with the moss balls, its health deteriorated. No matter how hard I tried, the betta could not be revived. I suspect that a fungus infection caused the deaths. Why still a two-star then? They are aesthetically pleasing. Still, they are NOT worth the money. One strange thing is that they seem to suck in fish food and other particles.",

    "description": "The 4 LUFFY Giant Marimo Moss Balls are the natural live plants that may not be perfectly spherical in shape and lush green in color. You will receive around 1.5 - 2-inch diameter ball which is three times larger than the nano marimo balls. Since we sell 100% non-synthetic and safe marimos, sometimes there might be a few brown spots here and there. Do not consider them damaged or unnatural because just like organic food, real marimos cannot be perfect. A few brown spots just show that the product is natural. Give them proper care and if in a few days, the balls are not healthy green, please write to us and we will send you a free replacement immediately, no questions asked. \n\nThe benefits of adding Marimo Moss Balls in the aquarium are plenty. These moss balls do not require constant attention. In fact, they are very low maintenance live plants. Your shrimps and snails love feeding on the green ball. \n\nYou may also make use of the LUFFY Giant Marimo Moss Balls as a decorative item in social events or for the purpose of gifting. \n\nPlease note that sometimes marimo balls trap air bubble inside which causes them to float. In such a situation, gently squeeze the marimo and pop the air bubble. Release it into the water and you will see them settling down at the bottom of the water tank. \n\nNote : Since we will send you a live product and it travels a long distance to reach you, give it a gentle wash before using for the first time. Also, in the rarest case of you receiving the product in an unsatisfactory condition owing to bad weather or delay, write to us for a free reshipment or refund. We will solve the issue immediately.",

      "BRING HOME A LIVE PLANT THAT BENEFITS YOUR AQUARIUM --- The 4 LUFFY Giant Moss Balls are live plants. Fish excreta, debris, phosphate, and ammonia disturbs the natural ecosystem of the water tank. These balls help in creating a thriving atmosphere for the aquatic species.",
      "NO SPECIAL FOOD REQUIREMENTS FOR GROWTH --- Both aquatic organisms and marimo moss balls compete for the same nutrients for growth. Marimos leave a limited room for other organisms to thrive. If marimos are floating, rather than settling down, gently squeeze it and pop its air bubble. Release it into the water and you will see them settling down at the bottom of the tank.",
      "REAL MARIMOS ARE NOT ALWAYS SPHERICAL & MIGHT HAVE SOME BROWN SPOTS ON THEM --- As you buy LUFFY Giant Marimo Moss Balls, you should be able to differentiate between a real and a fake marimo. The 100% natural marimo will not always be spherical in shape or lush green in color. It is perfectly ok to have some brown spots. However, if you do find sparkling green and perfectly spherical marimos, there os a high chance that they are unnatural and synthetically prepared marimos.",
      "ADDS TO THE AESTHETIC BEAUTY & ARE LOW MAINTENANCE --- LUFFY prohibits the usage of dye that imparts artificial green color to the moss balls. Since it distributes non-synthetic marimo moss balls, expect to receive regular/irregular shaped moss balls which are not always in deep green color. Undoubtedly, the marimo moss balls add to the aesthetic beauty of the aquarium and are low maintenance. They simply require some light and freshwater.",
      "SNAIL-PROOF AND LOVED BY SHRIMPS --- Some snails love to feed on live plants, but when it comes to the LUFFY marimo moss balls, they nibble or eat food off it just like a shrimp. Shrimps, on the other hand, gorge on the green stuff and munch on any particle they like. We recommend keeping the marimo moss balls away from fishes such as Koi or goldfish as it\u2019s a tasty snack for them. It\u2019s safe for them, but you don\u2019t want your one pet to eat your plant pet."
