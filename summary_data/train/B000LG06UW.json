      "text": "I am really enjoying this treadmill. It has a small profile for my small living space, it was pretty easy to put together, and it makes walking so easy and convenient during the winter months when I do not want to walk outside in the cold. I tightened the tension quite a bit. Without tightening the tension, the tread seemed too slick for my comfort. I am glad I opted for a manual treadmill as opposed to an electric one. I like that my movement controls the speed of the treadmill as opposed to an electric model. I am thrilled with this purchase!",

Its small enough to move around easily but very sturdy. The tread still slides smoothly over the base. (I keep the area between the tread and base well dusted with a Swiffer.) The only advice I can offer to get the best results is to use a smooth even heel to toe stride. If you come down flat footed you'll press the tread against the base instead of pushing it along the base.",

I wish I could lower it and use my arms too. Aside from that, the price is right for what I needed.",

Then the user is constantly having to use their arm(s) to support their body while exercising. So even a short workout on it can be a thrasher. Jogging on it is awkward but possible.

      "text": "Let me tell you now... If you're out of shape like I was, this will kick your butt. It doesn't seem like it, but it will. That incline doesn't look like much in the picture (or even in person) but once you're on the thing, it's crazy. I really don't know why people would want to spend thousands of dollars on fancy powered treadmills when this offers the most strenuous workout I've ever had on a treadmill. Definitely worth every penny.",

I knocked a star off because once it's folded up, it's still too large to push under most beds. I think the design could've been better in that regard. Overall, though, I'd buy this again and I'd recommend it.",

I've had to loosen the belt a lot and use a lot of lubricant in order to make the walk tolerable. I weigh 230 lbs, and I am trying to lose weight, but I rather walk outside than use this belt. This was one purchase I deeply regret.",

It's a manual treadmill which makes you work harder and you have to hold on to the handles to avoid losing balance and possibly falling but I tie a string to the handles so it holds me in place and keeps me from falling or losing balance. It's not bad for the price but I wish I could affort a better treadmill. I love jogging so this manual treadmill is not exactly what I need to get the results I want. It's OK for me because I'm not too bit (5 feet tall; 130lbs) but I suspect wouldn't be as good for anyone bigger than that as it's not very sturdy.",

I don't like that you have to hold on to the bars everytime you use it to push down on the treadmill with your feet in order to move it. Whats good about it, is that it doesn't take up to much space because the bottom lifts up and you can stand it in a corner. oh and i found it hard for running on it because like i said you have to hold on to the bars. best for walking on it",

    "description": "You power the belt, you achieve the most efficient walking/jogging result you wanted! Fold it up, lock it in place and roll it away for storage. It is just that easy - keep the unit out of your way when not in use. Warranty is 90 days parts, 1 year frame. Maximum user weight is 250lbs. Not recommended or guaranteed for user over this limit.\n\nNote: Manual treadmill, it is self-powered and must hold onto the handles and walk with a fluid motion in order to make it work. Belt adjustment has been pre-adjusted; however, for information on belt adjustment page 13 from the manual can be viewed. \n\nAMAZON.COM\nMost treadmills are frightfully expensive, with bulky electric motors that power the treadmill while jacking up the price. No so the Phoenix Easy-Up manual treadmill, which asks the user to power the belt instead. The treadmill is outfitted with a heavy-duty weighted flywheel and a sturdy running belt that respond to your walking/jogging speed. The faster you run, the faster the belt spins, letting you reach whatever speed is comfortable. At the same time, the treadmill isn't completely low tech, as it offers a single-button electronics display that tracks your speed, distance, time, and calories (includes two AA batteries). And users with small homes or apartments will love the spring-loaded pull pin, which lets you fold up the treadmill, lock it in place, and store it in a closet or garage. The Easy-Up treadmill--measures 46.5 by 50 by 21.1 inches (W x H x D). It also carries a 90-day warranty on parts and a one-year warranty on the frame. \n\n Specifications:\n\n * Heavy duty weighted flywheel offers a smooth, quiet operation \n * Spring loaded pull pin securely locks the unit in the upright (storage) position and makes it easy to release for operation \n * Single button electronics displays speed, distance, time, calories and scan (two AA batteries included) \n * Water bottle included \n * Walking surface: 41\" x 13\" \n * Dimensions: 46.5\" x 21.1\" x 50\" (open); 21.7\" x 21.1\" x 50.2\" (folded) \n\n About Phoenix Health & Fitness\nEstablished in 1998 as a wholesale distributor of fitness equipment, Phoenix Health & Fitness offers a complete line of high-quality exercise equipment to the in-home and light commercial markets. Working with a state-of-the-art computer system, the company can offer \"just in time\" delivery and other critical services while living up to its standards of reliability, consistency, honesty, and urgency. Phoenix Health & Fitness develops many of its new concepts and products in conjunction with its sister company, Reflex Design, and enjoys a reputation for delivering quality products in a timely manner.\n\n About Treadmills\nWalking is still considered one of the most beneficial cardiovascular exercises for people of all ages, body types, and fitness levels. As a fundamental form of aerobic training, walking has numerous physical benefits for the heart, lungs, and circulatory system, while also increasing muscle tone and burning fat calories. Treadmills provide a convenient way to regularly exercise in all weather conditions in the comfort and safety of your own home.\n\n From beginners just starting an exercise regimen to advanced athletes looking to maintain their fitness level, anyone interested in getting and staying in shape can benefit greatly from regular use of a treadmill. Treadmills allow you to determine the pace, distance, and complexity of the workout based on your needs, all while watching television, talking on the telephone, or reading a magazine. Much easier on sensitive joints like the knees and hips, treadmill walking and running surfaces are typically long, padded platforms that allow ample room for a long stride and comfortable, low-impact walk or jog without the harsh contact of a concrete surface.\n\n While many different types, styles, and price ranges of treadmills exist, many of them offer unique features like a fold-up design for easy storage, an electronic display monitor showing speed, distance, workout time, incline level, and burned calories, and EKG grip pulses to monitor the heart rate while exercising. Regardless of the simple to complex features you may choose, treadmills offer an array of aerobic exercise opportunities that will provide long-lasting beneficial cardiovascular results without a commute to the gym or a jog in the rain.",
