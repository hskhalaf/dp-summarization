Nimble size and shape is easy to handle and control. Very sharp, and stays that way. The handle does not get slippery when holding with wet hands. Things do not stick to the blade. I do wish it had less curvature to the edge. But that's really a minor issue.",

The serrations do wear down over time. But, for me, the knife serves as a very handy kitchen tool for several years. When the serrations become too worn, I replace it with another one.",

Lesson learned! This thing doesn't do anything particularly well, except take up space in the kitchen. I would be able to forgive its lack of cutting prowess if it were comfortable to hold and use, but the grip is tiny and awkward, and this is coming from a guy with relatively dainty hands. At least it's another knife I can trust my roommates with.",

You don't want a serrated blade for the meat, but cutting through the hardened fat on the sides of the leg really does require a serrated knife. This knife was sturdy enough for the task! Many bread knives have blades that are too flexible and flimsy, whereas this one is stiff enough to work with something other than just bread! If it is stiff enough for jamon, it is stiff enough for anything else in the kitchen!",

Good weight to it, comfortable, and the German made blade is not only sharp but seems like a very durable temper to it so will hold up nicely over time and repeated sharpening.
