    "title": "Sony Alpha SLT-a35 16 MP Digital SLR Kit with Translucent Mirror Technology and 18-55mm Lens",
    "description": "Style:Body with LensSony SLTA35K Digital SLR Camera (Black)\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n The SLT-a35 joins SLT-a55V and DSLR-a580 at the heart of Sony\u2019s \u03b1 (alpha) DSLR lineup. These models slot in between the entry-level a390 and the 35mm full-frame DSLR-a850 and a900. \n\nCapture your perfect moments with Sony's exclusive Translucent Mirror Technology DSLR superior performance whether you're shooting HD movies or still images. Tele-zoom High Speed Shooting at up to 7 frames per second, complete with continuous auto focus. Auto focus is also visibly faster in Live View and HD Movie modes. \n\nTranslucent Mirror Technology \nConventional DSLRs can shoot. Or they can focus with the speed and precision of Phase Detection AF. They cannot do both at once. The SLT-a35 utilizes Translucent Mirror Technology that directs light to both the image sensor and the Phase Detection AF sensor simultaneously.\n\nTele Zoom High Speed Shooting \nThe translucent mirror makes it far easier to capture the decisive soccer kick or your baby at her absolute cutest. The Tele Zoom High Speed shooting mode shoots up to 7 fps at 8.4 MP while maintaining continuous auto focus and auto exposure.\n\nQuick AF for Full HD Movie Capture \nWhen most DSLRs shoot video, their Contrast AF is slow and visibly \"hunts\" for focus. The Quick AF Full HD Movie retains the same fast, precise Phase Detection you enjoy for still images. It's a decisive advantage for tracking fast-moving subjects and a major benefit of Translucent Mirror Technology. \n\n16.2 megapixel resolution \nYou get incredible detail and gorgeous enlargements. Thanks to the 16.2 megapixel APS-C sensor size and Sony Exmor APS HD CMOS technology, the camera achieves high resolution with no penalty in low-light sensitivity or sensor noise. \n\nAPS-C size HD CMOS image sensor \nWith 19.5 times the area of the typical camcorder image sensor, APS-C makes the difference between amateur and professional-looking video, delivering an exceptional combination of high resolution, high sensitivity and gorgeous, blurred backgrounds. \n\nSony Exmor technology \nConventional image sensors use only a handful of analog-to-digital (A/D) converters, which can slow you down. The Exmor sensor provides more than 4,000 column-parallel A/D converters. This helps enable continuous shooting at up to 7 frames per second.\n\nFull HD 1080/60i movies \nThis is one of the very few DSLRs with 1080/60i Full HD, exactly the same resolution and frame rate as most broadcast and cable HDTV channels. Records in 1080/60i AVCHD format, 1080/30p high definition in PC-friendly MP4 format and standard definition 480/30p in MP4 format.\n\nPicture Effect mode \nThere are 7 types (11 variations) of picture effects to choose from: Posterization (Color), Posterization (B/W), Pop Color,Retro Photo, Partial Color(R), Partial Color(G), Partial Color(B), Partial Color(Y), High-key, High Contrast Monochrome, Toy Camera. Each is unique and each give you a new and exciting way to make your images and videos pop. \n\nMulti-frame NR \nExperience incredible low-light shooting without a flash. The camera captures six images in a fraction of a second. Combining the data from all six, it creates a single image with a reduction in noise equivalent to two additional steps of ISO sensitivity. Sensitivity selectable up to ISO 25600. (Recommended for still subjects.)\n\nHand-held Twilight \nGet cleaner and sharper nighttime pictures\u2014beyond the capability of traditional cameras\u2014without using flash or a tripod. The camera captures six images in a fraction of a second. Combining the data with separate algorithms for still and moving parts of the picture reduces blur, minimizes noise and enables extraordinary detail.\n\nAuto HDR built into camera \nCaptures more scene dynamic range than a single exposure can handle\u2014and more range than photo film. Combines the best highlight detail from one shot, the best mid-tones from a second and the best shadow detail from a third for one incredible shot. Captures in a split second. (Recommended for still subjects.) \n\n3D Sweep Panorama Mode \nCapture vast scenic vistas and 16:9 shots in spectacular 3D. As you sweep across the panorama, the camera records separate right-eye and left-eye images that make landscapes come alive on your 3D television. Records both JPEG and MPO file formats. \n\nEye-Level Electronic Viewfinder \nThe Tru-finder Electronic Viewfinder (EVF) is super bright, easy to see with 1.1x magnification, ultra-sharp with 1.44 million dots (1.15 effective) and provides 100% frame coverage. Exposure preview and informative overlays make operation easy.\n\nEye-level finder for HD Movie \nThe eye-level finder is one of the reasons people love DSLRs. But that finder goes dark whenever you shoot HD Movies. The Sony SLT-a35 enables you to shoot movies with the added stability you get holding the camera up to your face and using the eye-level finder for framing a scene and focus. \n\n15-point Auto Focus \nTo maximize the value of Translucent Mirror Technology, Sony incorporates Phase Detection AF of great sophistication. Three cross sensors maximize precision.\n\n921K dot TruBlack LCD screen \nSony's 3.0-inch Xtra Fine LCD monitor has 921K dots for superb resolution. The TruBlack screen includes a special resin layer to suppress internal reflections, increasing contrast compared to conventional LCDs. Sunny Weather mode boosts visibility even further in bright sunlight.\n\nMain Sensor Live View with Quick AF \nMain Sensor Live View with Quick AF combines the optimum focus of Phase Detection with high quality Live View images right from the main sensor. This is made possible by Sony Translucent Mirror Technology.\n\nLive View in LCD or EVF \nYou can use both the LCD monitor and Electronic Viewfinder for composing shots. Both provide a what-you-see-is-what-you-get preview of white balance, focus, depth of field, exposure and 100% framing accuracy, plus informative on-screen displays. \n\nPhase Detection Auto Focus \nWhile Contrast Detection AF often hunts for correct focus, Phase Detection AF knows exactly where correct focus is, and goes straight for it. The Sony SLT-A35 provides Phase Detection AF when capturing HD movies as well as during still image capture, either using the viewfinder or Live View on the LCD. \n\nISO 12800 sensitivity \nIncredibly clear low-light pictures without sacrificing detail, made possible by the low-noise Exmor APS HD CMOS image sensor and refined BIONZ image processor.\n\nAUTO+ (Advanced Auto) mode \nGet cleaner, more dynamic pictures and fewer missed shots. Unifies and simplifies Sony intelligent technologies, the camera automatically recognizes the correct scene mode, then quickly shoots and combines up to six shots to produce images with greater clarity, optimum dynamic range using Auto HDR technology and lower image noise using 6 shots layering technology.\n\nSweep Panorama Mode \nCapture expansive landscapes automatically. Press the shutter and sweep vertically or horizontally. The camera does the rest, continuously shooting images and stitching them together. Up to 23 MP image size.\n\nPowerful creative control over movies \nWhile the camera offers fully automatic movie shooting, you can also control aperture (A mode w/ MF only), white balance and select Creative Style. During a movie shot, you can change the metering mode and adjust exposure compensation.\n\nPro-style \"rack focus\" movie effect \nA hallmark of today's movies is the \"rack focus\" effect, when the cinematographer changes focus between background and foreground subjects. This usually involves careful planning, a tape measure and dedicated a crew member for \"pulling\" focus. With the SLT-a35, you can perform this pro-style effect simply by changing the selected AF Area within the frame. \n\nCompact, lightweight design \nEliminating the moving mirror also reduces the camera's size and weight. It's not just remarkably advanced; it's notably small and light. \n\nHelp Guide \nProvides ready reference to advanced camera functions, helping to develop your confidence and skills as a photographer.\n\nGraphic Display \nClarifies the relationship between aperture and shutter speed, as well as the effect each has on photographic results.\n\nBIONZ image processor \nThe brains of the camera is a refined version of Sony's BIONZ image processor. Its chroma noise reduction delivers high-resolution, low-noise photos even at ISO 12800 sensitivity. Also enables up to 5.5 fps continuous shooting at full resolution, Sweep Panorama mode and more. \n\nDynamic Range Optimizer (DRO) \nImproves results with backlit subjects and recovers details hidden in shadows. Settings include Auto, Level with a choice of five operating levels and Off. \n\n1200-Zone exposure metering \nReads exposure directly from the main image sensor. Choice of Multi, Center and Spot metering accommodates a full range of shooting situations. \n\nRAW image capture \nSaves your pictures as compact JPEG files or ultra-high quality RAW files or both. RAW files save images prior to de-mosaicing, white balance, sharpness and color enhancement. This retains maximum latitude for enhancing the image on your PC. \n\nSteadyShot INSIDE stabilization \nImage stabilization reduces blur by compensating for camera shake. Typical DSLR systems build image stabilization into selected lenses only. SteadyShot INSIDE image stabilization is built into the camera body itself. You'll reduce blur with every a-mount lens, including macro and wide-aperture standard zoom lenses.\n\nPowerful supplied software \nTo help you refine and manage your images and video, the camera is equipped with computer software including Image Data Converter SR, Image Data Lightbox SR and Picture Motion Browser (PMB).\n\nFace Detection technology \nThe camera can automatically detect up to eight individual faces and adjust focus, exposure, white balance and flash to help deliver crisp, properly lit images of family and friends. Can prioritize children or adults. \n\nSmile Shutter technology \nCaptures a smile the moment it happens. Simply select the Smile Shutter mode and the camera takes the picture automatically. You can prioritize children or adults and adjust the smile sensitivity. \n\nHDMI output for HD viewing \nEnjoy HD movies and stunning still images on a compatible HDTV. The camera includes an HDMI output. In addition, the BRAVIA Sync system works with compatible Sony BRAVIA HDTVs enabling you to control camera playback using the television's remote. \n\nEight Scene Selection Modes \nThese help you get the shot by optimizing the camera for specific shooting situations. Select from Portrait, Sports Action, Macro, Landscape, Sunset, Night View, Night Portrait and Handheld Twilight Shot modes.\n\nSix Creative Style settings \nControl how the camera processes your images with six finishing styles: Standard, Vivid, B&W, Sunset, Portrait and Landscape. You can even fine-tune contrast, saturation, and sharpness to your personal taste. \n\nUp to 440 Shots of battery life \nTake up to 440 shots on a single charge with Sony Stamina battery power. Sony's InfoLITHIUM battery system enables you to see the percent of power remaining, so you can keep shooting in confidence.\n\nP/A/S/M exposure modes \nThe camera offers a full range of controls from the beginner's AUTO+ mode to P/A/S/M: Program, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority and Manual. On-screen prompts help you refine your skills, build your confidence and exercise greater creative control.\n\nAnti-Dust Technology \nAnti-Dust Technology helps keep the CMOS sensor clean, resulting in consistently clear pictures. First a static-free coating on the sensor's low-pass filter helps repel dust. Then vibration automatically dislodges dust from the sensor. \n\nBuilt-in Auto Pop-Up Flash \nTo help you shoot more effectively, the built-in flash automatically pops up and fires as needed when the camera is set to certain scene selection modes. The built-in flash can also trigger a wireless accessory flash (sold separately). The integrated hot shoe enables you to expand your lighting options with a range of accessory flashes (sold separately).\n\nVersatile on-screen displays \nInformative displays in the LCD monitor and electronic viewfinder include digital level gauge, graphic display of exposure settings. \n\nSlot for two media types \nFor cost-effective, convenient storage and sharing of your images, the camera accepts Memory Stick PRO Duo/Memory Stick PRO-HG Duo and SD/SDHC/SDXC media (Class 4 or higher recommended). (Memory card is required. All are sold separately.) \n\nPhotoTV HD compatibility \nOptimizes compatible BRAVIA televisions for gorgeous display of digital pictures.\n\nIndex and Slide Show Display \nQuickly review your photos using 6- or 12-frame index views, or as an automatic slide show with fade-in/fade-out effect.\n\nRemote capability \nWorks with the RMT-DSLR1 Remote Commander wireless remote control, sold separately. \n\n\nAWARDS",
