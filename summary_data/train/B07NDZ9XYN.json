Put the 2nd one on a hose and it LEAKED, profusely, from the slider mechanism and from the face of the nozzle. I contacted Amazon and they send me a replacement ... guess what - it leaks too. So 2 of 3 units leaked - that's a failing grade. I ordered two of a different brand with a similar design and they both work fine. I'd stay away from these guys.",

Well this is a nice unit and checks all the boxes for me: multiple usable patterns (some I don't use), paddle flow control, instant on-off, and a constant on trigger hold.

This is the best of the multi-position sprayers I've tried. Heavier than all the others because of the metal frame, but far more durable.",
