      "text": "A ski pole is a ski pole, until you look at small details. One, carbon fiber poles have a smaller chance of being broken or bent in airline luggage handling. Two, the grip is shaped to prevent a gloved hand from slipping down around the pole during an aggressive pole plant. Three, the strap adjustment is part of the top part of the grip, so there are no plastic buckles flying around to smack you in the event of an errant pole plant in large bumps. Great ski pole.",

The poles were a good height, and the strap held up well on the first five trips I did. The strap released well from my hand on a fall I had, which was on my second trip, and it made me more comfortable with the poles, for safety. I hope they last for years to come.",
