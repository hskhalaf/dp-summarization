Nothing that a crimp with a shifting wrench will not solve. 2. The sleeve in the fabric for the long rods is about an 18th of an inch too short making inserting the rods a bit of a struggle. Also I am about 230lbs if you are any heaver your mid section will probably be on the ground. I had to put a lot of weight on the legs to get them inserted. if this is for a smaller individual they may have a problem setting up this cot.",

This one fit those two requirements and more: it was affordable for the quality. It is a bit bouncy, but you get used to that soon enough. It is rock solid and really difficult to assemble - signs of good quality. If it were too easy to assemble, it meant it was loose and was going to fall apart. Not this one. Recommended.",
