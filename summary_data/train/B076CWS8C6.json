You immediately get a full library of games to choose from (with a few free ones off the bat). But the real star here is the multimedia capabilities. Watching video in your own cinema in VR is quite the luxury. Two small cons: 1) you need a mobile phone (apple or andriod) to set the GO up. 2) Oculus is owned by Facebook so it may be a little sketchy on privacy But those two cons are not enough to even drop this device down to 4 stars. It is a great, value device that deserves its 5 stars.",

I am not tied to being in front of a camera. I can now sit on my comfortable sofa while I enjoy VR. If your primary use is to watch videos or play simple games, then this is a great solution to enjoy VR.",

The 3D effect is awesome but resolution is not sharp at all, just fuzzy. I was disappointed because I was not expecting this. However, the games and 3-D immersion is pretty cool.

When setting it up & looking for serial # on headset - I noticed that the Manufacture Date on my SO CALLED \u201cNEW\u201d product was from back in 2008 - 12 years ago! So much for a NEW product! I decided to give it a shot anyway and after just a couple times using the Oculus Go, it Completely DIED on me. Wouldn\u2019t even charge or start! Just beeped at me. I immediately returned it. Tried to get a hold of the Oculus Company - Not even an 800 # to Contact.",

I wear glasses and I made every attempt to adjust things. Others with perfect vision used them too. The same is true for all. Very blurry... plus a visible grid pattern overlaying the actual images. My excitement for VR long term is undiminished. Perhaps I should have invested more money in higher end gear.... or perhaps it's just a matter of time until somebody perfects the technology and the experience. A lot of smart people are working on the problem. I'd recommend waiting.",

I said, \"may be contributing\", because I still have poor battery life after shutting off this feature.

After pairing, open the app on your phone and tap settings in the bottom right corner, there you'll find the option to turn this feature on and off.)",

However, what this devices does is allow you to play in VR and get the sensation of VR now. Being able to explore a virtual 3D space that surrounds you is eye opening and mind expanding. While I'm sure better devices will be available over the next year, this device offers an approachable gateway to VR for those interested in the experience and possibilities.
