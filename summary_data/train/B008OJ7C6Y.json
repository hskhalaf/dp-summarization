We got a hospital pulse ox instead. With this baby we bought an owlet instead and have had no issues with it. I would stay away from Snuza. They just want to sell you a unit.

When they get older, and roll around more it will fall off once in awhile but at least you know it works!!!! I have also given these as gifts to my friends who have had premature babies.

They do occasionally go off if the baby shifts and creates a gap- or the diaper is not close-fitting enough but for me that is just proof they work well! The battery life is amazing.

For the most part, the device stays very secure on my little girl and she is quite small (almost 7 lbs). After doing a bunch of research I found out that, unlike the owlet, this product doesn't emit any harmful EMF. This only happens with devices that have wireless connectivity. Although an app would be a nice feature, the alarm is plenty effective for alerting parents if there is cause for concern. I am so glad I bought this!",

After doing extensive research we decided to go with this product and absolutely love it!! It's small, un-intrusive, and very easy to use. We have never had a false alarm and thankfully never had a real alarm but the peace of mind is worth the money.",

We've used it for about a week now, and it has eased some of my anxiety. We had one false alarm when the Snuza slipped off of my baby's diaper. The alarm that went off on the Snuza was loud enough to rouse my husband out of his sleep, and he can usually sleep through anything. The vibration is definitely strong, but not enough to hurt the baby. I love my Snuza and don't regret getting it at all.",

She has been turning to her side since she was a week old and this monitor has given us such peace of mind during the night. We also anticipated having the occasional false alarm since she is such a wiggle worm but haven't had one so far (folding the top of the diaper down before clipping on does help keep the monitor secure), and she seems totally comfortable when it is hooked to her diaper. I also love the indicator light and optional beeping per breath feature. Would definitely recommend to fellow parents!",

    "description": "Snuza Hero baby monitor is a wearable device which attaches to your baby's diaper and monitors your baby\u2019s abdominal movements. The Hero detects the slightest of movements and will alert you if abdominal movement is weak or less than eight movements per minute. If the Snuza Hero detects no abdominal movement for 15 seconds, it will vibrate in an effort to rouse your baby to resume abdominal movements. Often the vibration is enough to rouse the infant and Hero will revert to monitoring mode. However, after three vibration/rousing incidents, a Rouse Warning will alert you that movement has stopped for 15 seconds on three occasions. If an additional 5 seconds of no abdominal movement is detected a sharp audible alarm will sound.",
