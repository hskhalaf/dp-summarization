Pros: hardwood floors is good, maneuvers around furniture is great HOWEVER Cons: If you own shag rug, this vacuum is the WORST ever invented. The beaters have no adjustment and that makes pushing this vacuum over shag almost impossible. If you do, then after awhile a burning smell starts... it is the beater mini-motor overheating. Like I said, WORST ever, poor overall design, and finally dumping it so a better brand.",

The filter is easily removed and cleaned. Dyson is the only vacuum I will ever use again. I very highly recommend it.",

The first time I used it I had to empty the canister a couple of times...it pulled so much more dust and pet hair out of the carpets and transitions easily between carpet, tile, and hardwood without requiring an adjustment. The filter requires cleaning at least once a month, but considering how much it picks up, it makes sense and is worth the small inconvenience.",

I have a weak wrist and after a while it gets too much to maneuver and push around the dyson. Other than that, I love it!",

Also it clogs very badly with small items like cereals, rice etc on the bottom suction inlet pipe. It never picks up small items not even in the carpets. I liked the $75 Bissell Vacuum Cleaner better than this. Waste of money on this purchase, I am posting some pictures on the clogs. I don't recommend this to a friend, I will stay away from Dyson products in the future. Since I don't have 0 star, I have provided 1 star.",
