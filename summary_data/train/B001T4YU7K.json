Two, this doesn't stain well at all. You can definitely see what is filler and what is natural wood. I have bought a total of three of these altogether since I only use the filler for repairing rough work such as mars on a bench saw stand I built. I'd buy something else if I were looking for something that would closely match the wood I'm filling.",

I'm now on my fourth tube and I could not be happier with the results. This wood filler performs better than expected. Once dry it forms a strong, dense fill that sands well to match surrounding surface levels. Paint adheres as per regular wood. Staining isn't so great as it tends to be lighter than regular wood, however, touch up with darker stain will remedy this problem. I'm hoping future batches of this product are just as good.",
