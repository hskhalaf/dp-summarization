I recently purchased a hammock from this seller and was so impressed by it that I decided to purchase my patio swing from them as well. It's literally perfect! The hardware came so neatly laid out and the instructions were very clear. The cushions are thick and comfortable and I absolutely love the brown tones. It's a very sturdy frame but the decorative touches make it gorgeous. The adjustable canopy is also very handy so that we aren't baking in the direct sun. This patio swing is easily twice the quality as the swing comparably priced at my local home store.",

I guess time will tell on the long term durability. I purchased in April 2016. Ok, but not great.",

The cushions are not made to get wet, so finding a good cover is hard that doesn't tear or get pushed around by the wind. I wish the cushions and top had been rain proof. But it looks really beautiful and is comfortable. Rocks quietly and smooth. Heavy to move to the garage in winter...takes 2 people.",
