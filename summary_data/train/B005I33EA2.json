When the inner layer gets wet from sweat they become hard to remove and almost impossible to put back on. It takes an overnight on the heat grate to get them dry again. Inner liner is not removable.

They have kept my hands dry and warm during a cold January. One star off for a running a bit small. I don't have giant hands, but the large is pretty snug. You might want to try a couple sizes if you aren't sure. Also, my fingertips did get a little cold in near zero temps, but I'm not too surprised or disappointed by that. I also bought a pair of the Carhartt W.P. Waterproof Insulated mittens for crazy cold. All in all I recommend these gloves.",

Everytime we talk he mentions how good these gloves are and told me to make sure I leave a good review. He isn't just shoveling snow for 5 minutes either, he is a flow back operator so he is out in the elements for long periods of time. I'm only going off of what he says, and we are from South Louisiana so if he is warm and happy at -15 degrees than so am I!!",

However, when using them again the next day, the insides were still damp from the previous day. Despite some reasonable attempts to dry them (putting them in front of the hot air vent for 12 hours), they held on to that moisture pretty well. However, I used them in their damp state anyway, and I still felt warm in them.",

Waterproof was not the problem in fact the waterproof worked as advertised. The problem was at the finger tips of the gloves - my finger tips after 1/2 hour were so cold that I had to go inside to warm them up. Carhartt needs to provide extra insulation at the finger tips to correct this problem.",

I work out doors all day in Oregon,along the Columbia River, these gloves got soaked in 20 minutes,and when you them off they are hard to get back on from the wetness inside that adds resistance to your hand, bunching the liner inside. The insulation also makes it hard to get a good grip on objects because it slips around inside.I will not buy again. Best way is still to oil my old leather gloves,I may get cold hands but at least I can get a better handle on my tools",
