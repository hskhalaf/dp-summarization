This is pretty much useless unless you are trying to mash foods that are already heavily cooked and mushy, to begin with. Don't waste your money on this overpriced product. I purchased thinking that OXO wouldn't make a junk product. Sadly, I was wrong.",

I'm baffled at some reviews that indicate it works well. That's not my experience with this product.",

Cheaply made and certainly not worth the cost. If I could give zero stars I would.",
