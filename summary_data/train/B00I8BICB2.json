I tried contacting Sony customer support and they provided minimal help outside of recommending that I try using different batteries. This has been very frustrating as I enjoyed the camera quality, but now I cannot charge my batteries through it. The micro USB Port should not brake down like this after such minimal usage.

My only complaint, the battery life is less than stellar. However, from what I've read this is a common issue with mirrorless cameras.

And apparently, Sony does not make one. That is just ridiculous to me as I am finding it very hard to find one with solid positive reviews and will either have to buy a new lens that comes with one or just buy one of the cheap hoods from a third-party.",

The on-to-shoot time is a little slower than your average dSLR, but the autofocus is much faster and works fantastically.

Thought about buying 2 for when the first one had to be retired for whatever reason. Takes the most beautiful pictures, sharp, clear, vivid colors that I'm amazed with. Makes me feel like a photographer (which I'm really not by any stretch). SONY done it up right on this one, Would recommend to a friend.",

I've done 3 second exposures by hand, that's crazy! The battery life is horrible though. Get a set of battery's and a wall charger. Wasabi makes a set that seems to work well for pretty cheap. And get a huge memory card, the camera is fast (lots of pictures will be taken) and if you are shooting raw, it will fill up fast.",

There doesn't seem to be much penalty compared to using the view finder. With Canon, I would miss shots if not using the viewfinder.",

I also use it for city photography and outdoor/hiking, all of these generally done at night. Really a wide range of use.
