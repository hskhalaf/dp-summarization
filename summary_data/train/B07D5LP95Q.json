I had a problem with the mic - so I emailed the email that was on the box and asked about fixing it. They sent me a new one free of charge without me having to send in my old one, which saved me money on postage. They also replied to my email in less than two hours and shipped the microphone instantly. Thanks for handling everything so well!! Would highly recommend this product! :)",

And it\u2019s small size makes it ideal for toting around. Easy to use with music on our phones. We couldn\u2019t be happier with this purchase!",

Well, today I decided to bring it out and the plug where you insert the mic completely pushed it after I inserted the mic cord. So then I popped on a smaller piece for the second mic insert and it also completely pushed back. Now both holes for mic cords are no longer working. I can\u2019t use it anymore unless I open it and try to push it back out. Sad I missed my return mark.",
