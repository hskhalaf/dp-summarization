After wheeling about for only a few uses the wells fell off and no longer hold and cannot be modified or re-installed due to design...Another note: Others have complained about breakage at the plastic hose inlet. I fitted it with a 3' washing machine hose to effect strain relief. Problem solved. This device not recommended for these reasons.",

I have only used it a couple of times (once to wash concrete and once to wash vehicles) and I find it convenient and effective for those uses. Next job is cleaning siding and I am confident this machine is up to the task. The pressure washer runs only while the trigger is depressed and it runs relatively quietly.",

Realistic price should have been $150 in my opinion. One thing that already concerns me is the port to hook up the garden hose is again made from flimsy plastic and I can already see that getting broke by accident moving machine around work area. Has good strong pressure but not so much as to cause damage to what is being washed. Still works and nothing broken as of yet so keeping fingers crossed.",
