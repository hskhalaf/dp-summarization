Even with a make-up cleanser, I had to scrub pretty hard to get this off my eyelid. Perhaps there's a trick to it, but I think I'll keep looking for a new eyeliner.",

It certainly won't run down your face like in the movies if you cry a bit, but you will tend to look a bit like a raccoon. Back on the positives, it lasts quite a long time (days even) but it will smudge. Overall, definitely recommend for the longevity, easy application, and the price.",

      "text": "I have to say I'm one of those people who looks like a raccoon every time I wear eyeliner. So, based on reviews here, I decided to give this a try. I can say it does a really good job not smearing down my eyes but by the end of the day, even this starts to smudge a little. I also am not too good with the brush technique and find it difficult to apply. With that said though, it is a solidly good product and does what it says it will - stay on your eyes - and is a great price. So, I would recommend.",

The product feels nice and creamy when you take it from the pot to load up with a brush. Applying it is super easy since it glides on the lids (and i used an angled brush separate from the one included). I was able to create a clean, dark wing \u2014 which lasted up to 9 hrs with only my inner corner smudging. for the cost this liner is super worth!! :^)",

It's possible to control the width of the line from really narrow to rather wide, and do so quite easily. Also, a little goes a long way, and it's easy to see how much is left in the container. I am really happy I tried this product - recommended without reservation.",

The only downside is (like a pencil), it can smear *fairly* easily. Meaning if you wipe your eyes you'll come off with it on your hands... to be expected though unless you're using a liquid liner!

I forget the exact name of the colour--before, and loved that as well.
