I followed instructions to a 'T' but because the burners don't heat evenly, the cooking service didn't have a consistent conditioning on it. On about the 3rd heat/cool cycle I turned on the oven to 500 degrees applied flax seed oil and heated it up in there. The last picture was after 3 cycles and you can see that the whole cooking surface didn't get conditioned. Get flax seed oil and follow instructions, but use the oven",

First morning made breakfast on it. Pan sausage and eggs. Had 24 sausage patties on it at once. Cooked them just right but also quickly. Scrambled eggs on it. About a dozen all at once. Turned out great. Later that evening we did burgers. I had 14 burgers going at once. Very efficient. Easy to clean. Just just pour water on it while it\u2019s hot. Everything comes right off! Best thing we\u2019ve added to our camper. Could be used at home also. I think it\u2019s a great product.",

I have cooked over a griddle for years a chimp can use this thing it\u2019s so easy. Recommended for emergencies too.",

This is an awesome product, a great Grill for the money. Well worth it. Also bought the covers for it for another $17.",

      "text": "The Blackstone griddle has been great addition to our household. We probably don't use it as often as we would like but for the times that we have used it, it's been perfect. Build quality: Surprisingly, it's built well and very sturdy even though it's made in China. Ease of use: Very simple to setup, should take you less than 5 minutes from unpacking, hooking up the portable propane to lighting it up. Cleaning is a breeze if you are familiar with handling cast iron products. Do make sure that you season the griddle well before using it. I would recommend purchasing a propane adaptor to fit a 20 lb propane tank if you use it often.",

Also it goes through a green bottle of camping grill propane in no time flat. But it's a winner in the big breakfast department. But I'm going to have to find a place in the camper for the old Coleman grill too.",

Updated to 5 stars for making it right.",

If you hear a click, you need to close the valve back and wait 10 minutes or so and then reopen very slowly so you don't pop the regulator. Works great and I recommend the table that this sits on.",

My fried rice and things as simple as grilled cheese or just amazingly better in taste and text year. I would suggest purchasing the optional propane attachment and holes for use at home. The portable propane tanks you buy at Walmart don\u2019t last very long but are great for camping. One small tank would probably last two or three sessions. Also if you live in a humid area make sure you oil your grill after every use or else it will rust. Carrying case is also great.",

    "description": "Size:17 inchThe Blackstone Table Top Grill/Griddle is the perfect stove to bring with you to any event or occasion. 260 square inches of cooking spaces allows you to cook multiple things at the same time! Hate doing dishes while camping? No worries with this griddle, simply wipe it off with a paper towel after use and be ready for the next meal! Its convenient size makes it easy to bring with you to the park, camping, hunting, or any get together. Easy to clean and remove grease tray keeps cook top clean. The H style burner provides even heat distribution for optimal cooking across the whole griddle. As outdoor enthusiasts and founders of BLACKSTONE we dreamed of a quality outdoor griddle and/or grill that could cook for large groups and families. In 2005 we made our vision a reality by creating BLACKSTONE PRODUCTS. We then launched the 36\" BLACKSTONE griddle that is still popular for backyard cooking and which brings families and friends together for fun and food. Our spectrum of gas griddles and gas grills are popular for backyard living, a BBQ, recreational cooking or commercial grade cooking. Since then, the company has expanded dramatically and created a brand new look as well as a large new line of durable rugged innovative and portable cooking innovations including an outdoor pizza oven and the ever so easy to transport and set-up DASH - and our products will last a lifetime. By using the latest technologies available and complementing them with our own innovations, we feel we have the leading edge on the market in our categories. Our products are designed and engineered in the USA by people who are avid users and live to entertain outside - at home, in the tailgater parking lot or just about anywhere. We pride ourselves on the quality of our products and how well they function while keeping the prices very affordable. We have assembled a strong and enthusiastic team with the utmost passion for BLACKSTONE and outdoor cooking including excellent engineers, intelligent industrial designers and uniquely creative graphic artists. We have the capability to make any adjustments to our current lines or create new units all together, tailored around your needs in a very short time in contrast to our larger entrenched old-school competitors. Look forward to future innovations from BLACKSTONE sooner than later. We are more than just another outdoor cooking appliance company that only focuses on the numbers and overlooks the end users by neglecting quality or deferring to accountants. We are here to stay and hope you enjoy BLACKSTONE products as much as we do. Carry by hand",
