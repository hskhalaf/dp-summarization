I use it one or two times a day and it almost completely relieves my pain and stiffness. I can even go up to about a week with out using it before the pain begins to return.

Instead, I purchased one of the kinds that you loop around the door handle, and then it holds your head/neck in a hammock like sling, while you lay on the floor and slide away from the door to increase tension. That design accomplishes the desired decompression, without applying any undesired pressure to your lower neck/shoulders. I would recommend you save the time/pain and get that kind instead of this.",

Considering the low price, I was very happy. However, after a few uses in my office, just pumping it up while wearing as directed, it started leaking. At first the leak was slow, but it got worse until the product no longer work at all. So, if you think your issue can be fixed with one or two uses, it's worth buying. Otherwise, get a more durable brand. I am going to try another brand myself.",

It does take a bit to inflate and you can't really move your head once it's on and inflated but I think that's the point.",
