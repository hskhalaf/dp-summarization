I'm a 68 year old home owner and I've noticed that once you clean a carpet it gets dirty even sooner. Why? Because when you clean a good carpet you remove the stain preventing coating the helps keep the carpet clean. Bissell is the only cleaning agent I've found that restores that stain preventing coating (Scotch Guard). I've waited 30 days since cleaning my carpets and found that my carpets stayed clean for the first time after washing them with Bissell 2X cleaner. This is GOOD stuff!",
