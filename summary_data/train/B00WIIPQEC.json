I don't get it, was I not gifted with lightning fast hand-eye coordination and wit quicker than the speed of light???? I don't know if the game is defective or I'm defective, but I have to win one game against her before I die. It's my only wish in life. Don't buy this if you want to have a relationship with your friends and family. Unless you're highly competitive and good at card games. Then buy it and show the world what you're made of.",

      "text": "First of all - this is a great, fast-paced family game. Sort of like Spite and Malice meets Double Solitare. And I would like to clear up this issue about the expansion pack. IT IS DIFFERENT. Anyone who says otherwise must not play the game. It has to do with the color/picture combination on the BACK of the cards, which identifies which cards belongs to which player when the game is over. Of course the fronts are the same. That way everyone can play together. Because of the speed of play, probably not great for small kids, but a good family game. Not over complicated.",

I am so happy with the expansion pack, and we get great use out of it. This is so affordable, given that you actually get the game WITH the expansion pack.

It just has different colors to the shapes to make it possible for more to play. We were happy to buy this.",

    "description": "Size:Basic packDeveloped in Pennsylvania Dutch country, Dutch Blitz is a card game that's exciting to play and easy to learn. Perfect for family game nights, or to play with a group of good friends, you'll enjoy spirited competition as you try to get rid of your 10-card Blitz pile before anybody else. Not as easy as it sounds, though, because players don't take turns. You have to be the fastest to place your cards in sequence and in the same respective colors on the center Dutch piles while using as many cards from your Blitz Pile as possible. When your Blitz Pile has been exhausted, you've won. The original game includes four decks of 4 colorful playing cards and easy-to-follow instructions, while the expansion adds another four decks of different colors. Combine the packs to play with up to 8 players.",
