      "text": "The phone is pretty, has a great camera and good screen and was relatively fast with Ice Cream Sandwich. Then I updated it to Jelly Bean and I fully regret it. The phone is a pain to use, slower than many lower end smartphones out there, to the point where it becomes useless. Also the 3,5 mm jack stopped working after a couple of months. UPDATE: The phone has become a nightmare to use, to the point that many times I can't ever answer calls. I've done almost everything and this is just unacceptable. I imagine doing a rollback to ICS or using a moded Kitkat firmware would make this a good phone, but it's too much trouble.",

Needless to say he cant play music in his car off this phone. At all. Otherwise it arrived on time, no cosmetic damage, but how crappy and dissapointing",

It cannot be activated on any prepaid plans, because it is a 4g phone, and it not compatible with any prepaid including Page Plus. Only with a credit check or contract.",
