      "text": "The phone works so far very well. The issue I have is with the camera which is lousy overall. It does what it says. However they advertise this phone to be upgradeable to lollipop and we are July 31 and no upgrade. I call that false advertising from either Blu or Amazon and this is not correct. I would have waited to buy this phone. There is now a new version of this phone with lollipop. Poor business practice. Update: Still no update to lollipop and when call placed to Blu, they stated no update to lollipop. Amazon, change the description of this phone. NO LOLLIPOP UPGRADE.",

Processor isn't super-fast, but that's offset somewhat by the fact that this thing isn't bogged down with bloatware. My AT&T Sim card works great in it and I think the phone is actually faster than the HTC One+ it replaced with all the same Apps. I had no issues running Waze and streaming a podcast using bluetooth on my way to work. 2 days without a charge is probably more realistic for a heavy user...that's still great battery life.",

We have been through 3 different memory cards, several attempts to set up files to be written to the card and a hard reset on the recommendation of Blu service support. Finnally fed up of spending more time trying to fix the phone and very little time actually enjoying it. Getting a new phone tomorrow. No intention of going back to Blu again. Ever.",

I do not understand why people compare it to \"higher end\" phones or expect it to be the mother ship of all phones its $150 people, you can go spend $800 or lock into a contract and be disappointed elsewhere. It is a good if not great phone IMO I don't have any complaints and after a few weeks of use the battery life usually lasts me 2-3 days easily. I check emails, play clash, Call text, browse the web,use Google maps, watch videos all with ease. Another thing to note is the screen doesn't feel cheap nor look \"generic\" like cheap phones Usually look.",

I've posted a writeup on a workaround here:  Had this phone been available last summer, I would have preferred it over the Samsung S5 that I ended up buying.

Limited on-phone storage. Screen response is a bit slow and glitchy compared to say an HTC One (M8). Overall, for $150 unlocked, it's a good deal for someone who wants a dual SIM phone and long battery life.",

They all run out of phone memory even thought there is ample extra microsd space available. onc either runs out there is nothing you can do to fix this problem. You have to factory reset it and lose all your stuff. On a weekly basis. DO NOT GET BLU phones .. they are not working !!!",

Good for a backup phone, that's it.",

Just keep in mind that the user interface is choppy due to the 1 GB of RAM. But if battery life is you're most important feature in a phone that you use for only doing regular stuff such as Facebook and playing games with low graphics, then this is the best phone. I chose this phone over the Moto G 2014, because it has the Super Battery along with freebies that make you save money on cases and headphones.",

Switching from Dalvik to Art runtime smoothed some things out, as well as using Nova Launcher instead of Google Now. I don't know if my next phone will be made by BLU, but for the price I paid? I'd definitely consider it! (three months later) Still using it. Still charging it every other day! Nice.",

I don't use my phone very much but I have had it last all weekend. Thursday night through Monday night without charging and still had 36%. People that use their phones more might notice a shorter battery life but it will still be long. Performance can be kind of lacking at times but I would trade battery life and affordability for some performance any day of the week. Great phone.",
