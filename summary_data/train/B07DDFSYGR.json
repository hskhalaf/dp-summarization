The swivel and 360 rotation is nice and the clips works well just about any where. I will say I do have to re position. The fan often as it s not very sturdy. We do like the little essential oil (or bug reppelant) spot on the back. I spray babyganics bug spray on this and it really helps protect her from bugs.",

      "text": "Am i wrong in thinking since this fan takes 2 batteries instead of 1, it should be at least somewhat more powerful??? Well answer is NOPE..... I have the opolar single battery fan and on high it is just as powerful as this 2 battery fan,what gives?? wish this fact was mentioned in product description but it was not. i guess they designed it for long run time over more power but again no mention of this fact. product being returned...........",

I\u2019ve used it off and on during that time. The design is awesome. You can only charge it with a lithium battery station using usb connection. I use my power bank or my solar power pack. You can\u2019t just use a cell phone charger plug in. But it\u2019s very powerful. I can\u2019t tell you if it will hold up for a couple years.",

The fan is variable speed, which is nice. As far as battery longevity, we ran it for approx. 4-5 hours before we noticed a decline in fan speed. The clip is a nice feature too. And yes, this small fan moves air!",
