I simply wet my brush, and put a dab of this shampoo on my palm. Then rubbed the brush tip on my palm. After repeated rinse and wash it finally cleared out decades worth of makeup. The product calls it a shampoo, but I never saw any suds or soap. It simply just releases the makeup from the bristles. After finishing the cleanup and the dry up. The brush was still nice and soft, so there was no fear of it stiffening up due to soap residue.",

      "text": "This soap is supposed to be used to clean dirty make-up brushes. I had a few make-up brushes with old make-up left in them, literally for years with a couple of them. I found those lost in the hinterlands of my make-up drawers. I used both the Japonesque and some liquid dish soap. Both did about the same. The brushes came clean so I'm not real sure why the Japonesque is better to use than liquid dish soap. I guess the smaller bottle is easier to keep in your bathroom drawers or countertops than a large bottle of dish soap. But other than that, I didn't find it especially wonderful.",

That totally makes sense to me and I have noticed that my brushes I have that I have only washed with the japonesque soap are lasting longer than the brushes washed with the dish soap. Plus, this brush cleaner smells absolutrly incredible!!!! I honestly wish there was a body wash with this scent or shampoo even, I could bathe in it for sure!!! I'm about to order my second bottle.",
