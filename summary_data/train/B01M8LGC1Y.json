The thinking is getting one or two these will help me organically control the mosquito population. The Bat House is well built and plenty large enough to house many bats. The groves cut in the back are also cut in the back of the front so the bats not only hang around on the front of the back but also the back of the front (hopefully that makes sense, funny).. Being made of cedar I would think it will last for a long time in the elements. I'd definitely buy again. Now, I hope some bats move in...",
