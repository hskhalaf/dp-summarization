This Razor I wen't off the reputation of their scooters. This pogo stick is really stiff (I'm 180 lbs. and it was stiff for my weight). Also, the bottom portion does not go down very far to allow much bounce, which it seems like it goes down several inches less than my other pogos. I do like the folding handles/pedals which does allow easier storage if it matters to you, which it does for me when I have multiple pogo sticks.",
