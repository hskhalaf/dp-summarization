However, I decided to splurge and get the ThinkPad mouse.. I do not regret it! It's so light and it is plug-and-play. I can't believe I waited so long to get a mouse for my laptop-- working on it is easier now. If you have a ThinkPad don't get a regular wireless mouse-- get the ThinkPad mouse!!!",

Easy plug-and-play usb operation (I don\u2019t even mess with Bluetooth mice anymore as it seems pointless and less reliable). The magnetic cover is also a very clever touch that makes it a piece of cake to change the battery and clean. Great mouse, great price, zero complaints here.",

That said, does what you want a mouse to do. Is pretty sharp with its sensor. I struggle to say I'd recommend this mouse, because it is a bit small in my hands. Still, gets the job done. Extra points for ThinkPad branding.",
