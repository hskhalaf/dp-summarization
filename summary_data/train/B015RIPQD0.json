My teenager is rough on keyboards, as he likes to nosh while gaming...so Mountain Dew and junk food have been the downfall of a couple of keyboards at my house. Washable keyboards such as this one is what I've been needing all along :-) And this one does the trick quite nicely...feels and acts like a regular keyboard PLUS the convenience of being able to take a rinse-off and head back into service. Would definitely buy again...but here's hoping I don't have to for a while :-)",
