Since buying thsi camera I have also bought several Fujifilm lneses whist they are on special offer. These are also well made. So far I am very pleased with the p[hotographs that I have taken. I even saw a test result of the camera and the quality of the pictures was rated at 20 out opf 20...I have never seen another camera score this highly.",

      "text": "I have bought the Fuji Xpro-1 as a replacement for my excellent Canon 60d and I can tell that the image quality is even better. The results with the 35mm lens are fantastic, especially in low-light situations and can rival some full-frame cameras. As for the \"slow\" auto-focus, for me there was no problem at all, maybe because of the software upgrade. The hybrid viewfinder is also very convenient. For me, the electronic viewfinder works better than the optical one, but that's a matter of taste. Overall, this nicely sized camera is perfect for street and portrait photography and at this price, it's a bargain!",
