      "text": "Fabulous Price for some Awesome Readers!! I always have glasses on my head, in my purse, on the side table, at my neighbors, etc. THESE READERS WORK!! Fortunately I received six clear pairs all intact (didn't need sunglass readers). Compared them to some Foster Grants I had purchased from Walmart for $10. Same size, same weight (used digital scale, what the heck it was right there on the counter). The only difference no Bedazzling, but Fun Colors. I expect these readers to last as long as all my other plastic readers. 6 pair for what I used to pay for 2. You do the math. God Bless!!",

They are very attractive and I like the gold detail on the arm of the glasses. I keep one in my bedside table, one in my office and one in my purse. I would definitely recommend these!",

Usually this occurs after I've had a pair of glasses for a long time, plus the screw is usually intact so that I can tighten it. The screws completely fell out of all 4 pair of glasses.",

My last glasses (a few weeks ago were purchased at CVS for a lot more money) were a 2.50 and they were fine. I don't want to give up on these glasses so I placed another order in 2.75 and hope they will be a better fit.",

This is a pack of low cost readers. The magnification was accurate, the eye glass was clear and the styles were cute. These are cheap glasses. But I put a pair everywhere I could possibly need to read something. As a matter of fact, considering getting another set. If I lose them or break them, no big deal. I previousl y purchased another set for a similar price. They were too cheap looking to be professional. Also ugly. Go ahead and get them.",

They have pretty designs on the sides but that is not what you see when talking to someone. I put the blacked framed ones in the kitchen to use when cooking and in the glove box and use the pretty ones when going to dinner or at work. Not sure when I would use the sunglass pair as I need the light to see the print. Those do not need to be in the pack of six. Overall they are very study glasses and not flimsy along with a great price.",
