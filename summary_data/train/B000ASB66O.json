It stains and drips very easily. Makes it a nightmare to use initially and setup (especially if it gets on carpet or on your clothes). I did not expect this aspect.

      "text": "I've always worked out and had the strongest lower back any trainer ever saw. I weigh 135 lbs and am 5'3' tall, putting in my first home gym at age 64. I assembled the chair in less than one hour from opening box to tightening the bolts. Stable as can be and STURDY as a tank. My 230 lb very tall husband is a surfer not a gym rat but it fits him and now he's hooked. Awesome equipment though it needs to be used carefully and a trainer should show you if you've not used one in the past.",

You might faceplant. Otherwise, does it's job.",

Could not get a refund and was not happy since I am a huge proponent of Amazon and its service. That said, this is cake to assemble. You will not only strengthen your back; you will feel it in your abs, your butt and the back of your legs. I do crunches and the first time I tried this I had to take 5 days off because my abs were SO sore. Takes up little space. Worth it",

A few things i don't like about it is that the two handle bars are really short. My chest is about 30 inches, and when i do dips, my chest barely touches the seat. So if the handles were even half a foot longer, that would of been great. Also, i feel that there could of been a little more padding on the seat, but its nothing too bad. Overall, its acceptable for me. I'm only 110 pounds though. So i basically only do sit ups and back lifts on this thing.",
