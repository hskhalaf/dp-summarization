Almond or Coconut Flour as one of the ingredients when making the recipe. I know nut flours don't have the gluten necessary to rise, but the rolls I made did come out taller when I removed them from the oven. Purchased this on 5/21/18; expires 3/2020. Would buy again.",

Offers a good boost of protein (Scores 1 on the PDCAAS scale) added to any shake without really altering the flavor. It kind of tastes like malt. Mix in a scoop of real cinnamon and some ice cubes and you get a delicious frosty. Part of my daily regimen.",

I don't mind it, just scoop of a bit off the top and it tastes fine. But this latest pouch, despite the same mixing habits, doesn't foam at all. The inconsistency makes me nervous.

All this with none of the chemical/artificial aftertastes that you get with most other \"flavored\" varieties/brands. I'm just now discovering this (after forcing down Optimum's French Vanilla powder for almost a decade now), and I really wish I could go back in time...
