The Bose especially as I couldn\u2019t run more than 20 yards without them falling out and feeling throughout like rhey were going to. The Jaybird Run on the other hand feel secure throughout, sound is great, setup is seamless. Thank goodness I saw a YouTube review comparing all three.... so pleased I got these.",

The only thing (and it's a huge thing) that I hate is the lack of button functionalities!! With the Jabra 65t, I can skip tracks, answer calls, change volume etc.. directly on the buds. With these, I can only program them to EITHER skip track or change volume....",

I guess this is an issue with many in-ear buds, but the Runs are very expensive so I would have expected more.",

My main reason for the rating is inconsistent connection between right and left earbud which keeps dropping out. It's so random. When I'm moving or sitting still, I can have an hour of solid, uninterrupted listening or it's on and off all the time. Very frustrating and will return them. I called Jaybird. They were super nice but reading the reviews it seems they haven't sorted this problem out which is a shame. I might consider a different make and cheaper buds.
