Therefore, here are the ratios you will need if you are using weight: For every 1 oz volume of Part A is equal to 33 grams of weight. For every 1 oz volume of Part B the weight is 27 grams of weight. The benefit of using weight instead of volume is that you may use only one container, rather than 3, which makes the process of mixing go faster.",

The sealing of the containers is awkward and very difficult to manage. One orange top ended up inside of the bottle and blocked the opening anytime I tried to pour. The directions state that you must use two pours while mixing, which I did, but as anyone knows who has worked with resin, each time you pour you lose product. So, by pouring twice, more product is wasted. At this cost, I don't like having to waste any amount. The product has not dried yet although it looks clear.",

I'd estimate that to be maybe 1/4-1/3 a cup of hardener that will go to waste(at your cost). It also increases the chances of measuring errors.

Clear resin is easily tinted and colored for our custom applications. Other pros: Good work / cure times, mixes easily, Has good gravity, and viscosity for forming and molding.

If you have ever used this type of product in the past you know there is no avoiding that. People have complained it's not working. It works BUT you MUST follow directions. If you don't read them ALL you can't possibly follow them. If you read them and follow them exactly it turns out great Update 10-15-2020...still good as day 1",

Which I highly doubt. Ive tried several UV epoxies and do far they just yellow at a different rate. I'll change it to 5 if it doesn't yellow after a month. I'll definitely play with this more and my go to we epoxy fir anything not requiring fiberglass laminating.",
