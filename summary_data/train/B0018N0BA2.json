I've had this board for about 9 months now and have made 3 different signs on it with chalkboard makers. Each time, I've left the sign until I needed to make a new one and each time, the markers erased very well (even white). It still looks like a regular chalkboard bit it's less porous.",

As with all chalkboards, you have to condition it before using. To condition all you do is rub a piece of chalk all over the board and then wipe off with an eraser. It creates a nice chalky layer.... we've never had any problems writing or drawing on our boards with regular old chalk. I even use sidewalk chalk to write on ours. Very pleased with this product!",
