      "text": "You need this serum!!! As an esthetician I am extremely picky about skin care products and with so many subpar products on the market I was a tad dubious as to the efficacy of such a reasonably priced serum. To my surprise, this Vitamin C serum is the bomb! Not sticky, no stinging, hydates without leaving a film. After 3 months of daily use I began to notice lightening of a few darker spots on my face, definite glow to my skin. After a full 6 months I am so happy with the results that I have begun recommending it to my clients. Not only have I reordered the serum , I will be trying more of the products.",

When I first began using this, I could tell an immediate difference in my skin. This product is touted for tightening skin and reducing pores, among other benefits. The only complaint I would have is not having the option to buy it in a larger bottle. Another note regarding customer service. They are GREAT to check in via e-mail and ask if you are satisfied with the product or if you have any issues. We know customer service is at the top of our list when shopping online.",

It gives your skin a littly heat flush, it isn't oily, it has a good amount of hylauronic acid in it and the delivery is just perfect for absorption. I use this daily, every morning under my sunscreen. Its the perfect addition to my routine. I also swear by this after every derma rolling session, it absorbs and shows instant smoothing and retexturizing the next morning. Try it... the price gives you no reason not to at least give it a test.",
