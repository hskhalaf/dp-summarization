NOTE: This works MUCH better than the spray version of the same product. I did not use a foam roller - I used a paint brush for better control, first painting the product on a small area, then using the side of the brush to pat the surface lightly to remove brush marks. I saved a small amount for touch ups. See photos for the end result. It is important to STIR BEFORE LOADING THE BRUSH - EVERY TIME - TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SOLIDS SUSPENDED IN THE PRODUCT ARE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED.",

It dried to the touch in about an hour and solid the next day, with the outside air temp in the high 60's and low humidity. After 24 hours I painted over the bed coating and the color coat seems to adhere well.",

I can say that anyone who claims this is \"tinted clearcoat\" or \" not very black\" is an idiot who did not mix the product, I used an undercoating gun to apply this and it worked beautifully, its still curing as I type this. The graphic down the side was done with the spray can stuff and the lower section is the can via an undercoating gun. both were sanded and primed with the self etching primer",
