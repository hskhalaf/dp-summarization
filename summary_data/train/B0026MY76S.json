      "text": "I upgraded from another Outdoor Research hat (the Sun Bucket) to this one for its wider brim. The Sombriolet has saved my head, face and neck from the sun for many trail miles, including the length of the John Muir Trail. It keeps its shape even when soaked (it is not water resistant, but I wasn't looking for that) and dust and sweat clean off with just fresh water. Seems like it will last for many many years. Great hat!",

With the adjuster cord I could make it tight enough to keep the hat on in the wind. So for those concerned about that, you can feel comfortable about the size factor. This brim is extra wide, which really protects your face, ears, and neck. It is very light weight. It kept it's shape throughout the 2 week trip. You will not be a fashion queen in this hat. At 104, I hardly cared. I would call it functionable. Expensive, but was everything I needed or wanted.",

It was taped up in a re-used bag (which is fine I'm ok with recycling things) but the way they packaged it bent the hat and it has a crease in it now. This was, in effect, like buying this hat used off ebay, but maybe worse depending on how someone packages something/takes care of the product. I'll still use the hat, might return it, but was disappointed in the company that shipped it. So yeah 5 stars for the hat (in good, new condition) 1 star for the shipping.",

I use it when I mow the lawn, but not much good for anything else. My light Tilly hat also flips up, but, at least, it holds it's shape.

Lose that and it becomes a bit \"just another hat.\" There are other hats out there which do recover from crushing (cf.

The venting is very effective and the size of the hat provides a lot of shelter from the sun. It packs well - nice and flat in the suit case. I could even fold it in half to put it in my back pack. My only negative comment - and it is not a big one - is that the front of the brim flops a lot in the wind. The strap helps keep the hat on your head in windy conditions.",

Every summer I buy a new hat to protect my face and neck from the sun, and in the seven years I have delivered mail I have never purchased a better hat than this one. The best thing about this hat is it does not absorb my sweat, and I sweat from my head a lot. I have been forced to buy a new hat every year because I sweat so much. So far it seems I may have found a hat that I will be able to continue using for multiple summers.",

So, I now have to wear a hat while walking in the sun. This hat has been perfect - light weight; SPF of 50+; looks good (I like the light color); wide brim keeps the sun off my ears and face. I don't use the chin strap and it is easy to remove. The only negative I have found is the brim is not at all sturdy and the slightest breeze causes the brim to flip up so at times I look like Gomer Pyle on a walk.",

The underside of the brim is darker in color and makes it easier on the eyes especially if on or around water where the sun is reflecting off that surface. The hat breaths well helping to wick away the sweat and keep it out of my eyes. The wide brim can make it be more affected by the wind but the chin strap helps to keep it in place. I would recommend this hat.",

For that reason, this hat can be worn in many instances, such as gardening, pool party, or shopping. It's nice that it has a cord that can be adjusted around your chin for \"wind-safety\" purposes. For me, the hat itself was a little bit big (I might have needed a S instead of the M size), but it fit's ok, especially with the chin cord adjustment. The fact that it protects from the harmful sun-rays gives me peace of mind, and that counts the most.",

With a UPF 50+ rating, wide brim, and moisture-wicking headband, you will stay comfortable and cool to do what you love in the great outdoors. Never lose your hat thanks to the adjustable drawcord, making this hat perfect for those wild adventures. \n\nAt Outdoor Research, we think that life gets better the minute we step out the door on a new adventure, no matter how big or small. We learn about ourselves, each other and the environment every time we get out. We come home a little wiser and stronger. We see the world more clearly, and that compels us to treat it better. More than anything, we\u2019re convinced that if we inspire more people to get outside, the world will be a better place. \n\nIn 1981, a brilliant scientist and adventurer named Ron Gregg watched his frostbitten partner get airlifted off a glacier on Denali. He'd spent months planning a new route in the purest style, skiing 100 miles from the road to the base of the climb. Barely halfway to the summit, their trip ended with the failure of a simple pair of gaiters. Stubborn to the end, Ron refused a seat on the helicopter and descended alone for two weeks, pondering what had happened. Somewhere along the way, he realized he could both fix the gear problem and devote his life to pursuing his passion for adventure. By the end, he knew one thing for sure: He wasn't going back to his old job.",
