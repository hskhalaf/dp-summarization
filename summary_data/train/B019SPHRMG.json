I was concerned about them being too thick(expected) but there was adequate room for wires to be pushed behind outlet in gangbox. love the green LED indicator showing power. Love the high output USB. My only small issues were due to the poor cardboard packaging of each unit, some were missing extra plates or parts that I fortunately was able to take from the others that were complete. Also, the first time to plug in to the lower 120v AC outlet is very hard. After getting it in the first time all is well. Apparently internal flexing was needed. Good value for the price and recommend.",
