What I do now: Use this product first for about 10 minutes, follow with a regular brush for 5 minutes, then Furminator until I'm satisfied with how much I'm getting off. I used to spend up to 1 hour once a week on my long haired shepherd. Reduced that to about 30 minutes by using the Pet Grooming Gloves first!!! Very satisfied. Make sure you use them until the gloves look like they have miniature dog-hair rugs on them then just peel them off!",

MIght be more effective for a longer hair cat - the wide-spaced nubs might catch longer hair more easily. Switched to a more standard de-shedding brush with metal teeth and noticed the difference immediately - after only a few minutes of use, I'd already collected a huge ball of loose hair from her undercoat!",

And it is pretty easy to pull the fur off the glove when enough has accumulated to peel off in a big piece. My other cat, however, doesn't like being petted or rubbed with it. He meows funny and pulls away if we try to use it on him. I finally just.gave up. So it just depends on your cat if this will be a good product for you.",

Kitty feels like he's being petted and not brushed so he doesn't need to be convinced to let us use the gloves. Makes a huge difference for how much hair we find around the house, on our clothes, in our mouths, in our food... everywhere! For cleaning, if there is a lot of hair in the brushes, it clings to itself and is easy to \"peel\" off. It is hard to get the stray hairs from in between the bristles, but I just use the vacuum to suck them out and that does the trick. Highly recommend this product.",

I have a short haired cat and I\u2019ve taken more hair off of her using this twice than I probably have in months of regular brushing. I thought the shortness of the bumps and big space between them would make it work subpar, but figured that\u2019s why it was so cheap- nope, works perfectly. So glad I didn\u2019t send more money, I have zero complaints. My cat also really likes it a lot- much easier to get all over since she thinks she\u2019s just being pet. It doesn\u2019t trap 100% of the hair, like some still flies away, but I think that\u2019s to be expected.",
