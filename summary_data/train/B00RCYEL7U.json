Great product (when they work), but TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. Just hope you get one that works, and if it is going to break, it needs to be within the Amazon return timeframe. FLIR CUSTOMER SERVICE is TERRIBLE!",

I suspect, much like another reviewer here, that the battery has gone bad. It's a pity the warranty is only for 1 year. For $199 I spent when this first launched, it feels like a waste of money. The picture quality was never very good, it's motion detection was a joke (it would detect light changes as motion so it was basically useless unless).",

I paid extra for a monthly server/recording fees, but when you want to pull the archive recordings every time, it says their system is down. I think the whole thing is a lemon. This product is bad, do not waste your money. Just get cctv, it's reliable and cheaper.",

One thing I am anxiously waiting for is the ability to view the video feeds on the website. I read somewhere that they are working on that. Once that happens, I'll be VERY happy with the camera.",

Take the smartzones for instance, I can choose the exact spots where I want motion to be detected and filmed and using the rapid recap I can easily view the highlights of the day. The cloud storage is another great feature that really saves you some bucks and the night vision is absolutely phenomenal. Terrific piece of equipment with many pluses!",

      "text": "So unbelievably simple Just got this camera. My dog could set it up, it\u2019s that easy. In 5 minutes I had this camera up and running (+20 minutes of charging). The angle of the picture is very wide, so it\u2019s very easy to capture the whole room even if you don\u2019t stick it in the highest corner. My advice would be to put it somewhere where it won\u2019t be moved that often. If you use the rapid recap feature and you move the camera, the room would come out distorted.",

As far as the quality of the image this camera is top notch and the setup was REALLY easy! I LOVE IT!",
