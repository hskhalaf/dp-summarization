It's light weight (even when filled with water) and the vibration is very relaxing. My favorite part is the splash guard because I can paint her nails with ease when her feet are placed on top. I would've loved to have given it 5 starts but the water was definitely not heated, even in slightest amount. I poured in very warm water and it was not able to retain the temperature so there's not even the slightest chance that it could heat cooler water. But, for the price, it's perfect.",

You do have to really search for the fill line, but that is such a minor issue I can't fault it. Bottom line this is a cheaper footbath that gives you exactly what you paid for.",

The first one i had i had to return because the waterfall was faulty. The new one shipped pretty quickly. We plugged it in and it started blinking and shocked me! We requested a refund but it said the refund was $0 since it based it off the 2nd received one. Definitely not happy with this product. Do not waste your money. I would give zero stars if I could.",

Didn't care for the LED (initially I thought it was cool feature to have but once I used it, seemed redundant). I liked that the water was warm and didn't get cold. Didn't really like that the attachments including the rollers are manual. Felt like extra effort and between that and the noise, didn't exactly get the spa feeling.",

    "description": "Style:Blue| Color:Waterfall / Lights / BubblesPamper your feet with a rejuvenating massage and spa experience at home! The Conair Active Life Waterfall Foot Spa comforts your feet in warm relaxation. Specially designed for active lifestyles, the flowing waterfall gently massages the top of the feet while the massaging foot rollers soothe the soles. Exfoliating loofah disks help soften skin and provide a rejuvenating massage, while LED lights showcase massage bubble action with heat to ensure water stays warm. With this foot bath tub, it\u2019s easy to take good care of one of the hardest working parts of your body! Most of us are on our feet a lot! That\u2019s a lot of stress and strain on a daily basis. Compound that with activity and how much love do you give your feet? With each foot\u2019s 26 bones, 20-plus muscles and over 100 ligaments, it\u2019s no wonder that happy feet can affect your overall well-being. The toe-touch push buttons on this pedicure foot spa make it easy to control bubbles, waterfall feature and temperature for a customized experience every time. This foot massager includes 3 attachments: a pumice stone to gently exfoliate skin for smooth feet, a scrub brush to gently clean feet and a soft-touch massager to relax achy, sore feet. Whether you want to soak in cool, warm or hot water, this spa is especially designed to maintain the temperature you choose. Water jets propel water over and around your foot, providing a massaging effect that helps your muscles relax. The massaging foot spa also has a \u201cwaterfall\u201d feature which gently pours water over the top of your feet for utter relaxation. With the Conair Active Life Waterfall Foot Spa with Lights and Bubbles, your feet will always be pampered and revitalized. This footbath will not keep the water warm; you must put warm water into the footbath and expect it to cool off after around 10 minutes. We do not say anywhere on the detail page that it will hear and/or keep water warm. Keep the water at 100 to 118 degrees fahrenheit to avoid burning your skin.",
