I\u2019m questioning how long these are going to last since they are already 10 years old.",

You have to connect the speakers to an amplifier via speaker wire and plug in the amp to an electrical outlet. The recommended amp is for indoor use only so I had to drill a hole in my house to run the 2 wires from indoors where I plugged in the amp to the 2 speakers outdoors. Once installed, playing the speakers via a Bluetooth connection is a breeze. A tip is to be sure you have good wireless connection near the speakers too.",

I already had wiring in place which made installation easier. You need to drill holes in the wall for the plastic screw anchors, then hang the mounts with the screws, hang the speakers and crank it up! The sound is as good as you are going to get in an outdoor setting. The bass is very good and you can dial the volume up to call the police levels. Highly recommended.",
