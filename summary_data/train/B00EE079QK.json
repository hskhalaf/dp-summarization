      "text": "These are classic, real leather durable and comfortable sandals. My son had s pair last summer that lasted throughout the year and he liked to wear them, saying that they were comfortable. We've bought another pair for this year. They're also pretty versatile in that they go with a lot of different outfits, both casual and dressier. They do run large--at least one size so try to account for that when you order. Otherwise, these are great real leather sandals that are worth the price since they're more comfortable and will last longer than cheap, synthetic versions.",

He is wearing about an 11.5, or even 12 in tennis shoes, but these always tend to run large in length, and the 11.5 was too long, so we ordered an 11 W (wide width). When they came, they were so narrow I could barely squeeze them on him. We are sending them back and trying an XW. These sandals look great, but just be warned that they run long and narrow, even in the wide width.",

The back strap has a cushion in it so there is no irritation. He wears them all day with no complaints. They go with just about everything and are durable for playtime.",
