Since I was taking my time, having to open mail and destroying old documents, I was able to shred for longer periods than the 4 minutes because it didn't have time to get hot. Also, I wasn't doing 6 sheets, but more so randomly. To alleviate mail back-up, I've sat it under a chair table where I put my mail by the front door. Now, I open mail, shred what I don't need and walk away. I just wish it came in colors...a nice blue would blend in so good.",

My former shredder finally quit because the cutter blades in the center, where envelopes go through, became bent. I probably fed it some envelopes that had more than 6 pages. The cutting wheels on this model are way beefier than my previous one. I think the motor would stall long before these cutting wheels could be damaged. I also like the big window that shows how much paper is in the bin.",

I ad some 3 in 1 oil after a ream of paper. ...or..... take the oil to 2 pages of paper. Oil should be added to the edges Of the oiled pager. Last shredder lasted 6 years.

We affectionately call it \u201cminime\u201d. The instructions say don\u2019t use for more than 4 minutes every 40 minutes so we use it during tv commercials . It does do plastic slowly. Yes I would buy it again .",
