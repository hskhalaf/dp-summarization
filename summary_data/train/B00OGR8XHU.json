I was initially worried that it was not a true, powerful retinol, but the results (better skin texture, and much more even skin tone) are undeniable. This is a true, powerful retinol and yet, gentle and relatively easy to adjust to. The product is properly packaged to preserve the ingredient's potency and purity. The product showed up promptly with packaging and product pristine. Couldn't be happier :D",
