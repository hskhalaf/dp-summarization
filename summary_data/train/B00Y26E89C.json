I've tried several varieties of pre shave oil (cost, curiosity,etc) but always end up a little bummed that the texture and fragrance is not like Shaveology. Give this Shaveology pre shave oil a try. If you have to shave almost everyday like I do, it's must for super smooth skin and reduced burn.",

I now have no razor rash or burn. One day i forgot to use this and I had horrible burn again. Took me a few minutes but I then realized I didn't use the oil. For anyone starting out shaving with a DE razor I highly recommend this product.",
