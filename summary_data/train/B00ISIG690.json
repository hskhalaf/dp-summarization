As you may or may not be able to see, I purchased this product in my sophomore year of high school (about 3 years ago?). I have finally taken the time, after they broke a few weeks ago, to write my grateful review. These headphones have stuck by my side for coming close to four years. There's not much I can say, other than the fact that these headphones all of the close to 4 years either in my pockets, jostled by my keys, or drenched in sweat during a run, or just swung around aimlessly.

I'm not sure if Bose as a company just made lower quality headphones or if Amazon is selling 2nd tier products. At this point, I ended up putting these away, seeing as how my standard apple headphones beat the Soundtrue headphones in terms of quality. Absolutely not worth the $80.",

Cons: - Have to CRANK the volume to block out surrounding sound in noisy environments. - Tangle up more than i expected for what seems like a robust cordset.",

Don't expect these to drown out a lot of ambient noise. The up side is you are still aware of your surroundings. I do believe the sound gets better as you break these in more. It's not phenomenal sound, but it's excellent for the price. I wear these everywhere, including the gym. I'm careful with the cord, but I see how it would wear quickly with careless use.",

If you're using them as much as I do, after a year the cord becomes weak and you lose sound in one ear or even both. These will probably last longer for other people as mine truly get above average use. The microphone also works pretty darn well.

I was worried about those hooks that go around you ear, but I hardly notice them. I purchased these solely for the gym. They fit nice, stay in the ear, and sound decent. The zipper case is a nice feature, as it keeps the headphone safe in my gym bag. Overall I am happy with these, and I really wish amazon would start doing .5 stars. Because that's exactly where these would fall; 4.5 stars.",

I have always used Bose headphones in the past but received a beats headphones from my husband so I used them. I hated the beats headphones because the music quality was poor. After the beats headphones stopped working, I went back to Bose. You can hear the difference! The base is more prominent and the voice is crisper. Not to mention, the Bose in ear actually stays in your ear. I use it to go to the gym and run on the treadmill and it never comes off. I highly recommend this product. I am truly satisfied in every way.",

What makes these great is their comfort. Once you put them in your ears, you kind of forget about them as you go about your business. But the best feature is that, after wearing them for a few hours, your ears don't feel like someone has bopped you and given you cauliflower ears. No soreness! Don't know about you, but I hate that feeling. Doesn't matter if I'm working or doing various activities. When I plug these headphones into my smartphone and listen to my playlist on Amazon Prime Music...it's Heaven on earth!",

Ended up using the small fitting (left) large fitting (right) and the buds work without too much slippage... although require regular adjustment through your workouts.

      "text": "This is my third pair of Bose earbuds. My first two went dead on the right side. I sleep with them in and that's probably why the right side goes bad. I really do like the Bose earbuds for the comfort and ability to lay on them on a pillow without discomfort. I have tried several others but always come back to the Bose for the ear comfort. I can't stand noise canceling earbuds or any earbuds that go into the ear canals. So even though I don't have the best of luck with these lasting long, they are still my go to earbuds.",
