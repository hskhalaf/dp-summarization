      "verdict": "Swift 1.5 sneakers contain a classic silhouette that gives the nod to the past models of the eS brand. However, the similarity does not stop with the design. The familiar comfort, heel support, and board feel of eS skate shoes are still there along with their much-admired sturdiness.While these kicks don't come comfortable right out of the box, they feel downright amazing once broken in. The shoes also feature handy inner lace loops that have saved many a lace from getting torn right away.",
      "pros": [
        "According to many eS Swift 1.5 reviews, the comfort in these kicks is exemplary",
        "They've got enough padding to absorb landing primo, plenty of users have noted",
        "Several testers love the \"superb balance between support and board feel\" of these shoes, and they highly recommend them for skating in",
        "These low-top sneakers are durable and last a long time without tearing, state purchasers who skate daily",
        "The board control is impressive, say a good number of eS Swift 1.5 users who wear tested these kicks",
        "The style of eS Swift 1.5 shoes is \"straight fire,\" a lot of people have remarked",
        "A handful of customers have noted that the fit of eS Swift 1.5 shoes is on point, and the sizing is accurate",
        "Some consumers have reported that these skate shoes are lightweight and flexible",

Didn\u2019t send back because he loves the way they look, just can\u2019t wear them for extended periods of time. Got a pair of puma shoes instead with a memory foam footbed that he loves, also 9.5. Just order a half size up and you should be fine.",
