      "text": "Within two months of purchasing the camera, I received an error message on the LCD screen that said ERROR OCCURRED. PLEASE TURN UNIT OFF, THEN TURN ON AGAIN. However, all camera buttons were frozen so I couldn't do anything. I had to remove the battery to turn the camera off but even then, when I turned it back on--same error message. So after dealing with awful customer service, I have to mail the camera to Panasonic's service center and wait to see whether they are going to send me a refund, refurbished camera, or whatever else. Hey Panasonic--it's 2017, you products should do what they say for more than two months.",

We installed it and instantly recognized that the picture quality out was much worse than the 1080p Panasonic camera it was replacing. The color quality, details, and dynamic range were either the same or not nearly as good. We had the camera hooked up via HDMI to a 4K Samsung TV. The build quality felt cheap, the camera felt cheap and was super light..but not in a good way. We returned it, super disappointing because we love our other Panasonic cameras and wanted to move to 4K.",

The only criticism I have is that the extra little camera, which seemed like such a fantastic idea (and was a major selling point for me), is probably something I'll never use. I'm really disappointed in it. The video feed from it isn't saved as a separate file, so if you turn it on, it's forever a part of the video you shoot. Additionally, you don't have as much control over it as I'd like.",

The Cameras comes with plenty of accessories. It would be nice if it would come with a better battery. The side pnp camera is a gimmick that I doubt I'll have any use for. The menu is a bit complicated to work your way through if you are out on a shoot. But the low light image is clean and the camera is certainly a good purchase for whatever todays market price is. I do like the camera, But I reach for the Sony first.",
