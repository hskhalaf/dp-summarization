Great height for lap desk (should accommodate average sized person or those with extra pounds) or for placing on a desk to stand and work (burn more calories and save on cost of sit/stand desk!). Divider to create 3 adjustable tilted heights is a definite plus. Fold legs and go, so quite portable from table, to couch, to bed. No assembly, out of the box and ready to use. Exactly what I needed when working from home (COVID-19 YIKES!)",

I will say, the biggest flaw is that the legs that pull out do not stay in place in their own- they sort of curl in if you move around too much. The only way to remedy this would be to replace it with new screws (due to the type of screws it cane with you can\u2019t simply just tighten them up). Aside from that I love it.",

As I use my mouse, my wrist rest in the edge of the tray, and as I move my mouse the paint rubs off all over my wrist. #3: Wishing there was some kind of non-slip padding on the actual laptop tray.",
