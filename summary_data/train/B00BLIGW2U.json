It feels rugged enough, I blew it up in 8 strong breaths, and rolled it up easily on the first try putting it back in the carrying sack. On another note, my 5'5 160lbs girlfriend (see pics) fit better yet her hips touched through it while mine did not and we're both side sleepers. I'm guessing all my extra weight pushed the air from my upper half to my hips and provided more cushion. Works for me! I'm choosing it for a 2 week hike after painfully sleeping on the ground.",

I got them for backpacking. I haven't put too much use into the two I bought yet, but they seem fairly durable. The only thing I question is the nozzle. It works really well for blowing it up and getting the air out- no problem there- but I do wonder if the pad will rip near the nozzle first, since it sticks out quite a bit. If it does, patching it will be hard. This is about the only advantage that the foam types have over the air-filled ones.",
