My kids had the two small bags and my husband and I shared the big one. Very roomy and spacious I must say! They did have little scuff marks here and there on the front and side from being handled by the baggage handlers, but it can easily be rubbed off. I HIGHLY recommended this luggage set. I love it!",

The durability while traveling I can\u2019t comment on until I use them. So far it seems okay. I will be writing another review after I get back from my trip.",
