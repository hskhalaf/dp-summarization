I just completed my first treatment and will wait and see if the skin tag falls off.

However the directions aren't very clear as for how often to use it and how. I do not reccomend however unless you are desperste. This hurts. Even using the skin protectors they provide your skin will be sensitive and the skin tag itself will hurt. Be prepared to civer them with bandaids due to rubbing against them and them bleeding.",
