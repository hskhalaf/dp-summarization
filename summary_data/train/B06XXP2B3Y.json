When I opened the bag and found a slip that said \u201cif you write a good review, the next bag is on us\u201d I knew that it might not be all that it was cracked up to be. The first few days were fine and I didn\u2019t feel any side effects. However, towards the end of the detox my stomach feels more bloated than when I started, and I am constipated. I do not recommend this product to anyone. Do not fall for the good reviews, it is simply just people trying to get free product out of a company.",

I ordered a tea and didn't realize it had stevia in it and I threw it out right away. Teas shouldn't have sweeteners unless you add them! As far as the detoxing and metabolism thing.. I honestly didn't drink the tea as intended for the 14 solid days so I'm not sure if results were to happen. I'm getting another bag and will hopefully do better. I'll come back and update my review if I do. Anyway, if you are looking for a tasty detox tea, this is it.",
