I used this shoes just to walk my dog less than ten times as I wear work boots and cycling shoes daily. I bought those shoes to have a good pair for a travel in few days and now have nothing. There is already a massive hole on the heel and now rubs on plastic and hurt feet. This happen to my converse, emerica and older etnies after wearing them for way over 3 years... not even a moth in.. this is just ridiculous.. I have a cheap pair of supermarket shoes that last longer.",

Kwool and just waaaaay cooler than my Vans imo (yes Vans are amazing) - So overdone right now and everybody seems to rock em - Don't know about you, but that's a really big turn off for me. (I'm old and remember the BMX 80's daze - they were exotic then.) Anyway rant over, these now win on style points imo. Not sure how they are for skating, I still have a couple of decks - but it's been 3 years at least since I've been out. They're probably great though. Thanks peeps \",..^",

They seemed fine but once he started to walk in them thick plastic in the heel started to cut through and he had to cut it out. The back is now unsupported and so the heel collapses. Strange design fault so would not recommend.",

The reason for the -1 is that I found the material, much like any shoes, has to wear in before its completely comfortable. where the toe bends it can cause discomfort.

Luckily for me, I don't do either any more so they look good and will last me a long time. They look just like the Pictures.",
