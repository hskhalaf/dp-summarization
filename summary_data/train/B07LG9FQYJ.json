I don't run super technical trails at high speeds so Idk what that would be like in these shoes but I do run on some questionable, hard to see trails covered in roots and rocks with lots of hilly terrain in an effort to avoid people. And I'll run in any weather so there's been a fair amount of mud and sludge I've put them through. I've only done ~50k in them so far and they've been great!",

When I did a work out in them, my feet swelled, as all feet do and they became so tight. The materiel doesn't stretch well. I kept the shoes on even so, walking around the house, and my feet are still hurting, the tightness (and pain) hasn't gone away. I'm going to try a size 8 because I want to give them a real chance.",

      "text": "When Nike first came out with the Wildhorse model, I loved it! nice wide platform and toebox. I tend to roll my ankle when running on uneven ground, so I loved these. My toes where not crunched but the shoe didn't flop around. I was disappointed in the wildhorse 4 because the design made it tight around the top of the foot. So I was excited to see they designed the 5 differently. But the toebox on the 5 is narrow and tight and the quality is poor. I had them for a week when the bottom sole started to separate from the shoe. Sorry Nike. I can't say I will stick around for the Wildhorse 6.",

I was going to buy an all black Nike trail runner but loved the rich color of the Air Zoom Wildhorse 5 in geode teal with bright accents and so glad I did. It\u2019s a sharp looking shoe. I will say that even though I wear a true 6.5, I sized up to a 7 based on suggestions of other review and glad I did. The 7 fits like it was made for my foot. I love the shape of the sole - not too bulky but a nice grip for various surfaces. Super light weight. I could wear these Nike\u2019s every day!",
