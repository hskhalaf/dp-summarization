The back tapers to a 2\" and part of the back is the velcro only because the collar is too short--labeled a small. I am an orthopedic nurse, and if one needs a cervical collor, it must have support in the front and back of the neck. There is really nothing in the back to support the neck; however, I specifically need help with extension, so I turned the brace backwsrd, where the 3\" width was in the back. Essentially this is a bad brace.",
