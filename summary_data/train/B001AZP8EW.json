The hardwired connections work flawlessly, but anything connected via the radio will have to deal with constantly dropped connections.

I'm experiencing simultaneous dropping of the wifi to two Kindle Fires, a Fire TV Stick, two Acer laptops, a Dell laptop and three Android phones. None of them are immune and they all lose their connections at the same time while the cable connected PCs keep humming along. It's too bad, too, because it has twice the range of the Linksys router it replaced. This one is going back, I'm afraid.",

All maintenance software says that the computers are functioning properly. I ran satellite tests and they all were within stated parameters. Objectively, all I can say is that--it works. Both computers can access data. So the router upgrade didn't hinder system functioning but I can't honestly say that it helped either.",

While looking for a replacement, found the Netgear product comparison chart in attached screenshot, and went with the lowest-end unit supporting gigabit internet (since the wireless connection speed/other bells and whistles are irrelevant to me). The \"N300\" link led to this product page. On arrival, discovered the router did NOT in fact support gigabit internet (see picture of specifications on box) - negating the entire reason I purchased it. One star because product does not perform as advertised.",
