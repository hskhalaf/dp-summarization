I will not hesitate to use this product in any of my favorite baking recipes. I only wish this was around when my mom, who suffered from Diabetes, was still alive so she could continue to enjoy all her favorite baked goods without worrying about her blood sugar. I highly recommend MONKFRUIT. It is worth every penny. My only hesitation in sharing this review is that more people will try it, buy it and then my ability to get it so quickly will be effected. So buy it, but save some for me.",

I will never need to eat toxic sugar again. Welcome home Lakanton Sweeteners!!! I have 2 more in my cart ready to come home now. Oh wait did I mention cinnamon and Lakanto on my egg loaf is even better than french toast with cinnamon and sugar? My fiance couldnt tell there was no sugar in the cheesecakes. WINNER",

This sweetener is by far the closest substitute to sugar that's on the market, plus it's all natural and not a sugar alcohol. It's also great that you can use it as a direct replacement for sugar in any recipe! I can't say enough positive things about this product. I will continue to purchase this from here on out and will be recommending to this to my clients.",

I am trying to be very careful to not keep a lot of sweets around since we eliminated sugar, but sometimes there are things you have baked in the past that you still want to make again - these sugars allow you to do that without sacrificing flavor. This granulated sugar also bakes up much better than artificial sweeteners. I think the baked goods may be a bit heavier than regular sugar, but the taste is great.",

I swear my coffee tastes better with this sweetener than when compared to that made with Stevia and Splendia; maybe it is the lack of an aftertaste, but I can taste the aroma of the coffee.
