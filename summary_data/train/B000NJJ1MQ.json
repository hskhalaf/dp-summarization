      "text": "Worked great for a couple months, but then the turning mechanism stopped working. When you put in the code, you can hear it click, but the the thing you turn to actually move the deadbolt just spins and spins without unlocking the deadbolt. Same problem when trying to lock it - you push the lock button and the turning thing just spins without moving the deadbolt. You can still lock/unlock it from the inside, but that's not the point of having a keypad lock!",

      "text": "One thing you need to know about this keypad deadbolt is that it needs to be manually engaged from inside and outside. It does not locked itself when you close the door. It is not an issue for private use. However, if you rented your room/house out on airbnb, people often leave the door unlocked because they are not familiar with this keypad. I used this keypad for a little over a year and the battery is still going strong. It is very easy to install (very clear installation instruction) and easy to use (setting new code, deleting old code, etc). It is also very secure.",

Common sense made me aware of this but for others, not so much. It doesn't make the lock not work, at least so far.

Just a tip -- when it is installed, the part that spins around, under the key pad is SUPPOSED to spin!!! I thought it was broken since it didn't sit stationary. Once you punch the secret code on the key pad, it trips the lock to open and close it properly. Fairly easy to install. We did have to get a door know hole drill bit, so it took extra time. Plus it was a metal door, so drilling wasn't too fun! Great product.",

After about 10 years, the old lock stopped disengaging and defaulted to a fail safe position (ie, deadbolt always engaged). Rather than try to fix a worn part, I ordered a new one, which arrived in one day and as expected. Installation was simple because the necessary holes were already drilled for the old lock. The new lock included basic programming instructions and not full printed version of programming options, but I had the booklet from my old lock. The Schlage BE365CAM619 is a good, reliable option for an electronic coded lock that does not require or use an internet-connected, \"home-linked\" system.",

Although, on the cheaper model, it doesn't allow programming from the locked position, so I guess either way is relatively safe. Love that you can delete the codes and enter up to 19!

This model unlocks much faster instead of having to wait for the motor to unlock for you (great if you're running late, and have to get back inside because you left something). The only difference is size since the touchscreen model takes up significantly more space, and that model can connect to wifi/program to unlock/lock the door (which you have to pay a monthly fee).",
