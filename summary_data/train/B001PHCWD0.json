He lost his eyes in the attack (poor guy), but he's now a spoiled lizard living a life of luxury (and safety). This cage is wonderful because with the addition of plants and driftwood, it's like his own personal lanai where he can relax without a care and still be outside.",

The construction is not as rigid as I would have liked and I would like it if Zoo Med offered replacement parts for some of the key elements. I have 3 cages, extra large, large, and small and I bought an extra cage to cannibalize for spare parts. A major flaw is the lack of any hooks or braces from which to hang vegetation, drippers, and other accessories. You get a bare bones screened cage and have to use your ingenuity to finish it and make it functiona.l",
