      "text": "After owning a keurig machine and being disappointed with the coffee as compared to using fresh ground coffee I was reluctant to get a Nespresso machine. After my wife ordered this my mind has been changed. The coffee comes out hot and after trying many types, most are very tasty. The milk frother works perfectly. Adding warm frothed milk helps keep the coffee hot. The frother also has a cold setting if that is what you prefer. The machine feels sturdy and not likely to break with long term use. I would highly recommend this machine to anyone who appreciates good tasting coffee.",

Coffee pot easy to use even for my week hands. Some say coffee is not hot enough. I say it\u2019s perfect to drink without burning your mouth. I think when coffee get to hot it becomes bitter. Just my opinion. Would recommend",

LOVE the coffee it brews. It\u2019s creamy and has an amazing taste. Easy to clean and lots of options to make any barista drink with the milk frother. I can make perfect cappuccino, Carmel lattes or my favorite iced coffee. I have people drop by just to have one of my coffees because it\u2019s so great.",

In my kitchen the reservoir is hard to see, and more than once I've run a capsule through only to find 1/2 of my usual shot or nothing at all in my cup. Easy to waste a capsule that way, and I wonder if it's good for the machine.",

    "title": "Nespresso Vertuo Coffee and Espresso Machine Bundle with Aeroccino Milk Frother by De'Longhi, Red",
    "description": "Style:Machine + Aeroccino| Color:RedNespresso is constantly evolving the way you drink espresso and coffee. Offering freshly brewed coffee with crema as well as delicious, authentic Espresso, the Vertuo Evoluo machine conveniently makes two cup sizes, 7.7 fl. oz. Coffee and 1.35 fl. oz. Espresso, at the touch of a button. It uses two different capsule sizes: large capsule for Coffee and a small one for Espresso. Vertuo Evoluo coffee makers deliver a perfect cup of coffee time after time, thanks to Centrifusion, a patented extraction technology developed by Nespresso. Vertuo Evoluo uses an intelligent extraction system that recognizes each Grand Cru blend. Thanks to a barcode on the rim of the capsule, the brewing parameters are adjusted by the machine, with no need to change settings. This delivers the best in-cup result for your chosen variety - at the touch of a single button. The capsule is automatically ejected after brewing, with only 15-20 seconds of pre-heating time, while the automatic energy-saving function switches the machine off after 9 minutes of inactivity, consuming less energy. Each machine includes a welcome set with 12 VertuoLine capsules, each with varying intensities and taste profiles. The bundle includes the Aeroccino 3. It provides a smooth, finely textured hot or cold fresh milk froth for your coffee recipes via an ultra simple and fast automatic system, in a few seconds, without noise or vibration. The Aeroccino also heats milk for your Caff\u00e8 Latte or Cappuccino.",
