It\u2019s effective at keeping little ones from falling out of bed, but doesn\u2019t require special bedding and doesn\u2019t look bad once the bed is made. I also anticipate this being useful for travel. It will not only keep the small ones off the hotel floor, but will be a perfect divider when kids need to share a bed.",

Would definitely by these again. When i fall asleep in his bed accidientally, they are very comforting to lay against. Breathable, cool, soft, gives me peace of mind and my son too!",

Fit snugly under the sheets and stays put. Fits under a normal sheet without a problem. Loved that it had a waterproof (yet not crinkly) cover. We are still new to the product but so far so good!

These are just enough to be a gentle reminder through the night that she's reached the limit of the bed, but not so constraining that she can't get out over them once she's awake. We use them under the fitted sheet, so they stay where they're put without any problems.",
