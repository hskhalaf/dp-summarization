It took me around 10 puffs. 3)Very soft to the touch. This is one benefit which lot of people seem to overlook. 4)Winglock valve is very easy to use and holds the pad's air well.

I have used it on some nights around 40-degrees & stayed pretty warm using what I would consider a barely adequate sleeping bag for those temps (I think I wore long base layers, wool socks, a hat, & a sweater w/maybe some thin gloves?). It's surprisingly comfortable considering how thin it is when blown up. It slips on my tent floor a bit but that doesn't bug me too much, just pitch your tent on flat ground or add something grippy to your tent floor. I'm looking forward to more good times being had with this piece of gear.",
