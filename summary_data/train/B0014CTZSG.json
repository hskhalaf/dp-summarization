Earth Mama Angel Baby makes good stuff you can replace this with. It's basically just castile soap. I now use Dr. Bronner's pure castile soap (the baby-mild kind). It's cheap, pure, and one bottle lasts FOREVER. Even though my baby's skin isn't sensitive, I can't knowingly go on using California Baby, due to their allegedly dishonest practices and un-pure ingredients. Castile soap might not work for all super-sensitive skins, but it's worth looking into. Another option is to make your own soaps, which is surprisingly easy and super cheap. Good luck guys!",
