Word of advice buy your exact size because if you buy to big the sole doesn't fit you foot very well and can be very uncomfortable. I did this when I bought a size 10 instead of a Size 9/9.5 and wore them around London to find by the end of the day my feet were aching but in the 9s I have now. Perfect fit and are very comfortable. Size Matters!",
