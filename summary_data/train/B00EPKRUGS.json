My only complaints are that one of the base studs was bruised/scratched from the shipping(It's not noticeable anyway because of their black color), and that you will need a thin screwdriver to screw the bases together as you have to screw them on through these small holes that connect over the base of the stand. Also be advised that it is somewhat wide. If you have narrow shoulders and a thin build you might want to buy a narrower stand (This is not adjustable).",

It is cheaper than other options, but it may be more worthwhile to spend more for a more consistent/sturdy product if you really need something sturdy and issue free. As a note, I had one piece that wouldn't fit in and I had to contact them for a replacement piece. Fortunately, they responded and acted quickly, but the replacement piece still suffered from some issues but allowed for the product to be usable.",

It's not a perfect fix, but it does the job with a little force and patience. You may want to try a little grease over the connections once the tape is applied and turn the unit so the male side inserts downward into the connection using gravity and body weight for leverage.",

This dip station is also very sleek and definitely not an eye sore. This station comes with a no nonsense one page of instructions that are decidedly easy to follow (there isn't much to put together). The only thing that could have possibly made this product better, is if there were marked spots for where exactly the pads were to be installed, but that is honestly a very small gripe.",

Putting it together took some minor twisting of the uprights to get the lag screws through, and a hammer wrapped in a rag to get the holes lined up vertically, but that was a minor inconvenience. Now that it's together I've used it for dips, some suspended abdominal exercises and inverted pushups. It's well worth what I paid for it and highly recommended.",

Before I was doing dips on an old Soloflex that came with an attachment for dips and stability wasn't so great. That and my hands would hurt because there was no padding on the Soloflex attachment. It doesn't take up too much space which made my wife happy as well.",
