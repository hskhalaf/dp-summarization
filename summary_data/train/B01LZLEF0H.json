It's a shame, too, because otherwise these are excellent collars. The lettering is nice and the colors haven't faded -- we'll see how they hold up through a summer of swimming in a few months. We used to have nylon collars with info stitched in, but they held odors and had to be washed more often than the dogs. This is not an issue with leather.",

But I was able to fit both dogs names plus my phone number on these collars and they still look good. Seller even reached out to me to make sure I received them and if I had any questions.
