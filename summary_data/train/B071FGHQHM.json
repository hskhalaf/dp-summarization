Its often hit-and-miss. I'm very happy with the fit and comfort level of these goggles. They don't fog up or leak water for my boy. No longer fussing every two minutes, complaining, etc. He can concentrate 100% of his focus just on swim stroke! I knew that the bungee cord strap would add to the lack of fidgeting, and I wasn't disappointed. Its much better that standard silicone straps with adjusters that extremely frustrating. I'd buy these goggles again 100 times over.",

The attachments themselves are next to impossible to remove to change out. And even then, none prevented leaking. I would not recommend these at all.
