My friend also uses my scale and his body fat currently measures around 25%. His measurement has been steadily falling over the past few months as he's been losing weight, so at least that part seems right. Seriously, though, 3% for me? Wouldn't I be dead?",

      "text": "The scale is very sleek and good looking. Weight, body fat percentage, water, etc. are all on point, the app is very user friendly, and the scale was very easy to set up. The heart rate is so off the charts random that I either have a defective unit or need to see a cardiologist. The iPhone app actually keeps telling me to see a doctor. Well, I am a doctor and my resting pulse rate isn't 110 or 120. I think it even said 130 something once. No. It's like 75. That being said, it reads a normal HR sometimes, but rarely. DO NOT BUY THIS SCALE EXPECTING TO GET ACCURACY ON YOUR HEART RATE.",
