I'm sure this type of sled works in some areas that are frozen solid on .5 of a year round basis. I grew up in Missouri, where we had snow at the most a week at a time and it definitely wouldn't have worked there, so it most certainly won't work here in Texas. Flat bottomed smooth sleds are best with quick snow in warmer climates. It makes a lovely photo prop though!",
