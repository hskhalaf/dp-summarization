I really liked how the author gives great meal plans for any meal of the day. Highly recommended.",

      "text": "I was horrified by this book, which pretends to promulgate DASH information and science. As we all know, DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, and the food plan was developed using proper studies toward that aim. This book not only muddies the science with disproven myths and old wives tales (64 oz water/day for everyone? Dietary cholesterol/eggs are problematic?) it also has almost zero focus on reducing hypertension in favor of yet another screed on weight loss and how being thin is the ultimate measure of health. Not just a waste of money, this book is outright dangerous, IMO. Stay away if you are looking to *actually* participate in a DASH lifestyle.",

The written part of the book was useless but it would have been very worthwhile if I could have used some of the recipes. None of them looked very tasty, the mixture of ingredients didn't look right, I don't think they had been tested prior to throwing together into the book. I didn't waste a lot of money on the book; but I did waste a lot of money on the recipe ingredients that I had to throw out.",
