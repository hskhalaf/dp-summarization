Simply put, the sound is incredible. If you care that much, then this is not just worth the money, it is a steal.",

I bought this amp thinking that i could eliminate my chromcast dongle and use it on another tv, but sadly i could not. As i read through the product description, i does state that the chromecast feature is for audio, so i cannot blame Sony for misleading, but if anyone has used a chromecast before, you would assume it would cast both audio and video. Other than that, the amp works as described",

      "title": "Sony Comes through with a Great Receiver",
      "text": "I spent over a month analyzing performance data and customer feedback on stereo receivers before I chose the Sony STRDN1060. Nothing came close to its performance for the money. Setup was super easy. I especially liked the speaker balancing function using the included balance microphone. My speakers are better balanced now than they have every been. The Amazon price was also very good. The price-matcher app from the credit card company could not find a better price. I am very satisfied with my purchase.",

If you knew nothing about hooking up a stereo you'd be up the creek. No good user manual is available so I don't really know what's happening with some of their \"trick\" sound effects like A.F.D, or multi-stereo, etc. The included microphone aided speaker balancing during initial setup, but most things are learn as you go, or as you stumble upon something. I guess I just assumed that they would want to include a comprehensive user manual so the end user could get full benefit from this unit. Extremely disappointed in that aspect.",
