So I was nervous at first to take these considering I have taken so called natural ones before and felt like I was gonna just die, having to take three pills three times a day to have a hurt stomach but these are so smooth going in and comming out. It doesn't make your stomach bunch up just to know it's working I do recommend this to anyone who is looking for a gentle colon cleanse.",

The other brand I have used; I usually take 5 for 3-7 days to cleanse and it works fantastic from day 1, I decrease the dose for the last 3 days cleansing for a total of 10 days. This brand does not start working from day 1, I take the same amount as scheduled but the results are not really good if you are doing a complete colon cleanse. Will not buy this brand again.",
