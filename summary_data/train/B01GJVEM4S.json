It requires exact placement of two screws, and then blindly attaching to the screw holes at the back.

      "text": "Update: The vendor, Hykolity, contacted me shortly after my original review was posted, and set an additional light to correct for the original unit. They were fantastic, and the light itself is great. I ordered an additional two, and none had the repeated issue with the socket. Five star service from the vendor! Original review: The female socket for daisy chaining was ground off on a corner, leaving the electrical contact exposed, and the socket itself was mangled into position on the single unit I ordered. The lights are bright, and I didn't plan on putting any more in series so not bothering to return",
