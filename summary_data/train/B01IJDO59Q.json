We saw these on Amazon and thought they looked great and the price is unbeatable! I didn't get too excited about them because I thought there must be something about them that made them such a great price (i.e. cheaply made or poor quality), but once we put them together we were pleasantly surprised!!! We absolutely LOVE them! They are super sturdy, the top leather seat is soft and durable, the white legs are solid and just everything about them is perfect. We would buy them again in a heartbeat. Definitely recommend these barstools. :)",

It took less than a week to get to me and I assembled them myself in about 30 minutes. They include an Allen Wrench for the leg screws but you will need your own Phillips Head screwdriver for the screws on the footrests. The legs are level and the grey faux leather came without any blemishes or rips. I\u2019m definitely going to order a couple more for the kitchen side of my breakfast counter.",

The manufacturer even had the fore-sight to install plastic feet on the bottom of the legs to prevent scratches and keep the surface even. We bought two sets of 2, and all four of the stools were identical in build quality and sturdiness. Not a single one wobbled or creaked once assembled, and did I mention they are beautiful? We priced similar stools out at a local home goods store, and they were easily $30 dollars more, each! Be sure to measure and get the proper height to match your counters.",

You don't need directions to put these together. All you need to do is pig one leg on at a time loosly bolted. Once together, tighten up. I was also impressed with the quality of screws. I was worried about stripping the screws as i used my high powered dewalt driver. The screws survived and did not strip. I highly recommend this product.",

Slight chemical smell when I opened the box but it seemed to fade as I assembled them (or I just got used to it). Like some other reviews said, mine both wobble slightly (like the legs aren\u2019t exactly the same length). I\u2019m sure this could be corrected by attaching extra felt pads on one of the legs. Unlike other reviews, I did not notice any damage when mine arrived. It took me about 30 minutes to put both stools together\u2014super straightforward directions and no missing pieces. You will need a philips screwdriver.",

One of the post broke screwing them in so be careful don\u2019t use a power screw driver. I called customer service and they took care of me with broken part. The stools seem sturdy and just the perfect heights. As of now it\u2019s a 5 Star I will see if they hold up good.",
