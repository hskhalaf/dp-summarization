The metal hairstyling comb was a plus its unique wide tooth gives you a natural texture without the need of running your fingers through. Love this brand!",

The package is sleek, the pomade itself is black (which threw me off at first but it goes on clear when you put it on the hair), and it smells amazing. More important, the quality of the product is on point. I use it when my hair is slightly damp from the shower by rubbing a small amount in my palms and lightly scrunching my curls. It helps to give the curls shape without the frizz or crunchiness. A little bit of this goes a long way too, so I'm going to let my brother try it out also. Would definitely get this again.",

Maybe that's desirable for some, but it you want your hair feeling softer when you run your hands through it, I would not recommend this.",

Depending on the amount applied, I can get a medium hold on a clean combed look, or use a little less and the pomade acts almost like a leave-in conditioner for a more relaxed style if your hair has some length. I'm on my second 5 oz. jar and the first one lasted 7 months. Made in France and worth the premium price in my opinion.",

      "text": "It's a firmer pomade, dries stiffly. Looks great the moment you put it on but dries hard. At first I didn't like it but I started combining it with my American Crew Pomade and it works wonderfully. I get the texture of American Crew with the hold of Jovinno. I also really enjoy the smell of it.",

      "text": "This pomade is the only one ive ever bought twice. I have thick asian hair so its hard for me to style my hair. this pomade has a strong hold and if you style it with wet hair, you can get a bit of a shiny look. The scent and the consistency of this pomade is what seperates this pomade and others. The scent is noticeable but once its in your hair, you wont smell it as strong as other pomades, such as Haircraft, sauvacito, mountain men, layrite. the consistency is like jello? but easily spreadable throughout your hands. It has a \"bounce\" type of feeling to it. 5/5. i would highly recommend to myself lol.",

      "text": "Overall disappointed with this product. The ingredients of this product make it hard to spread evenly between the palm of your hands. I had to use a lot of efforts just to try to spread them evenly, and even then, it still has chunks all over your hands. When apply on dry hair, it does not apply evenly. And when utilize a little water to help it spread a little easier, it does not work and make it worst. The only good thing about this product is the smell. That\u2019s it. Will not recommend.",
