She also stated that a father's love would protect your daughter from bullying. It won't. However, for the average Dad just wanting a quick read and some pointers I think this book is fine. It basically affirms you need to spend quality time with your daughters, talk to them, set boundaries for them, and make sure they know you think they're important.",

The overall message of making sure to spend lots of time with our daughters, protect them and talk to them was good, but felt a bit lacklustre.",

Raising a daughter in today's world is fraught with decisions about social media, how much oversight daughter's need, etc. FATHERS NEED TO READ THIS BOOK. You have no idea how influential you are on your daughter. She may be an infant when you buy this book, but that's the time to read this. A father is every bit as important as a mother in their daughter's development.",

Dr. Meeker does a great job of presenting statistics and facts while presenting anecdotes from her years of practice. She never relies on platitudes to get her point across which tends to plague a lot of father/daughter parenting books. I think this is a book both fathers and mothers should be reading. This is my first exposure to Dr Meekers works, I will start looking for more of her books.",

Mrs. Meeker finds a way of challenging you and lifting you up to be the man and father our daughters deserve. Fantastic book.",

The true stories that Meg Meeker provide really help understand the female point of view. There were times I had to put the book down and hug my daughters(5yrs and 2yrs) because this book taught me that having their father in their lives is VITAL! You know those books that you read a dozen times and every time it gets better? This is one of those books. And it's very informative for all ages. Whether your princess is 2 or 18. Any father with daughters should pick this up. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",
