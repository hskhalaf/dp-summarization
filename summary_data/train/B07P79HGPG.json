All the cards are great, cute cards I would have bought myself in a Hallmark store, and I love just being able to pull one out when I remember that it's someone's birthday today. I would recommend this product to anyone who loves sending or storing cards. It's great!",

Otherwise...most of the cards included are birthday. So if that's what you mainly want, this will be perfect for you.",

So I ordered these for her and it was PPERFECT! She loved them so much she wanted to keep some for herself haha. Super high quality and at first i thought was a little pricey but when i did the math they\u2019re only a FRACTION of the price if i was to buy them in stores one by one... loved the cards so much we bought a knot her box of other holidays... highly recommend",

Well worth the money and the cards are high quality, unique, and arrive in a lovely box. Gold colored Hallmark \"Crown\" stickers are included inside, as well, to use in sealing your envelopes. Adds a nice touch. Highly recommend!",
