You can wear it for a more natural and elegant look with a single coat for tint and slight definition. Two coats with 30 seconds in between provides volume without any of the spidery look or clumps most other mascaras give. I have spent upwards of $30 on brand name mascaras only to be disappointed and so happy I found this one!",

I did notice, however, that it has a strongish smell, which surprised me for a natural product but it didn't cause me to tear. Product comes with an expiry date on the bottom, which is a plus if you wish to buy a few at a time and keep one for later unused. The one I opened lasted for a good 6 months without getting hard. I will definitely purchase it again.",

This in combination with an eyelash curler leaves my eyelashes looking long and not clumpy. Honestly, this product was better than I expected. I plan to continue using this product!",

Most \"all natural\" mascaras go on thin with little thickness, but this one goes on thick and stays on all day and doesn't smear or wear off as the day goes on, plus... my eye lashes don't feel heavy or weighed down. It just makes my eyes feel good and look good...all day long! I love this mascara... it's the only one I will ever want to use. Thank you....Natural Mineral Mascara!",

Although the experience was really good with the company I cannot say the same for the product. It is very clumpy and doesn't really extend the lashes the way that I had hoped. Its not bad, its just not very good. Because it is too thick when it goes on you can't get it to give the length as it just clumps. I have not had that experience with other organic/natural mascara products. Sorry",

I've been using it for about 2 weeks, almost daily and I don't have itchy eyes. It doesn't smear throughout the day. Not sure how it does in water (swimming, etc). Goes on smooth, and easy to remove.

After using it for three months there\u2019s been no reaction no dry eye no pink eye or eye infection.
