Sounds fantastic and can easily fill a 20x20 room with great sound. The 18 hour battery is amazing. I am more impressed with this than the bose soundlink color. I got a really great price buying it \"used like new\" from the Amazon marketplace. I am really impressed and glad I chose this speaker.",

It isn't as small about portable and other units in the house, not as powerful and loud as others... but provides a good balance between size and power. And because of that little extra size, there is better bass than others speakers in th house.",

Rubberized grip keeps it in place in both positions, no matter how much the bass is kicking! Convenient. The charging port in the back is low current, but the internal batteries have the capacity to fully charge most phones. Cons: Size. It's probably bigger than you think.
