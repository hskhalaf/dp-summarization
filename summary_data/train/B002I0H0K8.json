The other day I was asked, \"Mom, what do doctors need for surgery?\" \"Um, a scalpel.\" WOW. They love changing their characters and it keeps them engaged with one other while they play. They are cooperating to play the game rather than playing against one another, such as a racing game.",

Younger children will not understand how to correct some issues, such as when you are touched by a zombie and in turn \"zombify\" anything you touch. Also although its vocabulary is good, we often encountered situations where the program did not understand a word and/or its context. I must admit I am biased and giving this game an extra star because of its \"educational\" aspect :0)",

The best thing is that the game is truly free-form without any nanny-state limitations - good or bad. If your kid wants to create a gun to shoot the people, the game permits it. It's up to the parent to counsel the child on the behavior, but the game, like any good tool, is at the service of the user. I definitely will get the other Scribblenauts game soon!",

This version centers more around doing missions, however you have a bit more freedom to play. There is no longer a limit to how much can be created. Another feature that I enjoyed was the ability to make your own creations and post them online for others to download.",
