So I found this adapter so that I may use the light feature and my headset. I am very happy with this adapter, works great with PS4. Will definitely recommend this to other PS4 gamers!!",

Normally I plug a 3.5mm cable from the speaker to the Switch\u2019s 3.5mm port to get my sound working and its a little inconvenient doing it whenever I dock my Switch which also makes a lot of static sound in the process. Since the Switch supports USB audio, this adapter works like charm. The sound is if not the same, better than just plugging to the 3.5mm port from the Switch to the speaker. I\u2019m satisfied so far. I hope its durable enough. For now my rating is a perfect 5/5",

What's most noticeable is that the competing option is much louder--when I used this to play audio from a Galaxy tablet through my car's auxiliary input, the volume was so muted that it really wasn't a viable option for that purpose. The pro with this device, however, is that it is truly plug-and-play, so if you just need something to plug your headphones into a device with a bad audio jack, then this will probably be okay for you.",

      "text": "My title says it all. My audio jack stopped working and I wasn't about to spend $100's of dollars for an expensive repair. This simple audio jack solved the problem Furthermore, laptops in the past came with audio jacks that had two ports--one for the speaker and the other for mic. The newer models come with only one audio jack for both. I can't understand how this is an \"upgrade\". If I use the jack as a mic, then I cannot listen to the recording unless I unhook the mic. This little part corrects the \"upgrade\" issue. Dr. Charles Rasmussen",

      "text": "This adapter is a simple and convenient way to increase the number of laptop's audio ports (usually a single combined headphones/microphone one). The product page is very informative with clear pictures and descriptions of all characteristics, uses, possible connections, etc. The downside is that it will occupy a USB port, which number is usually also very limited. So, a USB hub might be needed. On the other hand, if all that is required is to connect a headset and microphone to a laptop, a simple adapter like thismight be sufficient.",

This product dealt with both sufficiently and I'm satisfied. The build quality is sufficient.

It's not even worth returning, as the shipping cost is almost half the price of the adapter. Next time I'll try my luck at Walmart for another device, At least returning it would be easy",
