The controller, however, is garbage and is not suitable for almost any gameplay. Shaking the controller makes buttons press themselves, R2 may as well be free to move whenever it wants, and the left joystick can be twisted (not pushed, literally the rubber part literally spins in place). The fact that simply shaking the controller beyond the basic vibration makes multiple buttons press is big enough of an issue. 4 stars because the PS3 looks to be totally fine. Controller sucks terribly though-- buy somewhere else if you want the combo together.",

This model consumes less power than the original PS3, which I previously owned, and runs much cooler.

It isn't as bad as people say though. - No party system Overall the likes definitely outweigh the dislikes and I would recommend this to anyone.",

The bad: Lacks backward support for PS2 games; no infrared port means non-Bluetooth universal remotes aren't compatible; online gaming, media, and commerce options still aren't as fully developed as Xbox Live, though they're getting better",

Sept. 6 just checked my 3 PS1 arcade games(atari redux, Williams arcade and Intelevision) and was surprised that the console would play them !!! Actually on the manual it says that this model has limited backward compatability against the NO backward comp. described in Amazon.Don't know if other PS1 games can be played but I am happy that it can play the ones I have.",

He also knows what games he wants, so extra/free game bundles do not do him any good or are worth anything. As well, some systems, come with Blue-Ray remotes, but you can use the game controller to watch a Blue-Ray disk if you need to... but you can always buy the remote at a later time.

      "text": "My son bought this PlayStation for his Mom and Dad. We needed a blue ray player and he felt this was a better deal for us. Now we can keep our system updated when necessary. I have also discovered that playing some of the games is pretty fun. At age (over 60) I am enjoying Fat Princess. I am in no way as accomplished a player as my son, but now I can play some games too. We like the look and design of the PlayStation too. I would recommend this for anyone who wants a game play machine or a blue ray player.",

Besides that there are game updates which take forever as well (Gran turismo for example) . The upside is that you can upgrade the harddrive in this system pretty easily to make it faster. I installed a SSD in the playstation and it is significantly faster especially for gran turismo",

Kind of sad, as most reviews have stated this was the best blu-ray player to buy... glad I still buy DVDs, since I now can't watch all the movies/shows on blu-ray, nor play the games I invested in until I get a new one. I *hope* that sony has better quality control now on these.",

The system defiantly is faster than the older one, no freezes or lockups, smaller size and no fingerprint smudges. The great benefit of the Sony PS3, is the free online game play, the multimedia capabilities, such as Video on Demand from Voodoo or Netflix, Blu-Ray player, the large size hard drive and the wireless controller. Overall, I would highly recommend this all gamers!",

It was broken right out of the box; both the thumbsticks jam when you push upwards, making most gameplay extremely challenging if not impossible. I purchased this product to save money. However now that I will have to purchase a brand new controller any money that I saved on the console is wasted.

    "title": "Sony Playstation 3 160GB System",
    "description": "With the PlayStation 3 160GB system, you get free PlayStation Network membership, built-in Wi-Fi and 160GB of hard disk drive storage for games, music, videos and photos. This system will come with firmware 3.6 or greater. You can easily upgrade to the latest firmware for free, simply by connecting the PS3 to the internet. And every PS3 system comes with a built-in Blu-ray player to give you pristine picture quality and the best high-definition viewing experience available. Whether it\u2019s gaming, Blu-ray movies, music or online services, experience it all with the PlayStation 3 system. All PlayStation 3 systems are already equipped with everything you need to play stereoscopic 3D games.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\nThe fourth generation of hardware released for the PlayStation 3 entertainment platform, the PlayStation 3 160GB system is the next stage in the evolution of Sony's console gaming powerhouse. Loaded with a mix of multimedia features and functions available on earlier PlayStation 3 models, as well as a series of new advancements and refinements, the PlayStation 3 160GB system is destined to push the envelope in the realm of Next-Generation entertainment.  \n\nWhat's Under the Hood\nAs with previous models, the PlayStation 3 160GB system features an IBM \"Cell\" processor and a co-developed NVIDIA graphics processor that together allow the system to perform two trillion calculations per second. Yet the 160GB system manages to improve on this with its 45nm version of the processor, which although running at the same 60+nm speed as previous PS3 versions, uses less energy. This makes the unit's smaller size and quieter fan possible. Along with the traditional AV and composite connections, the 160GB system also boasts an HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) port, which delivers uncompressed, unconverted digital picture and sound to compatible high-definition TVs and projectors. (The system is capable of 128-bit pixel precision and 1080p resolution for a full HD experience) This console also provides for an extreme sound experience by supporting Dolby Digital 5.1, DTS 5.1, as well as Linear PCM 7.1. Finally, it features cross connectivity with your PC network and PlayStation Portable (PSP) and its pre-installed, 160GB hard disc drive allows you to save games as well as download content from The Internet. Unlike other models of the PlayStation 3, the 160GB system does not offer backwards compatibility.\n\n \n\n\nThe same functionality now in a smaller, more quiet and energy efficient package\nView larger. \nSpace saving when placed upright...\nView larger. \nAs well as when horizontal\nView larger. \nA textured, no fingerprint finish\nView larger. Blu-ray, PlayStation Network Downloads and Beyond\nPlayStation 3 utilizes the Blu-ray disc media format, which gives you the best high-definition viewing experience on your television, by way of the format's ability to hold six times as much data as traditional DVDs. This tremendous capacity, combined with the awesome power of the system's processor and graphics card, promises an endless stream of mind-blowing games, and other multimedia content. However, this does not mean that the PS3 is limited to Blu-ray discs - it also supports CD-ROM, CD-RW, DVD, DVD-ROM, DVD-R, DVD+R formats. In addition, PlayStation 3 system software includes BD Live support that allows you to play discs that support Blu-ray Disc Profile 2.0 (BD-LIVE). This means that you can also connect to the Internet while playing discs that support this format to obtain additional features. Of course, PS3 owners also receive free access to the PlayStation Network (PSN), where through the PlayStation Store and PlayStation Home, they can download games, game demos, movies, and other content, as well as chat with friends, play mini-games, compete in tournaments and explore dedicated game spaces.\n\nSensational Controller\nThe Dualshock 3 wireless controller(one controller) included with The PlayStation 3 160GB system provides the most intuitive gameplay experience, with pressure sensors in each action button and the inclusion of the highly sensitive Sixaxis motion-sensing technology. Each hit, crash, and explosion is more realistic when the user feels the rumble right in the palm of their hand. It can even detect natural movements for real-time and high precision interactive play, acting as a natural extension of the user\u2019s body. Dualshock 3 utilizes Bluetooth technology for wireless game play and the controller\u2019s detachable USB cable to seamlessly and automatically charge the controller when connected to the PlayStation 3. By integrating all of these features into the popular PlayStation controller design, the Dualshock 3 further enhances the advanced gameplay experience only available on the PlayStation 3 system.\n\nSynch with Your Other Sony HDMI Devices\nThe PlayStation 3 160GB system features HDMI + Bravia Synch functionality. Bravia Synch allows connectivity between Sony HDMI products without having to utilize multiple remote controls. This means that with the push of one button, users can control compliant Sony devices connected to your PS3 via HDMI cable.\n\nWhat's in The Box:\n\n * New slimmer and lighter PS3 system with a 160 GB HDD, Internet-ready built-in Wi-Fi, 2 USB ports and HDMI + Bravia Synch output for 1080p resolution and connectivity between other Sony HDMI products.\n * Dualshock 3 wireless controller(one controller).\n * AC power cord, AV cable and USB cable.\n * Free PlayStation Network membership.\n\nSYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS:\nCPU Cell Broadband Engine (Cell/B.E.)
