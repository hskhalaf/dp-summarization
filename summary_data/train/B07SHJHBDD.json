Seriously, though, this makes kids and adults alike laugh out loud and can entertain cats for hours, and I think it's the only plushie my partner wants to have on display. It has stood up fine so far to cats (who can trigger it on their own!); dogs reportedly like it as well, but are definitely more likely to destroy it. Keep it out of your fish tank and don't evolve it. ;) Batteries not included; this takes three AAAs, which you'll want to have ready when this arrives. Note that you'll need a small screwdriver to open the battery compartment.",
