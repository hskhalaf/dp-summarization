The only reason I spent nearly $20 a piece for a pair of kids gloves is because I expected warmth AND dryness for our often subzero winters. Walmart sells better quality gloves for far less. Fail.",

They kept her hands warm all winter long and I'm sure we'll get at least another year out of them before she outgrows them. My #1 piece of advice is to get them with a set of matching straps so they aren't missing a day after you buy them (learned from not buying the straps last year and losing so many gloves before buying them).",
