Connection between either a satellite receiver or a VCR and TV monitor via RCA audio/video cables was a breeze, and my first recordings looked great. For this manner of hookup, a built-in tuner isn't required, and its absence contributes to the unit's affordability. I've recorded using both DVD+R and +RW discs with equal satisfaction. I recommend it without reservation to anyone seeking a \"no frills\", \"does its job well\" DVD Recorder that will be used with either a cable, satellite, or home VCR signal input.",

But it is the easiest one I have used ( Pioneer Samsung Phillips) to just insert a DVD and press \"record\". At the end you just name it and finalize. Really very easy to do. A good value.",

My ultimate goal was to rip the DVD into my laptop and that went also smoothly. As an added bonus, I can now record TV shows with this recorder and watch it later in the laptop while commuting.",

Having said that, the actual DVD recording works very well, it's very easy and the recording quality is good. Have not had a chance to test the upconversion quality. To summarize, I needed a DVD recorder, and since my older DVD player did not play DivX, was also hoping to kill another bird with the same stone, and was unsuccessful. If it played DivX, this would likely have been a raving 5-star review, it was just too big of a bummer.",
