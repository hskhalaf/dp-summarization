Dries fast, but if you have to pull it up again wet\u2014really hard to get back on over the shoulders and into the arms. Pluses outweigh difficulty in getting off or putting back on if damp. So glad we had them in the Galapagos",

My daughter says I look like a seal but I\u2019m not trying to win beauty pageant just be warm. I may not use the hood (just tuck it in behind my neck).",

Does exactly what I want which is to protect me from the sun between dives after I peel down my wetsuit. No problem with seams or zippers or material.",

The combo of colors of material and stitching give the suit a versatile sporty look. While I was recently vacationing at the beach, it most definitely came in handy for blocking the intense rays of the Florida sun. Was great for swimming in the gulf and the wetness of the material actually kept me cool when walking and beach combing. Also like the draw string bag it comes with. Take time when putting it on dry preferably, and zip slowly half way up to all the way up as a turtleneck with the hood if so desired.",
