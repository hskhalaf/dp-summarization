Since 2015 I have learned that sucralose, aka, Splenda, isn't so healthy and I noticed Isopure still uses it. I was hoping by now they'd have begun using stevia, monk fruit, erythritol or some combo of those and ditched the sucralose. Other than that issue, it's a great product.",

I liked the texture of the powder but I didn't like the after taste and at times it was a little hard to pass through due to the strong taste so I had to throw in a banana sometimes or peanut butter to cut the taste . I decided to go a little natural and just do the Vanilla, I loved it! much more natural taste and you don't need peanut butter or even banana's to give it a good flavor, it already tastes amazing even with just water. Although I cant wait to finish it and try the coffee one next time.",

At 240mg in one serving providing 25g protein, it contains about 10% of recommended daily consumption. For comparison, another protein isolate that I use regularly contains 50mg of sodium for a similar serving.",

I found the Dutch Chocolate Powder flavor just a bit too Chocolaty; switched to the Vanilla, and while I like it, that was a bit to Vanilla for me!.

This powder has zero sugar and I don't even need to add any sugar to my smoothies. I have already ordered more of this product. I recommend you try it. Thumbs up from me.",

Instead of buying the chocolate I add sugar free baker's coco (1g carb) and one Splenda for a creamy chocolate post work out shake.",
