You might gain 10% or 15% increase in charge level, then nothing. Time to talk to Anker warranty. Update 2: Anker honored their warranty with no issues. The replacement unit is working fine. Great support is a major reason for my continuing to choose their products.",

I have one unit from another manufacturer (aukey) that seems to charge pretty much as fast as the OEM charger, hence is why I\u2019m a little disappointed with this.

      "text": "This is my third Anker PowerPort (three different models /sizes) , for straightforward reasons. They are well engineered, nicely designed, and utterly reliable. Anker backs their products with exceptional support and customer service, and their descriptions are accurate and without exaggeration or deceptive sales nonsense. This device, compact and covered with a soft matte black coating, charges everything I own to full charge. This includes: iPad, iPod Touch , Nexus 7, Galaxy Tab S 8.4 and 10.1, HTC One M8, Xperia z3 and two generations of Kindles, plus misc calculators and other devices. It works well, is compact, sturdy and well worth the money. A no-brainer purchase if you need charging in a simple, uncomplicated solution (a day who doesn't).",

It got just a little warm charging two larger items at the same time that required a little longer to charge.
