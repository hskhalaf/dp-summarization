I can see what people are talking about if fully extended that they can be a lil flimsy (Hence the 4 stars vs 5) but you really don\u2019t need to because they are fairly long. Not an issue with marshmallows regardless. If cooking hotdogs or sausages, even plant based like mine, I wouldn\u2019t extend it all the way since they are obviously heavier than marshmallows. They are also easy to clean both in the sink and good ol fashion sand wash with a quick rinse or wipe.",

That is my only critical point, the carry pouch is a bit cheap but it will suffice. Just make sure you don't lose the red plastic tip covers. The tips are sharp and if you lose the covers, the tips could poke right through your carry case.",

I\u2019m thinking we\u2019ll be down to 3 sticks before long.",
