But, other's poor reviews with batteries dead, light did not work, or ink dried out; I chose this product. I always read reviews. \u2b50\ud83d\udcac I pulled out the plastic tabs for all #24 ordered. I checked each one for ink & UV light. They ALL worked.!.!.! I tried to open battery compartment for child Safety, none openned. I also priced them per pen, and they were the cheapest for the best quality, so far. I have not given them to classmates, yet. Very happy with purchase after much research & effort. \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",

She had an idea of how to use the invisible ink pens. She said we could use the stencils to put artwork on the wall next to a blacklight. You would only see the design when the blacklight was on. I thought that was a great idea! I'll post pictures when we get finished. Thanks, Rosetta Conway",
