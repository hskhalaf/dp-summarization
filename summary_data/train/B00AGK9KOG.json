The batteries lasted nine months before they needed replaced. Like the instructions very clearly point out, good alignment between the door/lock and the hole in the strike plate is critical for proper operation. If you have to push or pull on the door to lock and unlock the door, it's not going to be able to function properly, especially when controlled wirelessly using ZWave. This should be obvious and is not a fault of the product, but many reviewers complained about it.",

Then, I wrote email to the customer support with detailed description of quality issues and purchasing invoice. Till now, I have yet to receive a response from Schlage. Very unsatisfactory experience, to say the least!",

One of the best features is the keypad, so I don't have to carry a key on me or always have my phone. I now always have to remember to have my phone on me in case this happens again.",
