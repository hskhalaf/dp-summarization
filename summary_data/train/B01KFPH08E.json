It broke right above the swivel, so both dogs, tethered together, ran away form me at full sprint. Fortunately the Newfoundland was well behaved and probably felt like he had nothing to prove and just sat there. This would be fine for smaller breads, but not reliable for larger dogs.",

The handle is a little on the cheap end, but comfortable nonetheless. Best used for calm dogs. If your dogs are spastic in all directions, you might have a hard time with this.

The adjustable of the leash is a nice feature and is easy to adjust. I dont like the bungee/ springy of the lower leash sections...well made but the pull created does affect the other dog by pulling them. The bungee also doesn't give you immediate control if you need to pull the dogs under control. The bungee also allows the dogs an extra foot or so.",

We have two rescue dogs, one is a medium shepherd mix who walks great on a leash, the other is a small chihuahua/terrier mix who didn\u2019t have much (if any) leash time in her native Puerto Rico and zig zags as she walks. So dealing with the two on separate leashes was terrible. The dual leash helps keep them close and the smaller pup is now walking a lot better and makes walk time more pleasurable.",

The leash lets me walk two of the dogs at the same while still giving them plenty of space from each other--I bought another coupler leash once that was very short and forced the dogs to stand right next to each other all the time. This leash gives each pup plenty of space, should they need it. The handle is soft and comfortable, and the leash material is strong and braided. I am very glad I bought this.",

It\u2019s great having a 1 leash for both my dogs. It\u2019s a great idea. But don\u2019t expect this leash to make the walk easier if you got dogs that pull. This will definitely take a good while to get use to. But with the resistance issues, I\u2019m really not sure if I want to continue with this one.",
