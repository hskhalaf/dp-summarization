Checked the history and the movement would appear that the unit traveled directly from the school to the hospital. Well after frantically calling the school it turned out the kid and GPS unit were all still located at the school. Thank you Americaloc for the 20 minutes of sure terror.",

This tracker also has amazing battery life, i left it in my daughters backpack for 5 days and it was still transmitting. The only thing I wish was that it was a bit smaller so it would fit in my daughter pocket. It also will not update if it does not sense movement.",
