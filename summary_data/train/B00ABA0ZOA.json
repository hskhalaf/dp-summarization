Fast forward 15 years and I got this for my 3 year old (yeah, yeah, he doesn't have the manual dexterity or patience....Stop interrupting me) to pass that haze onto the next generation. Guess what, he loves Jenga!! Just not in the ultra competitive, beer fueled way. He views them as blocks, so we spend an hour or so each episode building stuff and knocking it down. Eventually we will start actually playing Jenga, but for now, his journey towards the haze of my youth is wonderful. Peace, No BS Guy",

We have to actually remove each block at a time on your turn and make sure the tower should not loose the balance. Overall I like this game because you can spend hours playing this without getting bored as well you can finish it early if you have limited time. Overall worth it's price and good game.",

The blocks are not painted, which allows them to stay together and the game to proceed normally without being shortened by premature slippage. The cardboard box is rectangular, and might serve as a storage mechanism for the blocks for awhile, but I suspect it will not last for that purpose. I'd prefer a storage bag, like several of the knock-offs that are marketed here have, but a bag might be found elsewhere.",

The only other gripe is the very cheap cardboard guide that comes along with the game to assist you in rebuilding the tower once it's been toppled. I'd pay more if there was a better device to assist in building the tower again. Hours of fun that even our 4 year old was able to fully participate in. A non electronic game that holds your attention span..... amazing !",

BIG gripe is the cost of larger Jenga blocks that only stack 3 feet high. Seventy-five dollars ($75.00) is slightly pretentious, and the pictures are slightly misleading. However, it works like Smaller version Jenga,and my kids in play therapy get a kick out of it when it crashes. The box is sturdy enough for storing the blocks.

Because if the wood is made of cheap compressed plywood or something, instead of dense hard wood, it would make a big difference when you try to pull a piece in the stack. The friction between woods will be enough to overcome the weight of the structure on top, thus causing the whole thing collapse more easily. Other than that, overall this is a good product given its price. I would recommend this product if you are a casual player and only play it sometimes as one of the many game you have handy.",

I will agree with others that the boxes are stupid as all he--. I don't know why its a rectangle so the blocks don't fit without a struggle to center it.

I know a social worker who puts questions on each block for her therapy sessions so that kids/families can talk while being distracted with a game. This is a great idea for teachers, too. building vocabulary, asking questions, writing prompts, etc. A nice game to have at home. Younger kids would love it, I'm sure.",

I'm not sure if this is intentional, as it allows some blocks to slide out more easily, which would make sense for the actual game.
