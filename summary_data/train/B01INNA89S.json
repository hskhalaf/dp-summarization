So far, fire stone pizza, beer can chicken and smash burgers in just 2 days. Has hardly had time to cool down. Passing down my beloved trusty Weber. Very simple to use once you understand how the airflow works. Tons of youtube videos to get your going. I had never heard of Kamado Joe, but once I started looking at the Green one this one stood out. My only wish is the casters were larger for easier rolling. Build like a tank, for years of use.

I sent pictures of the damaged parts to Kamado Joe the same day we received the grill. We have been ignored for weeks now. Due to this I can't recommend this brand. I would tell prospective buyers to go with the green competitor instead. The performance of the green egg seems to be equal for about he same price. If they don't ignore their customers, they might have an edge. Thanks for nothing Kamado Joe customer service!",

Keeping temperature is a learning curve that takes a few tries and when smoking you don't need to add a huge amount of wood chunks just a few smokes for a very long time.
