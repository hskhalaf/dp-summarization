I had this happen once, but it was because I did not have the blade fully engaged. When it is fully engaged in the collar, it will NOT come loose. Just push it in until it clicks audibly. Otherwise, I like the ease of changing blades, and I was pleasantly surprised to find a flush-cut blade in the kit. This was not mentioned in the on-line add, so it was a pleasant find. Thanks, DeWalt.",

This has options that were not available back then and cuts as strongly as any electric saw in my opinion.",

They locked in and made a clicking noise. When he pulled on them they wouldn't come out, but when we used it and made contact with the wood they would fall out! I don't get it at all. Too late to return or we probably would. Love Dewalt generally but this is a bit much.",
