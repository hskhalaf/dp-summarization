Very well made with generous padding,and a quality zipper. Shell loops in pockets will hold 12 shells with plenty of room for other small items.

There's also a single ring on one end, but no matching one on the opposite end so using a shoulder strap won't work. My intended use was not for holding a shotgun anyway, but rather an Appalachian dulcimer, which it fits well at about half the cost of a somewhat similarly designed dulcimer case.
