I only oiled my boots maybe twice so I could have gotten more life out of them if I took better care of them. I had a pair of RedBacks last longer but I like the feel of these better. I only experienced water leakage once the boots started to come apart at the seems. I liked them enough to buy a second pair.",

    "title": "Danner Men's Quarry USA Black Work Boot - 8-Inch",
    "description": "Our most popular work boot \u2013 now built in Portland, ore. We\u2019ve developed a new vibram quarry outsole and upgraded the midsole to a single, solid piece for increased longevity. We've also updated the collar liner to be instantly comfortable and re-engineered the placement of the triple-stitching to reduce wear and tear over time. Using our universal 610 last, the US-made quarry has the same fit and feel as its predecessor.\n\nAt Danner, they are craftsmen. They pay attention to details. They forgo quantity for quality, with the knowledge that the boots they craft are no better than the hands that create them.",
