Based on the information I received from a Muscletech representative, that product has been replaced with this one. This product definitely does the job however it doesn't do it any better than the previous product, or products similar to it that are cheaper. In addition, I bought the Platinum because it tasted great and it broke down really well. This product does not accomplish those two key features well. I probably won't be investing in this product again unless it's on sale. tl;dr Does the same job as other proteins but taste and break down are off the mark from the product it's replacing.",

For post workout i do the opposite ratio and I've gotten good results, and it does great for the appetite. Only 4 stars because it's the only caesin i ever tried so i have no basis for comparison.

The vanilla flavor of this is, well, not good. It is palatable, but not in any way good. On the plus side, it does mix well in a shaker cup. It is SUPER thick -- I use about twice the recommended water and its still thick. Too thick to drink at the recommended ratio for me.",

It\u2019s definitely thicker than their whey proteins, but it tastes good and it mixed fine for me in a shaker with almond milk. I got the chocolate, and it\u2019s a mild chocolate flavor, thick - tastes like a milkshake kind of! I like to mix it with chia seeds and almond milk and let it sit for 45 minutes to turn into a chia seed pudding. Top it with honey and coconut flakes, and it's a delicious snack!",

Helps me recover and train every day, no soreness the next day and helps me maintain muscle mass after a long nights sleep. Easy to mix in water.",
