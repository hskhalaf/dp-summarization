The bottom part completely felt off or completely disassembled from the shoes. I was at work went the issue happened. I had to leave work I went to a shoe store near my job and found something to wear. I generally like Aldo\u2019s, but I was not lucky this time. I believe Aldo can do a better job in manufacturing this shoe kind.",
