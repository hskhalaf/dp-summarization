I decided to buy a second one, and eventually the same results occurred. The matter how hard (or gently) I push, the blade won\u2019t come out of the head. It just jams. I want to be clear that I never dropped either one of these knives, not even once. I tried loosening the screw on the head to varying degrees, until it was wide open. Still, I can\u2019t get the knife blade out. So I have given up on this brand, and emphatically do NOT recommend it to anyone else.",

With multiple passes of this Kutir utility knife, the bindings come away cleanly and safely. Love your product, and would recommend to all.",

After taking it apart, I found that while trying to retract the blade, the metal blade would slide against another metal part and dig in and get caught. Trying to force it to retract would cause it to dig in further. The fact that this can occur means it was designed poorly. A blade that can't retract is too unsafe to have in my house, and so I rate it 1 star.",

The metal components are terrific-- good quality. And the tightener is solid... I had no worries it would loosen while in use. This looks like it will lady a long time. (I'm still trying to figure out what the yellow plastic thing is for... didn't fit as blade cover and appears to be for blade storage, but I thought that was in the handle itself.

A test of the sturdiness of the blade and cutter is to extend the blade a couple of inches to cut thicker items. This cutter makes solid straight cuts. Don't waste your time with the other cheaper thinner cutters; this will be the last retractable utility knife you buy.",
