Instead of just talking about distance, velocity, and acceleration, I place X's in the hallway and the kids have to measure to them and create the code required to get there. They have to work out the coding blocks (which are really easy), and they can use whatever speed and time they want to get the desired distance. It works great, and the kids love using it.",

I figured we had a lemon so the following year I have it another try. Right away, the same problem occurred. It\u2019s like an expensive remote-control car that doesn\u2019t work.

Apparently you have to try to perform an action that requires a connection to start the process. Great concept but really terrible execution on the software and user experience",
