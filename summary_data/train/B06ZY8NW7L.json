That horn was sold to another up and coming band member. I still play in several bands, and wanted to get the trumpet involved somehow in any of those projects. I purchased this horn, it has an excellent sound, the valves work very nice. This is perfect for a beginner, however, it will also serve as a great horn for the veteran trumpet player.",

The trumpets finish is nice and clean, but the attention to the detail in manufacturing the valves is below subpar. Valves constantly stick even after thorough cleaning, inspection, and lubrication. If you want a pretty trumpet to hang on your wall for wall decor, this is it. Very frustrated with my overall playing experience with this trumpet due to the valves constantly sticking. Save yourself or your child the embarrassment of having malfunctioning equipment during practice or performances and avoid this brand.",
