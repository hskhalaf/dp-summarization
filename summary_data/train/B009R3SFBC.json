Only one hole is the right size/shape, and it's almost impossible for cats to pull the food out. It works well if you only want to put cat toys inside, though. You also need to tape down the cardboard inserts which don't stay in place. On the plus side, it's recyclable.",

She mostly just beats up the box until the treats fall out. It usually takes her at least 10 minutes to get them all out and she definitely gets a workout yanking and throwing the thing around our house. If she gets lucky and gets it to turn over that is the quickest way to pay day. Pretty entertaining for sure :)",

Very clever designations between easy and more difficult allows your cat to build up to more challenging levels, and also means your cat will keep coming back to this mystery box.

However, the holes in the box were of a size that once my kitty figured out how to gain access to her treat, was unable to slip her head out without toppling the box over. She was frightened. I continued to leave treats in and on top of the box. She did show interest a few days later. She, again, got her head stuck. When she raised her head the box moved with her until it was partially off the ground. This might work for a kitten. My kitty is 3 and a ragdoll.",

The picture shows the insert folded up at the end with the holes lining up, but if you fold it that way the end covers the open hole on the box. With that said, he loves it! Tons of fun. He even puts his other toys in it and tries to get them out. Seemed funny spending money on a cardboard box since I have plenty from amazon deliveries, but it was well worth it. If it was made better, with better directions it would have gotten 5 stars.",

The first day I left it out there were quite a few treats still inside the toy and I dumped them out. But over a few days they figured it out and they never leave treats behind. It really is cool to see your cats figure it out and get rewarded for their efforts. It's also a great way to see which one of your cats is the smartest. I also think it's great because it gives your cat something to do while he waits for you to come home.",
