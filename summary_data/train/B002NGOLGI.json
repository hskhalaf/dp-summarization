For reference, fructose has a glycemic index of 25.

Stay educated, and stay away from anything with Maltitol, Dextrose, Maltodextrin, Polydextrose, etc.",

      "text": "I don't normally have a sweet tooth, however, my first week getting into Keto, I immediately had an insane desire for something sweet, and of course chocolaty. Of course went to Amazon to see what they had available and came across these delicious looking brownies. I was not looking forward to the taste, assuming it would be horrible tasting, dry and chalky, but I was pleasantly surprised! They are the perfect size to get over your sweet snack desire, taste/smell delicious, and the nuts on top are a perfect addition. This is my \"go to\" sweet snack and I don't feel guilty about it! They're amazing!",
