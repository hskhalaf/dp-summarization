They slide easy off, easy on, and at the door guests think that they are there for decoration. I\u2019ve just ordered my third pair; they\u2019ve lasted about two years each; I really give them a beating. Your feet don\u2019t get wet no matter how much water they receive, and dirt does not stick. My fit was great, with or without socks, but I try to wear them with socks. I highly recommend them if you love gardening as I do. Thank you Amazon for providing them to us!",

I am a veteran clog wearer, and, as a child had a pair of wood clogs like these. My intent was to actually wear them around the house. As a veteran life-long clog wearer who purchases only European-made clogs I am also familiar with the EU shoe sizes. Therefore, I was shocked at how h-u-g-e (and I do mean huge) these are made despite ordering the correct EU size. My feet are swimming in these. They are far too large, particularly in the the width (but in the length too).",
