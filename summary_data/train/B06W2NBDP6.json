      "text": "I just finished installing this deck in my car and so far so good. I purchased the X390BS because it was this years model and had several updates/upgrades over the previous year. The install was easy and sound quality is excellent. It was easy to customize the colours to match my interior and most settings seem pretty intuitive. The AppRadio Live app is cool as you get free GPS via your phone etc but it's a very different platform than the rest of the system so it's a whole additional thing to figure out. Drawbacks: takes about 10 seconds to resume BT audio playback on startup. I'll update as I get to know it better.",

Pros -50w gives great speaker power delivery -big screen -seperate subwoofer channel (very common) -seperate subwoofer volume control -bright screen with big letters -usb or bluetooth -lots of features Neutral- advanced EQ only Cons -Small buttons -stupid parking brake restriction to even setup bluetooth -bluetooth seems very weak with it cutting out even standing next to an open driver door with it -no integration without an extra device to sterring wheel controls. Overall i do love the deck but i would love some changes to the unit",

For you 2008 Honda Element owners get the Xcorpion Honda Element Double Din Dash Kit my only complain is that sometimes when you skip the song forward it turns off the display since the assigned button is right on top. also Pandora has to be connected on your phone first before you can connect and the Spotify app has a similar problem...Bluetooth work excellent though.",
