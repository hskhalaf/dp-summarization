After being discharged from the hospital my husband and I have to clean his wounds and change his bandages twice a day. About 5 days in and these shears have already lost their luster. They started out cutting like a hot knife thru butter but now it is forced and difficult. I ended up wrapping gauze all around the handle/finger holes because the cut is so rough and takes so long that they hurt my fingers every time I have to use them, which again, is twice a day. I definitely WOULD NOT recommend these for long term use.",
