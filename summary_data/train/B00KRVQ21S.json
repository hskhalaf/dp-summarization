I would suggest infusing for a while before you drink, or else you may be disappointed. 2) The infuser while metal is suspect to denting. I accidentally dented the metal part when trying to separate the plastic and metal pieces. Word of advice try not to apply a lot of pressure on this directly, put more of a torque-like motion to get the two pieces apart and together.",
