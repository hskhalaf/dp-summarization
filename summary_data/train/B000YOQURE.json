I recommend scuffing the adhesive pad base with light sandpaper and some good cleaning product like brakeclean or alcohol to get the \"slippery\" surface to allow the adhesion of the sandpaper discs. Very easy to use and has good control with the palm type air valve. I have a 60gal IR compressor and it never runs out of air flow/volume when using the sander.",
