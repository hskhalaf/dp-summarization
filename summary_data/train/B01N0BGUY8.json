If you are debating between a cheaper option such as this or something along the lines of an iographer or some other smart phone rig then this cheaper option may work for you. There are a couple of things to be aware of though. First, the phone does not fit snug or fully secure in the system. If you are looking for something to walk around with and have a two grip stabilization then I would look elsewhere. If you are only using this on a tripod then this will absolutely work for you.",

      "text": "Bought this item as I shoot a lot of videos from my phone for my website and facebook page. Everything came as promised, but my issue came with the piece that you screw in to secure the phone. It doesn't tighten enough to stay put as I've seen in every video. The piece slides about freely so that I can't move the rig at all. I'm going to buy a thicker washer to hopefully solve the issue, but very disappointed that it didn't come with everything necessary to work from the moment it arrived.",

      "text": "This rig does what I bought it to do - bring together my phone, mic, and light - but I live in constant fear that my phone will fall out of the rig. It wobbles and shifts incessantly when it's by itself but it really becomes unstable when I attach my Moondog Anamorphic Lens. I basically set it up on a tripod, gingerly press record, and back away for fear even a gesture's whisper breeze will cause it to move or fall out. It works for now, but I'm definitely on the hunt for something more secure.",
