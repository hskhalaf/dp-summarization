      "text": "Purchased this camera due to the small size. I was looking for a camera to take to stand up shows and concerts. Last night i got to test it our at a stand up comedy show with low lights. The zoom was great and the pictures turned out great. With full zoom, auto focus and auto settings, low indoor light, no flash, i could not asked for a better picture, every shot turned out great, good lighting and no blur. Glad i picked this little camera up, great size, outstanding zoom and great picture quality for the money.",

      "text": "This was a great value. I love the quality of the photos. The only frustration is slow response in taking pictures when lighting and conditions are not perfect. The camera takes the shot when it gets good and ready! The other negative is the low battery life. The camera comes with a battery charger but be prepared to charge the battery often. Regardless, the quality of the shots make this a great value. Also of note was the great customer service I was provided as a result of some issues surrounding my transaction: Without going into great detail, I just want to say, Amazon really care about their customers and strive to make them happy.

First of all, let me get the main thing out of the way which I'm sure is so important to the rest of you as it was to me...:) IT\"S BLUE! And wow is it ever pretty! This design is sleek, gorgeous and very snazzy. The pictures it takes are almost too clear, I see lines and blemishes even the mirror won't show me in these pics. Am I really that old looking in hd?!! Thank goodness for the blur feature...though I haven't figured that out yet.

Second, I'm a commercial real estate broker and sometimes need pictures of properties. I don't list a lot of properties, but when I do I need to take pictures. I have used this camera for both purposes over the last month and it has performed really nicely. The pictures come out very clear, lots of detail. My wife's SLR camera is superior, but for the size and price I'm extremely pleased with this. If you read the manual before using, everything is easy to figure out.",

I read all the reviews on here, and took the advice of one of the camera guys who gave a very thorough review of all the recent models. I haven't been disappointed at all. Love this camera. Did buy a couple extra batteries, and the 32gb card. I was worried at first that it might not be enough, until I checked my iPhoto library, and it only has 16 gb of photos in it. Guess that the card will be adequate. LOL",

The battery is a special Canon rechargeable, NB-9L, quickly revived by included recharger. They are cheap so I usually carry a second fresh battery, but rarely need it. I bought an adapter for the tiny (size) memory so that I can put it straight into my computer without using the cable. I can download a huge number of photos quicker that way. The function, display and menu buttons are not intuitive, and take some getting used to, as there are so many options. Overall, a great camera.",

Maybe it's a firmware issue but there are no firmware updates. Online forums indicate many owners are happy but some have the same complaint I have. I expected better from Canon.",

I do like a camera that uses regular double \"A\" batteries more.

Shots are clear, the tracking is a great feature and I'm learning the 'extras' slowly. My favorite is the Color Accent. The size of the camera is a plus and the auto feature does everything it needs to to get the shot right. I would give it 5 stars but some of the features are confusing to either get to or use, otherwise, it is a fabulous purchase for someone looking for an everyday-use camera.",

Whether technology has improved that much, or this camera is just amazing, I have never been happier with a camera. On the Auto setting, I can take night shots without any blur, day shots with vibrant color, or even zoom from very far away without the pictures looking pixelated. Good battery life, microSD compatible, excellent camera.",

I have an older Panasonic Lumix (LZ3) which easily and reliably outperforms this pretty elph.If you have been wondering why the price keeps dropping, I suspect that is the reason.",

    "title": "Canon PowerShot ELPH 520 HS 10.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom 28mm Wide-Angle Lens and 1080p Full HD Video Recording (Black) (Discontinued by Manufacturer)",
    "description": "Color:BlackThe Canon 6169B001 PowerShot ELPH 520 HS 10.1MP Ultra-Thin Compact Digital Camera, in black, is a mere 0.76 inches thick and the world's thinnest 12x zoom camera. Canon's pursuit of perfection has driven the development of miniaturization including a lens and 10.1 Megapixel CMOS sensor that, powered by Canon's DIGIC 5 Image Processor, create images as breathtakingly beautiful as the camera itself. The camera's 12x Optical Zoom and 28mm Wide-Angle Lens is a marvel of optical technology. The Wide-Angle lens gives you more to work with in every shot, adding depth, perspective and grandeur as called for. The camera's sensor was specifically designed for this lens, so even at the long end of the zoom images are bright and clear. It is also packed with the technologies including Smart AUTO with Face ID and Full HD Video. Brimming with a full range of advanced technologies the PowerShot ELPH 520 HS digital camera makes the ultimate style icon incredibly effortless.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n Canon Elph 520 HS An Ultra-Slim High Performer\n\nIn the twelve years since the original ELPH was instantly and universally proclaimed an icon of style, successive ELPH cameras have remained at the forefront of design even while boasting the very latest in digital technology. Now, opening a new era of ELPH design, the PowerShot ELPH 520 HS digital camera is both homage to the original ELPH and astonishing synthesis of Canon\u2019s leadership in technical advancements. A mere 0.76 inches thick, it is the world\u2019s thinnest 12x zoom camera. Canon\u2019s pursuit of perfection has driven the development of new miniaturization including a new lens and new 10.1 Megapixel CMOS sensor that, powered by Canon\u2019s DIGIC 5 Image Processor, create images as breathtakingly beautiful as the camera itself. It\u2019s also packed with the latest Canon technologies including Smart AUTO with new Face ID and Full HD Video.\n\nSpectacular Lens Power, Amazingly Compact Body\n\nIncredibly Thin Design\nCanon\u2019s unwavering commitment to equipping an ultra-thin, clean-profiled ELPH with 12x zooming power required a redesign of the lens, sensor and other technologies. This pursuit of perfection paid off, creating the world\u2019s thinnest camera* with a 12x zoom. At an astonishingly thin 0.76 inches, it is significantly slimmer than competitors\u2019 12x zoom models.\n\n\n12x Optical Zoom and 28mm Wide-Angle Lens\nNewly designed to custom-fit the PowerShot ELPH 520 HS digital camera\u2019s incredibly thin profile, the camera\u2019s 12x Optical Zoom and 28mm Wide-Angle Lens is a marvel of optical technology. The Wide-Angle lens gives you more to work with in every shot, adding depth, perspective and grandeur as called for. Landscapes, city scenes, family shots and more all benefit from the extra width. With a 12x Optical Zoom, no shot is beyond your reach. You\u2019ll love the flexibility it gives you when shooting: from a single vantage point you can capture an unlimited number of different images simply by zooming in and out. It also incorporates the latest in Canon lens technology, suppressing lens aberration for outstanding image quality throughout the entire zoom range. The camera\u2019s sensor was specifically designed for this lens, so even at the long end of the zoom images are bright and clear. \n\nUA Lens Technology\nPioneered by Canon, UA Lens technology makes possible compact lenses with remarkable optical performance. By using molded glass with an ultra-high refractive index in aspherical lens elements, Canon has succeeded in reducing lens size while significantly reducing image aberrations. Another stellar example of cutting-edge Canon optics, UA Lens technology helps make PowerShot digital cameras pocket-friendly and capable of astounding image quality. \n\nCanon HS SYSTEM\nThe Canon HS SYSTEM lets you take bright, clear photos in an even wider range of shooting situations. Beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas. The system is the result of two technologies brought together in PowerShot cameras: a high-sensitivity imaging sensor, which is able to capture more light; and the DIGIC 5 Image Processor, which actively reduces noise with high-speed image processing. The 10.1 Megapixel CMOS sensor in the PowerShot ELPH 520 HS digital camera incorporates advanced light reception technology that enhances sensitivity. The DIGIC 5 Image Processor provides a major boost in noise reduction, expanding the usable ISO range to an amazing high of ISO 3200. The Canon HS SYSTEM takes the frustration out of low-light shooting, delivering clear, blur-free images.\n\n\nCanon Full HD Video Advantage\nIn addition to the Canon HS SYSTEM, the combination of the advanced CMOS sensor and DIGIC 5 Image Processor in the PowerShot ELPH 520 HS makes it possible to shoot crisp, clear high definition video. Imagine the fun and excitement of being able to shoot spectacular 1080p Full HD video with stereo sound that you can later watch on your HDTV or download to your computer to share with family and friends. In addition to being able to shoot Full HD 1080p video at 24* frames per second, the PowerShot ELPH 520 HS can also shoot 720p HD video at 30** frames per second. * Actual frame rate is 23.976 fps.\n**Actual frame rate is 29.97 fps.\n\n\nDedicated Movie Button, Wind filter feature and Optical Zoom for easy video capture\nIt\u2019s never been easier to shoot videos with a PowerShot digital camera. The PowerShot ELPH 520 HS has a dedicated movie button that lets you start and stop recording instantly. There is no need to go through layers of menus or operate switches or dials to switch to and from video recording mode. The camera is always ready to shoot stills or video whenever you want. The PowerShot ELPH 520 HS also incorporates an electronic wind filter, which suppresses wind noise that can muffle or distort the sound. And unlike less sophisticated point-and-shoot cameras, the PowerShot ELPH 520 HS lets you use the full range of optical zoom when you\u2019re shooting a video.\n\n\n \n\nHDTV Playback via HDMI with CEC Support\nIt\u2019s easy to enjoy and share the videos you shoot with the PowerShot ELPH 520 HS digital camera. Simply connect its HDMI terminal to your HDTV using an HDMI cable. And because the PowerShot ELPH 520 HS supports HDMI-CEC technology, you\u2019ll be able to control the playback of your images and videos on any CEC-enabled HDTV using the TV\u2019s remote control. (CEC \u2013 Consumer Electronic Control \u2013 is part of the HDMI specification, enabling components in a system to communicate with one another.)\n iFrame Movie Support \n\n\n \n\n \n\nWith the PowerShot ELPH 520 HS, you can also shoot video in the Apple iFrame format, which is a computer-friendly standard that speeds up importing and editing of videos. It keeps file sizes small, making it more convenient to upload or e-mail high-quality videos. The iFrame format enjoys native support in compatible Mac and Windows video applications, making it unnecessary to perform time-consuming and often quality-degrading conversions.\n\n\nPureColor System LCD \nThe PowerShot ELPH 520 HS digital camera\u2019s large and bright 3.0-inch PureColor LCD screen makes it easy to view and frame your shots in high resolution (461,000 dots). Many LCD screens on the market today use a striped arrangement of dots that works great for text and menus, but is not ideal for imagery. The PowerShot ELPH 520 HS digital camera\u2019s PureColor System LCD uses a delta arrangement of dots, an arrangement that works better for the organic nature of photos and videos, allowing you to review your images with exceptional clarity with rich, true-to-life color. Moreover, you can view the LCD screen over a surprisingly wide angle \u2013 above, below or to either side \u2013 without color shifts and with minimal reflections. \n\nIntelligent IS\nThe latest advance in Canon Optical Image Stabilization technology, Intelligent IS analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation. For stills, the system automatically selects among Normal, Panning, Macro (Hybrid) and Tripod IS modes. When shooting video, the system automatically selects among Dynamic, Powered, Macro and Tripod IS modes. With Intelligent IS, you can concentrate on image capture, letting the camera make the most effective IS settings to assure the steadiest possible image.\nNormal\nCorrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills. Panning\nPanning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement. Hybrid\nCorrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting. Dynamic\nEffective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking. Powered\nCompensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified. Tripod\nWhen tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed. \nShooting Modes/Special Scene Modes\nSmart AUTO The camera automatically selects the best shooting settings for optimal quality based on subjects and environmental factors to provide point-and-shoot simplicity. Program Access advanced exposure compensation features while shooting mostly automatically. Movie Digest Records a video clip before capturing a still image and then combines one day\u2019s worth of clips into a video. Stitch Assist Easy-to-use guidelines simplify the shooting of aligned multiple frames that can later be combined (using bundled software) to create panoramic photos. Low Light\nFor high quality image capture in an amazing range of dimly-lit situations.\nPortrait The camera sets a large aperture, focusing the subject and artistically blurring the background to make your subject \u201cpop.\u201d Smart Shutter The camera automatically takes the photo when people smile, wink, or get into frame. High-Speed Burst\nCaptures rapid action frame by frame, by shooting continuously at a high speed while the shutter button is held down.\nHandheld Night Scene Take clear and steady pictures at night without the use of a tripod. Super Vivid\nSuper Vivid intensifies existing hues, saturating the scene with bright colors.\nColor Accent Choose to retain a single color in your image while other colors turn monochrome. Color Swap Select a color and replace it with a color you specify for special effects. Underwater Capture underwater images with reduced backscatter effect. Optional Underwater Case required. Custom Define and store your own settings to achieve the effects you prefer.\nSnow Shoot clear snow scenes without darkened subjects or an unnatural bluish tint. Fireworks Grab brilliant images of skyrocketing fireworks. Long Shutter\nUse to blur moving subjects for artistic effect, ideal for urban night photography.\nFisheye Effect Add a classic photo distortion without a fisheye lens. Miniature Effect\nGive images a miniature look with an effect that emphasizes perspective by blurring the top and bottom of the image. \nToy Camera Effect Simulates photos taken with \"toy\" or pinhole cameras, darkening the image at the edges to create a vignette effect. Monochrome Choose from three single-tone effects: Black-and-White, Sepia, or Blue. Poster Effect Poster Effect combines several similar shades into one color, turning subtle gradations into eye-catching, scene-popping contrasts. iFrame Movie The Apple\u00ae movie format, iFrame, makes it easier and quicker to import and upload videos while retaining high image quality. Super Slow Motion Movie Record your clips in high speed (approx. 240 fps), and then watch your videos in slow motion.\nSmooth Skin\nRemoves dullness, wrinkles, and harsh shadows for beautiful faces.\nSoft Fucus\nCreates a hazy ambiance that\u2019s perfect for portraits and wedding photos.\n\nWhat's in The Box?\n 1.
