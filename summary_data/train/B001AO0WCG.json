She has been struggling for 12 years to get her hair really past her shoulders. This stuff is pricey for such a small bottle, but amazing. When we finished the bottle I wanted to save money and bought a cheaper version... DON'T. It was not worth it. It didn't work as well and we could tell a difference instantly. This stuff it great, worth every penny. Buy it.",
