The Action/Beat 'em up genre may not be for everyone, but I highly recommend this game to all gamers regardless. Excellence in design can transcend any preconceived notion a game or genre. Don't let this masterpiece fly under the radar. Vote with your dollar. Tell Nintendo that we want more games like this on the WiiU, and they should continue to expand out of their comfort zone. Support games that are complete, finished products without DLC. Support masterful game design. Buy Bayonetta 2.",

The fact is this is probably the most fun you'll have on Wii U unless you're below the age of 10. If you're mature you're in the mature audience and you need a reason for yourself to have games on the Wii U this is most certainly one to pick up. 5 out of 5 stars.",

It's bigger and better and streamlines the campaign from the first installment. With the amount of unlockables and collectibles plus the addition of an online component, the replay-ability factor is huge.",
