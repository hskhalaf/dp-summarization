No issues with the welding as noted by a couple others, but the screws to hold the faceplate in we're a pain. They weren't pre-threaded, and one side was so tight the head broke off the screw when I resored to an impact driver to try and get it in. I had to go find some replacement screws, but sorted it out. Be sure to screw these in without the faceplate the first time to get them primed! Still over all happy and managed to work around the issue.",

I installed them at the beginning of the summer and so they didn't get any use until late September. The heaters have been working well since it has been getting cooler outside. Occasionally, they will rattle a bit when they first kick on, which can be kind of annoying, but it seems once they start cycling on and off to maintain the temperature the rattling goes away. It is mostly only when coming on for the first time in a while that the rattling will occur.",

The instructions for installation the bracket are non-existantant. But after a couple of tries I got it assembled properly. As mentioned in many online reviews, the screw heads strip out when trying to screw them into the screw holes. I had to drill out the holes and use other phillips screws. Also, please switch the screws to phillips; square head screws strip too easily. Thanks!",
