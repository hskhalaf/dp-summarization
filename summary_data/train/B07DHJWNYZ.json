      "text": "Received this product yesterday and have only played with it a couple times. So far, pros are that the eyeliner stays in place and makes for a quicker winged look. Even if you mess up with the stamp, you can correct it pretty easily with the liner. Love the pen applicator. Another pro is the price for what is basically two liquid eyeliner pens. Con is that it can be a little difficult to remove even with eye makeup remover. Overall, super pleased with the product and looking forward to perfecting the application. Would definitely buy again.",

So far I haven\u2019t seen any smudging, and it lasts all day without fading or flaking. It goes on smooth and is full coverage. It does come off a bit in the corner if my eyes water. I have fairly bad allergies though, so they can water often. That\u2019s hard on any eyeliner. Otherwise, it\u2019s a great product so far, and I love that it\u2019s cruelty free.",

However, while the application portion is great, the actual eyeliner formula itself is not. It is not smudge or water proof, but stays in place well if you... don\u2019t blink too much. The pigment is not very opaque and even after a few layers it still wasn\u2019t truly black. I\u2019ve bought better products at Walmart for half the price. The quality isn\u2019t even good enough for me to want to give this to my 14 year old niece. I would recommend to just save your money, and practice more.",

It does take some practice so I would suggest trying it at home before you actually have to wear it outside the house. Overall, I\u2019d say it was worth it. Cons: the regular tip eyeliner (not the stamp) is terrible. It\u2019s patchy and opaque. I used a different eyeliner to finish my eye and fill in the stamp.

As a mom, I like that it looks \u201cunderstated\u201d and doesn\u2019t overpower her eyes.

Honestly after you let it dry, if you have primer on, it won\u2019t come off. I tried water and I had to rub a little bit after it dried for literally one second. Came off easily with a textured make up wipe but didn\u2019t move when I wiped it with my finger after completely drying. Easy to make them as wide or thin as possible. I tried to show wide and thin lines. Definitely recommend!!!!!",
