Switched everything over the day it arrived and Ive been in love with it easy to use nice big screen plenty of cases available to buy. Wasnt able to put it down for 24hrs almost.",

Very responsive and decent battery life compared to my 5c Shipping was super fast and item looked brand new!!! Speakers are nice and loud! Only con is the camera which is no big problem. It wont take a picture as good as the 5c but this is not a top of the line device. For what I wanted this phone succeeded my expectations!",
