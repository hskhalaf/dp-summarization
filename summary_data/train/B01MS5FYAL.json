It was easy to put together but two of the feet wouldn\u2019t screw in so they pop off when you move it around. A little gorilla glue helped with that. It\u2019s ideal for a studio or guest room but does not look right in a full size living room. Bought it for the pullout bed so for that purpose it will work. Beware it\u2019s stupid heavy so have help unboxing and moving or you might be sorry.",

That and the shoddy craftsmanship prompted me to contact the company to work with me on a solution. I had received it in time for holiday company, but could not exchange it before it was needed. And there was no offer of expedited exchange, just return or keep it , basically. NO helpful response. No phone call or personal outreach. Seemed unlike Wayfair, to be sure! Certainly a shame for the money spent.",
