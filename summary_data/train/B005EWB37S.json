      "text": "This little gadget is awesome. I love how it attaches to my ipad and charging it is very simple. Just plug it into the computer with the cord that is included and you're all set. The reason I bought it was because my ipad is not very loud and I needed the boost when I'm watching or listening to something and doing other things at the same time. ( I always watch movies on my ipad when I'm ironing -which is a very quiet activity) The reason I am giving this a low rating is because it is WAY too quiet. It is just a hair louder than my ipad. What a bummer from such a cool product!",

So I bought two more and gave one to my 87 yr old Mom who is almost deaf. Once she heard how well it worked on her Ipad she started to cry. Maybe it was the first time she could actually hear her Ipad. In any case this little speaker worked very well for our family. This is not some big stereo sound, but for us it is perfect.",

I've owned so many Logitech products that performed passably well over the years, that I frankly reach for the brand whenever I need a simple computer accessory. Mouse, keyboard, camera, computer speakers with subwoofer, arm rest. This is by far the worst Logitech product I have ever used. The unaided tablet sounds as loud as the tablet with the speaker attached. I cannot accept this. All you had to do was boost volume and clarity. Clarity is fair - volume is unchanged. I have requested a refund from Amazon. You're not my go-to brand any more.",

I have a couple of other products from them, including a set of computer speakers that has been with me for, I believe, about 15 years. Still going strong. Assuming you get a good unit, this model is outstanding. Highly, highly recommended!",

Pros: Great look Excellent price point Charge lasts a long time Cons: Definitely needs to be louder",
