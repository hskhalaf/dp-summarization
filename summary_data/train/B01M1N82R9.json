I wish I had just bought this towel from the start--the microfiber towels were leaving lint all over our son when I dried him off and I hated how the microfiber would stick to any rough spots on my hands. Would definitely recommend this product--great size, super soft, and the little bear ears are adorable. Shipping was very fast, as well! The towel is a little pricey, yes, but it's such a good size that my son should be able to use it for a long time.",

I've found that most towels are only large enough for babies up to about 6 months of age, but not this one! It's plenty large and I expect I'll be able to use it until he's at least 2. This would make a wonderful baby gift as it's nicely packaged and includes a full sized wash cloth as well. Great purchase!",
