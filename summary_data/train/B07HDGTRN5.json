      "text": "This purse is a great size and it is very pretty. From my knowledge of spotting counterfeit purses; I would say that they purse is an authentic COACH purse. I am very happy with my purchase however, there are two things about this purse that are not my favorite. 1.) the \"crossbody\" strap is not made to be used across the body. I would consider it a shoulder strap. A crossbody purse should hit at your hip or a little below NOT the middle of your stomach. The strap should also be a little thicker. 2.) the handles should be a little wider. If would fit on my forearm better. I think that is more of a personal preference though.",
