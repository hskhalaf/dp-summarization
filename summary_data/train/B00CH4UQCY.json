Tub needs to be at least 2 feet from the wall for the filler and shower attachment or the metal handheld attachment bangs against the wall. Looks beautiful in bathroom. Nice center point. One caution- make sure you have a water heater that will allow you to fill the tub without emptying the tank! We are putting in an on demand water heater for the house so I will be able to fill the tub without running out of hot water.",

That said, this tub looks great, fits two full grown adults comfortably, and (contrary to reviews on another site from some cast iron lovers) holds temperature quite well. If you want the look on a budget, this is a great deal.",
