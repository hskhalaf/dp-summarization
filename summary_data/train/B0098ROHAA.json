If I have a big event and I want to look refreshed, I put it on in the morning, leave it for half hour and then apply my makeup. In a few hours, I see a more pulled together firmer face. Lasts for a couple of days. I was going to let L'Oreal know what a gem they have as they probably don't know about it. Wonder what the ingredient is that makes it so.",
