This just floats on top like some cheap vegetable oil. The brand I'm used to mixes well with water and turns the water milky white. This stuff smells wonderful and I guess I can use it straight to kill ants or for hard core cleaning but I don't recommend it for general cleaning purposes because it cant be diluted. I see from other reviews I'm not the only one thats had this problem. I wont be buying this again.",

      "text": "This orange oil didn't smell as strong as some of the others I've had. I use orange oil to fight the ant population in my gardens. What I noticed about this product is that when I make my highly classified recipe I get small white solidified chunks. They look as though I put conditioner in it. It's a clearish liquid in the bottle. This is the first time I've used this brand but I will update as we go along.",

      "text": "I used 1 capful in the laundry and didn't think it smelled as fresh as using vinegar. I bought this to kill fire ants, though. It killed some, but the next day, they were still walking around. I guess I have to break open the hill with a shovel. I was trying to avoid that. Fire ant bites are miserable.",
