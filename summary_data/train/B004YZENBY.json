      "title": "Works well but poorly designed",
      "text": "The grater works well. I have only used the soft cheese side so far but it does a good job of quickly shredding cheddar and similar cheeses. I have two issues with the design. First, there is a rubber frame around the base to keep the grater from sliding. Unfortunately cheese gets in between the rubber frame and the grater's body making it difficult to clean. The frame can be removed but this requires some force and is a bit risky since the grater's surfaces are covered in sharp edges. The second issue is the steel rod that goes around the base of the grater to make it rigid. It is carbon steel rather than stainless. It rusts.",

On the second use I noticed rust flaking off, and had to return this. I'll look more closely at the reviews on other graters, this one was just way too cheaply made.",

I love the rubber base (it makes a difference!!) and I like how I can make home made hashbrowns every morning. I'm on a \"all natural\" diet these days, meaning, I won't eat anything processed at all. I've been eating anything I want as long as if it's REAL, and let me tell you, my home made hashbrowns really are guilt-free! This is a great product, and I use it everyday! UPDATE: 6 years later and this grater is really fantastic! Great quality!!",
