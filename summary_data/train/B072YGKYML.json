      "text": "If you are a very thin woman, this item might not work for you. I say woman because we tend to wear tighter clothes, and due to my lack of stomach fat this item creates an obvious bulge underneath my clothes. Even on the smallest setting, there's a gap between the pouch and my stomach where I can easily stick my hand in, and the belt slides down my waist quite a bit. For reference, my waist measures 26 inches. I measured myself where the moneybelt naturally slid down to without me tucking it into my pants, where I was 28 inches, so if your waist is smaller than that, chances are the belt won't fit well.",

There was no RFID back then, so I hope this RFID works. I realized I put it on backwards, but it was so soft & comfortable that I forgot I had it on for over 2 hours...! I'll continue to wear it that way, with the stiffer mesh on the outside & the soft pockets inside against your middle..",

I purchased this money belt when I planned a trip to France last summer, and it was very reassuring to wear it in comfort carrying extra cash. I don\u2019t normally write reviews, but I was asked by the founder of this company to write a review. However I would not do her the courtesy of writing this review if I didn\u2019t believe in the product. I would recommend this belt to anyone traveling abroad or even for other purposes. The price is write, and its well put together.",

I carry my epi pen, phone, Identification, money and there is a lot of room left.",
