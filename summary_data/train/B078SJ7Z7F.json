      "text": "I purchased these for use when I host board game nights at my place. Obviously due to the nature of cardboard, I needed some tumblers that had to fit several criteria, namely: 1. Screw on lid - no accidental tops popping off if knocked over 2. Lid seals with a rubber washer 3. Straws cannot be removed once inserted correctly, providing more protection against escaping liquid 4. Double-walled to reduce condensation effects 5. Different colors for easier player recognition My only complaint is that at only 16oz, they do not hold a lot of liquid, especially when using ice, so refills are a constant issue. Would be much better if they came in a 32oz size.",

The different colors worked out well because each teacher has a different color. I have a few of these skinny tumblers myself that I use for my water everyday.

They jostle each other in the hall or the cups get knocked off desks so far, no problems. If there is one thing that would be nice to have a couple more of, it would be the cleaning brush.

It felt like Christmas everyone getting to pick their own color which was fun. They don't maintain ice as long as I would have hoped, but it is 90+ degrees behind the line at any given time. They still do well despite that and usually refilled before it matters. 10/10 value.",

One thing to watch out for is they are not leak proof so if the tumblers are full and you move them be mindful of liquid that may drip from the straw hole",

Just something to mention as a heads up. I'd buy these again.",

Sure, they can hold a drink, but sooner or later you\u2019ll wish that cold drink hadn\u2019t gone warm, or left condensation rings all over your surface. Strata Tumblers with their double walls, thermo-regulate your drinks so you can enjoy them down to the last refreshing drop.",
      "\u270512 FUN PARTY COLORS: Got 12 kids? No? You will when you bring these out at parties.

Obviously color-coding is a great way to stop someone stealing your drink, and a must-have for allergy sufferers.",
      "\u2705SPLASH-PROOF LIDS: Most acrylic tumblers come with a rubber push down lid, and when you drop them the lid pops off. Strata Tumblers come with colored screw top lids with tight straw seal.

      "\u2705EASY TO CLEAN: Cracked plastic and water getting into the double walls are real concerns when it comes to cleaning an acrylic tumbler. So our design team solved both problems. Your tumblers are 100% Handwash Only. They also come with a BONUS REUSABLE VINYL NAME TAGS & STRAW CLEANER so you can keep straws free from mold and bacteria.",
      "\u2705SATISFYING TO GRIP: Many people agree skinny tumblers are the most comfortable size to hold. Not only do they feel good, they\u2019re easier for kids, and folks with arthritic hands. Each tumbler is 8.5\u201d high with a 2.5\u201d diameter, and holds 16oz of your favorite beverage. BPA FREE, Non-Toxic."
