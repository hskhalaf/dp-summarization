Called Garmin and tried everything they suggested, they don't make returns easy so I decided it made more sense to buy different brand. Found out from other friends that they had same issue, so again, not sure where all these great reviews come from. It's cheap which is good, but it's cheap so if you want to buy a new one every year, buy it.",

This HRM was quickly recognised by Wahoo Fitness iPhone App on my iPhone 4. I am using Wahoo Fisica attachment for iPhone. I compared my daily workouts with the Timex T5G981 HRM watch and was happy that the calories expended during my workouts were similar. I very satisfied with and highly recommend this HRM with the Wahoo Fitness app and Fisica attachment for iPhone.",
