Granted, the luggage was full and I had my backpack on it, but it blew out a wheel. I\u2019m really surprised beacise it wasn\u2019t that much stress. And, unfortunately, I am 2 days after the return window. Well, I took a chance on an unreviewed item. Reminder to self: don\u2019t do that again.",

My hotel is about a half mile from the office and after three one-way trips one of the wheels popped the rivet out of the plastic holder. The wheels are solid plastic, which is loud, rough on pavement, and not very durable. I bought a replacement set of solid rubber wheels to install. The rest of the suitcase has been ok, but has pretty much met my expectations (except for the wheels). It is cheap, do not buy this for heavy, or even medium travel.",
