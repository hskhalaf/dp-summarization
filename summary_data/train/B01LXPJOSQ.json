I was greatly disappointed with this set, straight out of the box several pieces are dirty with some black sticky grime substance, two of the pieces including the tweezers have the \"real stainless\" coating flaking off. Obviously NOT stainless steel! The nail clippers dont cleanly cut the nail, instead tearing as they cut. I couldn't be more dissatisfied with a product considering it's one of the more expensive sets for sale.",

I used the eyebrow trimmers to clip some thread on clothes that my scissors could not do with a clean cut. Also, the tool to get rid of hang nails (V-shaped cuticle trimmer) is awesome. Never seen on before, but worked flawlessly. LOVE IT!!! Next year I will be giving out these as gifts for Christmas.",

      "text": "Was really pleasantly surprised by this. The build quality is great; good weight and machining to the metal components, not too tight and not loose/soft, cutting surfaces nice and sharp. The case appears to be faux and is a deep purple when you stare at it, but passes for brown leather on a casual glance. Definitely not the normal junk pleather stuff that is usually associated to the cheaper sets. Nice assortment of tools and great value considering the sub $25 sale price. Surely feels like it would stand up to time and use. Definitely on par with the more well known brands such as tweezerman. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend to friends or family.",
