They adored the model for its comfortable feel, pleasing aesthetics, true-to-size fit, plush cushioning, and adequate arch support. That said, not everyone was fascinated with this pair. While some buyers noted that it fit as expected, plenty wrote that it ran too small and narrow for their liking. Naysayers also griped about the inferior materials and inadequate support. Overall, this trainer was considered a cozy and stylish walking shoe, despite its fit and durability issues.",

      "text": "Had a pair of RYKA Ultimate Running shoes for two years and finally needed to replace them. Decided to try the Dominion Walking Shoe. My old RYKAs were a size 9 1/2 and fit perfectly. Ordered the Dominion in the same size and was disappointed by how much smaller and tighter they were than my old pair. Had to send them back. Ordered half a size up (size 10) and am very happy with the fit. These shoes feel so good and supportive in all the right places. I actually like the Dominion much better than my old pair. If questioning whether or not to order up half a size, I'd definitely recommend doing it.",

The toe guard is the same material that the rest of the sneaker is made of. Time will tell if it stands up the wear and tear of every day usage. Otherthan that, the sneakers are very comfortable, look good, and fit perfectly. If there was a different color offered, I would buy a second pair. They definitely live up to the RYKA standard that I am used to.",

At first, I thought the width was a tad bit narrow but the mesh material stretches when you step and my feet have been fine. I also love the memory foam and has been the most cushioned shoe I have worn in a long time. I like this shoe so much I ordered another one in black. If you are looking for comfort and a nice looking shoe this is highly recommended.",

They do have good arch support. I usually wear a size 7M, which is what I bought, but for this style I'd probably need a 7.5 for them to be comfortable out of the box.",
