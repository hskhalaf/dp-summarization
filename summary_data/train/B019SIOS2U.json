      "text": "For reference, I am a perfect size 8.75 if such a thing existed. I ordered these in a size 9 and they are still slightly snug, so I'd recommend ordering 1/2 larger than you normally wear. They are VERY comfy and with wear I've managed to make the size 9 work for me. The footbed is a squishy memory foam which I wasn't expecting. The only complaint I have is that I think they are bit overpriced for what they are. If you can get them on sale though, snatch them up! I would appreciate a \"yes\" click below if you found my review helpful :)",

      "text": "I wear these blowfish flats everyday, and I love them because they are cloth and 'breath' and mold easily to my foot. They don't hurt like leather flats. Since I wear these everyday, they do get worn out pretty quick so I re-order them every 4-6 months. I absolutely love them and I am okay with the wear-n-tear because of the convenience of slipping them on and them looking 'dressy' for work. It's like wearing slippers (almost) to work everyday! Love!",

But they are super cute and I love them! I would give them 5 stars if I didn't have to do the exchange.",
