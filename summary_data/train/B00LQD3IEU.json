Also,the grease also gets on clothes; shirt collars and there is some build up around my suit pans pockets, as well as the places around the waist I use to hoist my pants but again something to be aware of. Overall good stuff, I'll be buying more.",

I did give it a few uses and it offered a decent sheen and a light to medium hold but I just couldn't get over the smell, especially after having spent $20 ( prime even) on a 2 oz. tin of it.

Consistency is a bit too oily or creamy, which is why this product's hold on the beard is a little weak. I've tried worse, so this isn't a bad balm, but it leans towards subpar in my professional opinion. If this company wanted to improve this product, they should thicken it a bit as well as balance out that scent a hair (no pun intended!) haha!",
