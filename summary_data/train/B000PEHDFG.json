Well it looks like it is but really only the bed is metal. The cab, wheels, undercarriage, and well basically everything else is sturdy plastic. Hey, at least it won't rust much right?",

At one point she had this dump truck over flowing with dirt. Just like how I remember playing with them. I just wish I could say the same for the other cranes and tractors.",

So, new 'baby' about 18mos old comes to a reunion party and I remembered the joy my kids had with the BIG truck. This little boy was self entertained for the longest time, having a ball pushing it around, sitting his little diapered bottom in the truck bed and scooting around backwards in it. A big hit, as I knew it would be. I think the product description mentions 'age 3', but my experience in the now (and then) is that Tonka is so well made that they are basically safe for any age.",
