      "text": "I usually like Vionic brand because of the wonderful arch support. The problem was with this particular style was the Velcro. VERY poorly glued on and separated from several of the straps. Walking around Spain with these for 2 weeks and that was the end of them. They were new for the trip--had only worn a few times to break them in. I threw them out before getting on the plane to return home. We had to find a sewing kit to try to tack down the Velcro on the straps so they were temporarily useable. Too late to return the sandals but I will not buy any sandals from this company again with Velcro strap closure.",

      "text": "I love the look of this sandal & it is my first Vionic shoe. The podiatrist recommended this brand. What is great is that very little velcro shows on the straps! Typically, due to my wide foot, quite a bit of velcro shows besides picking up debri in its fibers. I was concerned about the nubs on the insole & it takes some getting used to - my feet are sensitive & it often feels like I have dirt in the sandal. Also the upper sandal portion on the upper foot isn't super soft or comfy, but the support of the shoe is pretty good. I wouldn't use them to walk all day though.",

Be advised if you are buying them for the first time the arch may take a bit to get used to. I have a high arch and these sandals give me the arch support I need.

This particular pair has the added advantage of being fully adjustable and they are SO attractive that I bought two pair in different colors.
