The only negative is that they don't have a zipper so I had to put them on very slowly. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone with a high instep otherwise its all good.",

They were so tiny I couldn't even get my foot into the boot! I wanted them for a trip I was going on, but there wasn't time to return and rebuy. And I also honestly couldn't figure out what size to buy--8 1/2? 9? 9 1/2? It seems ridiculous that I might have to purchase a boot a full two sizes larger than I normally wear. So, order them at least two sizes larger and maybe these beautiful boots will fit you.",

My only complaint and I read other reviewers had this problem as well before I purchased them... They slouch around the ankles like they are too big or loose. I feel like I'm pulling them up a lot which is odd because they aren't loose on my calves at all. (I have 15 inch calves.) Overall I am happy with my purchase.",

Perfect foot and toe room but they did singe at the ankle. Which I hate. They were a great quality boot but a huge let down for me. Hope this is helpful.",

      "text": "I have been looking for a riding boot that isn't bedazzled and buckled for a long time, just classic and timeless, that doesn't look like a pirate boot (because most flat black boots do). These are the perfect boot, BUT if you are wanting to buy them, size down, they fit about a half size big. they also are a little sloppy in the ankle. I wouldn't be wearing these with dresses but they definitely look cute with fall sweaters and blazers. because of the big size and the really wide calf/ankle I have to knock of a star. otherwise they are decent boots, especially for the price. For reference I have 13.5 inch calves.",

Other than that I really wanted to keep the boots but am disappointed that they were not accurately descibed. They are being returned. Feel like I just wasted time & money.",

      "text": "Overall I didn't like these boots all so much and I returned them. First, the size 8.5 was a little tight, and I normally wear 8.5, sometimes 9 in winter boots and I guess these would be one of them. Another thing I didn't like much was that the shaft only reaches just above mid-calf, and I was looking for taller ones. Lastly, I didn't much like the overall bulky style, they are pretty heavy and not very sleek. Pros are that the leather is really nice, I like the shape and style of the shaft, mid way between classy and cowboy, and they would have been very comfortable if they'd fit. I could tell the sole is soft.",
