I regularly run quite a few windows at the same time and haven\u2019t had any problems yet. Only thing negative I can say is that the touchpad is a little finicky and I wish it had a backlit keyboard (my fault for not researching it enough). I use this with a docking station so the touchpad is not really an issue though.",
