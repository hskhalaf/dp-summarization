If needed, it would even fit under my kitchen cabinets (but I like having it on the outside edge of the countertop). VERY useful & it looks great; the picture doesn't do it justice. I've just posted a photo, so you can see it in a \"Real World\" setting. Love it; highly recommended for its quality AND the terrific price. Very happy! P.S. I added stick-on felt pads to the bottom of each foot. Keeps it quiet & protects my countertop.",

Our mug tree sits right beside our one cup coffee maker and does it's job wonderfully. Holds the mugs with enough room between them so they don't touch one another and thereby cause any breakage, is very sturdy and doesn't take up to much countertop room. Pretty darn cute too. All in all a great mug tree and I'm very happy with my purchase.",
