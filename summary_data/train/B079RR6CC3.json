The Katee hay being sold here on Amazon is not the same quality I was getting in the pet store.This hay is being produced in Canada, and its just awful. Most of it is unusable dust and what's left is small pieces. My rabbits will eat some of it but most of it ends up getting thrown out.",

While there are still a few tough, inedible pieces in it (nothing's perfect, after all), the pigs eat the vast majority of it, and seem to really enjoy it. Trust me, you'll be much better off with Oxbow than this Kaytee garbage.",

Not only a waste of money, but also the pigs have been starving & I hadn't understood why, until now; they have new aggressive behaviors we have to address since starting this bag of food.

I didn\u2019t have any problems with finding rocks or any other objects in the hay, but there definitely was a lot of dust in the bag. It does work fine for piggies though.",

      "text": "I've always liked this hay, and my bunny has loved it. This time, I ordered two 96oz bags of it, and both are the worst quality I've ever seen from Kaytee by far. My bunny will barely eat it because it's so short and dusty. I wish I could contact Kaytee to ask for different hay, but with all these other negative reviews, it doesn't seem likely they'd do anything about it.",
