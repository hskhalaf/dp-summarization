The blown air is a very thin line which might be good or bad depending on preference. It's not a wide blast area. like many other fans.",

It came completely assembled and ready to plug in. I love the sleek nearly invisible design. It can fit anywhere. It has 6 levels of fan power, you can choose rotation or not, you can set a timer, and best of all, there is a feature to lower the fan noise when sleeping. I really like that a lot since I use this in my bedroom. Highly recommend both for form and function.",
