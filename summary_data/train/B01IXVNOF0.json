Those who are looking for a footgear that grants instant yet lasting comfort, supportive build and precise fit will surely like this offering. It, however, was reported having a flimsy sole. All in all, the Zamberlan 1996 Vioz Lux GTX RR can overcome tough and demanding terrain; its sole might not be able to take such beating though.",

There was a bit of noise from the leather uppers on these over the older Vioz GTX models but now that I've worn them a bit the noise is gone. I think the toe guards are a great addition and will help keep the boots looking better longer. Bottom line I love them just like the older Vioz GTX model.",

You can step onto the point of a rock and the arch can take your full weight and distributes the pressure away from the center of your foot. (I had to test it.) Thick leather, reinforced toe. The tongue is incorporated in such a way that water and debris never get into the boot. Worth. Every. Penny.",

Waxed Tuscan Full-Grain Leather Upper The upper of the Zamberlan 1996 Vioz Lux GORE-TEX Walking Boots are constructed with the upgraded Waxed Tuscan full-grain leather which is rich and long-lasting. The leathers are enhanced with Zamberlan's proprietary Hydrobloc treatment for added water resistance and durability over time. Made with GORE-TEX Performance Comfort Footwear, it ensures the shoes engineered with this are designed for outdoor use in moderate weather conditions. They combine durable waterproofness and optimised breathability, offering enduring waterproof protection and optimised climate comfort. Water stays on the outside while perspiration can easily escape from the inside. Thanks to their innovative construction they are an ideal solution for the widest range of outdoor activities and changing weather conditions. Designed with new calf-leather lined collars, it adds durability while ensuring maximum comfort around the upper ankle, reducing the risk of chafing and discomfort. Get the feel of a leather-lined boot without compromising on waterproof performance. For additional durability on the upper, high resistance treated hardware allows for an extended life without corrosion with added durability against rocks and debris, and easy passing of laces towards preventing breakage. The PU coated rubber toe rands also adds durability to the boot and life to the leather uppers, especially above the toe bump. The upper also ensures the wearer with maximum comfort and flexibility thanks to the ZFS (Zamberlan Flex System) which describes the unique multi-directional joint that offers great lateral support, comfort and freedom of movement of the ankle and overall stability. The boot upper flexes exactly trailing the natural foot and lower leg movement, giving lots of lat",
