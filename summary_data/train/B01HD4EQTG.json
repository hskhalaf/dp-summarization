No more issues with the chuck (blade) coming loose, which requires regular wrenching with a hex key. No more lost hex keys, its not needed. The supplied blade seems more robust, it did not dull while accidentally cutting through a nail. I like the carry case, compared to the black fabric bag supplied with the RK510. The blades on the bottom were camouflaged, had to dump the contents to know what was in the bag. This Sonicrafter is a winner in my book.",

    "title": "Rockwell RK5151K 4.2 Amp Sonicrafter F80 Oscillating Multi-Tool with Duotech Oscillation Angle Technology. 12 Piece Kit includes 10 Accessories, Carrying Bag, and Oscillating Tool",
    "description": "Style:Oscillating KitThe new Rockwell Duotech Oscillation Sonicrafter F80 is the first oscillating multi-tool that provides a choice of two oscillating angles: 5.0 o and 3.4 o. Users can choose the 5.0 o oscillating angle when projects require fast, aggressive cuts and quicker results, or the 3.4o angle for precision and continuous control. The versatile F80 works harder and faster than any other multi-tool, while enabling the user to choose the oscillating angle that best suits the job at hand. The handcrafted F80 can be used at a 5.0o oscillating angle with an end-cut blade to make short work of cross-cutting, ripping or making plunge-cuts in wood. Trim doorjambs or cut PVC. Then switch to the 3.4o angle to clip nail heads or cut metal pipe. Or using a rigid scraper blade, remove blistered paint, take rust from bare metal for priming or scrape and remove hardened caulk or adhesives. Clamp on a carbide grit semicircular blade to grind old grout from between floor or wall tiles. The cutting speed of the handcrafted F80 is five times faster than the basic Sonicrafter F50 (RK5121K). The F80, with an industry-leading maximum cutting load of 35 lbs. of force, can be pushed harder than any other multi-tool without stalling the blade.",
