I think if I were more patient and used a model that cured longer, that wouldn't be a problem. But I'm time-compressed, so I'm willing to deal with the stinging.",

No more partially cured nails or having to turn your fingers on the sides to cure the edges. Love this light. 5, 20 and 30 second timer. I do with it was 5, 30 and 60 seconds though. I need the longer cure time for a no wipe top coat. Bottom is removable for cleaning.",
