Assembly is quick and the unit is light enough in weight to be moved easily, by one person. I have mine tucked in a corner of my Studio Apartment bathroom and it is more than adequate for some linens and bathroom items but still leaves ample room to move around the bath.

What I put in my cart said that it was a 2-Pack. $64 for one is a nice price for a nice piece of furniture. It is not a high-quality enough piece to be worth $127. If you're paying between $60-70 this is a sturdy unit that looks very nice and has *great* assembly instructions.",

      "text": "It's good for what it is: an extra set of drawers. I wouldn't make this my main drawer though; they don't slide out as smoothly as one would like. The basket drawers themselves seem to be pretty sturdy so I don't expect them to fall apart too soon. The drawers can still slip out of the frame if you're not careful. We put them in a vacation house and it's great for that occasional use. Overall not a bad item.",

They are all better wicker quality with the threads evenly spaced, no exposed ends and has unified coloring. Plus, they are little to no assemble. Though you don't always have the selection at Hobby Lobby since the furniture is not available June-Dec. to make way for x-mas items. I am keeping this unit, since I already assembled it and it is going in a less prominent area of the house.",
