Update: after two weeks, I no longer have to trick him to get him to eat cubes. Now he turns his head at any live bugs with the exception of roaches.

The only drawback is the color because bearded dragons are enticed by certain colors when it comes to food and this is definitely not one of those colors.",

My dragon really enjoyed the grub pie when it was warm and fresh but once it was refrigerated, he would not eat it at all. I still have half a bottle, so I plan to try to make it again and warm it up for him each serving. I am hoping that helps, because it is a little pricey.",

Also makes a good mix in to powdered gecko diets for a protein boost. You can also mix with water to make a slurry for syringe feeding any reptiles that need a nutritional boost.",

What's nice is you can modify your mixture to be more or less watery depending on your need, spanning from milkshake consistency to be fed by syringe if the animal is ill, to a wobbly gelatin (my beardie's favorite), to more fudge-like. This works best as a treat. At least in my beardie, it results in very smelly poops if he has too much.",
