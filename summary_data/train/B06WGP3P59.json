Really sad, as the shell is heavy duty, but the engineer / designer did not reinforce the part of the bag that gets the most impact and 'carries' the weight. FYI - did not over-stuff or abuse the bag, and stuck to 98% smooth roads. Wish I could get my money back. Also bought a rock bros saddle cover that is also ripping at the seams due to poor / incorrectly placed stitching.",

I strap my bike to the back of my brothers Jeep to get up the mountain or to work and I never have to worry about it. It's a good bag. I haven't had any zipper, Velcro, or waterproofing problems and I've rode in some rough weather. Good bag. I got the largest size. If you ride a more upright posture consider a smaller size as you might get some leg rub. The lower your saddle height the smaller size you should get.",

This bag appear to be much better than my previous bag. So far I have had this bag for a week, I hope this bag is durable.",

Pros: No swaying, waterproof 9/10, plenty of space Small amount of water gets through bag and zipper closure- not that big of a deal, just put some wax or waterproofing spray on. I am able to fit multitool, spare tube, other tools, and granola bar in it. Cons: concerned about silicone attachment. Attaches bottom bag to seat post. Ships with extra band in case one breaks. Eventually, it will probably oxidize and snap. Not too concerned - if it breaks, bag can hang on with velcro straps. Would be easy to make own band.",
