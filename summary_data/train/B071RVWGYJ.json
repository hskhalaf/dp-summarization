I decided to go with this salmon oil so she can enjoy her kibbles a bit more. And ill tell ya, she loves this stuff, and so does her pelt. I noticed shes alot shinier and she looks lean but very solid. And shes much more active she loves to play. Before giving her this salmon oil she was more into her naps more than anything. Now she much more active and she reminds me of when she was a kitten full of energy. 5 stars all day.",

The long story short, for the last month and a half, my old dog is able to walk again and stand by himself but best of all; he's not using pain killers anymore. An excellent alternative other than chemicals and pain killers. Highly recommended.",

So... this product review is more for the inconvenience as opposed to how it actually works-- I'm sticking with the salmon oil pills I get from the vet to put in my dog's food to help his skin and coat for the convenience factor, even though this was half the price.",

Even though a bigger bottle would be cheaper, I've bought small bottles to make sure they don't get old and go bad. Also the bottle leaks so bad I think the refrigerator shelf gets as much oil as the cats. I switched to another brand and the cats are eating normal again.",

So I started giving her about half a pump of this stuff with her wet food twice a day. She seems to like it just fine, she's eating the same amount of food so it must not taste bad. Anyway now 5 weeks later I would say her fur is noticeably a bit smoother/silkier and we are getting fewer knots. So I would recommend this product for sure and will order more when this bottle runs out.",

The bad news is that it didn't agree with her and she wound up throwing up with a frequency and volume not seen before. We would back off the salmon oil and she would get better within a day.
