I packed myou bag as full as I possibly could and the zipper held strong. The wheels were a dream, they made it so easy to push along the narrow isles on the plane. The shell of the suitcase is just as strong and durable. I would recommend this bag to anyone looking for a good quality yet still affordable bag.",

It's probably a bit small for trips greater than 5 days in duration but that's the price you pay for a smaller style carry-on -- it's not rocket science. Besides, 95% of us over-pack anyways.

I like it except for one design flaw. 2 little tap screws hold the plastic handle to the extension bars. The screws work loose and get lost. If you tighten them they tend to strip their holes easily. I've asked for replacement screws or a replacement case - we'll see about the response. For this case when new, I recommend a little glue in the screw holes - careful not to over-tighten - as a preventative. Update: The manufacturer replied to an email about the problem and is sending a replacement for the bag. Great, rapid service!",

Within six months (about 10 trips) the pop up handle plastic weakened and broke, rendering the bag useless. I'm going back to a Samsonite.",

Other than that, I highly recommend this durable, small-but-not-too-small, roller-bag.",

I don't carry around weights, or really much of anything other than clothes. Don't get me wrong, it's adorable and fits a ton. If it lasted, it would get 5 stars, but instead, here we are.

Fairly smooth, but definitely not as good as 8 wheels, and I don't foresee the wheels lasting too long. However, for the price and convenience of the purchase, I'm happy with it.

      "text": "My wife and I recently traveled to Cancun and returned. Going through the airport was a breeze. I controlled 2 of them with carry-on bags attached to the handles. I had no problem securing them, retrieving them from the luggage area and packing and unpacking them. Although I watched them being treated roughly there and back, they traveled perfectly (no dents, dings or gouges). I did place straps on them as an assist as I have seen how they are handled. Going to be traveling again soon and look forward to using them again. Great investment.",
