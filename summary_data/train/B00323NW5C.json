Since using the product I've had more energy, have avoided getting the cold/flu and am no longer getting the blue (down) days that I sometimes had in the past. I've also recommended this product to a couple close friends and they have made similar statements. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product to someone looking for a good all around vitamin supplement.",

It arrived in 2 days from Amazon. I started taking 2 in the morning and 2 in the afternoon. I haven't noticed any great changes in my health or energy levels. However, I like the fact that it hasn't changed my urine to neon yellow. Which means I must be absorbing most of it. I highly recommend Garden of Life's products and have already reorded from them.",
