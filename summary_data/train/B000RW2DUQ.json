This is a metal pedal, sounds like Pantera the way I use it...By the number of reviews my opinion should be pointless, But for 25 its a five star, ONE STAR SHOULD BE knocked for the color and plastic casing,But at $25 I feel like a jerk for even thinking that OOOOverall I will be picking up a few more Behringer pedals in the future, I do believe~~~~ Also picked up their EQ pedal, its nice but not familiar with it to give an opinion yet",

More punchier gain with everything set to 12 o\u2019clock. FYI for active pickups use a little less level and distortion and you won\u2019t feedback so much. Yes it\u2019s plastic... but who cares. You can buy two of these for the price of a DS-1, and 4 for the price of a MT-2. Who jumps on their pedals anyways. Worth it. Don\u2019t hesitate. It\u2019s more of a Magenta, not Hot Pink according to the pics.",

I adjusted the level and that helped but my line 6 amplifi 150 distortion sounds much better coupled with the built in effects. This is still a great quality pedal and the price point is incredible for what u get. I think this pedal would kick ass with the behringer eq pedal. Definitely has some balls to it tho and would make a good addition to someone's pedal board or a stand alone distortion stomp.",

However with the lower price comes some short comings. The housing is entirely plastic except for a metal plate on the bottom of the pedal housing to give it weight. I don't feel it will break with casual and light use, i don't suggest really giving it a good stomp on stage. If your gentle and within reason of the build quality, it can and will last a long time. The sound can be dialed in with relative ease and the sound produced i have no complaints about.",

Also be sure to add a power supply if you dont already have one. It wont take long to drain the battery ( about 12 hours) and by the time you purchase 4 9v batteries you are already at the price point of a power supply.",

I recommend using the gain less than halfway and treble non existent to get a little warmth and to preserve dynamics. Solid design and feel for being plastic. Definitely a good buy but now that I have my crate flexwave half stack with foot switch I no longer use this. Will be buying the behringer noise suppressor now that I know this stuff isnt junk. :)",

I checked the adapter on another product, and it worked fine -- so the Behringer was the issue. I would also note that you supposedly can use a 9v battery -- but to do that would be a major operation since there is no battery door , and you have to take the thing apart to get to where the battery probably would go. I say \"probably\" because there are no instructions how to do that. You're pretty much on your own with this one -- assuming you get lucky and get one that works.",

With the UM300 ULTRA METAL, you not only get take control of the Mids, you micromanage them! \n\nMETAL TO THE MAX\nThe UM300 effects pedal gives you the most extreme, sought-after hard rock and heavy metal sounds with super-thick, tube-like distortion - plus virtually endless sustain. \n\nTHE ART OF TONE\nLike most distortion stomp boxes, the UM300 comes with DISTORTION and LEVEL controls. And the HIGH and LOW controls let you dial in the amount of top-end and bottom you desire. But the similarity to other stomps ends right there. Much like our world-class mixing consoles, we've given the UM300 a MID FREQ control, allowing you to select a midrange frequency (from 200 Hz to 5 kHz) and boost/cut it by up to 15 dB (that's a lot!). What this means, in terms of tone, is thick, tube-like distortion with endless sustain, for everything from aggressive, traditional metal assaults to bone-crunching mayhem. \n\nA bright blue LED tells you when the UM300 is active, while a top-quality on/off switch maintains highest signal integrity in bypass mode. You can power the UM300 with our PSU-SB DC power supply (not included), or pop in a 9 V battery. \n\nMASSIVE IN THE MIDDLE\nIs there a hole in the middle of your tone? You'll be surprised how affordably and efficiently the ULTRA METAL UM300 can fill that void. See your BEHRINGER dealer today.",
