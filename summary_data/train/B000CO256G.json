The only time it isn't so easy to use is opening small jars, because it's difficult to get a grip on the jar itself so you can use force on the lid. Still, it's awesome, highly recommend it.",

I have rheumatoid arthritis in my wrists and hands, so have tried many other types of openers but always ended up asking my husband to open jars before I bought this gripper.

    "description": "Color:WhiteSay goodbye to the struggle and strain of opening stubborn jars and bottles thanks to the Swiss-designed Gripper Jar Opener from Kuhn Rikon. The adjustable mechanism locks securely onto lids and caps (and won\u2019t let go!) via a clockwise turn of the front-facing knob. Lids are then released by twisting the opener in the opposite direction. As well as being extremely easy to use, the device is also highly versatile: it will remove any lid or cap between 1 and 3.5 inches in diameter and is suitable for threaded, smooth-sided and grooved jars/caps.",
