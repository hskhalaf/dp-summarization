A General Contractor for 35 years, I\u2019ve ran every compactor since1968 and this compactor is legit. Someone gave it 1 star because of the gas cap. I had no problem fueling it with a FIVE gallon can with a big spout. Just finished a 5 hr nonstop session, same performance of the $2500 model I use. I\u2019m going to buy 2 more. If it breaks I\u2019ll edit this review, but it is built pretty well for the money. Buy it, I\u2019m glad I did!",

It does not like powdery soil. It bogs a bit. I am using mine on a section of road base. Does a fine job. It said that it is not recommended on clay soils. I have a section of clay I am going to use it on. I will just have to work with it. Starts easily. Just like anything else that shakes a lot. You need to check the bolts once in a while. Oil fills faster than expected. I do like this compactor.",

So now I have a machine that won\u2019t work, a rock patio that still needs to be compacted, a hot tub sitting in my driveway because it can\u2019t go in the yard until the patio is done, and no idea what I\u2019m going to do.

Lastly the throttle control is a joke at best . From 0-50% rpm, there is no vibration at all. From 50-75% throttle is where the vibration is variable, but not by much.

I only have 1 hour on the unit. the clutch bearing seal has failed, and coated the clutch shoes with grease. the clutch does not engage, just slips. I used brake cleaner to clean the clutch shoes and clutch drum. I was able to use for 20 more minutes and the clutch started slipping again. I am going to contact wen in hopes of receiving a replacement clutch. jason",

      "text": "The compactor was crated well and delivery was timely. The compactor uncrated and assembled easily. The instructions say to add 20 oz. of oil, but it only took 16 oz., which caused for spillage from overfilling and oil had to be drained down to appropriate level. The compactor fired right up on first pull and runs like a champ. The compaction power is great, but the plate edges do leave a rut which requires going back to rake the materials back out. This product is a great value for the price.",

    "description": "Style:DiscontinuedForget about spending money to rent a plate compactor. With a price this good and equipment this reliable, buying a compactor for the job site has never made more sense. A must have tool for anyone working on walkways, patios, paver installations, landscaping or small asphalt projects. Powerful 212cc/7hp engine delivers 4,496lbs of force at 5,400 blows per minute, increasing the density of loose granular soils, gravel, sand, crushed aggregate and other mediums into a sound, level foundation. This type of foundation extends the life of your project as it reduces water seepage, swelling and expansion. Our unique swing-over handle makes it easy to maneuver around the work area even in narrow, cramped spaces. Our engine features an angled combustion chamber (for more power per displacement), a pull recoil start and a low-oil shutdown to protect the engine. Vibration isolators between the welded steel plate and the engine reduce vibration, extending the engine's life. High density foam in the handles also reduces vibration to the user. One-gallon fuel tank provides ample work time. Tough powder coat finish keeps the product rust free. One-year limited warranty, 90 day commercial.",
