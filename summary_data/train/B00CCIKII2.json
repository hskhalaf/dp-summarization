My daughter got this when she was one, and I've gifted to several little ones since because it's probably her favorite toy overall and she's almost 2 now. When other kids come over, even 4 and 5 year olds, they gravitate right to the teapot and the cake. It's really cute. Here and there we hide toys and get them back out reintroducing them to our daughter and when we do it with this, she'll play with this for over a week straight when she sees it again.",

Several times a week my ten-year-old daughter will also join in and the three of them will have a big Tea Party. Complete with lights and sounds. It is a great toy for them all to grow up with. I am surprised to see that many people bought this for younger children too.",

That was charming; I'm sure all mail carriers got a kick from that. I forwarded this to my granddaughter for a 1st birthday gift, and that's a little young. But my son & daughter-in-law say it's enjoyed by all of them: colorful, durable, voice and sound effects (gurgling water sounds in pot) appropriate for a tea party. Tea pot voices references to the different colors and fruits depicted on each of the 6 cake slices - educational and promotes hand-eye coordination.",

The tea in the kettle appears to rock back in forth like it has liquid inside. You can lift the lid and see reflection. You also press the heart to refill the tea. My daughter's favorite feature is the pouring sound it makes when you pour the tea into a cup. I love the colored slices of pie as she learns her colors. Highly recommend for toddlers who love to make believe.",

It sings a ton of songs, and the lights move when you pour like there is real water in the pot. Makes a water pouring noise when you tip the pot. Reminds me of the Fisher Price one but does more. I'd recommend highly.",
