This peel is perfect for smaller type pizza.",

Maybe I wanted to see if I could burn/sear/singe every finger and most of the hairs on my arms first before wising up and purchasing the best one I could find. I have used it twice and it is great! Also, it is too attractive to hide in a cabinet, we have ours hanging on the wall near the oven. The only downside are the flashbacks I get from trips to the asst. principal's office in high school...he had something similar hanging on his wall. I highly recommend this product!",

If the pizza peel is couple inches larger, my rating would have been 5 stars. If your pizza is 12 inches or smaller, then this pizza peel works well for you.

As for maneuverability, I gave 4 stars because it\u2019s fairly heavy so you need to be very careful once a loaded pizza is on it. But that also reflects upon its sturdiness. I washed with only hot water and a sponge....no soap which could be absorbed.....Overall, a 5-star product",

      "text": "Really great peel! The quality is excellent, as is the customer service. They reached out to me to make sure everything was going well, and I responded with a couple questions. They were quick to reply and were very helpful and considerate. I've been able to use the peel a couple times already, and it definitely makes my life easier when dealing with the super hot oven and pizza stone. Pizza slides in easily, and I have one side of the board dedicated to taking the pizza out as well as slicing the pizza on. I'm looking forward to improving my pizza making skills, and using this peel more.",

The size I had ordered was no longer available, but they offered to send me the extra-large peel as a replacement. It is perfect! It is a beautiful product that will also serve as a meat and cheese or fruit serving platter. I was extremely impressed with their exemplary customer service. Definitely order from Pizza Royale if you are looking for a pizza peel. You will be extremely pleased with both the product and the company.",

The peel is an attractive and easy to clean bamboo. Anticipate many years of homemade family pizzas, flatbread, and Naan!",

Peel is aesthetically pleasing too, looks great hanging on my kitchen. It will also make a wonderful cheeseboard. I feel as if I got my $$ worth, and that is a rate thing these days. If you make pizza at home, or get take and bake, I highly, highly recommend. Great, great product.",
