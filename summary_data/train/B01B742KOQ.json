The shale stone ground down the sharp edges a bit but none of the spike bent and still grabbed the snow and ice as needed. I wouldn\u2019t go ice climbing with them but for secure footing on a steep winter hike, they were great!",

So I kept my crampons on while stepping on the rocks. I've done this on microspikes without having a problem. However these crampons ground down almost completely.
