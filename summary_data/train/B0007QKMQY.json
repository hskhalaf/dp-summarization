The camera was clean and free of dust as well as the kit lenses. Everything operates as it should. Everything came that was in the description. It takes a really nice picture. With addition of a few other used canon lenses useful for a beginner, she has a nice gear set that she can grow with. Lot less expensive than a new game system.",

It says that it uses relatively little power when the camera goes to sleep but it seems like my battery drains super fast. I use it for 10-15 minutes and then turn it off. I can do that 2-4 times before the battery shows that it's almost gone. Am I doing something wrong?

Canon has reduced the construction quality somewhat - more plastic - but for the price, this is a great machine. I paid Can $ 1100 for my XT body in May of 2005, and now you can buy it with 18-55 lens for $450! Great value. Buying it from Amazon was really easy. It came in days.",

Easy to use, simplistic design, sturdy, reliable, and still produces professional quality pictures. I must admit that the options and settings that are available are a bit much for me but the cameras auto selection takes excellent pics until you figure it all out. I HIGHLY recommend this camera to anyone that is looking to get started in photography.",

For starters, the default automatic settings give excellent results in most cases. Colors are vivid, white balance is spot on, and automatic ISO selection is OK. For the real enthusiast, the multitude of options gives something for nearly every situation. As with any DSLR, shot composition is done exclusively through the viewfinder. This is not a limitation once you realize the advantages of optical correctness in shot composition. The RAW output comes in handy for print use of the shots. Overall, a great buy!",

      "text": "I have been looking forward to getting a digital SLR for a long time. This camera was everything I expected it to be, and more. It starts up quickly and can easily take 2-3 pictures a second. I have small children who don't tend to sit still too long, so that was a big plus for me. The quality is awesome. The other aspect that I'm extremely impressed with is the battery life. There's not much more I can say that hasn't already been said. I highly recommend this camera.",

    "title": "Canon Digital Rebel XT DSLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Lens (Silver-OLD MODEL)",
    "description": "Style:Camera w/ Lens (Silver)| Product Packaging:Standard PackagingFor an uncompromising mix of ease of use, affordability and outstanding features, look no further than the Canon Digital Rebel XT. Featuring an 8.0 Megapixel CMOS sensor, Canon's DIGIC II Image Processor, and compatibility with over 50 EF Lenses, this digital SLR offers outstanding performance for both the serious photographer and the weekend photographer who just wants to take great pictures.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nFor an uncompromising mix of ease of use, affordability and outstanding features, look no further than the Canon Digital Rebel XT. Featuring an 8.0 Megapixel CMOS sensor, Canon's DIGIC II Image Processor, and compatibility with over 50 EF Lenses, this digital SLR offers outstanding performance for both the serious photographer and the weekend photographer who just wants to take great pictures.\n\n \n\n\n\nAll controls and displays are right where you need them. \n\nThe camera is compatible with over 50 EF lenses. View larger. \n\nCompactFlash card slot. \n\nEasy-to-navigate menus. For starters, the Rebel XT delivers 3,456 x 2,304-pixel images for images of 13x19 inches and larger. The camera features variable ISO -- 100, 200, 400, 800 and 1,600 settings -- and supports all Canon EOS series lenses. An optical viewfinder provides detailed information such as diopter adjustment and depth-of-field preview, while the 1.8-inch TFT LCD view finder offers a wealth of additional information as well as several playback features, including thumbnail view and zooming to 10x magnification. Backlit with five level settings for brightness, the viewfinder is easy to read in dark environments. While the Rebel XT is compatible with all Canon lenses in the EF lineup -- ranging from ultra-wide-angle to super-telephoto lenses --, the camera includes the Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 lens. This 18-55mm is a standard zoom designed exclusively for the Digital Rebel and features optimized coating to minimize ghost images and flare. \n\n If action photography is your specialty, the Rebel XT offers a continuous shooting mode that captures as many as 14 images as fast as three frames per second (with shutter speeds of 1/250 second or faster.) The camera offers a shutter speed range from 1/4,000 to 30 seconds, and a bulb x-sync at 1/200 seconds. Best of all, it features an ultra-fast 0.2 seconds startup time, a shutter release lag of 100 milliseconds, and viewfinder blackout time of 175 milliseconds -- all of which means that you'll always be on top of the action.\n\n Despite its wealth of advanced features, the Rebel XT is also one of the easiest, and most user-friendly digital SLRs you'll find anywhere. Its compact design -- 4.98 x 3.71 x 2.63 inches (W x H x D) -- and weight (less than two pounds) means that the camera body will fit snugly in your hands. The EOS Digital Rebel XT has a newly developed high-precision seven-point autofocus (AF) system for speedy and accurate focusing in any situation. You can easily choose your own point of focus or direct the camera to choose it automatically. You can even use predictive AF to ensure that moving subjects stay focused while you compose your shot. With a built-in dioptric adjustment mechanism and a new precision matte screen, achieving sharp focus is fast and easy with the Rebel XT, no matter where or when you're taking pictures.\n\n A number of additional automatic setting and shooting modes -- including Portrait, Landscape, Close-up, Sports, Night Portrait, and Flash Off -- allows you to concentrate on your subject and leave the camera to sort out the details. A redeye reduction via a built-in illuminator keeps your face shots on track, and USB 2.0 connectivity for both PC and Macintosh lets you upload your images with ease and without the need for additional software. The camera also supports direct printing with PictBridge compatible printers. In short, the Rebel XT is the ideal digital SLR choice for both the serious photographer who demands the ultimate in high-quality features, as well as the weekend picture taker who demands the ultimate in affordability and convenience. \n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe Canon EOS Digital Rebel camera now has a new, faster, and even smaller big brother. Sibling rivalries aside, the 8.0-megapixel Canon EOS Digital Rebel XT SLR adds resolution, speed, extra creative control, and enhanced comfort in the hand to one of the smallest and lightest digital cameras in its class. Despite its advancements in ergonomic design and technology, this easy-to-use EOS digital camera is compatible with all of Canon's EF lenses including the EF-S lenses.\n\n Rebel Without a Choice No More\nThe EOS Digital Rebel XT camera takes its place alongside the original 6.3 MP EOS Digital Rebel camera that first placed an affordable, high-resolution digital SLR into the hands of Canon consumers. The EOS Digital Rebel XT model is offered in two kit configurations: With Canon's high-quality EF-S 18-55mm f3.5-f5.6 zoom lens (in matte black and in brushed silver) and as a body only (in matte black and in brushed silver).\n\n \n\nThe Rebel XT's image sensor has the same 3:2 ratio as film cameras, creating an effective angle of view that is 1.6 times the normal EF lens' focal length. While many of the feature advancements and innovations on the new EOS Digital Rebel XT digital camera are inherited from Canon's EOS 20D \"prosumer\" SLR, the two cameras' most striking technological similarities are their use of Canon's newly developed, large-single-plate, high-sensitivity, high-resolution color CMOS imaging sensor technology. While the size of the APS-C CMOS sensor on the EOS Digital Rebel XT SLR is fractionally smaller than the APS-C CMOS sensor on the EOS 20D camera (22.2 x 14.8 millimeters versus 22.5 x 15.0 millimeters, respectively) accounting in part for the cameras' 8.0- vs. 8.2-megapixel resolution rating, individual pixel dimensions are identical, and they both provide the same effective angle of view, equivalent to 1.6x the normal EF lens focal length. There are, of course, some very real differences between the EOS Digital Rebel XT digital camera and the more advanced EOS 20D. While the 20D SLR includes performance features such as faster continuous shooting speed (5 frames per second [fps] vs. 3 fps) with larger burst capability (23 frames vs. 14 frames) and custom function settings (18 vs. 9) that more than justify its heftier price tag, this new Rebel XT model was created for those dedicated SLR users who are migrating to digital for the first time and don't wish to give up the flexibility an SLR system offers.\n\n \n\nChoose a single point of focus or predictive autofocus, or direct the camera to make the determination using its 7-point AF system. Autofocus Made Easy\nUtilizing the same 7-point autofocus system as the EOS Digital Rebel camera, the new EOS Digital Rebel XT SLR is capable of analyzing where a subject is--even when it is off center--and almost immediately bringing it into focus. It can also analyze subject movement and automatically select locking or tracking AF modes as needed. These features simplify the camera's operation and optimize its performance. The Digital Rebel XT allows users to select locking or tacking AF modes independently, adding a new dimension of creative control. Finer Photos Faster\nThe new EOS Digital Rebel XT digital camera can shoot up to 14 consecutive large/fine (8.0-megapixel) JPEGs, five RAW files, or four RAW + large/fine JPEGs at a rate of up to 3 fps. The EOS Digital Rebel camera's smaller buffer permits bursts of only four large/fine (6.3-megapixel) JPEG or RAW frames at a rate of up to 2.5 fps.\n\n While reprising the Digital Rebel SLR's ISO range of 100, 200, 400, 800, and 1600, Canon raised the Auto ISO setting on the Digital Rebel XT model to 400 to help improve image quality, reduce camera shake, and brighten the scene behind the subject when taking a flash photo. The new Digital Rebel XT camera also offers 12 exposure modes that are user selectable at the turn of a conveniently placed dial. The exposure modes--Full Auto, Portrait, Landscape, Close-up, Sports, Night Portrait, Flash Off, Program AE, Shutter Speed-Priority AE, Aperture-Priority AE, Manual and Auto Depth-of-Field AE--take into account virtually all shooting conditions and preferences.\n\n In addition to its lossless compression 8.0-megapixel RAW image file option, the Rebel XT Digital SLR offers users the option of shooting in a range of sizes and quality JPEG settings from large (8.o-megapixel) and medium (4.15-megapixel) to small (2.0-megapixel). Within each resolution option, the user may also select quality settings: Large/fine, large/normal, medium/fine, medium/normal, small/fine, and small/normal.\n\n RAW Power\nWhat's more, where the original Digital Rebel camera required dedicated software to extract embedded medium/fine resolution JPEGs from the larger, uncompressed RAW image file, the new Rebel XT model saves RAW and large/fine resolution images as separate files on the Compact Flash card. The user also has the option of selecting RAW (8.0-megapixel) files only, saving valuable space on the CF card. As with the EOS 20D, the Digital Rebel XT camera's RAW files are denoted by the CR2 extension.\n\n Creative Control\nAmong the new features found on the EOS Digital Rebel XT camera are user-selectable metering and AF modes, flash exposure compensation control, improved E-TTL II evaluative flash metering, and for the first time in this product category, custom function control. The Digital Rebel XT SLR even offers a monochrome mode for consumers who enjoy the subtleties and shadings that only black-and-white images offer.\n\n The Rebel XT camera incorporates nine of the Custom Functions previously found on the EOS 20D model. Designed to fine-tune camera operation according to personal preferences, the custom functions offer users a set of programming options for the SET button/cross keys, as well as control over long exposure noise reduction, flash sync speed in AV mode, AF start from the shutter button or AE lock button, AF assist beam, mirror lockup, E-TTL II metering patterns, and shutter curtain sync.\n\n All This and DIGIC II\nCanon's newest and most powerful SLR imaging engine, DIGIC II, provides high precision and high speed, natural color reproduction including high saturation, bright subjects, improved auto white balance, and increased white balance correction control and white balance bracketing over the original Digital Rebel camera.\n\n The white balance correction control is a digital color filter that works like a light-balancing filter or a color-compensating filter. Both the blue/amber bias and the magenta/green bias can be adjusted to +/- 9 levels. While the blue/amber bias adjustment is standard on the original Digital Rebel model, the Rebel XT camera's additional magenta/green bias adjustment provides increased color compensation from the earlier model.\n\n \n\nThe XT's DIGIC II image processor ensures natural colors, accurate white balance, and speedy write times. The Rebel XT SLR's white balance bracketing mode enables the camera to automatically take three images for every shot snapped, each with a different bias setting. The user can then select the best shot and discard the other two. White balance bracketing can also be used in combination with white balance correction. The benefit of all this white balance wizardry can be found in the photographs with colors captured accurately and precisely under a wide range of conditions. In addition to the legion of image-quality improvements, DIGIC II speeds up the camera's performance from start-up that is 10 times faster on the EOS Digital Rebel XT model (0.2 seconds) than it is on the EOS Digital Rebel with the original iteration of DIGIC (2 seconds).\n\n Another feature improved by the presence of DIGIC II is the speed of the direct printing function, which is PictBridge compatible. DIGIC II also produces faster startup times, faster CompactFlash card writing speed, and approximately 10x faster data transfer speeds thanks to the processor's new USB 2.0 high-speed interface. As an added bonus, the DIGIC II chip is so efficient, it actually reduces the EOS Digital Rebel XT camera's power consumption (and extends battery life) by approximately 35 percent. Indeed, this new Rebel XT camera is so energy efficient, it is powered by the same lighter-weight NB-2LH battery pack used by the PowerShot S60 (as opposed to the larger BP-511A battery pack used by the original Digital Rebel model).\n\n \n\nSelect 35-zone AF point evaluative metering, partial metering at the center of the image, or center-weighted averaged metering. E-TTL II: Exposure Control in a Flash\nThe new Rebel XT camera also features the next step in the evolution of evaluative, through-the-lens exposure control, E-TTL II. Though compatible with all Canon EX-series Speedlites, this smarter new E-TTL II system helps ensure that, even in situations with highly reflective subjects or backgrounds or when shooting in most other similarly difficult lighting situations, the image will be optimally exposed. The E-TTL II system compares the ambient light with the reflected pre-flash off the subject reported in all 35 metering zones and selects the areas with a small difference to be weighted for flash exposure calculation. This system also helps eliminate or underweights areas with large differences, recognizing them as an extremely reflective object in the background or a highly reflective subject.\n\n Bundled Software\nBoth the Rebel XT Camera and lens kit and the body-only kit are shipped with three software discs including EOS Digital Solutions Disc 10 featuring ZoomBrowser EX, ImageBrowser, and ArcSoft PhotoStudio together with other utilities, another disc containing Digital Photo Professional 1.6 for RAW file conversions, and a third disc containing PDF versions of the instruction manuals for each application.\n\nSee more",
