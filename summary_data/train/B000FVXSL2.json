And had to be washed like 4 times to get clean. Now they clean in seconds. Fast easy and my dogs stand perfect and let me do it. Definitely glad I bought it. Especially cuz we potentially have rain for more then 6m outta the year. In British Columbia Canada. Highly recommended.. sorry for long review normally do not comment this long. But this product was worth the good review. Let's just hope it lasts. Lol",

Naturally, when walking on rainy days, she collects lots of sand and pebbles that get lodged in her paws. I used to clean her feet with a bowl of warm water and a towel - water would often spill and the towel would get dirty quite quickly. The paw plunger solved all this - I pour in hot water before we depart - when we return the water are nice and warm. A few dips of each paw, a quick dry up with the towel and everybody's happy (especially the cleaning robot).",
