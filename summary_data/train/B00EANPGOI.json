After a half-hour of prep, the roller really wasn't more than room temperature. It's not worth the bother. The roller itself is OK but I really wish it had larger nubs to give a deeper massage on the bottom of my feet. Overall it's just OK.",

At the end of the day its nice to put my feet up, but I also need to work the soreness out. This has been my best option. I keep one by my recliner at home, and one under my desk at work, I also bought one for my dad who spends 10 hours a day on concrete floors in workbooks. This helps work the pain out of our feet. You can put as much pressure as you need, and you can adjust your foot to isolate troubled spots. Highly recommended.",

Not sure if mine was defective but just wanted to mention it and see if others have had a similar experience.",

      "text": "Keep it by the side of the bed and first thing before I get up and begin walking I 'roll-out' my feet and the roller makes a huge difference in how my feet and body feel, presumably by activating nerve endings. I notice the difference if I get up in the middle of the night and don't roll. Excellent device.",

      "text": "Really love this foot massage roller, which is a replacement for one that I had before. I leave it in my freezer and take it out when I'm ready to use. The combination of the cold and the nubs really help to massage my tired feet at the end of each day. I suffer from Plantar Fascitis and it helps to relieve the stiff muscles. Great find!",
