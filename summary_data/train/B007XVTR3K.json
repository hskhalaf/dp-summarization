New futuristic setting, cool gadgets and a branching storyline. I'm not a fan of CoD multiplayer...I'm a battlefield guy myself, but I found myself able to play this one. But my most favorite part about this game are the BOTS! BOTS! BOTS! BOTS! Couple that with the ability to use any item in the game and you got a recipe for a really good CoD. This is easily the best CoD released, but Ghosts is pretty close with its alien horde mode. Story good, guns cool, and zombies! Play this game.",

But there seems to be less weapons and its based in a modern/futuristic setting which is cliche. But tranzit is fun and has many Easter eggs inside the maps. So i would buy here i got it more cheap here than in gamestop but i would check both amazon and gamestop to get the better buy. Plus it seems amazon games are just kept in better shape than a game store.",

This is the same Call of Duty you've been playing for years. If nothing else, make the switch to keep up with the large player base and leave the elitists to play the one game they are good at.",

They better mix it up or I think this series is going to lose against Battlefield or another shooter! Still I give it a 7.5 to 8, just like all the rest.",

It's no original Black Ops, but the second is really good and I love it :) Me and my boyfriend love playing together, since we love to tease and compete with the other. Girls, I suggest getting this game and playing with your boyfriend. It's a great way to have some good fun! :3",

With the same ridiculously grotesque scripted sequences and dated, boring gameplay of every entry post-MW1, this one also attempts to disguise its inept storytelling with a gimmicky choose-your-own-adventure mechanism. Treyarch & Activision should be embarrassed not only to be churning out this garbage, but also to be aggressively marketing torture fantasies to teenagers.",

In this conflict, the mechanized creations of men reign supreme, facing off against each other as their creators stay safe and unconflicted, and in the process grow ever softer. In this scenario an important question will be asked: What happens when enemy steals the keys? To understand such a possible future, you must understand where you have been.\n\nPlayers of Call of Duty\u00ae: Black Ops II gain an understanding of this and more through the game's additional timeline set in the late Cold War era of the 1980's. Within the campaign story, which spans these two eras, players will see familiar faces such as Alex Mason, his son David Mason, and Sgt. Frank Woods. Linking these together will be the rise of another player in the conflict, Raul Menendez.\n\nKEY GAME FEATURES\n * An all-new Call of Duty\u00ae: Black Ops II storyline featuring new characters and and returning characters\n * A unique single-player campaign that contains two time periods linked by characters and their actions\n * Special Strike Force missions, in which the players action affect the outcome of gameplay and the overall campaign\n * A variety of multiplayer modes and play options\n\nZOMBIES\n\nThe Biggest Zombies Experience to Date: Call of Duty\u00ae: Black Ops II Zombies features three different ways to survive the zombie apocalypse.
