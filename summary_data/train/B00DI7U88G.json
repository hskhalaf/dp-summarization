It is not good to take a lot of Ibuprofen, so this is another way to help with pain caused by inflammation. I have tried it myself and it doesn't seen to help me much, but my knee is injured and I just need to have it fixed. So, it's not going to help your pain if you have an injury that requires surgery. But for inflammation pain it seems to work very well.",

It does provide relief from the pain, although doesn't last too long; I guess about an hour. However, re application is easy. I appreciate that is absorbs easily and leaves no residue. (you do need to let it absorb for about 5 min after massaging in, tho)",

It goes on smooth and is quickly absorbed without leaving a sticky or greasy residue. It is comfortable to pull on clothes over it afterwards. Also it is relatively scentless as claimed.",
