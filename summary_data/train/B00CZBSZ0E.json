Why use high fragrant ingredients like those two just to make a bar of soap unscented. Even though it is unscented, it had a very sterile, hospital scent to me, which I don\u2019t like. The exfoliation is very minimal to the point I wouldn\u2019t consider it exfoliating. Again, why use ingredients like Coffee, something that\u2019s often used as an exfoliate just to make it bare minimum. Overall, just a disappointing bar of soap.",

Specifically, seborrheic dermatitis on my scalp, keratosis pilaris on the back of my arms, dark razor bumps on my legs, and cellulite/stretch marks due to weight gain. The soap didn't get rid of anything 100 percent but I'd say more like 75%. Mostly, I'm glad my itchiness is gone. I don't notice any fragrance on the soap and prefer it that way.",
