In addition I found this wax to be significantly less painful than others I've tried. I'll NEVER go back to the other kinds. I do agree with other reviewers that you should order the extra muslin strips. I went through the ones included here in one leg waxing. I will definitely order this product again!",

I\u2019d strongly recommend buying extra waxing paper strips, as the ones provided probably won\u2019t be enough (there weren\u2019t enough for me). The wax is a sugar/honey type mixture, and can be pretty messy, but cleans up very easily with a wet washcloth. It\u2019s the first wax I bought for myself, and the only I\u2019ve ever used because it gets the job done. Highly recommended.",

While this can be a tad messy if you're not careful, it's basically made of honey so it washes off fairly easily (as compared to a waxier substance). It works very well for hair removal and it's simple to use. It doesn't come with many strips though so be sure and purchase extra. Another tip is to apply only a very thin coat. If it's too thick, it doesn't work nearly as well. For this reason, a little goes a long way. This is definitely my new favorite way to remove unwanted hair.",

The epilator can allow you to go many more days without having to wax. Ive been able to go 2 months between waxes by using the epilator to touch up. Also grab extra waxing strips, you are going to need them.",
