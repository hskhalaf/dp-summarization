I still give it 4 stars because I tested it and it works and the lights are a neat feature.",

I recommend buying the insurance because while I was getting it packed up to ship back to Amazon for a refund, it accidentally dropped about 3-feet onto hard floor and cracked. It was fun while it lasted but I'll be staying away from this brand.",
