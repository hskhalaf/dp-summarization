When this came out as an upgrade to FrontPage I bought it. The problem is this is too professional, essentially it functions like Dreamweaver. If you want to make professional websites for a living fine. However, if all you want to do is produce a simple information providing website, without all the Javascript bits and bobs, then stick with FrontPage.",

Using the CSS in Expression is a breeze. Don't let the other review dissuade you - it is an excellent application for developing very fast, web standard, full CSS websites!!",

I called the company that produced it (a microsoft vendor) and they have yet to get back with me with the resolution.
