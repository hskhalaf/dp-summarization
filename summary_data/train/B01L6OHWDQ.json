After removing the light from the USB charger, I set it down on the coffee table and left the room. About 30 seconds later I heard a loud hissing sound. The device had begun melting and smoke was pouring off of it from the where it charges. I immediately took it outside to watch it continue to melt. Had this been on my neck I would have been severely burned. I have contacted the company to make them aware.",

This light works very well for that. Comfortable, it sits on the back of your neck and the dual lights can be adjusted to virtually any position. The only reason it didn't get a 5 star review is the lighting is ultra white LED. While some may like that, I don't. Fortunately the light has 3 brightness levels so I just use the lowest setting which provides A LOT of light. Good purchase.",

A fundamental reason people will choose this light is to read at night without disturbing others. But as we are learning, blue light before bedtime disrupts natural sleep patterns. Unfortunately, for me this makes the light largely unusable. I\u2019d recommend a much warmer LED or inclusion of a filter to reduce blue spectrum emissions.",

Sometimes a little more light is needed for not just reading but searching for things like remotes. This helps a great deal because not only does it put out a strong light, it keeps your hands free! Love it!",

It takes a little getting used to because you can feel the hard base of it behind your neck as you're lying on it but I'm fine with it. I like that it has 3 levels of brightness for each side.",

It seems to be a wiring issue, because as it was dying, the lights would flicker at times and I could get them to come on with a little bit of adjustment. At this point, I guess I need to just throw it away.",
