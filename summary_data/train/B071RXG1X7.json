Using the recipe on the box the bear was tasty, and as firm as a store bought small gummy bear. The only suggestion I would make is to not use a whisk to stir the gelatin mixture together, because it makes tons of bubbles you just can\u2019t get rid of. If you look at the picture, the lighter colored centimeter at the back is because of whisked bubbles. Would highly recommend this mold to anyone.",
