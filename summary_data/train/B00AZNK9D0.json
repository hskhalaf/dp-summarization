The only problems I see are that the metal is thinner than I expected and after a couple of nights in the rain rust was already developing. There is no way for the water to drain out if it gets rained on so I drilled a few holes in the bottom. I consider this a design flaw, as the pit can hardly be moved indoors when it is hot. As I live in the Pacific Northwest, everything gets rained on. Despite this, I do like it and am happy to have purchased it.",

The first one that I bought in 2015 lasted for three years with regular and almost daily use. I was very pleased with that one and that was the reason I decided to buy again for the second time. The lid usually crumbles earlier than the bottom, in a year or two. They do not sell only the lid. Not sure if it is poor quality material... assumption based on the price the first time price was much higher and perhaps higher quality metal was used. My own experience, not trying to influence anyone else, just disappointed!",
