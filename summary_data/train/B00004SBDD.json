Hands still hurt after a couple hours from this task but much easier with these. Next time I get some young kid to cut the nails down. ;) Happy with this purchase it makes the job easier which is efficient. Also debated the Knipex but wanted a USA tool.",

In order to remove the factory washer to install a 1 time use crush washer you need strong Side Cutters that can cut a steel washer using only the tip of the Side cutters. So far these are the best side cutters I have found. You need a really strong grip to cut through the washer but if you are strong enough these will cut a framing nail or a steel washer like a hot knife through butter all day long for years.",

I wanted pliers with good steel and heat treating so the cutter edge will last better than the generic cutters I bought for my first tool box.

I am confident these will hold up to a lot of use on all types of electrical wire. The plastic trays for my Stanley sockets have instructions showing where to use cutters like these to open them so they can be snapped closed afterwards.",

    "description": "Size:8-InchChannellock 338 8-Inch High Leverage Diagonal Cutting Plier | Knife and Anvil-Style Cutting Edge is Laser Heat-Treated for Extended Tool Life | Forged from High Carbon Steel | Made in the USA\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\nNot all cutting edges are the same. The 8-inch Channellock 338 Diagonal Cutting Plier uses precision machined knife and anvil style cutting edges to ensure perfect mating and superior cutting edge life. Channellock uses high carbon C1080 steel for superior performance on the job, and an electronic coating for ultimate rust prevention. It's completed by Channellock's iconic blue handle, which is both comfortable in your hand and easy to spot in your tool bag.\n\nHigh leverage cutter with lap joint diagonal\n(view larger). The 338 can cut piano wire (0.063- to 0.091-inch thick), hard wire (0.047- to 0.091-inch), medium hard wire (0.047- to 0.091-inch), and soft wire (0.162-inch maximum diameter).\n\nChannellock utilizes precision-machined knife and anvil style cutting edges to ensure perfect mating and superior cutting edge life. While most manufactureres use two sharp edges that can become misaligned and lose their cutting effectiveness, Channellock's knife and anvil cutters give you proper cutting edge alignment for a clean cut every time. The edge is also laser hardened for unprecedented edge life.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\nOverall length 8 inches Jaw length 0.79-inch Joint thickness 0.43-inch Handle span 1.89 inches Joint width 1.18 inches Cutting edge 0.79-inch Weight 0.66 pounds ABOUT CHANNELLOCK\nFounded in 1886, Channellock is a worldwide leader in the manufacture of high-quality pliers and assorted hand tools.
