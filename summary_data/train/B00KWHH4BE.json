I would suggest using two bricks of the growing medium. Also, The top does not \"snap\" on like the directions day, so I used small clamps. Also, after it was set up I noticed that someone repaired a defect (a hole) with epoxy. It will too much of a hassel to send this back for a new one. I think it's pretty crappy that I got charged full price for a repaired item.",

Went through the hassle of returning that one, to receive a new one with the EXACT SAME PROBLEM. I am going to find a better hydro starter kit.

I've soaked it whole night plus whole day and still not absorbing much or expanding, had to really weigh the blocks down and hopefully that will solve the problem. Just hassle to return as it's a gigantum box. Maybe if I'll order another one and see if they are the same.",

The net pot openings are huge (6\") and the growing medium, coconut coir, retains so much moisture that mold grew before the seedlings emerged. Had to dump all my seedling babies. Unless you have a well stabilized environment, I do not suggest this for indoor growing. The instructions were very vague and ambiguous. Good luck deciphering. I'll try this unit again, this time outdoors in the summer of 2019. Wish me luck.",
