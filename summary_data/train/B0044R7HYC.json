He doesn't make a mess with his food because he is sitting at the exact right height for him. I only wish I would have bought it as soon as he grew out of his high chair! There are so many height options that I can tell we are still going to get many more years of use out of this chair.",

The seat part is lower now too - there's no slot for higher position of the seat. Update: the bottom of the leg cracked - poor quality plywood.",

Further, the backrest has some ugly cracks in the wood, just on surface though. Chair is very sturdy. Otherwise it's a nice chair and we're enjoying it.",
