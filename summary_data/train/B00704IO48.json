Not many kids toys are sturdy enough for adults and this has like a huge weight limit, like 250lbs! Crazy but most things are rated for just the kids. I'd say the only thing no one likes About it is the noise, every time you jump it squeaks like a kids squeaky toy. That is annoying, but something tells me that squeaky thing might be removeable, not sure, but we definitely aren't thrilled with the noise. Other then that it's great!",

My grandson took to it immediately and because it is not metal was able to use in the house on the carpet (to cushion him if he fell) This has been one of his favorite toys which also gives him exercising. Everyone who comes into the house has to see and try it. He greatly loves this toy and it has withstood many hours and many people up to 250 pounds in weight. I highly recommend this to youngsters learning to pogo stick or adults looking for a fun way to get some exercises in their lives.",

The twins were tentative about them until their 6'1\" daddy showed them how to make their jumpers squeak.

The center piece is not stiff- it's like a really thick resistance band, so if they slip off or fall over they don't get hurt. But it still jumps well since they can kind of pull it up with them as they go. The squeak isn't too loud or annoying and it decompresses fairly quickly. The little neighbor girl who's 7 loves it so much her Mom said she wants to get her own. So much fun! And yes, adults can use it- I've tried it myself!",
