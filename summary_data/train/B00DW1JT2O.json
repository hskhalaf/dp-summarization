Even still, 8 year old loved these, and I enjoy playing with him.",

Without the tape, I could hold the 2 pistols with my arms outstretched. The were facing away from each other and still registering hits. The tape seems to have fixed that problem. It might have cut the range down too though. They're fun. I'm keeping mine.",

The problem is the ability of the sensors to register a hit from an opposing gun. On the weaker setting, the sensor won't register a hit unless the opponent's gun is at point blank range (just a foot or so away), while on the stronger setting the sensor registers a hit if the opposing gun is fired anywhere in the same room, regardless of where it's aimed. So my kids were super excited to play with these, but upon realizing they just don't work for playing indoors during daylight hours, they have been abandoned and never played with again...",

They also have settings for indoors or outdoors, and you can choose how many times you can get \"hit\" before you're out.

These laser tag guns are really great for their simplicity: there are no extra parts that you have to wear and no special targets. The targets are integrated into the guns themselves, so you're aiming your shots at your opponent's gun. The game play is simple and intuitive. These were so much fun that we picked up a second set so that we could play teams.",

I see that Amazon is out of these now so I'm thinking that I received prior defective guns that had been returned by someone else. AGAIN DON'T BUY THESE!!!!!",
