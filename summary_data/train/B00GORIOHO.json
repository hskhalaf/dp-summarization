Listed is a Mickey Mouse with club house packaging and perfect for gift giving.. what you get is a Mickey Mouse just stuffed in a generic cardboard box that reads \"Mickey Mouse\" It was a bit disappointing as this is a birthday gift. I would highly recommend that the listing be corrected to reflect what you actually receive",
