Using legal paper size white boards, you can project your Lap Top presentations and your Mini white board real time presentations onto a movie screen or smart board by switching your projector between your lap top and Ipevo VZ-R. The white boards allow you to erase or save the finished board notes for later review. If you provide training classes with electronic circuits and other instrumentation, you can also provide real time demonstrations as well. The efficiency obtained with this equipment is truly fantastic. The availability of all the controls directly on the Ipevo makes this even more useful during any form of dynamic presentation.",

    "description": "VZ-R HDMI/USB Dual Mode 8MP Document Camera captures all your material and streams real-time images directly to your TV, projector or monitor with an HDMI input. It also features a USB mode for using with a computer. When in USB mode, VZ-R is compatible with a variety of software, allowing you to use it in different ways. And with its 8MP camera, VZ-R captures at up to 3264 x 2448 (10fps) in USB mode, and up to 1920 x 1080 (30fps) in HDMI mode that delivers crisp and clear images! In addition, with a Sony CMOS image sensor and a powerful Amarelle integrated system-on-a-chip (Sock), you\u2019ll find enhanced performance in areas of focusing speed, noise reduction under low-light conditions and reproduction of colors. Furthermore, VZ-R\u2019s built-in LED light gives you additional illumination for capturing material in dimly lit environments. Enjoy increased durability for VZ-R as its stand has been reinforced with a type of glass fiber reinforced thermoplastic GVX-5H (developed by the Swiss company EMS-GRIVORY) that can withstand heavy daily usage. You\u2019ll also appreciate the lightweight nature of it \u2013 VZ-R only weighs 2. 2lbs (1kg) \u2013 perfect for swapping between different rooms. VZ-R\u2019s swiveling head, multi-jointed stand, and small footprint allow you to capture freely from different height, angle, and orientation. Last but not least, the buttons conveniently located on VZ-R enable you to adjust the real-time images instantly to better fit your needs. (Please note that VZ-R's package does not include an HDMI cable nor power adapter. )",
