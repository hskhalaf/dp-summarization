Then lost it and i bought her this umbrella as a replacement. At first she was embarrassed to carry around this big tent big enough for 2. Also found it rather heavy for her. But now She enjoy the fact it screens her arms and hands as well as head. The heck with what anybody else thinks. She happily carry It wherever she goes! And it also works for the rain and water proof. Very good umbrella.",

I kind of fear accidentally pressing the close or open button at a bad time, but that's yet to happen.",
