We have tried liquid melatonin in the past, which did work, but ever since he had an unpleasant encounter with a disgusting liquid medicine he has preferred to take gummies or pills. Two or three gummies at least 20-30mins before bedtime seems to work the best. The gummies are a little too sweet (I've tried them - they work for adults too). They don't always help with sleeping through the night, but I've seen an improvement with my son. They are a wee bit expensive since they won't last a month if you are taking three per night. I do recommend the Zarbee's Naturals Melatonin Gummies.",

My 3yo goes through periods where she just cannot settle down for bed even though we follow the exact routine every night - pee, brush teeth, read a book, lights out. Normally she is asleep within 10 mins but if she is still awake and talking to herself in 30-45 mins I give her one of these and she is out within 10. If she seemed super riled up I will just give her one before book time and I can see her relaxing and getting sleepy by the end. These are also super useful for transitions like a new bed or room to keep routines on schedule.",
