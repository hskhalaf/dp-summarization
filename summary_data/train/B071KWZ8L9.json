The only thing you miss out on is the 3D portion, which wasn't all that great anyway,. The benefit of this new one is the fact that it will play the new SNES game from the e-Ship (Virtual Console) Same Nintendo quality, very reasonable price - especially with the latest price drop. Plays all DS and 3DS game and has access to the eShop. Can't go wrong with this thing",

The exclusive games are great, especially Xenoblade and Minecraft, even if you never intend to get the exclusive games, get this. Just as sturdy as the brick 2DS, but with much larger screens, useful extra buttons, and more that just make this a beautiful and sturdy machine. The increased processing power will also eliminate lag you'd get playing certain games (like Pokemon Sun/Moon) on the original 2DS. So unless you LOVE 3D, this is the handheld device to get.",
