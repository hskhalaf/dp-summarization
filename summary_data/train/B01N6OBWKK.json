This monitor had a fairly balanced colour temperature on entire panel however IPS flow was present where I was hoping it would be eliminated (just assuming because of the price). I would have kept it but unit I have received had cosmetic fault at the back. Backlit ASUS logo was not fitted in properly/was slightly pushed in which I found unacceptable especially when paying this kind of money for monitor. Issues with returning the item to Amazon requires completely separate review to be written.",

It loses half a star for having a somewhat awkward stand to set up (odd since I have several other Asus monitors and they have the best stand fixtures around) and half because it seems impossible to get rid of a thin black bar at each end and along the top. If you look closely at images of it on the web you'll notice the bars. For practical purposes they don't matter at all - it's just slightly annoying if you like edge-to-edge monitors.

It also has a very nice refresh rate of 240hz which is very nice for gaming. Overall I wouldn't buy this as it is very expensive and if its defective like mine it would be a big waste of money.",

I would recommend this monitor to anyone who loves gaming and has the budget for it.

The G-SYNC definitely makes a huge difference on some games for me, namely Watch Dogs 2, GTAV, Eve Online and the Metro Reduxes. All get much better frame rate and I can boost the graphics from medium/high to high/ultra on all of them now. Very happy. A bit expensive, really hurt to click that buy button, but it is a great monitor!",

Will admit i do find the stand lighting up a bit gimmicky but luckily i use the Monitor on a Monitor Arm so this isnt a massive issue for me. G-Sync has helped massively on games where FPS can fluctuate massively such as CS GO to help prevent screen tearing which was a large issue on my previous screen. Some of the extra features such as Gameplus are a bit irrelevant for games but dont deter so nothing to moan about. Overall a Excellent Monitor and would recommend to anyone",
