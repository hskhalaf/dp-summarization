I've never smoked meat or fish before, so I bought this smoker as a starter model. The capacity is decent for the size and it is easy to maintain. I've used it during 3 fishing seasons (1 1/2 years) with no problems. I'd highly recommend it if you are a beginner/novice to smoking meat and fish. Happy smoking!",

If using larger chips, the element can be turned off once the wood begins to smolder. All in all, a great design.",

You take the unit out of the box, big deal. Then, with or with out a small screwdriver, you attach a small metal handle to the front panel with two small screws/nuts. Repeat with second handle. Any child could do this in less than a minute or two. What else? Take the racks out of their plastic wrap. Another minute at most. The unit costs $98.73. The so-called expert assembly costs an additional $113.67. Come on, Amazon.",

I have found smoking the ribs for about five hours with two or three pans of hickory wood chips and then finishing the in the oven with a little bbq sauce is amazing. Also the smoked extra sharp cheddar tastes redonkulous and helps it keep alot longer. There is a recipe book that comes with it that has some good ideas you can run with. Definitely a purchase I have zero regrets with",
