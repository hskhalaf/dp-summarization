After going through three different pair I gave these a better look and see the sole is actually flared out, which I then thought hey maybe this will be okay. At that point I tried them on again even though I'd already generated my return paperwork...sure glad I did because these have proven to be an excellent shoe, as comfortable as any shoe I've ever worn and I just love them. In fact I just ordered another pair in the event they stop making them",
