I was concerned about the length because Im taller than average, but the California Costumes women's ruffled petticoat perfectly helped to provide a little more length. I did not care for the how the belt that comes with it looks so I did not use. The hat is soft and comes squished in the packaging, but was resolved using an iron over a towel to protect the material. Am very happy I went with this costume.",

Also, the belt is poorly made but I put a safety on it, the hat is terrible but my bf fixed it for me so it all came together!",

Apparently we all shop on Amazon haha One other thing i will say. While I think I rocked it best of course. The other women that wore it, what ever the size, it looked pretty good on their body types as well. Oh and my friend had the same one, but she got hers years ago and it\u2019s still in pretty good shape.",

The quality is very nice and my pirate costume was a huge hit at the party! I highly recommend! P.S. You will have to buy a feather for your hat if you want one, since this doesn't come with one.",

I recommend this especially since it came with a lot of pieces for the price. Didn't have to buy anything extra to make my costume look complete. Came with hat, skirt, top, sleeves, and belt.

Especially since it is inexpensive and I don't have to put anymore effort into it than to iron it. Don't use too high a heat or you will melt the fabric. If you iron the vinyl belt, put a piece of cotton fabric over top of it so the iron doesn't touch it or you will have plastic melted all over your iron. I put a piece of Velcro on the belt to hold it in place. And the hat ironed up pretty nice, too. Instead of the skirt, I wore black yoga pants. The husband was very pleased.",

Obviously, the top was a bit tight and small on me, but overall it still looked cute and I knew this would be an issue simply because the market doesn't really cater to petite women with huge breasts. Anywhere from an A-D, you'll do great! The skirt was so adorable. It'll comfortably as high or low as you'd want to make it. Boots are not included! Sword is not included!",

A suggestion to the seller would be allow us ladies to buy maybe one size for the chest and opt for another size for the skirts or vice-versa. Other than that wow I love it. I only try it on to make sure it fits so I have not worn it for long periods of time yet. Cant wait for our Pirates family theme this Halloween. YOu want sexy but not skanky this is the item. :)",

I fit into a juniors 9, but I realistically could probably have gotten a medium. I'm 5' 4\" and 145 lbs(at least thats what the scale says and we all know they lie! ;) )if that helps anyone.

Honestly, the skirt isn't usable but the top is fantastic. The top looks really cool and fits well, just need some shirt under it to get the look you want complete as the little arm dress pieces are kinda annoying and not practical. So, its a 1/2 good 1/2 bad, but still 4 stars as I think the top will get many uses.",

Not to mention I think the courset lace detail looked better without being covered by a belt. Fortunately I did have a positive experience with the hat. I was worried about it based on other reviews. It was a little crumpled when I received it, but after straightening it out a bit, it looked fine.",

You can reshape hat by getting out earlier and you stich or use velcro to make belt stay. The ruffles, plus the petticoat underneath (extra $) give a nice touch. Pretty much makes your behind look with nice volume.",
