This camera has a very large zoom (which is why I bought it for) which is almost useless because to take good shots that requires high shutter speeds which in in turn require either very bright light or very high ISO values. The electronic image stabilization is not worth the powder to blow it up with. Other cameras do a much better job. I had high hopes for this camera but was thoroughly disappointed.

Don't have too much expectation on the overall image quality, it only has a 1/2.3 inch sensor, but it's good enough for daily use or sharing it on instagram.

What I don't like: When zooming far way, need to zoom in gradually to establish focus, else would get out of focus. Also, when zooming in low light, the auto shutter speed is slow, causing blurring images. For example, in events with professional lighting, such as a big concert, I could take decent pictures of the lit stage from very far away. However, for indoor events with no professional lighting, such as school events, zooming from far away would likely have blurry pictures, unless I try to snap only when everyone is still.",

But under ordinary use, the image stabilization works well, and it's lower light (higher ISO) performance is no better or worse than any competitor. Got it for a trip with my 13 year old, who'd been only acquainted with cell phone cameras before. She still has it, but still prefers her (upgraded) cell phone for taking pictures. Sigh.

It autofocuses very quickly as well. Sighting of the subject can be done by using the LCD screen (which is quite bright, even in bright sunlight) or, with the push of a button, through the small sighting slot just below the flash.

      "text": "I love this camera for everything. Maybe for a serious pro use you need a Nikon D5. Last Nikon I had was the D2. Got too expensive. I love the LUMIX lens and recently I shot a pic at about 22X right throwing the home Venetian blinds of an unusual formation in a distant tree. Focused perfectly on the object of interest with no blind showing. Great travel camera and easy to learn its intricacies. Can\u2019t beat the lens either. While the sensor provides over 16 mp its is a small sensor, under 29 mm^2, about the same as an iPhone which makes very low light imaging subject to dark noise in the sensor.",

The first FZ80 started having issues with the zoom about three years after we bought it. We travel alot and took close to 250,000 pictures if not more. We thought enough of the camera to purchase a second FZ80. At times I would like to have a manual lens to turn to focus, but not practical with a point & shoot. Just touch the screen on the object you want focused and it is done. Happy shooting and enjoy the zoom.",

The iPhone has a feature called HDR that permits better photos of rapidly moving objects. The DMC-FZ70 also has this ability. I tested it and it also stopped tennis balls in flight. I wanted this capability for sports pictures and because I have young grandchildren that seem to be in constant motion when I want a picture. I also wanted the telephoto ability for sports and wildlife photos. It would cost a small fortune to get the telephoto ability for a DSLR camera.",

(GOOGLE MOS VS CMOS). the 60x lens with image stabilization is amazing. you will hear the little stabilization motors running when it is zoomed out. it has great wide angle at the other end. the battery lasts way longer than any point and shoot. it has dozens of modes to shoot under. I bought a 64gig chip for it. Don't hesitate to get this camera. I did lots of research and comparisons and this one wins hands down.

The ability to control the depth of field is taken to a level of simplicity that is genious (there is a wheel that is also a depressable button that changes control mode... aperture, shutter speed, etc.), allowing for \"on the fly\" control of the lens. Sometimes it seems a bit slow to focus on distant objects, but when it does, the optics prove they are excellent and the pictures of objects taken at high distance (even in low light) are amazing. Highly recommend!",
