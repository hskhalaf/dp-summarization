Thankfully, this celebrated hiking footwear doesn\u2019t stop there; it is also powerfully grippy over mixed terrain and stands mightily durable against abuse and wear and tear. That said, this shoe\u2019s reputation is by no means spotless as some users didn\u2019t appreciate its subpar breathability. All in all, the Adidas Caprock \u201crocks\u201d thanks to its harmonious combination of comfort, durability, and aesthetics. Hikers looking for an ultra-ventilated shoe, however, should very well opt for something else.",
      "pros": [

        "According to a moderate percentage of reviewers, this low-top hiker is satisfyingly versatile",
        "They said that its function and performance are for office and casual uses as well",
        "A handful of buyers commended this Adidas shoe for having not one but two switchable footbeds",
        "A few owners happily reported that they were able to use their Caprocks straight out of the box with no pain or blisters",

Ah well, not the first great shoe my weird feet haven\u2019t fit well (for reference, Keens are my best-fitting brand).",

The soles are very hard and seem almost indestructible so I had to break them in by wearing them every odd day to work. Have had them for about a month now and they are great and fit perfect. Definitely recommend breaking them in slowly if you go on a long hike day one with these your feet are going to hurt. I love Adidas anyway and now planning a lighter mesh pair they offer for summer hiking.",
