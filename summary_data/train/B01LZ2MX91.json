Pick one up for $80 or less with Mario Kart 7 or New Super Mario Brothers 2 pre installed. I plan on getting my youngest daughter the latter, since she likes red, and the newest deal is red and white with New Super Mario Brothers II already installed.",

And he tells me he likes the huge back catalog to work though. Here's hoping the eShop stays supported for another few years at least- this handheld has had a great run. Both his specific unit, and the 3DS family as a whole. It may not be as good looking or specced-up as the New 2DS or 3DS, but for the same price as those, you get this plus another game or two, and that's what some of us like, apparently.",
