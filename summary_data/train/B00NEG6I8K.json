STA-BIL Rust Stopper is an aerosol spray that delivers a protective coating for exposed metals, preventing rust and corrosion. Untreated and treated metals can rust within weeks of exposure. STA-BIL Rust Stopper prevents rust and corrosion by protecting metal surfaces with a long-lasting barrier while maintaining joint and pivot points to move freely. Use anywhere metal needs to be protected from rust and corrosion. With the flip-top sprayer this product allows you to use the stream setting for getting into tight precise areas, or for large coverage you have the fan setting. This does cling to the surface leaving a film over the surface you are treating. Great for shop, agricultural, automotive, marine, and outdoor power equipment uses. Protect all your metal surfaces exposed to the outdoor elements with STA-BIL Rust Stopper. STA-BIL is proudly made in the USA.",
