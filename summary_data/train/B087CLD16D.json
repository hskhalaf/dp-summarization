Ordered another one - display is flickering... is it a joke? Luckily I have learnt my lesson and I do not buy directly from Razer or return for repair to Razer as they are so useless. So if you want give it a try always buy on Amazon, price is the same but Amazon will never let you down if you have defective device and will arrange return for refund immediately.",

It\u2019s what I bought it for and I am not disappointed. It also looks great. There are a few things I was surprised by though: - It runs HOT. As in, so hot it could probably burn you. I think the metallic body probably makes this worse. We had to buy a separate base with a fan to actually use this on our laps.. - The battery isn\u2019t great. The longest I\u2019ve been able to use it unplugged is about 3-4 hours. Though I am running some pretty demanding games.",

This machine is designed to be permanently plugged in. For light use, such as writing a document or browsing the internet, I might scrape a couple of hours. For more intense stuff like rendering 3D images or playing Fallout 4, then an hour is probably the max you're going to get from the battery. The Amazon advert speciffically stated there was also a 1TB hard drive alongside the 256GB SSD. That is simply not true. I couldn't be bothered to wrangle with them, but that amounts to misrepresentation.",

Followed Razer's advice in checking Windows and other software updates etc to no effect. Only solution left is to do a full reset but this is a serious pain in the proverbial and really should not be necessary on a new machine. I'm left with an unreliable laptop with a curious ability to freeze while running very hot indeed. Battery life, even when not gaming, is as little as 4-5 hours. Good points - 144Hz screen is excellent and the laptop looks good - when it works.....",
