It\u2019s better than most drugstore brands I\u2019ve used, but if I were to go to a sad movie or work out or even just hang out next to the bathtub while bathing my kids, I would start looking like a raccoon. I have been seeing it smudge slightly even just from daily wear. If I\u2019m going to pay that much for mascara, I\u2019ll go back to using Thrive, which doesn\u2019t smudge and comes off with warm water.",
