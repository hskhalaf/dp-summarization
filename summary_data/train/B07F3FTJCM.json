The water was delivered May 23rd and the liner had 3 holes in it. We called Intex for help and they wanted us to CUT THE WORD INTEX OUT OF THE SIDE OF THE LINER and mail it to them before they would offer any help. This would cause all of the water to leak out and then it would cost another $325 to get it filled again, therefore causing the water to cost as much as the pool.",

      "text": "We LOVE this pool! After reading hundreds of reviews we went with this rectangular style and were so glad we did. Long enough to actually get a good swim for the kids who are learning. It\u2019s a beast to put together and definitely requires a few people but it\u2019s very sturdy. Like every other person, reviewer said, it\u2019s very important to level the ground. You\u2019ll want large pavers to hold the legs - ours shifted back and are nearly falling off so I\u2019d suggest larger one - two foot squares under each leg to adjust for the shifting. Other than that, we have loved it!",

Make sure your ground is level before adding water and take out wrinkles on bottom. I would buy it again.",

They should get training from the seller on how to properly handle customer service. Overall the pool is very nice and big.",

Neither myself or Amazon were able to get in touch with Intex for the supposed warranty. I tried to use a different pump but intex pumps use a much smaller hose diameter. Now the hoses are all splitting and its only 16 months old. Buyer beware and actually I\u2019m amazed and disappointed that they still sell these pools knowing the manufacturer can not be contacted for warranty.",
