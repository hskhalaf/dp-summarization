I was able to easily climb inside! It comes with 4 tent poles to give it a little extra structure (you can see them installed in the 3rd picture). This will be a fun place to play or read. The whole thing easily folds away into a small bag that measures just 15\u201dx18\u201d. The unicorn headband is super cute too. This will be a great gift!!",

So if you have a hard uncarpeted floor that\u2019s something you\u2019d want to watch out for. Has 2 netted windows on the sides that you can use to keep an eye on your child.",

He and his sister play in this together all the time. It was even used as a great hiding place in a game of hide-and-go-seek during a recent visit.

Tent poles don't always stay in place at the top. But he likes it.",

The projector flashlight that came with it, is also amazing; he loves the space images. Definitely a good purchase. This will definity be a tent that he plays with for a very long time. Very spacious, he can sit in the tent and bring a bunch of his toys with him to play.. I would definitely recommend this tent to anyone looking for a durable and spacious tent for their child.",

Other one I had earlier had pockets from bottom to top used to keep it in place and well hidden. 3. Does not looks like $30 product at all. 4.

We've only had it up a few days, so time will tell how it holds up to these little monsters, but so far so good. Easy set up, and easy to put away (I did a practice run), especially if you've used similar products before (beach tents, etc) The only drawback is if you don't have much space, it's fairly large. In our house that means using it in common areas because it doesn't really fit in the kids' bedrooms. But seriously , it's worth it for some peace and quiet, LOL!",
