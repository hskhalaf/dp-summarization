It is lined in the inside with fleece but feels a little thin in comparison to other ski gloves I've tried on. The tag on the glove describes it as \"rides best in colder conditions\" as opposed to: warmer conditions and ice cold conditions. The touchscreen control works with all the fingers but the fingers are kind of fat so it makes it a little difficult to type. EDIT: after 2 hours of boarding and much falling, my gloves were completely soaked on the inside.",

They probably would have been ok to layer another pair of gloves on them but I was really hoping for a pair that did the job in just one glove. It is a very nice glove but it is not made for ice cold weather, which is what I bought them for. I ended up returning them to keep looking for the right pair.",
