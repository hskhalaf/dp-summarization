You know - I don't care who is watching or what people think - I just wanted to jump on and feel the adventure. It is great for me as a mom going alongside my two kids (ages 3 & 6). This way, if they need me on their bikes I can dismount fast and help them. And ....... it's just fun!",

It feels like how it felt to wheel around the skating rink as a kid. My 9yo asked for one for his birthday. And my 37 yo husband did too! We all had to take turns on this today! Buy it.

Unfortunately, we had to return the 8 yrs old and up (mine) due to the fact that the height adjust pin was not working (popping back in) and the bar fell out - very dangerous when going down hill. However, for this specific 6 yr old one. My 7 yr old daughter has been on it for about 3 times now. She loves it. It is very durable and fits her perfectly. Recommend buying wrist guards, elbow pads, and knee pads. These go pretty fast.",
