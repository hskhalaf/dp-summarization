It comes with tiny really cute accessories, two bunnies and 2 lights you can turn on and off. I purchased a CC kitchen set,CC living room set and CC nursery set. The sets fit in the house really well. My kids have exspressed that their critters still need a bathroom though. Love Calico Critters they are always adorable and great quality toys.",

It was easy to assemble out of the box but my husband went the extra mile and super glued the pieces together. He said it was almost necessary since some of the connections were loose. At least this way we won't have to worry about pieces falling off easily during play. With that being said, I would definitely recommend having a tube of super glue handy while putting this house together. Overall I am very happy with this. The Calico Critters are adorable and my kids are very happy.",

It does come with several small pieces that we did not give her to play with for several reasons...1) even though I'm fairly certain she would not put them in her mouth, we didn't want to give her the temptation of the little food. 2) I didn't want her to lose them and be upset at the chance we couldn't find them. So we will save them for when she is older. Overall it is a great playhouse that doesn't scream gaudy, cheap, plastic toy.",
