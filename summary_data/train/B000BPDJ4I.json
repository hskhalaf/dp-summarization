I have had four different stud finders and the last one I threw across the room in a moment of frustration. A friend pulled one of these out of his box and I was instantly shocked and surprised. No battery, nothing to fail. It just slides across the wall a few times and finds a nail and sticks like it was glued. I love it and I will use it from now on.",

I recently completed a storage project and without this I would still be punching peek-a-boo holes in my finished drywall looking for studs. I spent about $45 on my electronic stud finder and it gives off the edge beep for a good 6 inch area. I use it to find the general area and then follow up with this magnet to actually find the stud. Then with a quick peek-a-boo punch to make sure it actually is the stud. The magnet never has let me down.",
