The whole unit is not too heavy and is pretty straightforward to assemble. There are a couple of quirks that I think could be addressed...after about 20 or so uses, the clamp stripped out. This was a real bummer for me, as the clamp supplied was very handy for smaller pieces of wood. I liked having the option of moving the clamp to the right or left side, however when the clamp is used on the right, sometimes it gets in the way of the saw motor when you're dropping the blade.",

This one got here in 2 days, and I just love it!!! For a saw, it is pretty quiet. Cuts like a pro. The blade seems to be off by about a degree or two, but I just stuck a toothpick on one end since I am too lazy to read the instructions and adjust it. Eventually I will do that. I am using it to trim out windows and doorways and all my cuts have been perfect. And it is pretty spiffy looking too!!",
