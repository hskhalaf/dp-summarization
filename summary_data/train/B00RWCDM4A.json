What it DID do, and the reason I'll keep using it, is take the grey that's growing in and remove all the 'dull' from it. What was a mousey dull steel wool is now an amazing silvery / white / stainless steel shine fest. I would never have expected that, but wow, I'm keeping it ; )",

I would recommend scrubbing your palms immediately after application and avoiding drips onto your face if at all possible as it does stain.

Apply shampoo, lather a bit to make sure product coats all strands. 4. Clip it up and shave your legs, exfoliate or whatever time suck you do in there. 5. Rinse after 7 to 10 mins. 6. Towel dry. 7.

      "text": "I purchased this shampoo back in October after my hairdresser recommended this particular product (she sent me the this amazon link to save money) for my brassy hair. I used this product twice without any significant results. I contacted my hairdresser to ask when I should expect to see results. She asked me to describe what I was doing and in my description I told her that it was difficult to apply given that it is the consistency of water. She immediately stopped me and told me that I had been duped. The REAL shampoo is supposed to be very thick like molasses. So buyer beware! Not sure what I bought, but it is not the real product :(",

The areas that had the deposit are darker white but I think that will go away with the next use.....waiting until next week. I rubbed it in the areas that were a problem let it sit for exactly 3 1/2 minutes and rinsed it out. I used a clarifying leave in spray conditioner, styled and was thrilled with the result. No damage whatsoever. This product is for real! I've used so many shampoos/conditioners that were supposed to correct and after religiously using nothing but more yellow.......",

I chose this one because it was the cheapest. When it came in the box was covered in the purple shampoo and so was the bottle. There was BARELY any shampoo in the bottle. I am very disappointed. I wouldn\u2019t recommend ordering this stuff because the same thing happened last time I ordered a purple shampoo that was $30. I got the shampoo all over my hands because the bottle was a mess and it ended up staining an expensive pillow. Please don\u2019t buy this crap.",

It tones all of the brassy, warm undertones and leaves you with a nice shade of blonde. You don't need to leave it on for long.

      "text": "This is not good for shampooing your hair but it tones awesome! I wash and rinse my hair with regular shampoo first to cleanse. Then I lather this in and leave for a few minutes to tone. It does great at removing the yellow! The smell is not good and it feels like it\u2019s not doing anything softening to my hair. But I follow up with conditioner and everything\u2019s great. Totally recommend as long as you\u2019re not trying to use it as actual shampoo.",
