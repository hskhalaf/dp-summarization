HOWEVER, if you point the remote about halfway (45\u00b0) either up or down, the volume works almost flawlessly. (feels like it works best when pointing the remote up) I'm not sure if it's related to why I have the volume issues in the first place, but I use a Vizio sound bar setup. So I'm not sure if people using just TV speakers don't have any issues with the remote. Otherwise, the remote works great!",

Pretty much defeats the point of using a dedicated media remote.

You think you are pushing the arrow key and you end up pushing the enter button. Most remotes have raised arrow key functions but this uses a \"flat face\" design; hence the problem.

For a while it was fine, but as soon as I changed the batteries the cover just refuses to stay in place. Line of sight. And even then if you aren't aiming it just right.... I don't know what all the positive reviews are about. Payed shills? Because this thing is borderline junk.",

Usually have to replace them every couple of weeks and we don't even use the remote that much. I'm looking for another option and will be throwing this thing away.",

This works as well as the original remote, the buttons feel good to press with the same amount of pressure. We'll just see if this will last a few years like the original. So far very happy!",

To that end, the range of the IR is pretty good, so even holding the remote perpendicular to the Xbox seems to get the job done.",
