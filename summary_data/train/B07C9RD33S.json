If I can find one to fit the 36 then the cups are too small and my boobs just pop out the sides or front.I am an avid gym person and love to Run so support is important to me. very minimal bounce if at all with this bra. I tried it on asap and then wore it to work to try out. I work 13hr shift work in the nursing field and 8 hours into the shift and it's still awesome. I will be buying another. Best bang for my bucks! So happy with my purchase",

It has good support, the straps do not dig in, I\u2019m not falling out on top or on the sides under my arms, and there is no gapping. Just enough padding for support. This is the best bra purchase I have made in a very long time. Most sport bras just push you in and together which causes me to chafe. The underwire does not dig in, helps separate, and gives you form. I\u2019m very pleased.",

It\u2019s not loose like a comfort fit, but if it was it wouldn\u2019t perform like you need it to. The availability of sizes and adjustability is just fantastic. I am so glad I found this bra!
