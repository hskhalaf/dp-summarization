      "text": "I absolutely love my yogurt maker. I have a limited diet and a sensitive stomach so many times I eat yogurt as my dessert. I would always get whole milk yogurt which is absolutely scrumptious but is pricey when you\u2019re eating yogurt with every meal like me. So, I bought this guy, and it is amazing. It\u2019s the best yogurt I\u2019ve ever had and it cost a fourth of what I was spending before. I have to buy the yogurt culture powder from the grocery store for every other batch (I can\u2019t seem to use the cultures from the actual yogurt more than once) but it\u2019s still significantly cheaper and tastes amazing.",

They conveniently let you know in the directions what amount to use for the type of milk you're using. The yogurt tastes so much better than store bought. Unfortunately, I accidentally dropped the inner container and it broke, so I need to contact the company to get a replacement.",

The lid of the inside container is amazingly tight and perfect for the purpose. I dont have to transfer into another container, it just fits right in my refrigerator... What I dont like is the lack of timer... It would have been added plus to have auto off for the device or a timer to adjust the time off. Or a digital stop watch. Thus four star or else I would have given 5 stars. Nevertheless device is worth every penny. Love it.",

I heat the milk to 185 degrees, cooled it to 110 degrees and added the yogurt and didn't stir too much. Perfection. I'll try that Yogourmet starter when I only have about 6 hours to cook.",

It also comes with a thermometer, very cool, although my thermometer must have gotten wet because not all the numbers are displaying correctly now. Just follow the directions and you'll get great results! A tip: if you don't want to buy expensive yogurt starter, just go get a $.69 cup of yogurt from the market and use it as a starter. Just make sure it uses \"active cultures\" or you won't get no yogurt. 5 Stars!",

I've tried making yoghurt with all kinds of milk.Trust me, homemade yoghurt taste so much better than the store bought one. It comes with a jar, thermometer and a cheese cloth bag.I also bought an extra jar so that I don't have to wait for the first batch to get over. Highly recommend this yoghurt maker.",

    "description": "Yogourmet Electric Yogurt Maker\n\nAMAZON.COM\nThe Yogourmet Electric Yogurt Maker makes it easy for you to quit spending extra money on store-bought yogurts, yogurt cheeses, and cultured milks. Best of all, it helps you enjoy the rich, creamy texture and great taste associated with natural yogurt, along with a wide variety of health benefits. And you get the satisfaction of knowing exactly where your food is coming from.\n\n \n\n\n\nA unique water-bath system provides consistent, ideal temperatures for yogurt making. \n\nYou simply need to select milk, cultures, and flavorings to get started. View larger. \n\nFlavorful, natural ingredients help make homemade yogurts, yogurt cheese spreads, and cultured milks a healthy addition to your diet. \n\nVersatile and Easy to Make\nWhether you enjoy yogurt with granola in the morning, as a substitute for sour cream on your baked potatoes, as a snack on the go, or as an ingredient in baked goods, you understand the rich appeal of this versatile food. The Yogourmet Electric Yogurt Maker is designed to help you craft specialty yogurts using your choice of milk--for half the cost of store-bought yogurts. This electric yogurt maker uses a unique water-bath system to maintain an ideal temperature for preparing yogurt that is healthy, safe, and the perfect texture. Featuring a precision thermometer marked with both and Fahrenheit and Celsius readings and a detailed set of instructions, this yogurt maker takes the guess work out of deciding when to add your yogurt starter to your preheated milk. It's fast, too--two quarts of yogurt take just four and a half hours to make.\n\n You can choose to make one or two liters of yogurt at a time, and the inner container's special seal-tight lid will let you store your yogurt in the refrigerator for more than three weeks. When it's time to make a new batch, this container is dishwasher-safe for easy cleaning, and it is made of food-grade plastic that is PVC and BPA free. Additional inner containers can be purchased separately, making it easy to keep different types of yogurt on hand or start a new batch before the last one is gone. These reusable containers contribute to a green lifestyle by eliminating the disposable containers you would collect using store-bought yogurt.\n\n Calcium-Rich, All-Natural, and Good for Digestion\nUsing your favorite fruits, jams, or flavorings, and your own milk, whether it's local organic milk or soy milk, ensures that your homemade yogurt is free of artificial colors and the strange tastes left behind by preservatives. This system can also be used to make soft yogurt cheeses, special cultured milks, and macrobiotic yogurts with casei bifidus acidophilus.\n\n Having a great selection of homemade yogurts on hand is ideal for anyone keeping close track of what they eat, especially those on the \"Specific Carbohydrate Diet.\" Plus yogurt is an easy-to-eat source of calcium and essential B vitamins. The fermentation process involved in making yogurt means that it contains lower levels of lactose compared with other dairy products, so even those who are sensitive to lactose can typically enjoy it.\n\n For cheese making, this kit includes a specially designed cotton bag with an easy-to-fill opening and a cord, which makes it simple to close the bag and hang it. \n\n The Yogourmet Electric Yogurt Maker is backed by a one-year warranty.\n\n What's in the Box\nOuter container with lid, inner container with lid, thermometer, cotton bag, and 12-page instruction manual.",
