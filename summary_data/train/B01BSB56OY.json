I have used high-end brush shampoos as well as cheap soap and hair shampoos. This was worse than anything. It actually left a weird, gummy residue on my brush bristles, causing them to clump. The suds and water were running clear, indicating the brush was clean, but my brush clearly still had foundation on it. I worked with this one brush for at least 15 minutes. I finally resorted to using Pantene hair shampoo, which worked. I\u2019m so disappointed. \ud83d\ude29",

It really does a good job getting my brushes clean. It has a pleasant scent that's not overpowering at all. It also washes out very easily. Also the packaging was great as it comes with a sticker closure to ensure it doesn't spill during shipment. My only critique is that I wish it was more conditioning as it tends to dry out my brushes a little. Overall it's a good product though and the price was nice.",

I put water in a jar with this shampoo and put the brushes in to soak for a few minutes (just the brush part, not enough water to reach where the bristles are glued in). The super dense ones took 3 washes (they were pretty nasty tbh) and my regular brushes just took 1. Worth the buy",

I am not in love with the smell, which is why I took off a star (especially because it is coming in contact with my face via the brushes and does linger after they have dried) but if I liked orange-y smells I'd give it 5 stars!",
