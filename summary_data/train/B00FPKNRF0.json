It takes me 10 minutes now to eat a 20 second dinner. Its downright humiliating. The shame - oh, the shame! Hmmm. Come to think about it, I haven't been to the vet for a while. Phhhhhht.

Also, can\u2019t say if food will stick to it for two reasons, the plastic is such that it looks to be made of a very non-porous material and two, my pup licks every Bart of that bowl clean.",

We decided to try it out for the price to see if it slowed him down and stopped the excessive burping/farting. He has only used it for 3 days, but I love how it has forced him to slow down in his eating. He was quite puzzled at first and now it's an entertaining challenge! Great buy! Excessive burping and farting have also lessened in the past few days! We bought the purple flower design, regular size bowl. Our Springer is small for his breed at about 35lb.",

      "text": "We have another Outward Hound slow feeder bowl as well. We got this to provide variety, so he doesn't master one and start gulping his food. This bowl slows him down way more than the other one. That said, I don't use this one in the morning due to time constraints. It takes a good 10-15 minutes for him to clear this bowl vs. the 3-5 minutes it takes for his other one. So, I use one for breakfast and this one for dinner. They're really sturdy and don't slide all over the floor.",

      "text": "I got this bowl for my puppy when he was about 2.5 months old. He would eat his meal in about 30 seconds. He gets just over 2/3 of a cup of dry food each meal. This feeder slowed him down a lot. I got him the spiral one so he will go in circles around the food bowl to get all of the pieces. At first it would take him 10 minutes or more. Now it only takes about 5 minutes, but that is awesome when compared to 30 seconds. I do recommend trying this bowl and I do plan on buying other patterns for him for mental stimulation at meal time.",

      "text": "I really needed to slow down my miniature schnauzer Apollo's 20-second inhalation of his meals. While our elder schnauzer, Cicero, leisurely dines on his food, Apollo's is usually gone as soon as I put down his dish. He loves games that involve hunting for treats, so I knew this was the perfect solution to engage him in 'play' while also slowing his pace of food consumption to more like 2-3 minutes. Success! Very pleased with this slow feeder. Easily washable, sturdy, doesn't slide around. Highly recommended.",

But the plate ended up being a bad idea, he had no patience and ended up levaing food on the plate, which got full of ants bugs later. Worst part it that sometimes he got his nose injured for trying to reach the kibble.",

      "text": "My golden retriever puppy is a extremely food motivated. We have been using those \"puzzle balls\" which she loves, but they are noisy on our hard wood floors and when they get trapped under our sofa, my pup barks like crazy. I needed a quiet food puzzle for her early morning feedings (before the family wakes up). This food puzzle isn't as \"fun\" as the balls, but it slows her down so that she does not inhaled her food. I bought this \"slightly used\" on Amazon and it was a fantastic find! Great price and a great product! My pups loves it.",
