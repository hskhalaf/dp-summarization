If not addressed, the company's failure at quality control will destroy the bar's reputation. It's a shame - I love the short and simple ingredient list.",

I wouldn't advise eating when you won't have time to check/brush your teeth before interacting with others. At this price, it seems they could head back to the lab and work on texture.

      "text": "Pro: great, simple ingredients. Filling and easy on the go. I like to keep them in my pantry for the days I don't want to make breakfast or have to eat in the car. Buying them by the box on subscribe and save helps reduce the cost per bar vs buying individual ones in the store. Con: sticky in your teeth and a little tough to chew. I always make sure I have a drink with these. If you have issues with chewing or your teeth, either skip these or break small pieces off at a time and drink with each bite.",

I don\u2019t like throwing away food but giving them away could possibly make the recipient ill. I won\u2019t be ordering again.",

I had ordered one flavor (cheapest option of the flavors I like) and received a completely different flavor (which ironically is my favorite kind, but was one of the more expensive options!). So I'm very pleased with how the mishap turned out, but I still technically received a different box of bars from what I ordered (hence one star reduction). No regrets, all the flavors I've tried so far are pretty tasty. I'll keep ordering them even after Whole30 is done.",
