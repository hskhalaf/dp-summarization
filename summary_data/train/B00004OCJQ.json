We have three ricers (this was for our daughter), and it's better than any of the others, which include a chromed-steel model that rusts, an aluminum that can't be put in the dishwasher, and a stainless model that has rusting hinges. From the photos and some of the reviews, it looked like this might be a bit small and take forever to rice a large amount of boiled potatoes, but it's fairly deep and holds as much as any of our other ricers. Would buy this again.",

On sizing, a large apple would not fit in the basket. Its probably 3.5-4\" diameter. I used it to rice well done red potatoes and instead of fitting tightly to the basket, the mashing plate seemed quite a bit smaller so extra potato would shoot out of the top unit instead of being mashed. I had about a 20% waste ratio of material that never made it through the ricer. I'd recommend you look elsewhere.",

I highly recommend this ricer, I wish I had had it when I was making mashed 'taters for my family at least 3 times a week.",

This ricer gets the potatoes instantly the precise texture you want and it's just as simple and fill-and-squeeze. Obviously, you need to make sure the potatoes are cooked thoroughly or else it won't work, but it really is a huge time/energy saver. Sure, it's a pretty limited gadget in what it can do, but totally worth it, in my opinion.",

Im guessing a lot of people set this on hot pots and with the weak metal (maybe aluminum) it causes to break. Second is that you can't really load much. I put about 2 1/4 (half the potato) in it and it works smoothly, but go to 3 and it won't easily crush them. So be careful how much you load or you might break it. Lastly, yes the ricer does work great. I produced some soft and fluffy gnocchi.",
