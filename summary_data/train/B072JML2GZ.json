I was surprised at how cheap some of the ones on the market look and wanted something sleek that would blend in with my new kitchen. This was the perfect choice! It's very easy to use and isn't very loud at all. Great if you wake up earlier than someone you live with and don't want to wake them. The buttons are clear and easy to read. It has several specialty functions that are going to be really useful! I really don't have anything negative to say about this microwave. I'd highly recommend it!",

The only thing that I'm not crazy about is that you have to pull the handle to open the door, rather than a button to push that releases and pops the door open. The latch is secure, so when you pull it would not be hard for it to slide enough to drop off the edge of the counter. But that's minor compared to everything else, including the price.",

The microwave makes a bit of noise when it first starts (like a warm-up), but quiets down in a second. It's not super quiet though. The button beeps are quite loud, so silencing them is a good option.",

Call me, I'm available for the next nine months.) All you have to do is hit the stop/clear button twice and then push the #8 for 3 to 5 seconds. You'll hear a goodbye beep and it's done. Repeat to reverse the process. Good product. Fits my needs and otherwise works just as described.",

It fits in a small space, is quiet and, best of all, you can turn off the beeps. Why does anyone need five (5) beeps every time it is finished cooking? I have low vision and my biggest disappointment is how hard this machine is to set up and use. If the deadline to return had not passed (I am deeply frustrated about this) I would return it in a heartbeat and get another make and model. Otherwise, I am sure this would work well for most people.",

So far I have tried heating frozen bread, cold pizza, frozen pasta, frozen vegetables, and cold soup. All of these were heated evenly after manually entering the time and power level. The microwave is also very quiet compared to older models. For easier comparison, this microwave is less noisy than the range hood fan and AC fan, and louder than a refrigerator fan. Interior is easy to clean and glass plate rotates smoothly.",

I was hoping they could just put a new door on it. They denied my warranty claim, which I feel was pretty unjust. It's still a great microwave, I just didn't like the way I was treated by Toshiba customer service, that's why I gave the one-star review.",
