      "text": "I purchases these pans because we were looking for a good set of BFOA free pans. There were well reviewed and fairly affordable compared to other options. We mostly use them for items that wouldn't stick anyway (pasta sauce, boiling water, etc) so haven't had any sticking issues. They do seem to stain very easily though. After boiling salted water, they start to show strange stains that don't come off. Not a huge deal.. they still work.. just don't look as nice as you'd like them to after a few uses.",

Aluminum cookware causes BPA's to leech into the food cooked in it just as BPA's leech into foods packaged in aluminum cans. The beauty of the Cuisinart Cookware is that the aluminum is encapsulated and it allows heat to be evenly distributed in the pans. I don't have to have the heat on the stove very high at all and they clean up beautifully. The price was great too!! I know that I will be healthier because I am now cooking with stainless steel!!!",
