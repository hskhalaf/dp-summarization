Most washer are loud. You can't hear it in the hallway. I would suggest get an drain hose extension i had to modify mine attaching 1 inch pipe about 7inch long, along with thick rubber hose to fit the drain extension. So it can reach the sink being across the kitchen so I don't have to move. Its optional. You don't have too. Other than that its great",

Do my laundry at my leisure this is definitely one fantastic strong machine. Instructions were easy to follow hooked it up to my kitchen sink. I'm going to be a 70 yr.old senior soon this was my birthday present to me. Thank you magic chef and Amazon.
