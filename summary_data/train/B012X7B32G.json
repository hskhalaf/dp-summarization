Not a manufacturing defect because I've read others complaining of the same issue. Just a design flaw which needs to be rectified for this product to be great.",

Controls are in intuitive places and the mic feature that let's you hear surroundings in your headphones so you can talk to people without taking the headphones off is one of its best features. Solid set of headphones and I'm really well-pleased with them. Cons: The auto pause/play is super sensitive and often cuts out when I'm not stationary--which forced me to disable this feature. Mic while on Bluetooth is not the best as I've had callers complain they can't hear me. When wired callers say it's much improved voice quality.",

I know this isn't my transmitter's fault since other devices always automatically pair even if they've been turned off for a while. Since these babies run off firmware hopefully there will be an update from Plantronics one day that allows them to automatically pair. I'm not holding my breath though.",

I use them mainly on the train, and they easily generate enough volume. They are just very well designed and put together so everything just works easily and well. Excellent headset for phone calls too. For the money, I don't know how you could do better.",

      "text": "For this price range, this is a great pair of headphones. Sound quality is great and balanced, not heavily relying on bass to make it sound \"richer\" (you can always tweak that in your audio settings). I've had mine for 2 years (close to 3 now) and they're holding up very well. No wear on the ear muffs like many other brands I've tried (looking at you Coloud). They are a little loose so heavy head movement will probably cause them to drop off your head but for casual listeners or those on the go, it's perfect. Otherwise, they are incredibly comfortable and you can wear them for extended periods of time before the eventual headphone-headache sets in.",
