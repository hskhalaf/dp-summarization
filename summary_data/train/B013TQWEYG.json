      "text": "Bought this item to display collectibles that were other than a jersey. It works great! 4 stars instead of 5 because there were a few scratches on the frame when it came. Also, the plastic has a very thin, easy to miss opaque protective covering on both sides of the display causing it to look foggy and cheap quality. Be sure to remove the film! Once removed, the plastic was perfectly clear.",

      "text": "Good looking case to display your collectible jersey. I like the hanger and latch door. Also, included are two solid wall anchors for hanging. Very easy to place your jersey in and mount on your wall. Price is kinda steep for the craftsmanship but not bad. I think a price between $40-$50 is more reasonable. Also, the description mentions a felt lining inside... this is wrong, no lining whatsoever (just noticed so down graded rating from 3 stars). I would return if I didn\u2019t have to ship but not a big deal. Some complained the arcrylic window makes viewing your collectible hard to see... just don\u2019t forget to remove the protective film on both sides.",
