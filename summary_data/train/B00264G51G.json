If you buy this product try it before any functions. I would have put a 4 or 5 star but the pan had a hole which could help ave caused a huge grease fire.",

It heats up (and comes back to temp) quicker than the larger amount of oil that it requires. It was really nice just being able to lift the baskets to remove the food, rather than hunt around in the depths of the oil, too. Being able to separate foods between the two baskets is very handy.
