Once seasoned you must watch how you wash them, (no dish washer, no soap, only hot water and a nylon scrubber works best for me) and re-season them after washing. Once you get the hang of it, it becomes second nature. Cooking with cast iron will also add dietary iron to your meals. I am low in iron but cannot take iron supplements as they upset my stomach. But cooking in cast iron helps keep my iron levels up.",

Made lasagne, biscuits, casseroles, etc. We can also see how this size will work well for family gatherings for special things without any left overs. And it's Lodge and that by default makes it a well made beautiful DO. Beautifully pre seasoned and ready to go out of the box. Definitely recommend this, especially if you are cooking for a smaller group.",

This is a good size for two families (8 people) but a bit large for going by ourselves, just the 4 of us. May look at getting the next size down. Visit the Lodge site and see the difference between the deep and the regular dutch ovens. One is better for baking, one is better for other cooking (stews and roasting and such). If you are going to do a mix of cooking and only want one, get the regular depth ovens like this one, they allow you to brown the breads and baked stuff easier.",

Easy to clean up. I use the Dutch oven with charcoal briquets, only takes about 12 - 16 to make bread or chile, stew etc. If you like to camp .... make room for this wonder ... it is quite small but makes 2 quarts.

The lid that holds charcoals is a must since most recipes call for coals to be on the top and the rim around the lid ensures easy placement.

    "description": "Size:8-Qt| Color:Deep Camp Dutch Oven\n\n LODGE LOGIC 8-QUART CAST-IRON CAMP DUTCH OVEN\nFlip lid to use as griddleThe Lodge portable \"camp stove\" is the pot that does it all. The flanged lid holds hot coals and inverts for use as a griddle. The integral legs allow the oven to sit perfectly over hot coals. Includes Camp Dutch Oven Cooking 101 book. \n\nFrom colonial hearth fires to the campfires of Lewis and Clark, cast iron camp ovens fed the colonists, helped tame the wilderness, and did their share in settling the American West. Cast iron cookware has long been treasures as sought after heirlooms, so much so that, when Lewis and Clark returned from their journey west, their trusted cast iron pots were among the few items making it back to civilization.\n\nLike whiskey and tall tales, Lodge Cast Iron improved with age. There are few companies who can boast that products they made over 100 years ago remain in use today, and are still in high demand. You just won't find anyone who knows camp oven cooking like Lodge. Our camp ovens have proven themselves with avid outdoorsmen and patio pioneers from Tennessee to Tokyo. When you create a meal in Lodge Cast Iron, you create a memory that lasts a lifetime.\n\nMany of the pieces of cast iron cookware made in the Lodge Foundry over a century ago remain in use today. \n\nThe Lodge Cast Iron Dutch Oven is a multi-functional cookware that works wonders with slow-cooking recipes. It comes with a tight-fitting lid that helps lock in nutrition and flavor. This pre-seasoned Dutch Oven works like a charm right out of the box. Made of cast iron, this Dutch Oven evenly distributes heat from the bottom through the sidewalls. Also, it retains heat better so your delicious meal remains warm for a long time. Sporting a stylish black color, the cast iron Dutch Oven looks good in most kitchens and it doubles up as an excellent source of nutritional iron. It features loop handles for convenient handling and the oven is easy to clean and maintain.\n\nA simple Cast-Iron Dutch Oven, like the one your grandmother used, still ranks as one of the best cooking utensils ever made. It gives you a nearly non-stick surface, without the possible harmful fumes generated by preheating chemically treated nonstick cookware.\n\nMany of the pieces of cast iron cookware made in the Lodge Foundry over a century ago remain in use today.\n\nLegs Allow Oven to be Set Over Hot CoalsFEATURES:\n * Made of cast iron\n * Pre-seasoned and ready to use\n * Multi-functional cookware\n * Virtually non-stick surface\n * Brutally tough for decades of cooking\n * Easy to clean-hand wash, dry, rub with cooking oil\n\n\n\nDETAILED HIGHLIGHTS:\nSUPERIOR COOKING PERFORMANCE\nTightly controlled metal chemistry and exacting mold tolerances deliver consistent quality for even heating and superior cooking performance.\n\nHANG OVER HEARTH OR CAMPFIRE\nHeavy gauge wire bale can be used for hanging the oven over the hearth or campfire.\n\nSTURDY LEGS\nThree integral legs allow the oven to be perfectly spaced over hot coals.\n\nSNUG FITTING LID \nFlanged to contain hot coals on top so the oven can be used for baking, stewing, and roasting. The versatile lid can be inverted for use as a griddle.\n\nMULTI-FUNCTIONAL COOKWARE\nThe right tool for searing, sauteing, simmering, braising, baking, roasting, and frying.\n\nMADE OF CAST-IRON\nCast-Iron is a form of cookware developed over a millennia ago remains as popular today as when it was used to prepare meals hundreds of years ago. Cast Iron is one of only two metals compatible with induction stovetops. Unparalleled in heat retention and even heating.\n\nCAN BE USED WITH A VARIETY OF HEAT SOURCES\nAt home in the oven, on the stove, on the grill or over the campfire. Skillet may be used on various heat sources including gas, electric and induction. Seasoned cast iron can also be used on the grill or open fire and coals for camp cooking. Begin heating cookware on low and slowly bring heat up to medium or medium/high. Always remove cookware from the stovetop after cooking. \n\nPRE-SEASONED\nSeasoned for a natural, easy-release finish that improves with use.\n\nSeasoning is a necessary step in using cast iron cookware. Oil is baked into the pores of the iron at the foundry to prevent rusting and to eventually provide a natural, non-stick cooking surface. Unlike synthetically coated cookware, it is possible to restore the cooking surface of cast iron.\n\nLodge uses a proprietary soy-based vegetable oil to season our cookware. The oil contains no animal fat or peanut oil. The seasoning is functional application and slight inconsistencies may appear in the seasoning finish. The inconsistencies will not affect cooking performance.\n\nEASY TO CARE FOR\nEasy: hand wash, dry, rub with cooking oil. It is very important to replenish the seasoning of your cast iron cookware by applying a thin layer of oil after each cleaning. Seasoning is an on-going process. The more you use cast iron, the seasoning is improved.\n\nBail handle for use with tripodUSING YOUR LODGE CAST IRON\nRinse with hot water (do not use soap), and dry thoroughly.\n\nBefore cooking, apply vegetable oil to the cooking surface of your pan and pre-heat the pan slowly (always start on low heat, increasing the temperature slowly).\n\nOnce the utensil is properly pre-heated, you are ready to cook.\n\nTIP: Avoid cooking very cold food in the pan, as this can promote sticking.\n\nPLEASE REMEMBER: Handles will become very hot in the oven, and on the stovetop. Always use an oven mitt to prevent burns when removing pans from oven or stovetop.\n\nCARE AND CLEANING OF YOUR LODGE CAST IRON\nAfter cooking, clean utensil with a stiff nylon brush and hot water. Using soap is not recommended, and harsh detergents should never be used. (Avoid putting a hot utensil into cold water. Thermal shock can occur causing the metal to warp or crack).\n\nIf you are having trouble removing stuck-on food, boil some water in your pan for a few minutes to loosen residue, making it easier to remove.\n\nTowel dry immediately and apply a light coating of oil to the utensil while it is still warm.\n\nTIP: Do not let your cast iron air dry, as this can promote rust.\n\nStore in a cool, dry place. If you have a cover, or lid, for your utensil, place a folded paper towel in between lid and utensil allowing air to circulate. This prevents moisture from collecting inside the utensil, which can cause rust.\n\nTIP: The oven is a great place to store your cast iron; just remember to remove it before turning on the oven.\n\nNEVER wash in dishwasher.\n\nIf for some reason your utensil develops a metallic smell or taste, or perhaps rust spots (maybe a well-meaning relative washed your utensil in the dishwasher or with soap thinking they were being helpful), never fear. Simply scour off the rust using a very fine grade of sandpaper or steel wool and refer to our section on re-seasoning.\n\nRE-SEASONING YOUR LODGE CAST IRON\nWhile maintaining the seasoning should keep your Cast Iron in good condition, at some point you may need to repeat the seasoning process. If food sticks to the surface, or you notice a dull, gray color, repeat the seasoning process:\n\nWash the cookware with hot, soapy water and a stiff brush. (It is okay to use soap this time because you are preparing to re-season the cookware).\n\nRinse and dry completely.\n\nApply a thin, even coating of MELTED solid vegetable shortening (or cooking oil of your choice) to the cookware (inside and out).\n\nPlace aluminum foil on the bottom rack of the oven to catch any dripping.\n\nSet oven temperature to 350 \ufffd 400 degrees F.\n\nPlace cookware upside down on the top rack of the oven. \n\nBake the cookware for at least one hour. After the hour, turn the oven off and let the cookware cool in the oven.\n\nStore the cookware uncovered, in a dry place when cooled.\n\nWHY SHOULD I CHOOSE LODGE COOKWARE OVER OTHER BRANDS?\nFor over 112 years, Lodge has provided quality cast iron cookware and accessories, with a broad and innovative assortment. Our continued commitment to quality enables Lodge to offer a superior product line.\n\nHOW IS THE DIAMETER MEASUREMENT OF LODGE COOKWARE DETERMINED?\nWe measure from outside rim to outside rim across the top of the cookware, not the bottom.\n\nWHAT TYPE UTENSILS ARE RECOMMENDED TO BE USED WITH LODGE PRODUCTS?\nWe recommend using wood or silicone utensils to avoid scratching.\n\nWHY SHOULD SOAP OR DETERGENT NOT BE USED TO CLEAN CAST IRON COOKWARE?\nSoap and detergent are used to break down and remove oils. Since the seasoning of your cast iron consists of oil, cleaning with soap will strip or remove the seasoning from cookware.\n\nARE THERE ANY TYPES OF FOOD THAT ARE NOT RECOMMENDED TO BE COOKED IN CAST IRON COOKWARE?\nFoods which are very acidic (i.e. beans, tomatoes, citrus juices, etc.) should not be cooked in a cast iron utensil until the cookware is highly seasoned. The high acidity of these foods will strip the seasoning and result in discoloration and metallic tasting food. Wait until cast iron is better seasoned to cook these types of foods.\n\nLODGE IS A GREEN FOUNDRY:\nLodge is a zero hazardous waste stream foundry. Lodge designed a vegetable oil recycler for the seasoning process to reduce waste and unusable oil is recycled and used as biodiesel generator. Lodge uses recycled and biodegradable packing materials. Reuse of foundry sand used in the casting process is recycled and unusable sand, working to purify the water of the local streams and planting trees to improve air quality and beautification. \n\nLODGE HISTORY:\nLodge is the oldest family-owned cookware foundry in America. Since 1896, the Lodge family has been casting premium iron cookware at their Tennessee foundry. Starting with raw materials and finishing with their seasoning process, they continue to improve on the highest quality standards that go into every piece we make. As the sole American manufacturer of cast iron cookware, they are proud to carry on the legacy started by founder Joseph Lodge. Lodge doesn't just make cast iron; they make heirlooms that bring people together for generations.",
