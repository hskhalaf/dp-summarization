Its solid and has withstood training, EMS calls and structure fires for six months now. Any other pen would break in my pocket. I write patient info with it on EMS calls. I've broken out vehicle windows with it with ease. It works better than a window punch and is easier to deploy because of the clip. Others were impressed with it's quick deployment and it looks like I'm breaking windows with just my gloved hand. The ink recently started to fade and I replaced the cartridge with no problems.",

First of all, a tactical pen should have a flat side so you could apply pressure with your thumb. Instead, the glass breaker is there which hurts when you put your thumb on it. Another reason you absolutely need to use your thumb is to keep the pen in your hand without slipping. If this pen slips in your hand, the clip could split your hand open. Other than that, the knurling is very aggressive, which I like. And it writes very well.",

      "text": "Incredibly strong and sturdy feel, great grip but the aluminum holster/pin near the top makes using the glassbreaking side very difficult. Internals are very simple, spring, ink capsule and the two other pieces of metal confining it together. Using the pen itself is nice, it writes as any standard pen should, only downfall is the closing and opening mechanism. You have to turn the tip in order to use it. When you lock it, the pen tip will be exposed, when you turn in the opposite direction it\u2019ll close however turning it too much might disassemble the pen into its primary components. Overall, cool and useful accessory. Could be better although.",

I never used to for self defense or to break a window, but I bet it could do both fairly well. My pen didnt come with a spare ink cartridge even though the package came with a space for one, which disappointed me. But overall, its a solid pen and an eye catcher for many.",

Not to mention the refills and this free gift. I will most likely be using a Sminiker pen for the rest of my life.",

The clip is secure and sturdy, the pen is comfortable to hold while writing and functions well and smoothly. I intend to carry this every day in place of more bland BIC-brand pens or mechanical pens in general.",

The pen twists so you can put your thumb on that end easily to reinforce your defensive grip. It looks nice too...just do it!!",
