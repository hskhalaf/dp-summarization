The only thing missing is for it to have something to button it closed it in the front , because that would help it not slip if I fall asleep and also for putting over my luggage handle when traveling. If it had that, it would be perfect. Excellent price, though, and perhaps I'll sew something on myself eventually. Most of these pillows are too hard, but the memory foam is just right.",

      "text": "Purchased so both of us could have a pillow while watching TV. We have been very happy with our old pillow as it contains firm polyurethane foam. This pillow offers no support because it is too soft. Also, if leaned on, the shape distorts (now I know why some pillows come with front fasteners). Our old pillow is firm enough not to distort under normal use. Otherwise, the overall quality of the fabric and workmanship are satisfactory. If it wasn't so cheap I would return it.",

The outside velour is super soft and touchable, and I haven't had any issues with it itching, rubbing, or otherwise irritating my skin. Easy to adjust the back, if needed, though I haven't needed to. It squishes just enough that my neck is positioned well on the seat back. I do find that it gets a little 'flat' on whichever side my head is lolling after awhile, but it's still more comfortable than without. Quality neck pillow at a great price point.",

I used this on 4 international flights over 8 hours recently and thought it was great for providing neck relief when awake however it was a bit stiff when I was trying to sleep. Unless you are great at sleeping perpedicular, it will not allow you much flexibility to sleep at other angles. In additional the memory foam is incredibly warm, a nice feature is that there is a cord on the pillow which allows you to attach to your carry-on. I have another neck pillow with comparable features and I experience the same issues with memory foam.",

    "title": "TravelMate Memory Foam Neck Pillow, Grey",
    "description": "Color:Grey| Size:11 x 12 x 3.8 inches\n\nNew! The TravelMate(R) Memory Foam Travel Neck Pillow is specifically designed in such a way that it has just the right softness to provide the most comfortable support for your neck. Unlike anything on the market, this newly released and improved version has a built-in removable (memory foam) insert so you can adjust the thickness of the pillow based on your preference. Why is this such a desirable feature? The answer is that you want to be able to adjust the thickness based on your sitting positions. For example, if you sit relatively straight, you want to be able to reduce the thickness so it will not push your head forward to the point that puts too much stress on your neck. \n\nWhen it comes to pillows, the old school of \"one size fits all\" just doesn't cut it since what works for others might not work for you. By dialing in the ideal restful position just for you, you now can sleep comfortably whether you are sitting straight on an airline seat or resting on a recliner at home. The thermo-sensitive memory foam will mold to your body's natural contours for a custom fit. It helps relieve the tension in your neck and shoulders due to prolonged sitting. Use it on a plane, car, or anywhere you need the extra support for your neck and shoulders. You will definitely like the soft and comfortable feel of this pillow. The cover is made of high-quality, machine-washable velour cover. The built-in elastic strap makes it easy to attach the pillow to a carry-on luggage without taking up extra space. \n\nSimply put, you get a high-end product at a fraction of the cost of what you pay at upscale specialty stores. We all know how it feels after a long flight. So do yourself a favorite and get this pillow! If it does not help you to do what it is advertised, just return it in 30 days for a full refund. No questions asked. Direct from the manufacturer and only available on Amazon, every product comes with the trademark \"TravelMate\" on the packaging. U.S. Patented.",
