The larger brush holds a LOT of liquid (and mind, liquid ONLY, not smaller bits like spices; that's what the smaller brush is for) for covering large areas with fewer stops to re-dip. The smaller brush holds a really good amount of liquid as well but also holds those small bits like spices too. I've used it several times with a basil-rosemary egg wash on pizza crusts and calzones and it really holds those spices well. They come apart and re-assemble easily to wash up by hand, but they do NOT come apart during use. I am 1,000% pleased with my purchase.",
