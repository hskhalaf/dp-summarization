I enjoy using it for the drawing apps as the iphone 6 is too small for me, but the ipad mini is just the right size. The camera on it is better than the previous ipad mini and the screen is much better quality. Performance is also improved as it is faster, and apps don't crash as often.",

I find it fits in my handbag, so when away from home I can keep up with my Emails, Messages and Facebook. Even when I am at home I use it to quickly access Google. In other words I just love it!",

Be aware though that the only difference between the Mini 2 and 3 is the choice of capacity and the fingerprint recognition. If you don't need as much as 64gb and aren't bothered about the fingerprint thing then the Mini 2 is a cheaper bet.",

      "text": "The iPad mini 3 delivered to me here has US model number not UK or EU. Any consumer laws do not apply per 40 minutes on phone with AppleCare when seeking to purchase AppleCare. Beware of this as if there is a problem you will not have full coverage as product seen as 'purchased in the US' never mind sold by Amazon.co.uk! If you are happy with this - great. But when our US purchased iPad died recently there was not coverage even though it was a major technological issue (no accidents involved) - we were left with a dead iPad only 2 yrs old as no Apple coverage here in UK!!!!",
