After 3 weeks of use we were starting to see signs of its working, the cats were scratching less and less, after 4 weeks it appears to be working well. We give it once daily in their food, to the outside and inside cats and everyone appears to be flea free. We plan on continuing to use this through the entire flea season",

    "description": "Size:2 PackFlea Away is a vitamin complex, specifically formulated for dogs and cats. Flavored with real liver, your pet will love them! What makes Flea Away different from alternate flea repellents is that fleas don't get on the dog or cat's skin and bite before finding chemicals and going away. The pests simply stay away from your pet because of the odor (undetected by humans) that your pets skin gives off. With Flea Away your dog or cat's skin gives off a natural smell caused by the special safe mixture of vitamins. If your dog or cat has an allergic reaction to flea bites, then Flea Away is the way to go. The fleas, ticks and mosquitoes are naturally repelled before biting your pet. Dosage: Cats: 1 chewable tablet 1 time daily. Dogs: Up to 50 pounds - 1 tablet 1 time daily, 51 to 100 pounds - 2 tablets 1 time daily, 101 to 150 pounds - 3 tablets 1 time daily. Please allow 30 days of use before seeing results as product needs to be in the system. 2 Pack.",
