I decided to give a hair wand a try since they do not have the clip, and came across this one. It is so awesome to have the different attachments for the price of what most others cost, and they usually only have one or maybe two different attachments. This one works great, heats up quickly, and made my hair look great!",

However, I noticed some features that I did see when I was looking at it on the amazon site and in YouTube videos. There was supposed to be a black little stand for when its hot, basically my stand is attached to the barrels, I noticed that my buttons are blue not black and they are under the heating numbers. It works wonderful but I just noticed those features were different from what I saw and was expecting.",

Not only does the Irresistible Me Sapphire Curler save me time (only took about 10-15 minutes to do her whole head versus 30+ with traditional iron), her curls lasted! Her hair looked fantastic all day long! Definitely a great investment. While the rubber tip does still get pretty hot and I suggest you still use the glove, everything about this set is awesome!",
