      "text": "The hard plastic material along the bottom of the bag is too flimsy. Even under a moderate load, it bowed out, in between the wheels. As a result, the bottom edge of the bag rubbed along the ground, wearing away the fabric and scuffing the bag badly. The bowing also makes it hard to pull the bag, which is the whole point of having wheels. All of this happened on my first trip. Bottom line: You might think you are getting a bargain, but you're better off investing in a higher-quality bag.",

I can say, I like the size (29\") and all the pockets. There's more than enough pockets, which I'm a huge fan of the saying, \"it's better to have and not need, than to need and not have\". The all around sturdiness seems okay, the zippers moves smooth, straps seems legit, but I've been wheeling it more than carrying it, which is great for me. I would recommend this bag to others. I gave it 4 stars because it's not as bright red as I thought it would be, based off the advertised picture displayed.",

      "text": "I quickly read a few reviews which said it was carryon size, and ordered it. But it seemed big when I received it. Then I checked airline sizes and most allow 12\u201dx9\u201dx22\u201d and this is clearly too big by 3\u201d in one dimension. Will keep it for car travel but wouldn't trust being allowed to carry it on board. The green is a nice value but don't understand why some colors are so much more money. Hate pricing games.",

To make it worse, I've gotta pay $9.12 just to return it?! No thanks. I'll sell it on eBay, or something. Maybe see if a friend wants to buy it. What a hassle. I will not buy this bag again.",

Won't use it again for carry on because she may not get that lucky next time. Kind of disappointed being I bought this gift for that purpose.
