The employment of the Fresh Foam midsole has also increased the overall comfort of the shoe. Although there have been some comments on its heel slippage, many were still convinced that shoe is still very suitable for long-distance running as it can handle great miles.",

This shoe has an even cushioning and gives stability. No pronating especially when cross training. I love the looks too. You can\u2019t go wrong with this shoe.",

With most shoes I wear a 10 if I can get wides or 10.5 if not. These are perfect for me in 10 wide. Someone else commented that the tread wears quickly. I can't tell how long they will last yet but the sole is this really soft and flexible which makes for a super smooth ride. I don't know if I would like it as much if it were stiff. And really these are for hard surface running, how much tread do you need? Anyway, great shoes.",
