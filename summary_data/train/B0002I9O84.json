      "text": "I have had this item on subscribe and save for some time and opened a new bottle tonight. I immediately felt a difference in the thickness of the tablet and it felt lighter. Broke in half easier. My cat, who absolutely loved the old formula, sniffed and licked the new tablet and then batted it away, rejecting it. I compared the ingredients to discover chicken and liver were replaced by cellulose (used to make paper) and silicon dioxide (sand). Obviously a cost cutting measure resulting in an inferior product. I've cancelled my subscribe and save order. Picture shows old bottle ingredients (right side) to new (left side).",

The company refunded my money, but I am very upset that the good formulation is no longer available. I can only hope that enough consumer input will cause the company making these (The Brampton Company) to go back to the previous effective and yummy formula.

I still have that love/hate relationship but it is reversed now. Something has changed.... They aren't as thick and are much easier to break apart. *thumbs up* But now my cat won't even touch them. He sniffs at the pieces and walks away, yet keeps begging. Kinda feel bad for the poor fellow. So, from my cat to your company, he gives you the \"paw\" (since he doesn't have any middle fingers). Not a happy household with this product anymore.",

If and when the old formula reappears I'll buy it again. Update: The company kept saying it was trying to change it back? Or whatever doubletalk they were using to convince people somehow they weren't responsible for the changes. Decided to try again, new bottle arrived 12-20-2016, and it's still horrible Different color and texture, and cats hate it.",

I had to actually smash them with a hammer to make them cat-edible. The company reformulated the tablets. The current version is much easier to break up, and it seems to work well. I have a very old (22!) tortie cat with long fur. I crumble one of these tablets into her wet food and add some water and stir. She eats it right up, and it has completely stopped her hairball retching. My younger (11) Siamese cat doesn't care for them, unfortunately. Two paws up from the tortie!",

The pills I received from Amazon were thicker and more barrel like. It's harder to break this pill up than it was the flat disc shaped one, but it's still doable. One more thing though, my very finicky cat does not touch this pill so I guess it's the luck of the draw.",
