My 6 yr old son is super into it and minds really well when the elf is around. Unfortunately there have been a few days the elf didnt move but I'm assuming it was because he is overworked, exhausted, and just wanted a min to his self when the 6 yr old went to sleep. Anyways, I wished cousin eddie had joints or bendable arms and legs that held a place so he could stay in a place by his self. He is flippy floppy so he will have plastic surgery over his \"off\" summer months.",

The original one entered our home 10 years ago and has spent each holiday season performing random hijinks and shenanigans each year without fail. Keep them out of reach and be mindful of staining and such changesof look. Having one that is original is cool until it goes missing. Keep them basic if you catch my drift.",

Needless to say he freaked all the other kids out so I bought him his own so he could understand. He loves Larry. He loves the games on the website. Larry got into some trouble with the Ninja Turtles but he got his revenge. This is perfect for kids and really helped me get my son into Christmas, my favorite holiday. I think we read the book every single night. My son still thinks Larry is watching through the security cameras in stores, so that helps too!!!!",

      "text": "My husband and I started the Elf on the Shelf tradition this year for our four year old son & so far it\u2019s been a lot of fun. We\u2019ve enjoyed coming up with new ideas for \u201cElfie\u2019s\u201d placement each night and then seeing our 4 year old literally jump out of bed with excitement to find out where his elf has moved to. Elf on the Shelf is a fun and silly way to bond with your kids during Christmas time. I hope to keep this tradition going for several more years while the magic of Christmas is still alive for my 4 year old.",

The book goes back in easily and he goes right back in his place. Being in retail for years, I was impressed with it. Love the way the story is told. This is our first time buying one and no disappointments at all. I may make him more bendable, but he is really perfect just as is. A tradition I can't wait to start !",

He was soooo excited to get it and keeps talking to in the morning. Not only does it keep him behaving the best he can, but he actually jumps out of bed excited to wake up in the morning (something very unusual for him) because he wants to see where the elf moved to.

For it to be worth while, you (the adult??) has to be dedicated to hiding it as many times as possible and putting it in amusing positions. Don't underestimate your child. Hide it where it is visible but make it challenging. I really believe these kids today are much sharper than we were and they love the exitement of the search.",

    "description": "The Elf on the Shelf: A Christmas Tradition THE ELF ON THE SHELF: A CHRISTMAS TRADITION (INCLUDES BLUE-EYED, LIGHT SKIN TONE BOY SCOUT ELF) \n\n\nBring the Christmas magic home to your family this year! The original Elf on the Shelf set includes a magical scout elf from the North Pole and a beautiful children\u2019s story book, all in a keepsake gift box. When you adopt this special elf and name him, he receives his Christmas magic and can fly to the North Pole\u2014but only when all girls and boys are sound asleep. At the start of each holiday season, the elf returns to his family\u2019s house to be Santa\u2019s eyes and ears, and every night he travels back to the North Pole to report in. Families can register their elf online to receive an official adoption certificate and a special letter from Santa. Set includes boy elf with light skin tone. \n\n \n *  A timeless Christmas tradition that the whole family can enjoy\n *  The Elf on the Shelf comes in light skin tone and dark skin tone boy and girl scout elves\n *  Bestseller with over 4 million copies sold\n *  A Scout Elf Game Day Jersey is available, sold separately\n\nThe Elf on the Shelf: A Christmas Tradition Keepsake Box Gift Set HAVE YOU EVER WANDERED HOW SANTA WOULD KNOW WHO IS NAUGHTY OR NICE?\n\n\nThe Elf on the Shelf: A Christmas Tradition is the very special tool that helps Santa know who to put on the Naughty and Nice list. This interactive holiday hide-and-seek tradition is perfect for children and families of all ages. The tradition begins when Santa sends his scout elves out to Elf Adoption Centers. Waiting for their families to bring them home, these patient elves hibernate until their family reads The Elf on the Shelf, gives their elf a very special name, and registers their adoption online. Once named, each scout elf will receive its Christmas magic and becomes part of the family's Christmas each and every year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Elf on the Shelf: A Christmas Tradition SCOUT ELVES ARE EYES AND EARS OF SANTA CLAUS\n\n\nAlthough they cannot be touched, or else they may lose their magic, the elf will always listen and relay messages back to Santa. Taking in all the day-to-day activities around the house, no good deed goes unnoticed; these scout elves take their job seriously.\n\n\n\nBefore the family awakes each morning, their special scout elf will fly back to their home from the North Pole. However, since these elves like to play games, don't expect to find them in the same spot! While some like to hide in the freezer (probably because it reminds them of the North Pole) and others prefer to sit on the fireplace mantle or hang from the chandelier, these elves love to play hide-and-seek with their families.\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nYear after year, children and adults alike are baffled by the mystery of how Santa really knows who\u2019s been naughty or nice. After much urging by the elves and Mrs. Claus, Santa has allowed his biggest secret to be revealed in The Elf on the Shelf: A Christmas Tradition. At the start of each Christmas season, the elf appears to serve as Santa's eyes and ears, traveling back to the North Pole each and every night to make a detailed report of the day\u2019s activities. This keepsake gift set includes a light skin, blue eyed boy North Pole pixie scout elf and a hardbound watercolor picture book. Children can register their elf online to receive an official adoption certificate and a special letter from Santa.\n\nREVIEW\nA Publishers Weekly bestseller!\n\n\"A great holiday activity for the whole family!\"--Kansas City Star\n\n\"Tip of the day: get an Elf on the Shelf.\"--Orange County Register\n\nSee more",
