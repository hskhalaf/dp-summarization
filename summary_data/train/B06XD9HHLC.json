The quality of the suspension ropes and fabric of the swing seat is high enough quality that I feel confident sitting in it at 230 Ibs. I wouldn't suggest this for outdoor use as the fabric would be difficult to clean. We upgraded the pillows with some nice plush ones and that has greatly increase the comfort of the hammock. The included pillows are just too small and not very high quality.",
