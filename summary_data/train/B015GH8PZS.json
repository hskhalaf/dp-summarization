None had seemed to keep the pipe from freezing once the temperature got to around zero. I thought I would give this one a try. What a remarkable difference this one made. We had -18 degrees and the water flowed with no issues. This order came with 2 cables. I have a spare if this one ever gives out. Great product!",

It's made to be used in a straight line along the pipes side, not wrapped around the pipe. I'm going to put some pipe insulation over it next time I go to the big box store to pick some up as I think this will make things safer from freezing and more efficient.",

However, the supplied hardware with the Garden Home was very hard to manipulate. The separators are stainless steel and spring back to their old shape when you try to close them on the cable. The Easy Heat hardware closes and stays clamped on the cable. I took most of my stainless ones off and used the softer ones from the Easy Heat. Overall the cable is good quality and seems to heat plenty when turned on.",

    "description": "Size:6FeetDescription Say goodbye to frozen pipes in the winter with the GardenHome Pipe Heating Cable - 6 ft. (1.83 m). This temperature-controlled cable runs along pipes and valves, thawing frozen pipes. The built-in thermostat will sense the temperature of the pipe and turn the cable on and off to provide the most economical solution for frozen pipe disasters. How it Works Before applying the heating cable, make sure that the area on and around the pipe is clear and that the heating cable is warm and pliable. Simply plug the cable into the nearest grounded electrical receptacle, secure the thermostat tightly against the pipe with electrical tape, secure the heating cable straight along the pipe, and let the heating cable work its magic. The built-in thermostat will automatically detect the temperature of the pipe and turn the cable on when exposed to temperatures below 38F for frost-free pipes all winter long. It will shut the heating cable off when the pipe has been heated to a temperature of approximately 45F, incurring no extra electricity costs.",

      "ECONOMICAL SOLUTION: Reliable low wattage design saves up to 70% energy than other cables and protects your cable to -50\u00b0F. Easy to install.",
