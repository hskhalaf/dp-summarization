      "text": "I bought this printer because of the positive reviews. It has a couple of negatives. Print cartridges have a very short life. Seemed like after only 20-25 pages it runs out of ink and then the printer locks up, won't print, won't scan, it becomes a boat anchor until you replace a cartridge. Doesn't matter which color, just quits printing. My old HP would print until all cartridges ran dry. We stopped using it after a couple of weeks because of this annoyance. I would not recommend because of this issue.",

The printer behaves poorly (error messages, poor print quality) when one of the cartridges is low on ink therefore you need to replace it before printing. I have purchased a new set of cartridges and have low ink levels and I only printed 10 pages.",

The network connectivity was easy to set up on all my computers, and the Epson Connect features are nice, especially the ability to send an email to the printer that you want printed. I know several printers offer this, and I can't compare this one to others, but it works well with the XP-420. We didn't buy this specifically for photo printing (we usually use an online service), but the photos we have printed are good quality. We have not printed larger than 4x6 yet.",
