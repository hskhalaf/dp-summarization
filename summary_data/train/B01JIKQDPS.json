I can\u2019t honestly say whether or not this product has improved my brain performance, but I\u2019m hopeful. Thanks! Edit: In August of 2018, the vendor for this product contacted me and requested that I edit this review to exclude details of their free offer. The customer service representative, Emma, explained that my review could create unfavorable results for me personally as Amazon would likely flag me for \"bias\" and prevent me from reviewing products in the future. The vendor also reminded me that I can update my star rating positively.",

In my opinion, companies that hide behind proprietary blends are not in business to help the customer at all. You pay for a product you are owed to know exactly what you are paying for. I've also seen this exact ingredient label on other bottles which leads me to believe this stuff is sold in bulk and branded over and over. It didn't work for me but your mileage may vary.

But I think the benefit outweighs the very brief fishy experience so I'm pleased to get a second bottle.

So, not only are they completely ineffective (I haven\u2019t noticed even a slight difference in memory improvement, mental clarity or recall ability), they are also causing nausea and \u201cflu-like\u201d symptoms for a few hours after taking them.

After doing months of research and looking for a more naturopathic approach was happy to find this product online. Its rated in the top 3 best brain supplements and its affordable!. I am going to purchase a few more. I am seeing small improvements which I believe with continuously taking it bigger and better will come. Will write a follow up update after they've taken it for a full 30 days.",

I really like this and I recommend this for anyone that wants greater focus and memory retention.",

I believe this product helped boost my memory a little more than if I would not have tried it. I recommend this product as the price point and quality was above average.",

I didn't know what to expect from NeuroHealth but gave it a try because it appeared to also take the place of a daily multivitamin. After two-three weeks, there was a notable change with improved clarity and I noticed I was working longer into the afternoon than usual (I'm a writer). NeuroHealth was the only change I made to my supplements and diet, and my sleep was the same 7-8 hours each night. I can only credit NeuroHealth for the difference.",
