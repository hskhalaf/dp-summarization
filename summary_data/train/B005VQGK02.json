      "text": "How do they manage to keep the room warm in the winter yet cool in the summer?: Amazing! You read some things that sound too good to be true, but these really work. And if you're needing them solely as blackout curtains, they will do a fabulous job of room darkening, as well. (I couldn't speak to other lighter colors, but my set is the indigo blue and I feel it would have worked even in WW2 to keep any small slivers of light from escaping. If they can work that well - - you know they're good.)",

But overall I am happy and my window is small enough that I only needed one. They are long enough that I could fold a bit of the top part upwards and pin it to the wall to keep the sun from shining on the ceiling and keeping me up. Probably a better way to do it but I made it work. Would definitely buy again. Very easy to install.",

I accidentally ordered this thinking it had grommets, but it does not. It has short, separated fabric \"sleeves\" along the length of curtain panel for the rod to go through. It does its job though and fortunately the rod I bought went through the sleeves (1\" in diameter). I just hate the feeling of the polyester fabric. I haven't noticed that it reduces noise significantly, but I was mainly concerned about the light.",

However, between the edges of the curtains letting light through and the fact that TINY pin-pricks of light can be seen here and there on the fabric, I will say it won't get your room 100% dark in daytime. If you have a VERY bright room like mine, I will say a nice solution is to use this /with/ the <a href=\"\">ron-loc fabric</a>. That's that I did, and it is 100% dark even on the brightest of days.",

I am now able to walk into a cool apartment in the dead of Texas summer, because of these curtains.

I installed them in a downstairs, poorly heated bedroom. They're not going to duplicate double pane windows, but there was a definite increase in the heat level in the room.",
