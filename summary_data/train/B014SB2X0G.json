I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. if I had any complaints, it would be a way to block off the glove dryer so you get more air flow to the boots, make it a little more sturdy on the construction and the knob is a little hard to turn. Other than that it is a great product!",

The unit performs extremely well, and the construction is noted to be of a high quality. There's nothing quite like putting on warm boots and socks before work. The timer goes to only three hours, so extremely wet, larger boots may need a timer reset or two. I'll be using this everyday, for more than one cycle, so I'll repost if anything changes.

    "title": "MaxxDry Heavy-Duty Boot, Shoe, and Glove Dryer (2 Pairs)",
    "description": "The MaxxDry Heavy Duty Boot, Shoe, and Glove Dryer dries two pairs of boots, shoes, or gloves in about 1 hour. Use the MaxxDry Heavy Duty to safely dry sweaty ski boots, soggy gloves, or wet football cleats. The MaxxDry utilizes forced air and heats to 105-degrees F. (40.5-degrees C.) to quickly remove moisture to prevent the growth of fungus and bacteria that cause odors and deteriorates garments over time. Forced air comes from an internal fan that pushes warm air through boots, shoes, and gloves to circulate trapped moisture through and out of the garment. The MaxxDry Heavy Duty is safe to use on shoes, boots, and gloves and will not shrink or damage custom liners or delicate items. The MaxxDry Heavy Duty includes two, removable 16-inch extension tubes to handle taller boots, and 3-hour timer that shuts the unit off automatically, and a heat/no heat switch so it can be used with or without heat. Dimensions are 12 inches deep x 17 inches high (with extension tubes) x 15 inches wide. Comes with a 6-foot power cord; 1 year warranty.",
