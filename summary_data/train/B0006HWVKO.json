      "text": "The L445BK arrived yesterday in perfect condition and intact bulbs. Packing was very good which prevented shipment damage. I have another lamp that cost almost exactly double and I can not tell much difference between them. I did however install a daylight LED bulb vs the swirly CFL and it works exactly as I needed. No assembly required other than putting the clamp mount where I wanted and sliding the lamp post into it. I have not tried the built in 110 receptacle and do not plan to use that feature, but could be very handy for anyone needing a plug at desktop level. Very happy with this purchase...if things change over time I will amend the review.",

The Ledu L445Bk clamp on lamp more than adequately satisfied my needs. It has two light sources -- a ring lamp and a 100 watt energy-saving bulb, either of which provides adequate lighting.",
