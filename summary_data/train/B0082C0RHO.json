However when fed the lamb formula he started vomiting, dry heaving, and had diarrhea all night long. We switched Cory to another flavor of Primal Nuggets and he did fine. This could have been a chance occurrence, but Cory was accidently fed the food again and the same thing happened. Will not buy the lamb again.",

The pork is slightly firmer and the beef a bit difficult to crumble. Our dog has lost a little over a pound (about 2 to go) since we started this food and it not having as much itchiness and redness on his nose/snout. He seems healthier and happier. The kids enjoy seeing how excited he gets for his food every single time. If he could write the review, he would probably say, \"More!!!\"",

She has been suffering with allergies and I think it's a combination of grain and grass because she was constantly licking her feet to the point of being almost raw. Spent hundreds of dollars on vet bills and meds, and nothing really seemed to help. Once she started eating Primal grain-free I almost immediately (within a couple of days) noticed a big difference. So happy that she is doing so much better now. I will be keeping her on Primal.",
