I live in a crowed London router environment and speeds have been getting steadily worse over the last year. The move to the ac standard seems to have helped and I'm now getting speeds that match the wired performance on 5G. It's a big old router but has a pleasing businesslike design and more importantly seems to deliver great results. It's also a little cheaper than some of the other brands with similar spec.",

      "text": "I should have taken notice of some of the reviews on amazon which said that the unit I bought (the R7500 model) is not as reliable as the R7000. The unit just seems unstable, dropping connection frequently (although when it does work it's quick). Nether web chat support is friendly and responsive, but they are clearly used to people having problems with the R7500. Changing channels, speed etc. settings hasn't made a fundamental difference to performance, and now I'm 'turning it off and turning it back on again' fairly regularly. It'll soon be time to give up and buy the R7000, thereby chucking \u00a3160+ in the bin.",

      "text": "Great router and awesome wireless performance, however DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE APPLE TV! There is a fundamental (and well publicised) bug which Netgear still have to fix that stops the Aplpe Bonjour system from working, so Apple TV cannot connect to your computer, not can your iPhones, or iPads access anything stored on the PC . . . No sign of a fix in nine months - this product has been sitting on my shelf that long waiting (I am using my older NetGear N900 fine). So this is going in the car boot and I'm getting an Asus RC5300 when it is out.",
