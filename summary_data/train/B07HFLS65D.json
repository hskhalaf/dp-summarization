      "text": "At only \u00a3490, I jumped at the oppurtunity to buy this card. The MSI Armor cards are always underclocked, that's why they're cheaper but overclocking the card is an easy way to counter that fact. In terms of preformance, it is better than the 1070ti and preforms similar to a GTX 1080. Many reviews have marked this card down because it doesn't come with cables, but if your buying an RTX card then you should already have at least two 6+2 pin connectors and if you don't, then your machine is likely not powerful enough and will bottleneck the hell out of this card so you're better off getting something less powerful.",

Plays new titles at 4K with some of the settings turned down. Quite happy with it so far but expensive compared to what the 970 was 3-4 years ago. Not MSI fault just Nvidia going for more profits!",

I can play games such as Fortnite Battle Royale with high fps with no lag. Very good high quality, smooth, lag free gameplays. Only problem I have is it makes a noise when before the fans start to spin. I'm not sure why that happens or if its normal because I have never had a RTX GPU before. But other than that, I would definitly recommend this GPU!",

This is one of the most demanding titles out there right now so older games will have no problem. 2) Do not underestimate the size of this card. It only fit into my NZXT h440 case by encroaching into the unoccupied drive bay. If your case is smaller then you may need to get a bigger one or choose a different card. 3) In 2D mode and general desktop use the cooling fans do not spin which keeps the noise levels down.",

This gives you up to 6X the performance of previous-generation graphics cards and brings the power of real-time ray tracing and AI to games. The revolutionary NVIDIA Turing architecture, combined with our all new GeForce RTX platform, fuses together real-time ray tracing, artificial intelligence, and programmable shading to give you a whole new way to experience games. Ray tracing is the definitive solution for lifelike lighting, reflections, and shadows, offering a level of realism far beyond what\u2019s possible using traditional rendering techniques. Turing is the first GPU capable of real-time ray tracing. Artificial intelligence is driving the greatest technology advancement in history, and Turing is bringing it to computer graphics. Armed with Tensor Cores that deliver AI computing horsepower, Turing GPUs can run powerful AI algorithms in real time to create crisp, clear, lifelike images and special effects that were never before possible. A power supply of at least 750w is recommended for use with the graphics card.",
