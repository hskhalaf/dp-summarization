I called Toshiba tech support and let them listen to it over the phone. He said that's not normal and I should return it. Amazon sent the replacement which I received today. It's making the same sound. I called Toshiba again and let another guy hear it. He said the same thing. I'm not sure I want to try a third one. ON the Toshiba website they specifically mention that this drive is \"whisper quiet\". I'm very disappointed and frustrated.",
