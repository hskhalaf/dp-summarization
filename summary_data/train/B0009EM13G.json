      "text": "This is a great printer to buy, old but does the job. HP's are quality printers. There may be replacements for this one, but I wouldn't care, this works for my Windows 8.1 laptop very well. It is portable, fits on my desk and prints text or photos in B&W well. It does not shake my desk, like an even older cartridge printer I also have. Smooth, clear printing is the result. Check the manual with descriptions for the size footprint and DPI, \"dots per inch\" for printing. Overall, this is a good, competent printer to buy, not too expensive, and one that will work well with an older computer.",

The printer output is crisp and clear. Printing starts as soon as you hit the [print] button, and is fairly fast, especially for the price. Paper jams are very rare, and the innards easily accessible on the rare occasion that it happens. Finally, the printer is very compact, allowing you to utilize it even in tight quarters. Note that a large number of the negative reviews are due to issues with this printer and Vista. If you are running a Windows OS after Vista, you should be fine.",
