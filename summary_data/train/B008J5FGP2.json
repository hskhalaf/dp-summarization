It\u2019s a grippy footwear that holds its ground on different types of surfaces. It is also easy to clean and dry. Preferred orthotics by wearers also fit the interior pretty nicely.There were, however, users that came away dissatisfied with the sandal\u2019s lack of steadiness due primarily to its elastic laces. Further compounding the negativity that surrounds the Arroyo II are the sandal\u2019s underperformance against debris.",

I've found that the best thing to use to reattach then is contact cement, but for a product this expensive this shouldn't be necessary.",

The tongue isn't attached the same way other models are and there's a noticeable tendency for it to tuck under the sides of the sandal as you're pulling it on.

These held up to everything without giving him blisters. His pinky toe would sometimes peek out of the hole on the side, but nothing significant enough to cause blisters or discomfort. We put these to the test and they passed!",

The solution -- wear socks if it's really hot -- at least if your style sense will allow you to do that. The Arroyo II is (for me) the perfect hiking/walking the dog/knocking around sandal.
