      "text": "This camera has served me very well. I have been using it for 4 years straight with amazing results. As I have progressed as a photographer, I have realized that there are certain situations which really call for more some of the features offered in higher end models than this, but I would definitely suggest this (or any of the newer models of this) camera to anyone who is just starting to feel serious about learning photography. This camera is a great instrument to learn with. The articulating screen (it can actually pull out and swing around, not just tilt up and down) has proven to be amazingly useful for astrophotography, macro shots, self portraits, etc.",

I am extremely pleased with the the D5200 and would highly recommend DJT World (seller). Further, although it said it was \"body Only\" it came with a Nikon strap, battery and battery charger.",

Amazon had a great no interest financing on cameras if minimum payments were made with the Amazon card so we bought this as a family Christmas gift. The camera takes great pictures - especially during my son's soccer matches and uploading photos is extremely easy. The battery life is fantastic - and I even like the red color I chose. My favorite feature is being able to zoom, crop and position the photos (with multiple size ratios from 1x1 to a 16x9 widescreen) within the camera view screen - the options are even better than photo viewers found on my laptop.",

Amazon had the right price and the reputation of standing behind the sale that made my choice to purchase from them rather than the many other options available. A $100 rebate on an additional Nikon lens also was a factor.",

Nikon makes some quality cameras and the D5200 has a great balance of photo and video quality for under $1000 with a decent variable or prime lens. More than enough presets and forgiving auto modes for a beginner as well as full manual shooting. The focus is a bit loud on the 18-55mm VR lens during video with the camera's built in mic. I'd strongly recommend a lens hood for the kit lens, and certainly at least one prime lens if you are just beginning with DSLRs.",

Manual focus would avoid this problem.",

My only gripe is that it is harder to adjust settings using the buttons and scroll wheels, so you are forced to enter menus to make fine changes that could be more easily be done on my Canons. However, even for a main camera, not just a backup, I can still recommend the D5200.",

So far I am very satisfied with the layout of the controls, the light weight of the camera and quality photo's I have taken so far. As the weather gets better and I use the camera more I might be able to rate it higher. I traded my D3200 for this camera and I believe the D5200 turns on faster and is much easier to focus under some conditions. I would say you can't hardly go wrong with this camera for the price.",

It's a great camera that's easy to use, packed with features and produces amazing quality images. It will take a while to master the features, as the manual is pretty close in size to the bible, but if you are looking for quality images with minimal post-processing, then this camera is the way to go.",

The Nikon metered for the sky instead of the subjects. What is the point of the \"Effects\" option? I have computers to do effects. All I need is aperture, shutter speed, ISO, and auto focus. I don't need a micro processor to do my thinking for me, especially when it get the answer wrong. The auto focus is also unreliable. Why the camera focused on the background instead of the subjects is beyond me. I guess I'll have to read pages 28-31.",
