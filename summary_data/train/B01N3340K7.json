Got my new oil and opened it today and it has almost zero color. Ugh! Have to find a new brand now! I attached pictures showing the color difference of the old oil vs new. Left is new oil, right is old",

I\u2019m very susceptible to just overall crappy skin and I get pimples all the time, yet when I started using this rosehip oil, 90% of my ance just stopped. I use this stuff twice a day and a French clay mask a few times a week and I\u2019m just so happy about it. So yeah, definitely recommend!",

I have combo to oily skin, so I only use it once a week (right now since it is summer time), but I much rather prefer this product for moisturization as opposed to my daily facial moisturizer. The dropper is also great and dispenses as needed. A little goes a long way! I will definitely be buying this product again!",

When I opened the beautifully packaged product I happily discovered that this particular Rosehip Seed Oil was far superior than the other Rose Hip Oil I had previously purchased. It was a golden color, thick with the richness of Rosehip Seed oil, that I didn't feel or see in my other product. I will definitely repurchase this again. I will feature it on my You Tube Channel, LeadMeToPeace Jeanie in the near future. Thank you for such a wonderful product!! I am amazed!",
