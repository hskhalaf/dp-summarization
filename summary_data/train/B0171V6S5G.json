Getting finger protection at this price seemed to good to be true but the grip has been holding up really well over the first month that I have had them. I played keeper in college (years ago) and they feel a lot like Uhlsport gloves I used to use. If they only hold up for one season of rec soccer they will still be a tremendous value. As with any gloves, you should avoid exposing the latex to your sweat as the oil from your skin deteriorates the grip more quickly. I try to keep mine in the bag they came in as well. All in all these have been fantastic.",

He loves them and hasn't lost a game while wearing them. I had to revise this review from 5 stars to 2. The Velcro on the gloves will not hold the glove straps after only a couple months of indoor use. My grandson liked the gloves when he first got them, but the velcro wore out after a very short time and now the straps won't stay fastened. I'll have to see if the gloves can be repaired with some new velcro.",
