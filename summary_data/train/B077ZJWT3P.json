      "title": "Strange Fit - Good Value Shoe",
      "text": "I have to wrestle with these shoes to get them on, but once they're on they are comfortable. There is ample toe room, they are not too narrow, and the heel-box isn't tight once worn. The only issue is the struggle to actually get them on, where they wind up feeling too small. Ordering a .5 size up may help. I wear an 8.5 or a 9 - but i found the 8.5 to be an OK fit. Always err on the side of caution if you're unsure. I have not used these for running yet and I don't plan on - they are probably more suited for just casual sneaker use, but could be used for running if needed.",
