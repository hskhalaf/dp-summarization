I understand the benefits but I can't get behind the price per ounce, OVER $1. So each cup is $8. WOW!!!!",

      "text": "I purchased this to use in some Keto style recipes. Erythritol is supposed to be good for baking, but I found that it burned and the finished product did not taste sweet enough. Seems like it looses sweetness in the oven. The granular version is VERY difficult to dissolve, so recommend using it in something that is wet and will be mixed for a long time. I made some really good Keto Eggnog with the granular Swerve. The powdered is easier to dissolve but can also remain gritty if not adequately mixed. My second purchase was only powdered and a different brand. Both styles of Swerve are available at Whole Foods for the same price.",

It is probably just as well because it was too expensive for the amount of product you receive.",
