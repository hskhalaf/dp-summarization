The ends dont fold up, just press them folded in the opposite direction and then it lays flat like the pic. No shedding at all and solid construction. Definitely a good price.",

I love that it's wider than most hallway rugs so it covers the entire hall. I wish it came in a size large enough to cover my living room! Sometimes, with shag, the rug can flatten over time and look a bit rough in well traveled areas so I will come back to update in a few months!",

As such, this rug had a specific desired function when we bought it, and it has ably filled that role. Being shag, it is a challenge to thoroughly vacuum all little bits from within the fibers, and it is impressive to observe the seemingly endless rain of crumbs when shaking the rug outside. That said, this comes with the territory when purchasing shag rugs, and I have no complaints whatsoever.",
