By far this is better for the sole reason that it's soft on your skin. The two are pretty much identical, but when you're combing your beard the teeth from other one will irritate your skin if you comb it too many times. Since I'm growing a beard out after having a short one for a while, training my beard and combing with or without oil I have to comb it frequently to get it going in the right direction. This one is now the only one I use.",

There's a huge difference in how easy this comb is on my beard vs a plastic comb being harsh. You definitely need this comb for a longer beard. I will say to be careful with the finer tines. It's realistically a thin piece of wood, be careful and don't try bending them too much and it'll last quite a while. The sandalwood scent was very nice, not overly strong. Also I've just recently switched to their sandalwood beard balm and highly recommend that also.",

I would, and already have recommended it to every bearded brother I know. #noshavelife ..",
