I\u2019m most excited about being able to Bluetooth link it to my smart phone, download, and edit pictures so that I can upload amazing pictures to my social media quickly. So far it\u2019s very easy to operate. Light weight. Small so fits in my hand comfortably. May submit another review after I have really learned to work it but so far very pleased.",
