I haven't had a headboard in a few years and didn't remember this being this tall. Also, finish is a bit shiner than expected. Reminds me of old bedroom furniture that has a high gloss. So if the shiny gloss doesn't distract, it's a great piece and I would recommend.",

Panels are made to float in the uprights and center piece no glue needed. It's just a headboard after all and doesn't need to support any weight.",

So...was delightfully surprised when it arrived earlier than expected. It is a nice sturdy/heavy piece once put together. As with all lower end furniture there was a bit of grumbling as I worked with a couple of the bolts. Would be nice if there were those wood look stickers to place over the ends of the bolts, but is probably only something I notice. I do love that it blends nicely with my wood end tables. So close in color that few will notice. Love love love it!",

Some of the headboards on Amazon indicated that no hardwear was included, and for klutzes like my husband and me, that would have been a disaster!

Otherwise easy to assemble, you might want to have a helper as you need to hold several pieces together at the same time to insert the fasteners and tighten them so an extra pair of hands is very helpful.",
