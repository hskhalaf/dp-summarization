Now, playing it I'll note that there are not too many new things in Buy/Build mode and CAS items, but I also found that this is not the focus of this pack. There are three new aspirations, new game play, and, get this, Vampire Toddlers??? Sign me up! You can WooHoo in a coffin, turn other sims into Vampires, piecing eye colors, and new vampire needs (like drinking Plasma AKA Sims blood), and you can turn into a bat. I am in LOVE with this new pack!",

I've been dying for The Sims 4 to add more life states for ages as they're one of my top favorite things to play with in game. Well done, EA. I just hope you guys add witches or fairies sometime soon. :)",

That's a pain in the rear. An option to disable these attacks would be really welcome.",
