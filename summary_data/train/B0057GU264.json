When you inbox the chair, the chemical smell is TERRIBLE! It gave me an awful headache. I had to put it in another room to air out. We have had it for a week and it still smells awful. I hope the smell will eventually fade. I\u2019m shocked it is legal to use paint/varnish with such a toxic smell on a product for a child.",

The drawer slides all the way in and out the back which does get annoying sometimes. It's a nice place to keep crayons, paper, and coloring books though.

When we have guests for dinner, we sometimes even use it for her to sit and have dinner to make more room for the adults at the table. I saw there are other accessories that match it, like a bookcase. I may have to order that too!",
