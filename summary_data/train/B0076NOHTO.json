While reducing a sauce in it after roasting a chicken, I could see how well the heat is distributed by the heavy bottom by the pattern of boiling bubbles.

It's all I expected although I haven't used it yet I'm sure I'll use it a lot mostly for soups and stews. I'm just hoping I don't have to replace the knob too soon but this is the best place to get one for a decent price.",
