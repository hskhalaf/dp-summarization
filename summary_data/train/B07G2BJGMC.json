This is going to be a great addition to our road trip happening soon. Not to mention if the hotels dont have good cable, we can plug our DVD player in with the cords provided and watch all the movies we want. Also the packaging is stronger than i have ever seen. I may use it as an added safety for traveling. Very pleased!",

It was used both ways on this trip and I was glad I had this and very impressed with the battery life it made our trip go by fast. The only thing I see that could have been made better is the door switch for th CD player, seems to be a little flimsy. Other than that very happy with this player and reasonably priced.",

It also came with a car charger, wall charger, remote, and the av cables to connect it to a tv.",

This DVD player has some great features such has a 5 hour play time when fully charged up which is great for tent camping when no electric is available. Another great thing about this unit is not only does it play DVD's but you can also use SD cards to watch playback from digital video cameras which is really cool. We got digital video cameras and then at the end of the day would show off some of the footage we got which was really fun. Overall pretty impressed with this DVD player and it's a great value for the price if you travel or camp a lot.",

The screen is so much bigger than our old player without being obnoxious. They are also very light weight. Would definitely recommend these!",

It has 44 small buttons all the same shape, size and feel. At least I can remember where the advance button is because the disc has stopped. The picture is so so.

I think the standard for measuring the size of the screen is to measure diagonally. So, this is not actually a 12.5 inch screen. Like others have said, the packaging is exceptional.
