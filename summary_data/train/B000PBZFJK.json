That's a pretty bad fault for a Hummingbird feeder.",

It was tricky at first to figure out that the top red plastic feeder part does not really attach to the bottom base. Once you twist the bottle into the base after filling, everything is secure.

Easy to clean, and since the Kaytee 100506148 Electro Nectar needs to be changed out every 3 days, I was glad it was so simple to do. To deter the pesky ants, I sprayed WD40 on a paper towel and rubbed onto the pole from ground up about 2 feet. That left 2 feet or more clean below the feeder so no mishaps would occur with the birds. All in all, I heartily recommend this. I've packed it away now and will use again next summer.",

It was quite easy to do, but I suspect not everyone would attend to the problem (nor should they have to), which might put the birds at risk.

Once the silicone pulls off the bottle the entire feeder comes crashing to the ground or cement in my case. It broke! We put extra silicone on the rest of these feeders to prevent future breakage.

Cleaning them is a chore as well, all the little feeding holes get mold in them and unless you have pipe cleaners you'll have a tuff time geting it all out. I do recommend them, they are well made, should last a good long while.",

I would rather the birds empty them in 2 days than to let them sit and develop algae. I make 4 cups of sugar water at a time. Fill the bottles half way then store the left over water in the fridge.",

Birds can also perch on the feeder which many do, even hummers. There are several features that I like best that are not really advertised. Should the bottle break, it can be replaced with any standard-sized plastic or glass bottle. Best of all, by removing the top with its hummingbird holes, it becomes an oriole feeder.",

The feeding holes are small enough that flies and bees aren't able to get in, and I ordered an ant moat to use with the feeder, so that has helped a lot. Great product!",

My only disappointment was that the holes on this didn't have any flowers/shapes around them.
