I recently completed a bathroom remodel with large tiles on the floor and the shower walls. The tiles were porcelain, and they were thick. Frankly, this saw is not recommended for that kind of work, but it did the job just fine, and is now ready and waiting for my kitchen remodel. Go slow, keep it filled with water, and you'll be pleased with the results.",

It didn't end up taking that long but I now have it to use for future projects. The saw worked flawlessly and I would recommend it to anyone needing it for a small job or even several small jobs. I have a straight tile cutter as well so I only used this for the odd cuts. It cuts very fast. I used it on tiles 16 x 16' without the guide.",

I was and still am impressed with it's performance. For sure it is not the \"go to\" saw for a tile pro I would guess, but if you are a do-it-yourself type for the occasional tile job, it performs well. The blade stays adequately wet due to the water reservoir. The reservoir does accumulate waste from the tile, but that is expected. When needed, I rinse it out and fill it with water again. I used it to cut tile that was glued to mesh backing. I would recommend it.",

We did buy a special marble blade (not terribly expensive) but this saw was amazing! So impressed what we were able to accomplish with such an affordable saw!",

Cleaned out the reservoir periodically to keep the work area a little neater. I could have rented a saw, but knew I preferred taking my time and making the right cuts along the way. I did build a little T-square jig to handle cuts that were wider than 7 3/4\". All in all, it did the job in fine fashion. Next is the joy of grouting.",

I only do occasional tile projects, and it is great to have this on hand rather than having to borrow or rent one. I also like that it is not too big because it can go in my tool bin easily. Don't hesitate - just buy it and have fun cutting your tile.",

It\u2019s small and easy to store without taking up much space, and runs very quiet compared to other larger saws that I have used. The only thing I can think that this saw needs is a drain plug to release the water when you are done using it. But overall I think this saw deserves 5 stars!",

The motor housing and vents are under the casing. I was able to wash off the table with the hose without getting the electrical components wet underneath.

The reservoir can fill up with the tile debris so make sure to clean it out really well after you've finished.
