I needed a carrier for an airplane trip with my 4 month old though so I thought I would give the simple ring sling a try. I fell in love with this!!! It's easy once you practice a few times and it didn't make me hot has hell!! Added bonus is my child also loves it! Only big difference is that it is NOT a hands free carrier BUT compared to nothing it's way better!!",

I am using it for my 32lb toddler for occasional use, when she really wants to be close but I really need to be able to use an arm. I'm happy enough with it, but if I was planning daily use I'd probably get another Maya RS (Loaned mine to someone who dropped off the face of the earth lol)",

      "text": "This sling is a good active sling. You do have to be careful to tie it once you get it where you want it, as the material slides easy and can losen as you move. Because of how thin the material is, it can kind of cut into you if it gets bunched up anywhere around the shoulder. I have another brand which is more of a daily use, which has addittional padding along the edge and a pad on the shoulder by the ring. Very nice for longer wearing, but this one is great for my husband who runs hot, and for any active wear due to the breathability!",

Didn't work. The rails are too stiff that when you tighten it as much as you need to it would be painful for you and baby. This was cheap and you get what you pay for.",

I wonder if he doesn't feel as secure in it since nothing wraps BETWEEN/under his legs like other wraps do....",
