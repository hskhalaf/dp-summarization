Some 11s will fit fine and 10s are too small. In this case, the 11s were too big and the 10s were perfect. If you love the style and wish they were a tad darker, just use some mink oil on them to protect them and they turn to a nice shade of brown. I love Ariats, but it is a challenge to find a great fit. In this case, I hit the jackpot! Here\u2019s a picture after I used mink oil on them. Perfect shade and perfect fit!!!",

The nylon-ish socks I was wearing wore through and gave me a little mark on my leg from all of the walking I did with them on the day I got them, but my feet didn't hurt and that is just unthinkable for brand new shoes.",

I've checked other Ariat products and it seems to be a brand-wide change. The uppers still feel nice, with good quality leather, but come on, Ariat! Why would you put a plastic composite on the sole of a leather boot?",

Not just for \u201cwork\u201d or only because they\u2019re for \u201ccowgirls\u201d. I read several reviews that the size was off or to order up/down but mine fit true to size 100%",
