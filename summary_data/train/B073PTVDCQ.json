The great part is that my son absolutely loves his new indoor jungle gym. Total use so far = 1 18-month-year-old played for a total of 2-3 hours. Biggest Issue = A large rip at one of the seams only after 2-3 hours of play.",

I would have bought a cheaper one, that is similar, if I knew it didn't come with balls. The other one clearly labeled that it didn't come with balls. So the price was justified.",

It does take a little finesse to collapse some of the components but after looking like an idiot for a few minutes just give in and use the included instructions and you'll get it. Great product!

      "text": "The only thing I wished was different were the ties. I'd prefer velcro instead. The ties don't hold it together too well. I have to keep adjusting it with the tunnels, especially when your child is back and forth traveling through them. The material started to rip from the tugging, which is why I prefer velcro. I plan to buy velcro to make the durability better.. It also has the straps on the outside for stakes to use in ground for outdoors, but no stakes included. Another thing you'll have to buy if you plan to use outdoors.. Other than that, its a great product. My son loves it.",

Because we're limited on space, some days we just put up parts of it, but that keeps it interesting for him. It's holding up well so far. The only complaint I have is the way the tunnels attach to the other structures- he gets frustrated with the gaps that occur during play because they just attach with two tie points. He wants me to come tuck the tunnel back inside the opening to the other structure.",

If your child leans against any part of it it will not support their weight and they will absolutely fall over and the playpen will collapse. The tunnels do not connect securely and are held together by small strings connected to the ends of each individual piece that you have to tie together. If you are watching your children while they play then they should be quite alright and enjoy themselves.",

This resolved by putting buckets in the pit. He will fill up the buckets and empty them and do it over and over again. Just a side note. His two aunts also got in the pit with in. They are both small in stature (one is in college and one is in high school).",
