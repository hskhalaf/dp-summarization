Reviews outside Amazon were also positive. They all outweighed the negative reviews. It is now April 2018 and guess what, it does not work. It was working last week on my Macbook but this week no joy. I have reinstalled the latest EZLink driver, still nothing. I have tried different leads, nada. Take my advice, along with the advice of others, it stops working after a few months with no explanation on any forum as to why.",

      "text": "Absolutely fantastic. I was a little concerned the image quality might not be all that great seeing as it is powered by USB. However, if anything the image is actually better than my laptop screen! There is the tiniest bit of input lag on the screen buy hardly noticeable, but it is there. A minor niggle is that case isn't all the great as a stand but it is perfectly functional, it is good enough. I could get a separate stand but then that is just something else that needs to be carried. Not worth knocking a star of for that though.",

The screen is actually larger than expected but after a quick panic I can report that in it's case, it will just fit in to a 17\" laptop bag. Thought this may be helpful to know if you travel a lot like me",

      "text": "Purchased for a summer of travelling while web-developing. I was sceptical that a monitor powered purely by USB shouldn't be any good, but was brilliantly surprised. Probably not suitable for gaming or photo/video editing, but I have my main monitor for that. Great for browsing, writing text/code or watching video, and I actually prefer it to the powered/HDMI monitors in my client's office. The case also doubles as a very sturdy stand.",
