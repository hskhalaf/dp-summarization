These options definitely help with adjusting fit and comfort. The price was pretty good at $45 and I was thinking of possibly purchasing another pair but when I looked at other colors, black or blue, they were $75 dollars, $30 more for the same shoe. What's up with that I don't know. If they were the same price I would have already ordered but not at &75.",

Honestly, I am surprised that as big of a company as is Amazon, why they don't send the manufacturers some examples of US size feet. I gave it 4 stars for now, but as I only wear these shoes on a limited basis I will be concerned about quality construction and materials...or the lack thereof. So if I experience problems in those areas I will update my review.",
