Pros: - cheap - effective - quiet Con: - Difficult to empty dirty water. Takes a lot of shaking and results in a bit of a mess around the kitchen sink.",

Depends on your water how it will produce/how long it goes on a gallon. I prefer this type of device because of low maitanance /no changing filters or routine tank cleaning. I also prefer due to the water being boiled prior because the air released from these vaporizers will be free from contamination.",

When this fails in a year or two maybe longer you just buy another one for $15. The hygrometer will likely last for years and years.

So you have to fill and dump multiple times to get all the little black particles it makes out. I also have to use far more salt than the directions say but I think it's just the water quality where I live.. Not bad for the price but I think I will upgrade to a better quality one.",
