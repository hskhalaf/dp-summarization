The mask does clean your face but not as thoroughly as other clay masks I've tried. it's a fun product (I actually like the tingly sensation) and I will use up the jar, but I probably won't repurchase.

I have found that after it puffs out to over a half inch, you can either wash it off at that point, but I have found that if you just rub it in again, it starts the process all over. My granddaughters would use this every time they were over. I got them their own jar, and they love it",

It comes with a little plastic applicator you use to scoop the product out and apply to your face. Don't place it too close to your nose and of course eyes as it bubbles up a lot! After it finishes bubbling (and you take pictures because it looks hilarious) you rub it in and use a wet washcloth to wipe it off. It leaves my skin extra soft feeling.",
