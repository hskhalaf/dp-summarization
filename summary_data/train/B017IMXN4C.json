The number and quantity of prizes allowed for prizes to be given out at a variety of events. My only complaint is that there are a lot of whistles - children love them but they are quite annoying. This product has 5 stars because the kids loved them and there is quite a selection for the price.",

I\u2019m pleasantly surprised by the variety of trinkets for both boys and girls but I\u2019m more pleasantly surprised by the quality. It feels sturdier than dollar store party favors and will hold up longer. The only downside is that there isn\u2019t equal amounts of everything so not every kid is going to get the same toys. I\u2019m still very happy with my purchase and highly recommend this box.",

Every kid hit someone in the face with that string and they didn't know what do with the toy (ages 4-8)... I bought this party pack for Pin\u0303ata stuffing. When the Pin\u0303ata was opened, the toys came crashing down onto the floor, and mostly broke into pieces since they were all plastic, and we were on a hardwood floors. The kids were sad. Some of the toys that were included were WAY to big to fit inside the Pin\u0303ata...If you are buying this for party favor bags, then you will be happy.
