That's the way the SSD cache in this unit is designed to perform, and it's made boot times and app load times quicker. It's also big and quiet, which is also a plus. It's also one of the last drives without the new larger sectors, which can be a boon for compatibility. All in all, I couldn't ask for more!",

The comparison was made between a standard Seagate 7200 RPM drive and the Seagate Momentus XT. There were clearly noticeable improvements particularly for the data intensive applications. The PCMark score jumped from 6909 to 7657 (11% improvements) and the HDD General Usage score jumped from 6.9 Mb/s to a whooping 18.6 Mb/s (170% improvements !). The drive also runs very quiet.

You can get Oracle Virtual Box and then create your VHDs and they will work blazing fast even when used externally. The secret is the transfer speed, the SATA cable and the high read-write speed thats magnitudes faster than IDE and USB. Don't hesitate if you are looking for a storage device. I've used these for two years now and no issues. IMPORTANT - Just make sure to get good quality cables and drive covers. Those will protect your HD from vibration, moisture and damage.",

But the update to sd28 fixed all these issues! Now it is running nice and smooth! Goto the main seagate site for firmware updates.",

I just didn't want to buy a plain old 7200 RPM disk for about 50-60$ but didn't want to spend over 300$ for a top end SSD. Even the top end SSDs don't have the big hard disk sizes; like over 500GB. Didn't mind paying a little more. The performance has been better than an ordinary 7200 RPM disk. Boot times are pretty decent and overall performance even when running virtual machines is quite good. I like it.",
