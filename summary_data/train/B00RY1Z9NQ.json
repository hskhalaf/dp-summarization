It may not be perfectly accurate in recording sleep time, but it is nice to get a general idea. The only downfall is that when I go over a particular bridge, it counts the cracks in the bridge as steps. The band on the vivofit 2 is much nicer than that of the vivofit 1.",

Tried the Garmin Vivofit with heart monitor and felt too heavy on my wrist and kept twisting around. This Vivofit 2 is best! Accurate and comfortable. Try out different colored bands, but make sure you buy Garmin brand, not a knockoff without the turnkey lock on the back of the button that closes the band. Has never come off yet! Also, be sure to wear fairly tightly on wrist for accuracy; not loose like a bracelet watch. Only wish the time were better lit for darker places.",

Only issue I have is when I received Garmin, it had a small little scratch on the screen in the bottom left corner. I thought I could ignore but it actually bothers me a lot especially when it was not caused by me. I'm hoping I will be able to exchange without problems because I spent a lot on this to get with something on there not created by myself.",

    "description": "Style:US Version| Color:Black\n\nACTIVITY TRACKER WITH MOVE BAR AND ALERTS\n * Features 1+ year battery life\n * Reminds you to stay active with move bar and audible alert\n * Learns your activity level and proposes a personalized daily goal\n * Shows steps, calories, distance and time of day on backlit display; monitors sleep\n * Automatically syncs to Garmin Connect to save, plan and share progress\n\nGet up and get moving with v\u00edvofit 2. It\u2019s the only activity tracker with a 1+ year battery life and backlit display. It even reminds you to stay active throughout your day with its move bar with audible alert that lets you know when you\u2019ve been idle for an hour or longer.\n\nTELLS TIME AND \u201cTIME TO MOVE\u201d\nResearch shows prolonged periods of inactivity such as sitting at a desk decreases your body\u2019s production of fat-burning enzymes. You can reverse that effect by taking frequent, short walk breaks throughout your day. And while you might lose track of time and forget to move, v\u00edvofit 2 knows. A red move bar appears on the display and a gentle alert sounds after one hour of inactivity. The move bar builds every 15 minutes until you reset it by walking for a couple of minutes. Don\u2019t want to be bothered with a beep every hour? Set up your compatible mobile device to vibrate as your cue to move.\n\n24/7 WEARABLE\nv\u00edvofit 2 follows your progress 24/7 and shows your steps, calories, distance and time of day on its easy-to-read, backlit display. Set the sleep mode when you go to bed and it will monitor your rest. At Garmin Connect, you can see your total sleep hours as well as periods of movement and restful sleep. v\u00edvofit 2 is water-resistant\u00b9, so you can shower or get caught in the rain, worry-free. And thanks to its 1+ year battery life, you can keep this activity tracker on your wrist around the clock, helping you turn good intentions into lifelong habits. The band is soft and flexible and features a quarter-turn buckle that secures it to your wrist. Optional accessory bands in various color schemes let you coordinate your v\u00edvofit to your wardrobe.\n\nPERSONALIZED DAILY GOALS\nv\u00edvofit 2 learns your current activity level, then assigns an attainable daily goal. As you meet your milestones, v\u00edvofit 2 will adjust your goal for the next day, gradually nudging you toward a healthier lifestyle. At Garmin Connect, our free online fitness community, you can earn virtual badges and view your progress.\n\nKEEP COUNT\nWhen you\u2019re ready to take the next steps toward better health, v\u00edvofit 2 has additional features to keep you motivated. Use the activity timer to record a timed activity, such as a walk or run, which can be saved and sent to Garmin Connect. You can also pair v\u00edvofit 2 with a heart rate monitor\u00b2 during fitness activities, such as a run or a cardio class at the gym, to record your heart rate and zone data and get more accurate calorie burn information. For detailed calorie tracking, you can create an account at MyFitnessPal and link it to your Garmin Connect account.
