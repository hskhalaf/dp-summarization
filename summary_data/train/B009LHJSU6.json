But what they don't tell you that in the description is that this pitcher is FULLY LINED with plastic. Yes, the stainless steel body is purely cosmetic. I'll leave it to the experts to determine whether it is actually BPA free or not. Pity that it wasn't steel as advertised.",

      "text": "This claims to be better than plastic pitchers due to plastic changing the property and flavor of water. I do prefer my beverages, especially water, to be contained in a glass or stainless steel container. This product is advertising that fact, yet the clear portion the pitcher that the water touches, as well as the filter holder the water runs through, are both made of plastic. Now tell me how that makes sense or is at all helpful? I am tempted to return this thing, but I have not seen one made from all glass or steel as of yet. Seriously Brita?! I thought you were better than that. I don't like \"trickeration\".",
