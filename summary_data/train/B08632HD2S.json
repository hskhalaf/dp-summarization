This device is the 12.9 inch version with much improved performance and amazing display. In fairness, the iPad will never be a replacement for my desktop Mac or MacBook because it still uses iOS rather than OS but the iPad is my convienient go to daily device. Sold by and supplied by Amazon with fast free delivery.",

The only gripe is that the camera quality is a bit crap compared to our Iphone 7 plus but we're not really going to be taking many photos with this device so we're not too bothered about that. The screen quality is outstanding and quite simply amazing and the Apple pencil works great with it! I'll probably come and update this in a few months after some more substantial usage.",

The colours on the screen are vibrant, the systems work fast, the iCloud updates keep everything synchronised, I bought a 256GB memory iPAD which means I can download so much more than before. I also bought a keyboard case so I can see the whole screen when I type and I would recommend that if anyone is buying an iPAD, just try and gather the extra money to buy an iPAD PRO",

I've started using my iPad for absolutely everything now! I can draw, play games, stream media, apply for jobs, video chat friends and family and much much more. It's really great for note taking or keeping diaries too. I didn't think I'd use it as much as I do! If you're considering buying one, go for it!",
