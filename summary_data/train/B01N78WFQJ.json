First I noticed the expiration date was very short considering I was buying two boxes (less than 3 months out \u2014 much shorter than any I have bought before). Second and most concerning to me was that most all of the bars in one of the boxes were very small. Several were less than half the size of the normal bars. This was very disappointing, as this was the only place had been able to buy in this quantity.",

Second, and I guess last, the odor and taste are, let's see, how can I describe it...let's say someone decided to wash all the feet of the homeless and then took that water and made food with it.
