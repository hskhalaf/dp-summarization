I feel the Almond Mint is less moisturizing beyond the scent over the other products lines such as fig and bamboo. I especially like the seasonal fragrances which Chaz Dean does state is more moisturizing. At this price point, one can't go wrong though.",

All I could get were little bottles of the sweet almond mint. So, I looked on Amazon and there this was in a bigger size, still not the 16 oz but bigger than what I could get on QVC.
