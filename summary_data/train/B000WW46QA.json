Secondly, the crepes will be VERY thin unless you hold the crepe maker in the batter for at least 10 seconds. Still, it works MUCH better than the crepe pan I bought. It makes crepe much easier and they are more uniform. This is important if you want to make a crepe cake.",

So no instructions. I had a friend that has one luckily, so I knew how to use it. And I'm sure you could find the instructions online if you needed to. But does make it something you wouldnt 'gift' to someone. Other than that, I love it. Super easy to use.",
