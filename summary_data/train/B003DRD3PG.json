After a disappointing review of my recent bone scan, I realized that I have to take 4 a day. 500 is per serving size, and serving size is 2. Therefore all these years I have only been taking half of my necessary requirement for bone health. I can only say that I am chagrined because I thought I was pretty smart about my health. Now I have to start taking a prescription because of my ignorance, and I have TWO college degrees.",

They're chewable. but they're not soft like I've had them before. These ones are tough. So it is obviously old.

They are a little on the sweet side for me, but am happy with sweet because it's better than a vitamin flavor/taste. The gummies are soft and easy to chew. In fact, this last bottle was the softest or freshest gummies I've had, so I will definitely look for this supplier again.",

I like them better than tablets. My only request of the manufacturer might be to make them a little less 'sugary'. Overall, I recommend this product as it has proven to help me maintain a higher level of vitamin D and calcium ( I am tested every 3 months).",

It is not necessarily dangerous unless you're getting a lot of Vitamin D elsewhere, since the NIH-recommended adult daily max is 4,000 IU, and one serving (2 gummies) has 1,000 IU. However, I also take fish oil, eat salmon somewhat often and take the vitafusion multivitamin with 800 IU Vitamin D. The recommended value is only 400 IU. Plus one serving is only giving you 50% DV of calcium. However, this is a great chewable option for those also allergic to dairy, which I am, so for now I will take it, but wish the company would adjust the formula.",

I guess if you are really set on getting enough calcium and don't like dairy products, this would be a good alternative. I love milk, cheese, ice cream...all dairy products...so getting enough calcium isn't a very big challenge for me.",
