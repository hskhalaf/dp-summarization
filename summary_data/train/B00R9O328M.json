First Alert keeps replacing them but it is not worth the trouble. About to call and get 4 replaced again and hope they have fixed the product.",

I've tried every recommendation from First Alert customer service with no improvement.

      "text": "Seriously - NOT ANDROID COMPATIBLE? In this day and age? I know the description said homekit compatible, but it doesn't say apple ecosystem only. Very disappointed and can't understand why they would do this, I have wifi thermostats, locks, garage door openers, light switches and everything else that is fully compatible with android, but not this ridiculous smoke detector? Come on! How hard woujld it be to develop an android app for it? It's worthless to me because I have no apple devices and refuse to buy apple devices. And you can't initialize it and set it up without an iPhone or ipad. Guess I will be purchasing only Nest Protect smoke alarms.",
