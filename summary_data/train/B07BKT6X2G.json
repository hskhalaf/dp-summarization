Main reason for the 4 stars is because the hair takes for ever to dry. Over night air drying and didn\u2019t dry. Sometimes I even use the hair dryer on low. Also I feel like they could have put more songs/talking for when outside and under water. I\u2019m also concerned about mold on the inside as it always seems to still be wet.",
