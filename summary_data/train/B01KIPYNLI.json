Yes, it was cold outside and the rubber was cold, but these are made for ice and snow (allegedly).

These are junk and I would highly recommend any other option.",

I was skeptical they would work especially since they aren't very expensive but they seem to work great. Hopefully they'll hold up long term. If you're in between sizes, go up. You don't want them too small or they won't fit over your shoes correctly.",
