They had good reviews, the price was decent, and they worked with his team colors, so I thought it was a good idea. Well, it was - sorta. He liked the fit, and the way they felt on his feet. However, by League Finals, there was a huge rip in the sole, and no reason for it, as he wears them only indoors in wrestling rooms, on mats, and on gym floors. Now he's off to playoffs, and I'm scrambling to find him a new pair! So disappointing.",
