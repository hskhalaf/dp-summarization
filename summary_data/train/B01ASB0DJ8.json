      "text": "Very poor design, quality and customer service from Intel. I used this only a few times over the period of a year, mostly just to play with for fun. When I booted it after several months it required a Windows Update, which CAUSED IT TO OVERHEAT. It was literally hanging from the TV, with plenty of venitlation. The Intel team recognized the flaw but still provided no recourse for replacing or refunding the item. I am going to contact Amazon to see if they will step in, because they are usually amazing. I would NOT recommend purchasing this item.",

They probably don't have the processing power to run any major applications at 4k, but I was super surprised when I plugged one into a 4k TV and it actually went full resolution (3840x2160). These are great. I got several of them almost a year ago, and they are all working fine so far. My only issues have been caused by automatic Windows 10 updates (ARG!) which isn't Intel's fault. They are more than powerful enough for my needs (playing videos, presentations etc... on display TVs).",

The new model offers very acceptable performance for basic tasks such as office or web browsing. It is not a device that you will do lots of HD video editing on, but it is not aimed at that. It can be hidden nicely behind a TV and works well with a bluetooth keyboard and mouse. Nice having USB 3.0 port in addition to the USB 2.0 port. Comes with micro USB power adapter, note that this is a 3A power adapter, much higher power than most cellphone chargers.",
