Lastly the location for the vents for the motor are on the end sides of the handle. that's where I tend to grab it, but again an easy adjustment of my hand position.

And the guy on the video is like crank it up to 6 ~7400rpm~... so far it\u2019s helped take out some swirl marks but no scratches at all, and just put more finer swirl marks.
