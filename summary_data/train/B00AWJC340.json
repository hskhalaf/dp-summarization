Also now that I've used it a while I can say it works great for neck support, I use it on my side when sleeping sometimes and between the knees also. Great pillow. OLD REVIEW: Uhhhh, is this a joke?? (See photos) not like the photo of the products. It\u2019s tiny, flat and not that supportive nor is it very large. This is a joke. Seriously, a joke. Where is the zero STAR selection?",

I like the fact it comes with a washable cover, just wish the cover fit a little more snugly, but maybe that's to allow for shrinkage. I haven't had to wash it yet.",

It'll stay put wherever you place it on your couch or bed, that's for sure. It grips other fabric well and stays in place. Be wary of others like this that are too soft. Not sure if it would hold up over weeks or months of daily use because I didn't use it like that. It seems to be very high quality memory foam and would hold up as well as any other though.",

However, it does provide enough support to help a little but is not the firmness I was aiming for. When it arrived, I wasn't convinced I received the right item as it was squished as tightly as it could be into a shrink-wrapped blob that took two hours to re-inflate to the proper shape.",
