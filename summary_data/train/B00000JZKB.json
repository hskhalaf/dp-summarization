      "text": "This is a great calculator for Finance/Business Majors and MBA candidates. It is sufficient for the majority of coursework an accounting/finance major would be taking, and it's allowed on the CFA exam. Better yet, it doesn't require RPN (Reverse Polish Notation... yes, that's what it's actually called) which is unintuitive like many HP options use. The one caveat: If you're concentrating in finance and taking course work focused on fixed income or derivatives, you may prefer a scientific calculator like the ti30/ti34 or a graphing calculator. These courses can involve some simple but very tedious algebra so calculators with variables and multi-line displays can be helpful.",

This is an excellent financial calculator. You can use it for ordinary adding, subtracting, dividing and multiplying but you can also use it for more complicated things like figuring out payments on mortgages and other loans at various interest rates and with various repayment times.",

    "description": "Texas Instruments BA II plus Financial Calculator for business professionals and students features are that it performs common math as well as various financial functions; the Worksheet mode includes tables for amortization, bond, depreciation, and compound interest, Built-in memory for storage of previous worksheets, Can perform cash-flow analysis and advanced list-based statistics and a Slide-case included to protect screen.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nWe're definitely taking this along with us the next time we shop for a house. Though it takes a little effort to master the collection of financial worksheets available on the Texas Instruments BA II Plus, you'll be glad you invested the time and money in this fine financial calculator.\n\nThe BA II Plus operates in standard calculator and worksheet modes. The standard mode lets you perform common math as well as operations involving the time value of money--that is, applications such as mortgages or annuities in which payments are equal and evenly spaced. You can also perform trigonometric functions in standard mode.\n\nThe more hard-core worksheet mode includes tables for amortization, bond, depreciation, and compound interest. If you're not familiar with such calculations, the very helpful user's manual will guide you through the process. All previous worksheet values are stored in memory, so you don't have to retype all the bond maturity or cash flow analysis figures.\n\nThe average user who wants to calculate a basic loan payment will be more comfortable working in the standard calculator mode. We were using the BA II Plus tools for calculating basic interest and payment periods within minutes. Still, it's good to know that the more advanced features are available for those who require heavy-duty financial computing.\n\nFinance students and average users alike will find much to like in the Texas Instruments BA II Plus. --John Frederick Moore",
