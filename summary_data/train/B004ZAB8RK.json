      "text": "When we opened the package the material surrounding the playing surface had several greasy hand prints that will not come off. In addition, the bars on the bottom used to keep the board from warping were not tightened. One fell off on the ground and the box was full of loose nuts and washers. Another was just about to fall off. Clearly this item missed the last stage where the nuts are tightened and there must have been no quality control inspection. The item arrived on time",

You can pay a whole lot more, but strictly from the gaming perspective, this is absolutely a great table!! Be advised... I bought the 16' and it is heavy. You'll need some help to unbox it, get the legs on, and get it upright where you want to position it without damaging it. I had three strong people... four would have been better and a bit safer for the table itself.",

The table was fairly easy to put together, a little tricky to level it so that the discs slide evenly. We did get it level and so far have really enjoyed playing. You don't need an special skills to play the game, ages 5 to 95. Would highly recommend this table -lots of fun.",
