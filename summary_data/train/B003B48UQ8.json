Unfortunately, many manufacturers keep modifying their products so that it's very difficult to know what version is shipping and whether it will work with DD-WRT. The E3000 has only one version and it works with DD-WRT. I was able to reflash it with no problem and it works great! The product came in original packaging with the standard accessories, instructions, and CD. Appearance very good without dents, scratches, or dust.",

At which point it was already a product that was at least 3 years old. it has lasted me about three years and today after a bit of researched I found it has been \"bricked\". Which basically means its fried I think. Had a bad storm here and I guess the power must have went out though wasn't at home at the time. Even though it was plugged into a surge protector it must have still been overloaded. Nothing wrong with it, not the fastest speeds but it worked well on 2 or 3 devices at a time.

The only shortfall on the E-3000 and others in this series is the built-in antenna..On my previous G model I installed a high gain antenna that Linksys sells.

The heat problem is easily solved by putting 4 bottle caps under each corner for better airflow and cooling. Now the unit does not get as hot. As far as the desktop software called \"Cisco Connect\"- it's a nice feature for those who don't mess around with router settings. But pretty much useless for advanced users. For example if you decide you want to change some advanced settings by logging into the 192.168.1.1 web interface, the \"cisco connect\" interface will apparently become unusable- strange.

Setup is trivial- run the CD, then plug in the router. 2.4 and 5 gHz setups are nicely separate- you can give each a different name, channel and configuration (if you want to). Question is- is this router really better than older or cheaper routers? I had the chance to replace an old Linksys 160, a Cisco 1000, and a Netgear WNDR 3700 with a Cisco E3000. The result: it is about 25% stronger than the 160 or the 1000, and maybe 10-15% stronger than the Netgear. This is with 2.4 gHz. Range was awful with both 5 gHz routers. It is just stronger enough to detect reliably with appropriate software.",

Best of all...no more screaming kids (and wife) when the movie freezes 10 minutes into the showing! I am very happy with the purchase.",
