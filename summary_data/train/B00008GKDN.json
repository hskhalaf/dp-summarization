To my surprise, never once it got stuck provided, the girdle is properly seasoned. Now I can make paper thin dosas (South Indian crepes) and never have to worry about things getting stuck. Very happy with the purchase! Oh, I forgot! My iron levels are back to normal just after 2 months of using cast iron pots and pans.",

I will add, being cast iron, it conducts temperature very well, and I have found I need to reduce my stove temperature to keep from burning my eggs.

I could never get it to heat evenly \u2014 supposedly one of the great benefits of cast iron \u2014 and I could never get the pan sufficiently seasoned that pancakes didn't stick to it horribly. Finally, I was heating it up one day, on medium heat, and it sprouted a big fat crack down the middle. On the stove. Heating up. Not doing anything a cast-iron griddle shouldn't do. I'll contact Lodge to see about that lifetime warranty, but I find returning products a pain, so I thought a review was in order nonetheless.",

Granted it was at high heat (500 degrees) because we were grilling a pizza, but we understood the the pan could take that high temperature. I tried cleaning it and it two weeks later, the grill \"stains\" are still there. I am disappointed because we wanted this pan to be our go-to pan for virtually everything--including grilled cheese sandwiches, pancakes. Every time I look at it, I go, \"ugh.\"",

If you're considering getting this, go for it. We use it all the time, so much that it earned a permanent spot on the stove. There was a small hole when we received it. We called customer care and then everything sorted out.",

Very satisfied with Lodge. Price was no part in decision but it is a great deal.",

The process of a replacement is not too involved but it is still a hassle to go through at a time like this. Also it says preseasoned but it still make a sticky mess. Had to re season twice before a true non stick surface built up. I will be returning this for one that hopefully has not holes or indents.",
