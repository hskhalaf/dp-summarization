More than any other object of study, it accelerated my understanding of the language.",

This is an important edition to a Java dev's toolkit since Java 7 and it reduces the possibility of resource allocation and exception handling errors. 2) Stream, and lambdas: Bloch talks about best practices for the most important additions to Java since generics, including, interestingly enough, avoiding using Streams *too much*. 3) Optional and static methods in interfaces. Bloch asks developers to consider usage of Optional carefully for performance reasons. Oddly enough, he doesn't discuss Java 9 modules that much, but personally I don't mind as I have issues with the way they were implemented.",

If you touch any code sample, the device jumps you to a very far away location in the book (e.g. from 11% to 97%) and there is no way to get back. You just have to reconstruct where you were, which is a slow process on an e-reader. I wish I could say that the problem is avoidable, but I find that I frequently touch the code snippets by accident as I click from page to page or just unintentionally brush the screen. Clearly, this wasn't tested very well!",
