I recommend buying it to the those that are just a little curious. As for the avid VR people I think this is a little a low level (NOW not when new) set.",

I feel like you should consider buying new padding that is better fit for this. Second, the touchpad is a bit annoying. Having your hand in this air constantly gets tiring and sometimes isn't too responsive. The price I paid is fair I believe, which was around 60$, though the latest Samsung Gear VR might be worth your time and money just a little more.",

I require corrective lenses, which don't fit well under the headset. Because the focus mechanism is singular, I can't get lenses to focus properly for both eyes at the same time, so I get a picture that's half right. That makes using the headset for more than a brief time fatiguing. The ability to adjust each lens independently would make it perfect. Content is still light I think and the physical controls are inadequate, but these are things that we can accept at this relatively early stage.",

Like I said, the 360 cameras google streetviewer (one of my favorite apps) and the like use need to catch up to make this truly spectacular. My father normally wears glasses, but he just adjusts his viewing and does not need to wear them on the VR. Computer generated content is much clearer than the ones from the 360 cameras, like I said.

The Google Daydream View is much better, and even though it at the time (December 2016) is only compatible with the Google Pixel and Pixel XL more phones, from a number of manufacturers, are on the way. Unlike the Samsung Gear VR will only ever be compatible with a small number of Samsung phones.",

It's image quality is not pristine, as it magnifies your phone screen, but the effect of VR is not diminished. If you're looking for high definition you'd most likely want to go with the Occulus Rift. At 1/4 the cost and mobile, the Gear VR outweighs the clarity of the Rift in my opinion. Great buy, and bonus store keeps adding new apps all the time.",

Fog can be fixed easily with some anti-fog spray anyway. Overall you get much more than what you're paying for, purchasing this to go along with your current model Galaxy or Note is a no-brainer nonetheless.",

Of course, there is a long way to go with VR, but this is something to get excited about. If you need to get something for your significant other or your kid who loves tech? Look no further. You can make someone's Christmas with this as a gift.",

If you've never bought a VR headset, I'd still recommend a cheap <$20 viewer. If you want to upgrade to a more durable and finished product, this is it.
