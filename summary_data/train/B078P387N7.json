As a double bag, my wife and I love it. Plenty of room, and warm and snoozy. Zipped apart into two bags you have one massive bag for me and one slightly less massive bag for her. There are oversized convenient zippers, a drawstring to cinch the top, and did I mention it\u2019s huge? This double sleeping bag produces long, full nights of rest, proven! We absolutely love it!",

Warmed up quite quick while I tested it out. Liner pattern and and faded color is a nice added touch.",

It is hard to wash normal sleeping bags so a removable liner is a perfect solution. I was impressed with an extra section of padding to covers the zipper to keep out any possible drafts. It was designed smartly to have a section for a pillow that hangs over the actual sleeping bag. The only thing I wish was bigger was the stuff sack. I am very good at folding things to fit back in their original bag but this gave me a run for my money. :) I loved the grey and turquoise color combination.",

Pic shows a 6\u2019 measuring tape for perspective. This is perfect. Cant wait for camping season. I fit really well. Love that it converts to two bags. Love the built in pillow pockets.

      "30\u00b0F TRUTEMP COMFORT RATED INSULATION - This means that we rate our sleeping bags to optimal comfort, not survival level. You will be warm and cozy at 30 degrees Fahrenheit / -1 degree Celsius. And in the chance that your King Cove gets wet, don\u2019t fret! The insulation can still retain heat for survival. This sleeper also has a hood that can be cinched for freezing temperatures. Simply cinch the hood tight with the built-in draw-cord to reduce heat from radiating away.",
      "RIPSTOP FOR DURABLE WEAR - The outside quilt has rugged 70D X 220T DWR Ripstop Poly for durability. This quality design on the exterior lining keeps your sleeping bag in excellent condition to ensure that it keeps up with you, no matter what the adventure is!",
