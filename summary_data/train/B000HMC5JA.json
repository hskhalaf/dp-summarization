I've managed to dent all the way around in my efforts, from squeezing this thing onto the lid, and still have no pasta sauce. Alas- I thought I had found a way to jar opening independence in the kitchen! Guess I will have to keep looking.",

I have used it to open screw top wine bottles as well as much larger jars of jam, sauce, etc. The opener takes up almost no space in the drawer and the price is reasonable. Can't say enough good things about it.",

Having two functional hand grips makes it quite easy to use. Using this design of lid opener on a glass container is not without its risks, though, so be careful. We often wrap a glass jar in a thick towel and do the lid opening in the sink in case the glass should break. So far, none have done so in our use of this opener......",
