I couldn't get the software to work on my computer and fell back on just running the executable on the printer itself. Finally it won't print at all. Head cleaning didn't help. Don't waste your money or time on this or any printer from Dymo. I am buying a P-touch next. They have always worked in all their incarnations.",

I needed about 50 labels printed out, and watching paint dry would be faster. It has also jammed on me quite a few times. If you only need to print a label every now and then, this will get the job done. If you're going to be labeling things often, please spend the money and get a more expensive one that can do the job faster.",

It takes forever for some reason. 3) Plug in the Dymo If you messed up and plugged it in first make sure you remove it from the computer and go to the printer preferences and remove it from there as well. This is tricky and odd setup but works great once you do.",

You either need to have a router/ap that is Wireless G only or have one radio on your router/ap that you can set to wireless g. But if the DYMO connects via wireless N it will not process print jobs consistently. (yes it has the ability to connect via wireless n dymo themselves admits its unsupported). So keep that in mind and this product will work fine for you.",

Almost every time I have to cut off the excess so the labels will actually fit where I need them. Changing the font size doesn't help the dead space at all.

Now the printer is an expensive paperweight and I am stuck with a bunch of unusable Dymo label cartridges.
