This manual makes way better quality espresso in my opinion. Definitely buy somethIng to tamp the espresso down. I also bought a smaller pitcher to stream milk because this steam wand sits low. I use any shot glasses I have around the house and I\u2019ve never had trouble with them fitting. I researched a lot of espresso machines before I settled on this one and I\u2019m happy with my final decision. Definitely the best quality for a midrange espresso machine.",

The taste seems also different, not sure if because of the temperature (coffee is quite hot and you cannot drink it straight away). The quality of the materials and design for what you pay is quite good, but I was expecting to have better espressos. I do not recommend buying it and personally I regret it.",

Also, the milk foamer worked once then began to burn the milk without foaming it. I cleaned it well tried again and still couldn\u2019t get it to foam the milk.

Also, the space between the filter and the cup holder was only 2 1/2 in. and there was no way I could get a cup of any size (except for a demitasse cup) under the filter. I sent it back and ordered a different machine.",
