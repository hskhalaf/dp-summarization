I think the sizing is accurate. I am 5\u20195\u201d 128 lbs and the medium was perfect. I can wear a t-shirt with a light sweater under the jacket. It is on the heavy side without the battery because it is a warm jacket to begin with and the battery does add additional weight. All of that is acceptable to me because I stay warm. It\u2019s not and isn\u2019t meant to be a high style jacket, more utilitarian.",

The 12 volt battery is really bulky, but it's necessary since it's the heating element. The jacket somewhere between true to size and a little big. Don't size up because you want the jacket to be fitted so the heating elements are up against your body. Overall, a great value if you are tired of always being cold!",
