The nice thing about putting dish soap in one of these is that it dispenses quite slowly which actually saves you money. I use Dawn dish soap which is already very powerful. A little goes a long way. It takes a few seconds to dispense due to the viscosity of the soap against the small tube but I got used to it and am quite happy knowing that my giant Costco sized container of Dawn will probably last me until I die. The glass itself is very sturdy and I am not afraid to manhandle it in my normal dishwashing.",
