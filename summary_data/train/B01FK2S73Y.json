It's really nice to use though, and it is small (About the width of a normal coffee mug). The 30 second cycle is really good if you don't want TOO much to push out all at once, and the LEDs on the device are nice actually and not too bright. Haven't tried it at night however, but I'm sure it isnt too bad",

Still not smell and the water level has not moved AT ALL. The container gets very warm with the lights on so I stopped using the light. I'm going to be boxing it up and sending this back tomorrow.

Instead, it kind of floats backwards into the backseat. I do like that it'll help the car smell nice over a period of time, but it would be nicer if the mist was actually stronger.",

That\u2019s okay because I can plug it into the console. I will use Velcro to put it on a side so I don\u2019t have to use up a cup holder, but the product is great! I fill it to the max line use one drop of oil and it fills my car with the smell. It lasts longer than one day too so I can leave it and not have to bring it in and out every day. Love this product!",

Around the 20-30 minute mark, it stopped emitting mist. The mist built up inside the diffuser but no longer came out of the hole in the top. I tried turning it off and back on, changing the water level, unplugging and replugging it back in, starting over, etc- nothing worked. I attempted these things multiple times and still the mist stays inside the diffuser and does not emit through the lid- sadly, I am returning this item.",
