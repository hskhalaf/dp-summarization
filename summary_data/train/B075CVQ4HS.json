D/load Bryton app for your phone first, then turn on auto sync to Strava make sure the green indicator stays on. then enable Wi Fi and connect to your router. follow those steps before your first ride or you'll never be able to upload those ride data to Strava. only post wi fi setup and Bryton app setup data will upload to Strava",

I was skeptical at best but after watching a few (hundred) youtube videos I pulled the trigger am I ever so glad that I did! Nothing against the Garmins but for what I needed the price wasnt justified. This bryton 530 is everything I wanted and more. I no longer have to keep paper journals of my rides its all uploaded through bluetooth. Probrably more info than I can digest. It also connects to to your wifi and Strava. This is the best computer I have ever used glad I bought it and wouldnt think twice about pulling the trigger again.",
