      "text": "Purchased this to replace an old undersized exhaust fan in my master bathroom. Mounting was very easy, I used the \"New Installation\" instructions as the drywall was off the ceiling. This is super quiet! The fan from the other bathroom can be heard over this one from below it. A word of caution, some builders do not install a vent at the other end. The exhaust simply runs over to the soffit. Looking on the inside this could easily lead to rot and other issues. So plan on adding a vent.",

Due to a long circuitous route for the vent hose we are using the highest fan setting. Having the adjustment for the speeds and run time are great to fine tune the operation. I like the way the unit soft starts and ramps up too. The motion detector is spot on. Would buy again. Installation of the unit wasn't too bad for us but adding the vent hose took a few hours to fish through by myself.",
