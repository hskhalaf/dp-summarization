Once you experience this advantage, you'll be less impressed with your slip-jaw pliers. The other great feature is that the jaws always remain parallel. Now you can use these pliers instead of an adjustable wrench. The leverage is fantastic. Squeeze the handles, the the jaws grip like iron. Definitely superior to slip-joint pliers.

The non serrated jaws do not mar the work and fasteners but the best part is the incredible gripping force these things can apply. If you have ever had to use regular pliers to tighten a nut or bolt you know just how fast you can round off and destroy them. With these Knipex Pliers it is like having a wrench. It is adjustable for a wide verity of sizes far beyond a typical tool this size. I love Knipex tools which I have always found to be of the highest quality best tools on the market.",
