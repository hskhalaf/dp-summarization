I finally broke down and picked up this electric rototiller to do some of the churning for me. And a wonderful job it does! The rototiller is light weight but powerful enough to bust through our heavy clay soil up here in the northeast. It will dig down into the soil about 5-6 inches provided you have patience to not try to force it to dig faster. Let the tiller do the work at its pace and you will be happy with the results. I should have gotten this years ago.",

      "text": "Although cheap, not worth the money. Purchased in November to \"edge\" flower beds around house. Spring has come so I decided to get started putting new pine straw down. Used edger to trim where grass was growing into flower beds, then follow up with this tiller to remove grass from \"inside\" the edged line. Very soft dirt, just grass. No roots or anything. Got about 40 feet completed before the head stopped spinning. Apparently the gears stripped out. Looking to see if still under warranty since it's been too long to send back through Amazon.",

Of course it\u2019s past the 30 days return time so it\u2019s sad that it didn\u2019t even last halfway through our project.",

Was finally able to dig 2\" deep after 5 minutes in one spot and I mean 1 spot. Very disappointed with product and description. Will see how customer support goes!",

Only thing that stopped this unit was the stones it brought up and were wedged under the housing - simple to clear and on it went again! Would purchase again in an instant - really!",
