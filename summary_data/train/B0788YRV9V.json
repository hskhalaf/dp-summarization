The quality of the paper is very good, and you get a decent amount for the price. My customers and people to whom I've given pottery as gifts have commented that they appreciate that I use 100% recycled paper, and that it also looks nice (sure beats giving them pottery wrapped in old newspaper!) The paper is thick and not translucent at all, with a thickness and durability comparable to (but a little lighter weight than) paper grocery sacks. It takes tape, inked stamps, and stickers well. I would recommend this paper for both gift-wrap or for insulation of delicate items in transport.",

I would maybe prefer a longer paper, I have had to use multiple sheets for some pretty regular size boxes to get full coverage.",
