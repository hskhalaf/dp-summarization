I've done at home waxing before and my skin has never been so irritated that it looks like I burn myself. I hate rlly hot stuff so I made sure the wax wasn't as hot when I applied it. it didn't take out all the hair either even when I applied pressure, i applied the wax in the same place 3 times and the hair still didn't fully come off. guys just get the strips. I would not purchase this product again.",
