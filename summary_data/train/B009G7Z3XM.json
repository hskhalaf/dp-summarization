It doesn't make those white flakes that other gel has. Lastly, it doesn't smell. It holds up in humid weather as I went to Costa Rica for vacation and my hair was still looking great and staying put.",

      "text": "Before buying I read comments regarding the scent and was a bit hesitant, but the price is what motivated me to buy. When it arrived the first thing I did was opened it up to smell it and it does smell odd. Not bad, just different, at least the smell doesn\u2019t linger in your hair. While this gel does have a different scent than the clear \u201cMode\u201d container with fragrance, it works exactly the same. Still giving the product 5 stars because it works great.",

After applying correct amount I find this gel to work very well. It provides a nice hold and no white residue.",
