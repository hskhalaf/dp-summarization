Super cute and I'm sure my daughter will love it, but I think it's a huge mistake from the maker that you have to remove the product completely from its packaging in order to silence it.",

She'll keep you on your toes. 5 stars because my two year old (unfortunately) loves this thing and it's also pretty cute. Better than a real cat, though that's probably debatable.",
