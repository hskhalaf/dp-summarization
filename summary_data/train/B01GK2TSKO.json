I was delighted to find that Kitchables had a variety that was more cost-effective than Bodum, and every bit as good in performance. They're comfortable in the hand, the double wall makes them adequately heat resistant, and the quality is good. Nick at Kitchables is doing a good job in his marketing (though the website sorely needs the upgrade it is currently going through). Handwritten notes accompany purchases, and Kitchables tries to reach out to ensure their products have arrived and fit the bill.",

The box that contained the glasses was very sturdy and I don\u2019t think me dropping the from 100 feet would have broken them. Thank you Nick, you will be seeing my next order soon.",

These feel pretty sturdy and work well for espresso. They are slightly large for restretto, I pull 28-30g shots and only fills just about half way. Double walled is ideal for two main reasons: thin glass means no need to warm up the cup and plus i can see the crema build as i pull the shot. I can't speak to durability as i dont drop things often but i never warm them up and they get hot espresso crema 1st thing in the mornings without any drama so i gave it 5 stars.",

When I received them, one had a production flaw and quickly broke. I wasn't that concerned as even 3 were a good value for the price, and put two of these glasses into rotation. Without any prompting, I received a follow-up email from Kitchables customer service. When I told them about the flawed glass, they immediately sent two replacement glasses. I am super-satisfied with both Kitchables and their customer service.",

Their shape makes them unable to be put super close together, so i have to position them perfectly to catch the coffee on the very sides. The actual construction of them feels nice, the heat retention seems to work well. I love the actual look of them, just wish they were slightly less bulbous so it would fit under the espresso spouts just a bit better, but it still works for its purpose and compared to other dual wall espresso glasses I have used they feel better in the hand.",

I gave two stars only due to the excellent packaging and shipping. The cups themselves deserve only one star.",

My only problem is that they aren't quite large enough for the Nespresso Double Espresso. I think the glasses are exactly 2.7 oz and the typical Double Espresso is 2.7 oz PLUS a bit of crema, so these overflow sometimes with the Double. They're fine for a single espresso. I'm also not a huge fan of the rounded shape. While they look great, I always feel like they're going to slip out of my hand when I wash or dry them.",

The packaging gave a great first impression with a handwritten card and a coaster that I was not expecting. I only see room for improvement in two ways: 1) Fill lines for single and double shot. 2) Better flow features for transferring from one of these to a mug. I still give this review 5 stars because these cups are intended for those who drink straight espresso, and they still perform quite well when making espresso-based drinks.",

      "text": "Received the set of 4 and these glasses look good!! I found that they are slightly eneven either the top rim or the bottom but its barely noticeable. I only noticed when i went to slide the cup under my espresso machine the one side just slides under, if i spin the cup it slightly hit the bottom where espresso comes out. One sides slightly higher then other which again is not visually noticable unless you sit there and study them. They are balanced sitting them down as in they dont wobble. Good quality glasses and look good.",

They also appeased my uncle, thereby bringing harmony to the universe. Thank you <3",

Although they look good and do their job (the exterior does not get hot), I have to manually raise them close to the extractors while the machine pours out the espresso. If I put them together below the extractors the espresso will pour out of the cups because the height of the extractors will make the drip go down vertically and the cups construction does not work with this particular pour and their mouth is not wide enough to use one cup instead of two.",

I enjoy using these for serving higher-quality green/Jasmine/herbal teas etc., and for having miniature servings of ice cream, haha.
