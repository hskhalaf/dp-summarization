The screen size and touch screen give that Total WOW!! factor to anyone you show it to, myself included:) Takes GREAT pics and video, controles are easy to use and understand. Hard to believe you can fit so much quality and features in a package so small. Be sure to buy a small soft camera case \"same day\" as you will want to protect your beautiful/huge touch screen right away! 11/06 update - Stolen on a Cruise so I bought the new DSC-N2, SCORE!!!",

      "text": "We really love our Sony Cybershot. It was purchased for the purpose of taking lots of family shots at family outings. The reasons we purchased the sony were: the small size, very easy to use, the 3 inch viewing screen, the carl zeiss lens, and of course the 8.1 mega pizels, plus the overall high quality. What I did not like was the PC software, it's not the easist to use, and on the Mac, I just use iPhoto, which works great. When we purchased the camera, we also bought the 2 GB memory stick, which I have not come close to filling, and the cybershot case, whichreally protects our camera. I would highly recommend this camera.",

My only issue is that in dim light it is impossible to see your subject in the LCD screen. This issue becomes worse when you are zoomed in. The issue is significant enough for me that I am returning the camera. I have used other cameras where the LCD brightness was increased as you zoomed in. Cameras with a viewfinder of course do not have this issue to the same extent.",

The touch-sensitive screen is more than a novelty though, allowing you to navigate virtually all camera functions more easily via menus, as opposed to twirling dials and manipulating crytpic buttons on any other conventional digital cam. The slideshow feature is stunning, and also allows for background music to play during the presentation.

It turned into a bunch of colored bars like your TV does during emergencly broadcast tests. Given there is no optical viewfinder, this meant I was out of luck. Additionally, most controls are accessed via the touchscreen (many inelegantly) so when it goes, the camera goes.",

At that point, the LCD screen on the back went white, not allowing me to review pictures, access the menu, or take pictures through it. I've sent the camera to Sony repair centers twice, with no results. The camera has spent three of the past four months either in transit, in repair, or simply not working. The Sony repair centers keep sending it back to me in the same state that I sent it in. If you're going to spend any kind of money on a digital camera, do yourself a favor and don't buy a Sony.",
