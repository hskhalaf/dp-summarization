      "text": "This tablet works great. I use it when conducting training online and it helps me illustrate concepts. It's also pretty portable so I can carry it around in a backpack. Update: Make sure you have some bubble wrap for the little pen though, or something to keep the tip safe as you don't want to get the tip chipped, otherwise you'll need to replace the pen like me. But not to fret. If you lose the pen or damage it, you can just buy the pen replacement on amazon without having to replace the whole tablet",

This upgrade (for me) is a huge improvement with the motion and gesture controls and pressure sensitivity increase for drawing and painting. Easy to work with and very durable. The COREL software Painter Essentials 4.0 has bugs in it - the slide draw disappears when used, the brushes do not work right and the update does not seem to fix any of this.(again this is not a WACOM issue - it's a COREL problem) - just thought I'd mention it. Great WACOM product - a must have for artists and digital photographers to create/edit your work that's easy and fun.",

      "text": "At time of this writing this product is at unbelievable price ~ $120, I'm rating five stars just based on the value. However, I'm subtracting one of those stars for the noticeably rough active surface, which you sense as an annoying drag upon the pen tip as you draw. In the end, decided I could live with the over-rough surface, but ONLY because of the low cost; had this product cost me $200 I would have returned it immediately over this issue. Overall what makes this such a great deal is the physical footprint of the active area, fact that it also supports touch gestures, and comes with full license of Photoshop Elements",

      "text": "The pen itself works great, to put it simply. Drawing is very pleasent, and makes graphic design easier fairly frequently. That is the most important thing in a tablet, so I give the tablet 4 stars overall because of that. Unfortunately, the pen's buttons are not TERRIBLY well placed (though not bad) and the rotate/zoom multitouch functions are difficult at best, and infuriating at worst. Single finger touch works quite well, but multitouch overall isn't worth anything, it usually just messes up whatever you're trying to do. I'd say if you want a tablet, this seems to be a good one, but it is not without flaws.",

It offers so much more freedom and versatility than a mouse and I loved it right away. I think it was a good deal. I compared it to other smaller sized tablets, and I think this one is the best value for the price.",

I will say that the touch function is somewhat sensitive at times and I would have liked to see some way to adjust the touch sensitivity in the pen tablet pref pane. I am a previous Wacom tablet user and there was no problem getting up to speed with this function which works just fine.",

I would pay the extra $20 or some bucks and get this model over the other Bamboo ones because it has touch and if your carrying around a laptop and a tablet at school, this could be faster for you to navigate than the touch pad on the laptop.",

The surface is really large and capable of handling designing in Photoshop, Illustrator or InDesign at any level!!

After reading on-line reviews and comments along with on-line video demonstrations, I decided that the Wacom Bamboo Fun was the best starter tablet. I was right! It was easy to learn and use. It allows me to express my creative nature both in digital photography and drawing. I enjoy using it. Later I'll use it for drafting.",

I still have a mouse connected that I sometimes use when the Fun doesn't seem to quite give me the feel and control I am used to in email and Word applications. But the more I use the Fun, the more skilled I'm getting and the less I go for the mouse. The four side buttons are very useful. For Photoshop, the Fun is wonderful.",

Obviously it's the lower end of Wacom tablets so you're missing a few functions such as higher pen pressure (which honestly isn't that big of a deal) and pen tilt which I consider to be the biggest kicker. I've got an Intuos at work and I don't use the tilt function enough to miss it at home. The layout of this tablet is nice to, makes working on it very easy. So as long as you know what you're getting, I highly doubt anyone would be disappointed with this product.",

The touch pad does not work properly unless the wireless keyboard and mouse are turned off. This is not a big disadvantage for us, as we really bought it for its pen input features.",

    "description": "Bamboo Fun lets you get hands-on with your creative projects, giving you the benefits of Multi-Touch along with the comfort and precision of Wacom\u2019s ergonomically-designed pen. With Multi-Touch, you can navigate, scroll, and work with simple gestures in an area larger than on mobile devices or laptop trackpads. For precision work, pick up the pressure-sensitive pen to draw, sketch, edit photos, and add handwritten elements to your creations. The generous size of Bamboo Fun gives you lots of space for creative freedom, making it simple and comfortable to use. Bamboo Fun works with your existing computer: desktop or laptop, PC or Mac. Attach it to a standard USB port and set it comfortably by your keyboard. You can even customize your Bamboo Fun experience by assigning your own shortcuts to the four ExpressKeys. Available in a stylish silver color, Bamboo Fun will complement your current setup. It includes valuable additions that make it ideal for your creative projects.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nCombining intuitive design and versatility, the Bamboo Fun is a powerful creative workstation that lets PC and Mac users create digital art with an organic, hands-on feel. Using an innovative tablet and Wacom's \"Multi-Touch\" system, users can manipulate images and navigate the Web using simple gestures and finger taps. When combined with Wacom's pen-input technology, the Bamboo Fun allows you to write, doodle, and embellish with ease.\n\n \n\n\n\nIncluded pen features 1,024 levels of pressure sensitivity for precise drawings. \n\nLarge, textured work surface and customizable keys give you artistic control. \n\nMulti-Touch lets you scroll, zoom, and rotate your screen with simple hand gestures. Sleek, Stylish, and Easy to Use\nMeasuring 13.3 by 8.8 inches, the Bamboo Fun is compact enough to store comfortably in a laptop case. It features a large and responsive active area, providing enough workspace for even your most ambitious projects. For added convenience, four ExpressKeys provide quick access to user-defined shortcuts. The tablet comes with a battery-free pen with an easy-to-grip design, so you can have maximum control over your drawing. The work surface is textured, providing a pen-on-paper feel. It's also reversible, so you can use it comfortably whether you're right- or left-handed.\n\n The Bamboo Fun is simple to set up. Simply plug the tablet into your computer via a USB port, install the provided drivers, and you're ready to go. You'll be doodling, writing, and painting in minutes.\n\n Enhance Creativity with Multi-Touch Technology\nWith the Bamboo Fun, Wacom has implemented a new technology called Multi-Touch. Typically, tablets require you to use the stylus for navigation, but Multi-Touch provides a comfortable hands-on alternative. It allows you to quickly navigate through your computer with a single finger. You can also scroll, zoom, and rotate your screen with simple hand gestures. It's intuitively-designed and easy to use -- even if you're new to the touch experience.\n\n For precision work, you can use the included pen. When you use the pen, the screen will automatically recalibrate for more precise use. In your hands, the pen quickly becomes an all-purpose art tool. It features 1,024 levels of pressure sensitivity, allowing you to perform tasks ranging from fine hand-writing to wide-brush painting. You can add hand-drawn embellishments to your favorite photos, add life to your digital sketches, or provide a personal touch to your scrapbooking pages.\n\n First-Class Visual Editing Software\nThe tablet also comes with a full suite of visual editing software, including Adobe Photoshop Elements 7.0 Win/6.0 Mac and Nik Color Efex Pro 3.0 WE3--valued separately at several hundred dollars.\n\n Bamboo Fun is compatible with Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows XP (Service Pack 2) and Mac OS X (10.4.8 or higher.) It requires a powered USB drive, a colored screen, and a CD/DVD drive.\n\n What's in the Box\nBamboo Fun tablet, Bamboo Fun pen, Quick Start guide, installation CD (includes driver software, interactive tutorial and user's manual), and software DVD.",
