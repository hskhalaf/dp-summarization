The best one I have had so far and certainly the most accurate. Thanks P.S They were out of this item when so I had to wait several weeks, but let me tell you it was DEFINITELY worth the wait.",

Prior to buying it, I was using meat thermometers, which died quickly or all together would just stop working on me--presumably due to being constantly submerged in liquids and oils? Either way, I wasted lots of money, time and energy complaining about and actually replacing thermometers. Coming across this thermometer has been a soap saver. It's much cheaper on Amazon than other vendors who sell comparable laser infrared thermometers. It's easy to use, durable and appears to have a lengthy battery life. A great investment.",
