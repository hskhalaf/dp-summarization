      "text": "I purchased this violin for my son who has been playing for about 10 years. He wanted it to play in the pep and jazz bands at his high school. He is very happy with the violin and it sounds great.The the seller (Kennedy Violins) is awesome. We could not get the amp to work, so I contacted the seller who asked us to send them a video of us setting it up and playing. After reviewing our video, the seller replaced the Amp for us at their expense. They were extremely polite and helpful. Obviously a company that understands customer service. I highly recommend this company and the violin. A+++++++",

Bow losing hair but also being reviewed by Kennedy who offered replacement is loss continues. but that does not reflect on the quality of the instrument. I bought the one on clearance and had to look really hard to find the cosmetic defect. Beginners beware that it is a much heavier violin than an acoustic and it takes getting used to the weight. Overall, very satisfied and would buy from Kennedy again!",

      "text": "The electronics quickly failed. The small amplifier that came with the violin quit working within a week. The headphone jack stopped working after a month and the output jack when used with another amplifier only works sometimes for a short time. I still play the violin even though it doesn't sound like a violin with no amplification because I am determined to learn to play and hopefully someday I will be able to afford a real violin and not this toy violin. My advice is to never purchase a violin online. Go to a music store and actually play the instrument. And realize that when you purchase a cheap violin you get what you paid for. Be forewarned.",

The design and finish of the instrument is very attractive. The case and other accessories were also nice. Overall, I think this was a good buy.",

I can\u2019t understand the good reviews for this cheap piece of crap. The little amp/speaker never worked once. Various strings have snapped on the violin and it is impossible to keep it in tune. The bow is flimsy. We called customer service and got some half-hearted advice to watch YouTube videos to try to fix it ourselves. My daughter never bothers to play it because it is such a pain to work with. The only decent thing about it is the case it came in. DON\u2019T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!",

Poor quality, slopped on paint all around, sub-par hardware. Spend a little more and get something worth while.",
