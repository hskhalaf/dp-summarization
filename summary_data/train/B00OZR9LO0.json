The sleeves are sufficiently long and the jacket hits just below my hips, which is a great fit. The smooth outer surface repels water, keeps wind out, and repels pet hair. Medium warmth, I walk outside in the cool weather in this, and I wear it at work when the heat isn't high enough. It's professional in appearance. I hope they keep making these coats because I love it and would buy more in the future. Lots of color options too!",

Would need another layer for spending all day in heavy rain, but sufficiently water resistant for short periods of time. This is the first Columbia jacket I've purchased. I bought it because my boyfriend had a similar softshell that I really liked, and I'm glad I did because the product is well made and one of my favorite jackets.",

Wind stands no chance against this jacket as it simply flows around it. In west Texas (where it does get cold) it's great to have a jacket that can keep you warm during the morning, but not bake you during the middle of the day. I'm sure I'll be buying more of these in the future!",
