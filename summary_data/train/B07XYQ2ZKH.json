No matter the genre I play, the music is clear, clean - the sound is AMAZING. I can not say enough about this dongle and it's included DAC. I use this dongle between my Samsung Note 10+ and my audio-technica reference headphones. Hats off the the engineers who designed this! The fit into the phone is outstanding, very tight and secure!",

The DAC/amp built in is much brighter and cleaner sounding as well as more powerful! I just hope this thing lasts more than a month or two. If so I am buying another one of these for sure as a backup.",
