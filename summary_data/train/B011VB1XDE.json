What more do you need in a watch? It has the neat Timeline feature built in to help manage your day. I have other smartwatches that are nice such as LG Urbane. It looks great and takes advantage of other features that this one doesn't have but as a daily driver I will be wearing this one. I'm happy so far with this watch.

I would be giving this watch a five-star review if not for the whole 'risk of severe personal injury and fire' aspect.

      "text": "I really like this watch. I especially like the long battery life, multiple watch displays, and not having a touch screen display. It's a great choice of features. I don't miss having a touch screen display and annoying audio sound(s). You quickly get used to having to use the four buttons for everything, and the choice of vibrations easily wakes you up in the morning. No more going to a meeting or class, and having your watch go off unexpectedly! What a great choice of features. Please keep support for the watch app!",

Every 4-5 days while I'm in the shower I charge it and it lasts forever and that's with using it a ton. I really like how you can change the bands just by ordering an off brand one too. This thing is simple, very quick, easy to use and great on battery. Five stars!",
