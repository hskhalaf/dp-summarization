I'd definitely try to get another 2070 after NVidia makes their quality more stable.

The memory modules inside the card are made by two different companies, Samsung and Micron. Micron memory modules have been experiencing failures across all of the brands and lines of card. Since there is no way to know which company's memory modules are going to be in your card, it's probably best just to stay away from RTX right now.",

      "text": "So, far far as 2070 cards go, this one is expensive. However, Asus also probably has the best cooler attached when it comes to thermals vs noise. It even has a bios switch with quiet and performance modes. Quiet mode is extremely quiet while still keeping operable temperatures. Performance mode will give you audible noise, but it will still be cooler and quieter than most of the competition. Only the MSI gaming Z is close. EVGA, despite having excellent warranty support and good pricing, has mediocre coolers. If you are noise focused and have a little bit of extra cash, this is probably the card you want to go for.",
