I use a portable CPAP when camping and had to keep the machine in the bag with me because it wouldn't operate in the cold otherwise. Plenty of room in this sleeping bag.

      "text": "Amazing sleeping bag from Teton, This is now the 5th sleeping bag I have bought from Teton brand. The whole family gets the good sleeping bags now. This was used in temperatures in the low 40's and not once did we get cold. In fact it was so warm that you didn't need to be tightly bundled in it during the night. Other reviews complain about the lining isn't flannel cotton, as nice as flannel cotton is, it really makes it much heavier and honestly just isn't needed. I didn't miss it a bit.",

I'll NEVER get it back into the bag though. It's very large for the bag and the fabric is slippery so it doesn't fold easily. I put it in a vacuum sealed bag and even with the air sucked out, it is still huge on the shelf. For me, it's a worthwhile price for a comfortable bag.",

Your feet and legs aren't cold. Actually, my husband has to sleep with his open because they're too hot for most summer nights, but just opening it, gives him the comfort he desires.",

You can not machine wash or dry clean this sleeping bag. The tag says hand wash and lay flat to dry, Well it can't lay flat cause the zipper does not go curve down around your feet.
