There is no visible trace of this product, unlike lipsticks and glosses. It is a true tint. For the little that it did, the high price, and the toxicity - it is not worth it.",

      "text": "This is a huge amount of product and quite expensive. but if you're using it daily unlike me, that should be great, i only use this a few times a month. I had the tiny size and it ran out, i should have just bought the small size again because i'm kinda regretting wasting the money on so much product. It's the best rosey red lip tint I've ever used, and i've tried lots of korean brands who usually have the leg up in lip tint. Can't beat the formula and color and staying power of this one, at least in my opinion. It even fades nicely instead of fading in weird places and staying dark in others.",
