The ears are a very small portion and regular sized flatwear don't get the food out well. Cleans very nicely in the dishwasher. My baby has figured out how to grab things and throw, so this plate is on the floor often. It's fine, but if the suction was better and ear portions slightly bigger, I'd be more impressed.",
