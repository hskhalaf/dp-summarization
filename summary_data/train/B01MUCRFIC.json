The shoe was praised for being a comfortable minimalist shoe that had practical features and superb performance, yet it was also criticized \u2013 by the same users \u2013 for its durability. Overall, the Vapor Glove 3 was a good shoe, but many runners think it is not a worthy purchase because of its short lifespan.",

I only walk in these so can't put them through real wear test, and is just used for 2 or 3 months but I kind of see where the money goes when you buy vivos over these. It's a different kind of shoe though. Feels like an ultimate slipper and can be worn in hot weather, and disappear on your feet.. and good colours too. I like these things about them.",

At one point I had a gory accident that needed stitching on a toe. The wiggle room made these the only comfortable yet protective option for my bandage, and meant I could walk around cautiously, rather than remain housebound. Yes, everybody stared at me hobbling around in my brightly coloured shoes. I usually buy size UK 10.5-11 trainers and am UK 10.5 for the Merrell Vapor Glove 3. In my experience, they're only suitable for dry weather. Squelchy in the rain.",

Like the Vivo\u2019s, the finish isn\u2019t fantastic but these are less than half the cost so I can\u2019t complain. Even if they last 3 months I\u2019ll be happy.",
