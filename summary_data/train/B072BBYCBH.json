Each minute is marked with a dot, so I can see the precise time without having to estimate the distance between the numbers. 3. I can illuminate the dial when needed. 4. The leather strap does not make my wrist perspire (as vinyl does). 5. It is the ideal size for my small wrist on the fourth-hole setting.",

I ordered an extra long size wristband since the last time I bought a similar watch the band was considerably smaller than in the past. This band is really long, too long really. But since it is an expandable band, I just wear it a little higher than normal. I keep buying these because I love the indiglo feature. It's great to have in the movies, or anywhere it's too dark to see the hands. The Timex watches aren't fancy, but they are reliable and accurate.",

I like having the second hand. the body seems heavier than ones I've had before so I'm getting used to it. it's a keeper for me but might replace band.",

Looks good, works fine; pretty much what I expected, however I noticed a odd thing - I can hear it ticking WHILE DRIVING my car and I don't drive a Prius or have bionic hearing. It drove me crazy for weeks because I couldn't figure out where it was coming from and why it was intermittent. Finally determined it was the watch and it's because she wears the band loosely. If the watch is pressed against the skin, then I can't hear anything. So be aware if you are especially sensitive to ticking noises, you might not be able to set this watch on your nightstand and go to sleep.",

However, the watch is quite a bit \"daintier\" (slimmer band, smaller face) than the picture of it on a model's wrist implies. I was expecting and hoping for something with a bit more substance. Still, it is a handsome piece, the watch band is a GREAT color! As one other reviewer wrote, if you can't decide between black or brown this is the perfect choice. I would call the color \"ox blood\"... not burgandy; it's not red enough to be a burgandy color pleases me. LOVE the light-up feature!! Recommend.",

Okay, now I knew that I was looking for a Timex, with indiglo, an expansion band with a more feminine shape, a readable face with gold numerals matching the case and band. I love this watch. Please keep making these, Timex",

It\u2019s very easy to tune the watch to the perfect minute, and you are sure when you\u2019ve pushed it in to start it up. One important thing! My girlfriend has pretty small wrists, maybe small to average-sized, and she wears it on the second to largest hole. If I had bought it for myself, it would not have fit.",

The face was smaller than I thought and what she is use to, but she does like it. I think it\u2019s a beautiful piece, especially with the mother of pearl. She loves the light on it.",

The pearl face of the watch makes it appear delicate, but the watch itself is durable and has been holding up well for me so far. The wrist band is a teeny bit big for me, but it's not a huge problem. Overall, I love it!",

I missed that it didn't have the little date box like my last Timex, but that's okay. It's comfortable to wear, the light is very bright for seeing the time at night, and the leather band is nice quality, although it does squeak a bit when you first get it. I've been wearing the watch for about a week now and the squeaking has finally stopped.",

The band was ten times too big, so I had to search for a YouTube video on how to take out the links. Without the Indiglo feature, I'd never be able to see the time -- even in daytime. I can't get my arm far enough away to see the clock hands, so using that helps outline the hands for me. lol. The light reflects off the face of the watch so it's sometimes tough to see even if you have young eyes. But it is exactly what I wanted as far as looks. I'm pleased.",
