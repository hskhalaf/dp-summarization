I still highly recommend this case to anyway looking for a slim, protective case for their phone.",

However, time has shown me that the quality of this case is far less than I thought it was. The hard outer case portion cracked at the base while I was removing it to clean. I didn\u2019t drop it, wasn\u2019t using excessive force etc. The crack eventually lead to the entire bottom corner cracking and chipping off. I am severely disappointed as I can\u2019t imagine that it would have protected my phone much if it had landed on its corner. Do yourself a favor and purchase a different case.",

I did not realize how well the pelican case was protecting the phone until having the OtterBox. Visually this is not boxy and has a nice feel over all. Protection from cracks rates a 1/10.",

      "text": "Fantastic case, however it gets dirty quickly and it stays that way. I've tried to clean it, but it will not go back to it's original color or even close to it. I would repurchase it again, but I feel like that would be a waste of money because mine is perfectly fine in that it has no real damage other than the color. I've had the case for a year now and it only has a few scratches from when I have dropped it; it has protected my phone perfectly without being bulky like the defender series. Plus, the defender series has a plastic screen connected to the case and I prefer to use my own glass screen protectors.",

The plastic part and the rubber part still don't go together smoothly and you can see the gaps between the plastic and rubber parts easily. Wish that you didn't see any gaps that's why this is not a five star review. The color is great and exactly what I was wanting. It is a little lighter than the picture online, but still pretty close. Have already dropped phone once or twice and case has protected it well and did its job.",

The only flaw is really just the fit (that everyone is talking about) but in reality it's not even bad and the case still gets the job done plus the gap is hardly noticeable.

This case is also not very bulky, allowing me to carry my phone pretty normally. I like the two components, a rubber in the inside and the hard plastic on the outside for protection. Also, I love that the home button is free of the case for easier access to it. Great price!",
