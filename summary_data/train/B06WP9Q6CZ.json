The fan noise people complain about is there (took a week before mine started being noisy) but I'm going to replace it with a computer silent fan and it won't be a problem.

It does a great job with softies, and low light lps corals. Definitely wouldn\u2019t recommend sps corals unless they\u2019re positioned at the top of the tank.

Among other great features are the quiet submersible pump, dual intakes and adjustable return nozzle. Each aquarium is also 2\" taller than the original BioCube aquariums, creating a larger viewing area with the new 16 and 32 sizes. Compatible with all existing BioCube accessories.
