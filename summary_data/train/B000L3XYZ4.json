While the unit continues to operate flawlessly, I notice the water is very slimy when I clean it. It only takes the water a couple of days to get like this. No one in the online forums seems to know how to get rid of this. I called Drinkwell and they advised running vinegar through the fountain which I did for several hours. Tried again this week, the cat won't go near it, and the water is slimy again. I tap out.",

I like that it continually filters the water, as our tap water is poor quality. After two months of use, the water started running more slowly, and it was time to clean it. This process took about 20-30 minutes, there's a fair amount of disassembly to do in order to clean the motor. I highly recommend buying the cleaning kitas it worked well. I'm going to start cleaning it monthly now. The only reason it's getting a star off is because cleaning it can be a lengthy process. Otherwise I am very happy with it.",

Taking it apart to clean it is cumbersome too, and a bit messy. I would recommend getting the brush set to clean this if you don't already have bottle neck scrubbers. However as far as use, my cats love this. It stopped them from trying to drink out of the shower. A full reservoir of water and a full dish last about a week for 3 cats if you are going on vacation.",

      "text": "I\u2019ve got a kitty who is pretty resistant to using most water fountains. I wanted to get her something that would help cycle and filter the water she drinks that wouldn\u2019t have a loud motor that made her scared. Fortunately, this fountain does the trick as the only sound you hear is the movement of the water and not the pump. In addition, its design is very good with its large reservoir and and the water way is less apt to evaporate at room temperature. It\u2019s pretty easy to clean and has been frustration free! This has my full recommendation!",

He's a schnauzer and his beard gets the water kind of nasty but what's really cool is the fountain is quite easy to clean. Just run some vinegar through it every week or two and you don't even hardly have to scrub it! Anyway I really like this particular fountain because it has a removable reservoir. Considering how much water he drinks, it keeps the fountain full and from running drive which I'm sure destroys the pump. Great product I would recommend this brand to anyone!",
