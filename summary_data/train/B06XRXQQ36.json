I'm lucky because I tend to obsess over the accuracy of the clock (to the second)! The face is large so it's easy to read. Thermometer and hygrometer seem accurate enough; I have not seen two hygrometers giving the same reading. Recommend that you check the two finishes to see which one has the sweep second hand. Otherwise I hope that it will survive the desert heat outdoors and last a few years.",
