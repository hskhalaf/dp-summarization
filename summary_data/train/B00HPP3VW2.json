I even ported the phone number from Kajeet, no issues, and done quickly. I believe you could also use this phone on Kajeet, though I had already activated it on TING, so I could not confirm it. First impressions...I like this phone. Clear crisp screen, touch is excellent, quick to respond, so far a very nice phone. Hope to update review in a month or two. I can refer a friend for credit for both of us, so just ask me. MAIN: you CAN activate directly with TING. I did it through the computer.",

For the price, it's a really an amazing device. It is very stable and very quick to open apps and games. No crashing or locking up. Storage is on the small side, but it isn't a concern of mine. I am very pleased.",
