Really odd, unless it needs to warm up? Anyway, I had to return them for this reason, as I mainly use at work and start stop my music often, also, for some reason it\u2019s \u00a320 more for the grey colour. It\u2019s probably my ear shape, I would definitely give these a go because once you get that sweet spot, they are amazing. It\u2019s a shame the on-ear, over ear (px5, px7) are so much more expensive, as I\u2019d go for those instead.",

They\u2019re great - the sound is well-balanced and full and the earpieces fit very well. I personally didn\u2019t have to play around with the different sizes and shapes that are supplied. If I had one criticism it would be the carry bag that comes with the item. I really don\u2019t have the heart to cram these lovely headphones into this little bag for fear of damaging them. The bag for my P7\u2019s is similarly disappointing so perhaps B&W need to reassess the \u2018coolness\u2019 and practicality of the supplied bags.",

This mean I had to manually stop the music every time, and in case it entered standby mode, had to re-power on the headset manually. As someone who needs to attend calls quickly when not listening to music, this was a major blocker. Else the music and quality are among the best I've heard.",
