      "text": "This flax has the highest 5 star rating I've ever seen on Amazon for a health product. Don't be put off by the omega-6 content. It has twice as much omega-3, which is very good ratio. Some omega-3 is processed into DHA which is used to keep the brain working into your senior years. Omega-6 fuels the coagulation process, which is dangerous in excess, but necessary to keep you from bleeding to death from a cut. Research also shows flax lowers the risk of breast & prostate cancer. It stays fresh as a seed for months, but quickly goes rancid as a powder. If you're on a budget, flax is an inexpensive health food.",

I did a germination test with a pinch of these seeds by putting them in a wet napkin and sandwich bag. I had intended to give it up to three weeks, but after two days I had an 84% germination rate. I expect it will get higher, but considering there are probably a million seeds in the 96oz. I am more than satisfied.",

Now, we can use empty jars to store grains and supplements that come in crappy containers or bags. I know that my horses are getting quality flax and we can sprinkle it in our baking too. I buy this every 3 weeks.",

I grind them in my nutri bullet once a week, and they last all week in the fridge.",
