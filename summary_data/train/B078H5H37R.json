It's slim and portable, which I love, and it's very responsive when the buttons are pressed (see my video for an example). It was one of the only lights at this price range on Amazon that actually came with a battery included. I really didn't want to have to purchase a battery on top of the light itself, so this worked out great. Overall, I'm very impressed with this and I've already made good use out of it for YouTube videos.",

It is a great tool for my wife to use in her youtube videos to make her portrait brighter. The knob on the back is easy to change the brightness from 0-100, She did not try the other color filter as she just need white. The battery feels very well made and I am not afraid of it failing on me. Overall, it is a great purchase for people who needs extra lighting when doing videos at home for their DIY videos.",

I also found I don\u2019t need an extra diffuser to smooth out the light - it comes along with a semi-opaque plastic (diffuser) on the light itself, which is pretty awesome. Pretty bright at the max lvl, and actuallly it\u2019s also bright at the min lvl too. Cons: The dials are a little bit confusing, esp when switching between color modes. It comes with only one battery, when you are outdoor and runs out of battery, you can\u2019t use the light.",

I mounted the ESSDI-160 on a shelf above my computer, and pointed toward the wall. The diffuse, reflected light with the orange filter installed got rid of the shadows. The continuously adjustable dimmer built into the light is an essential feature to get the right amount of light on my face to produce natural skin tones in the video image. Note: to install this light on a shelf (as opposed to a video camera for which an adapter is provided) you will need a small desk-top tripod or some kind of clamp mount that you'll find in camera accessories.",

The included battery charging cradle uses a micro usb-b input, meaning I can use my battery bank to charge the battery which is a nice touch. My only wish to make this device better was if the device supported the use of either USB-C or micro usb-b on the light body so i can use the external battery to power the device directly.",

I definitely recommend this light if you are on a budget and looking for a great source of light. This saved me in Jamaica.",

I just dropped a note to the supplier asking for a link for a compatible DC adapter and hope to get a response. Otherwise, the light seems true to form and has worked well in my first few uses. Cannot comment yet on battery life, as it is too soon. Battery life will have a further impact on my need for a DC adapter.",

The blue and red filters are the most distinguished, while the others are fairly similar. I was hoping the green filter would be really vibrant, to resemble night vision, but that was not the case. It's more of a faint green tint. Still, I definitely see all of them being useful in future projects. :)",

By the way, remember fully charge the battery for about 4 hours before you use. And after using, remember to remove the battery as soon as possible. good product",

The only minor complaint that I have is actually not toward the light itself, but rather the charger - it feels INCREDIBLY cheap. The light, itself, on the other hand, is very well built, but is a little on the heavy side. Highly recommended if you're looking for something affordable, but can still give you very nice looking results.",
