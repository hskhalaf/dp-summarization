      "title": "Great for Ableskiever",
      "text": "My wife has used a cast iron Ableskiever pan for 40+ years as this is what she grew up using in her home. She saw one of these and mentioned how much easier a teflon covered pan would be to clean and how easy it would be to control the temperature. I bought her one for her birthday on Amazon and she loves it! Makes great Ableskiver and even includes a coated probe for turning that works better than the steel kitchen dual prong fork she's always used. Highly recommend!",
