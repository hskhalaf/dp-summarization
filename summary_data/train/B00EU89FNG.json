      "title": "\"Pocket size\" high quality SLR camera",
      "text": "Unusual: a high quality but pocket size SLR lens without the camera body. It can be used aiming blindly (if in a hurry) as the viewer/remote control are replaced by a simple app on the mobile phone. Excellent quality of course, but a quirky, specialised gadget I am very happy with on dog walks and with horse training. Like it very much as my big SLR is unwieldy.",

      "text": "This lens camera has stopped me buying smart phones for photo capabilities. In fact does not work with nokia 1020 windows os phone.Conversly works perfectly with htc one or sony ultra. The photos taken are unbeatable. By seperating phone from the lens endless interesting viewing positions can be found. I have bees nesting below gutter in a hole eighteen feet up. I just have to mount the lens camera on pole and snap away. Just one chritisism is lens has to be manually turned on by pressing button before conecting to phone for viewing. So annoying . I recomend this qx 100 and if rich would buy two. david evans teush",

Can be used to photograph in unusual spaces - leave it in a garden pot etc. but don't think this will work quickly. It is fiddly and you'll miss any action scene by the time you've got it working. It uses its own wifi which takes a while to load.",

There's plenty of hardware resource there to cope but it's just unusable as a camera replacement. I'm now processing a refund.",

Thing is, I know NOTHING about photography, but can still take amazing photos! My one issue with this is the camera app you are forced to use - no flexibility for creativeness and experimentation. However, Camera360 will imminently be launching support for this. Problem solved! I forsee many years of satisfaction with this handy springboard into photography.",

Images are comparable to a good point and shoot camera, but the controls and ergonomics aren't. It's too unwieldy to leave on the phone all day, but then it's not on the phone when you could use the zoom, and then the moment's gone. Compared to this, cheaper add-ons like the olloclip offer similar creative options, that you're simply more likely to take with you and use. Unless you're specifically looking for higher quality images, I would take a look at that.",
