It is so tacky. The ribbon, which I was going to cut off anyway, is not wide and nice like in the photos, but thin and plasticky. The basket is constructed in such a way that the basket would aways slant to one side, as the bottom of the basket only has a nice base on one side. I didn't expect a high quality basket for this price, but this is unusable. PS it's too small for a Dock-a-tot. Returning ASAP.",

They are so tiny, I accidentally mistook the sheet for trash and then (after searching the entire house!), found it IN the trashcan. Perhaps if they were a different color? Regardless, more sheets would cost the company little, and wouldn't force you to discontinue use of the basket while washing the ONE sheet. The price was right, but that little thing would bring so much more VALUE!",

It came out in stringy shreds. I recommend that you do NOT tumble dry the bedding, and possibly you'll have more success with it. I wish the company would make higher quality bedding.",

      "text": "The price was so good I did not expect such a nice set. I bought it from the \"used\" page. When it arrived it looked like it was brand new, never opened, everything in its original packaging. Just to buy a bumper pad alone was more expensive than this entire basket set. Had I bought this basket set at the \"new\" price, it still would only have been about the same price as a bumper set alone. The hood makes the basket look adorable, and offers some shade and protection from breezes. There are more expensive Moses baskets out there, but this one serves its purpose: it is cozy, safe, and comes in neutral colors.",
