Therefore, the sprayer is now unusable. I've extremely dissatisfied with this product and do not recommend it due to the cheap plastic that will not stand up to repeated twisting when the pump is screwed into place. Mine broke after only 3-4 uses.",

I substituted a metric, slightly oversized o-ring (46mm OD x 34mm ID) and it seems to work much better. A little harder to pump but a solid seal and I'm guessing will not loose its seal quite as fast. Be sure to lubricate o-ring & bore.

I am female & started to order the 2 gallon container so I wouldn't have to refill so often, but ultimately opted for the 1 gallon sprayer & am glad I decided on that -- the 2 gallon container when filled with product would really have been too heavy & cumbersome to carry around the yard. For a guy, that would be okay. Anyway, it's a great quality, has multiple nozzles, the pressure release valve - &, well, everything I want in a sprayer.",

I got a strong pressurized spray that dispensed a good amount of clear water based acrylic sealer. I do like the pressure release value and the adjustable nozzle. Also the setup out of the box was very simple, a few connections and you're ready to go. Rain beads up and don't soak into concrete. Clean up w water after the job.
