I just used a basic plumbers tape on the threads and pressure holds on each piece. Still disappointed they claim brass parts. They won't even reply..... Too bad.",

The end connector will only fit tiny attachments like the ball inflator. Most items had little weight to them and some look more like plastic. Just cheap garbage overall. These are basically disposable attachments. If you are even remotely serious about your tools, spend a few extra bucks and get something better than this.",

The blow gun requires putting the attachment on it (with small hole) in order to attach the ball inflator or pointed end to blow, which is odd why it wasn\u2019t just made to fit the two attachments, by passing the attachment with the holes.

Plus, with the quick connections, I'm able to switch from airing up tires to airing up air mattresses or basketballs in a flash. However, I would recommend some thread tape be handy as air was leaking out of the adapter at the threads when I put this on my compressor. Thread tape fixed that problem quick.",
