So basically if you want to spray water or any NON-interior paint you are fine probably, otherwise it will clog within minutes. That is even using the spray tip the paint manufacture recommends. I had painted one interior door before it clogged. I called Wagner and they said to thin the paint! I'm sorry, is it 1959? No one who is normal buys paint and then thins it to paint the interior of there own home!!!! Oh and cleaning this is quite fun.",

I pressed the press nut back on and it has been fine since. The sprayer does not spray air when the paint can is empty, it just runs continuously without building pressure (I did not see this mentioned in the manual). I did have one clog in 5 gallons of paint sprayed. I did not thin the paint. Make sure the hose is connected before you prime it because paint may come out even though it is supposed to only go to the return tube.",

It sprayed quickly and evenly and made short work of 50+ feet of fencing.
