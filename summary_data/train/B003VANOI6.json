      "text": "Waste of $100.00! Let me first say that I'm not in the category of folk who likes punishing loud music and I also understand the limitations of speakers to volume. This dock is ridiculous however. The speakers will \"clip\" at volumes exceeding approx. 30% of their capacity. WTF? Granted, I bought this used as \"very good\" and for the first month it was o.k. but to clip at low volumes is totally unacceptable. I have NEVER cranked the volume even once (or by accident) to cause damage that would allow this. Stay clear folks.",

It takes up very little space and is easily portable. It might not play as loud as the boom box but sound quality is better.

If you plan to use it a lot on battery power I would suggest purchasing an external battery such as the Anker\u00ae 2nd Gen Astro Pro, which plugs into the DC input on the back of the speaker.",

There are way cheaper options available if you are looking for a portable and rechargeable unit. There are also cheaper options available for a stereo that stays plugged in.

I had another iphone boombox prior to this and this never happened, so it was not my phone causing the problem. Lastly, the remote is worthless.

I've been extremely happy with all of it. The sound is as full as can be expected from such small speakers and can fill a good size area. You obviously won't have the thumping bass you might want with dance music, yet it has more presence than I've heard from other similar speakers.

Don't put it too close to a wall, experiment with placement. The hand held control didn't work when it came but all it needed was a new battery.

      "text": "Very nice sound from a small device. It doesn't handle a lot of bass well and there is no adjustment for treble or bass, so it just depends on the quality of your recording on your I-Pod. I am using an older full size I-Pod and it fits very snug with no wiggle and even stayed in when carried upside down with the I-Pod inserted (on accident of course). Overall..if you just need it in the house or a small to medium yard, it will be hard to beat this item for the price.",

I am very pleased, the sound quality and overall quality of construction is great. This system is very durable and well built. It has also big sound for such a little box. I am not sure that you get all the battery life that is advertised but there is enough juice for a good afternoon or evening of music. As other reviewers stated, the sound quality is great unplugged from the ac jack but better when plugged in. I would imagine Logitech did this to conserve battery power. Good job Logitech",

I was looking for something light and portable with a good sound. I mean, what is the point of listening to good music on mediocre speakers? well, the sound is really astonishing and even better than I had expected! and it is also very nice to have a handy remote. I can listen to music quietly in my living room or have a loud party! Very good product!",

      "text": "I was pleasantly surprised at the astounding quality of sound in the price point! The sound has depth and richness. I play it in my office using my iPhone as a radio tuner. Since I have a protective case on my iPhone 4s, I connect this with a cable. This is also convenient so that I can talk on the phone without having to disconnect it from the speaker system. This is a steal at this price and I firmly believe you would have to pay several time more to exceed this quality of sound.",

Other portable speakers come with small plastic templates that are supposed to provide the necessary support your device needs in order to spare it any stress from flopping around. These speakers have it built in and it works perfect. The sound from these speakers is very nice for the size and the included carrying case is extremely convenient. I debated weather or not to buy these but I am very happy with my decision after finally making it.",

Took it out to the park and tried it last weekend - WOW, it sounded incredible! It will easily be able to be heard by our 100+ guests.",
