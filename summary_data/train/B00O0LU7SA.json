      "text": "Heads work, but are kinda cheaply made. Edges could be sharper. Using my crossbow and 20\" bolts, I fired a test shot with this broad head and the flight path was erratic. I went to archery range with my practice bolts with field tips and 4 hunting bolts with the these broad heads. The field tips flew straight and the these broad tips were erratic. Found out from the guy at Cabelas that these tips are better for compound bows and are better for longer arrows and not recommended for the short crossbow bolts. Hope this helps",

I was definatley amazed that they were so effective as the same big stores carry. This have been bought and used and shot deer with these broadheads. I did go through a double lunged doe and hit a rock on the other side and mangled the tip, but I was hunting deer and not rocks lol. They work great for deer hunting!",
