The inside of the stopper\u2019s cheap, plastic, and definitely looks like it might break at some point in the near future. The cocktail glasses look great, if a little fragile. I definitely wouldn\u2019t muddle anything in them. If you\u2019re looking for a cheap decanter that\u2019ll look great on your bar or in liquor cabinet, look no further. If you want to purchase a really nice gift, or an heirloom quality display piece, you\u2019re probably going to need to pony up a little more cash.",

If you are looking for an ok looking Decatur to fill and set out for a party (but you will empty what's left back into the original bottle after the party) then this will probably work for you.

I should of gone with a set that had a corkscrew material at the seal instead. But other than that I love it. And I can deal with the plastic. Its really not that bad.",
