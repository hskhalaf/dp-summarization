I don\u2019t know if I ordered a size too large, or what. I like them enough though that I\u2019m going to order another pair a size smaller, just to see if that\u2019s the problem. I hope it is because I really want to love these shoes. If it weren\u2019t for the insoles sliding I would order one in every color!",

If you wear them for lounging by the pool or light boating activities, they work perfectly fine. The reason I wasn\u2019t completely satisfied with this product is because it\u2019s almost impossible to swim with them on. If you kick your foot once in submerged water, you\u2019re almost sure to lose a shoe. Keep that in mind if swimming with shoes on is important to you.",
