After 45 days, they sent the correct wheel- but they did NOT send the COMPLETE wheel. The wheel bearings for the wheel were not included with the correct wheel. 2 months after purchase and my kid is still not riding this. At this rate, he'll outgrow the damn thing before it's fixed. Also, they run small, so if you're kid is older than 6 or 7, beware that he/she may outgrow it soon (even when the seat's fully adjusted out).",

It is very well made, rides very smooth, easy to change seat length, no chain to get anything caught, really a great little go kart. Rolls very easy on sidewalk, but also does well on gravel and on grass. Our grandchildren just love them. Thank You.",

If they are riding at a high speed and cut the wheel all the way too quickly it's possible the bike can roll over. I personally love the design and build quality of this Berg Buddy. Get it for your kid, you will love it.",

      "text": "I didn't know if my daughter would \"take\" to this as her seventh birthday gift (her main present). I was able to quickly assemble it (tools were included). It took less than ten minutes. She absolutely loved it. She rode it for almost an hour in the dark (supervised, naturally). I was very surprised at the build quality and smoothness of the ride. I highly recommend it!",

I am impressed with its stability and pivot on the front axel. We have slopped curbs on our street and he can ride on and off of them without tipping over. We look forward to many years of riding. Iam sure that the younger and future grand children will be riding this toy someday as well!",

I'm not a big fan of those so this was the compromise. He is pretty happy with it and it goes way faster than the powered ones, while getting him some exercise. Highly recommend!",
