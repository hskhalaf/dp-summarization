      "title": "Finally SNK Playmore Delivers !",
      "text": "I'm a huge fan of KOF games, but let's face it most are WAY below par. The best KOF game imo is the PC Mugen version, but this is also very entertaining. The fight system is sophisticated , yet complex and unlike say Marvel vs Capcom you won't be able to pull combos off with ease. Many fan favourites have returned , such as Mature and there's lots to unlock, but the game probably borders on too easy. If you're a KOF fan, you're definately in for a treat. The graphics are sumptious, but the characters are probably a little too small.",

I would have given this game a 5 if it had not been for the difficult controls due to the 360 controller and empty multiplayer. If you can afford a joystick for this game and like king of fighters, then this is for you",
