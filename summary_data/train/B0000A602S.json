I took it back, and got a Kodak digital for a few dollars more, and it has beautiful pictures! Also, you Have to use rechargable digital batteries. Regular batteries last for a few pictures only. The lens in the camera is stationary, so I think it will never focus as nice as a movable one.",

We got a charger and 4 batteries for $28 (15 min. charger at that) She enjoys taking video with it. And you can also add audio clips to each picture which you can listen to on the computer. She has had a ball doing that. (She is a budding director) Picture quality is great for home use. I would recommend this camera to anyone who loves to take pictures.",

I recently dropped this camera and it completely shattered and is now useless. However, if you use it properly, it's a nice little camera. The pictures always turn out well enough for me.",

They either come out barely visible or have an ugly blue-ish hue to them. The camera eats up batteries like no tomorrow, the pictures are grainy, red-eye is a BIG problem, the camera itself is ugly and mildly bulky which makes it a pain to carry around, it has a very slow shutter speed[don't even bother trying to take pictures of anything that moves] and is all-around a terrible camera.
