We're not sure if it was a Calphalon error or an Amazon Fulfillment error, but someone isn't checking people's returns before they're sent out to new customers. Very disappointed.",

While most of my pots and pans are still in good shape, a couple of them are no longer non-stick. I didn't notice any peeling or other issues; they simply stopped being nonstick and I have to use lots of oil/butter to prevent my food from sticking, and even then it often doesn't work.",

Some of the Calphalon Set Reviews are hit or miss, but I knew that I wouldn't be going wrong if I got the same simply series as what I have been using! Great purchase and the price was unbeatable! It heats evenly, the non-stick is awesome. Even if it does stick without the use of any kind of oil, you can use silicone utensils to scrape it without damaging your pan. Love them!",

If in fact you had a valid return Calaphalon does not provide a return shipping label so it is at the buyers expense.
