      "text": "ArtNaturals Argan Oil is the best shampoo I have ever purchased in my life. My hair went from being sometimes frizzy, sometimes straight, sometimes in between to easy to manage, straight, super shiny, healthy hair that I have always desired. I get tons of compliments from others and people often ask me what I use because my hair looks so good. I wash my hair three times a week with this shampoo and I don't even need the accompanying conditioner because the shampoo is so moisturizing in and of itself. However, the conditioner does add a little protection and shine when using hair dryers and straighteners. I highly recommend this product!",

My hair is usually very frizzy for up to 10-14ish hours after washing even with defrizz products put in. Using this product my hair drys so nicely. I love it. Totally hooked. Also now I use a organic leave in organic serum I made myself of argan oil, vegetable glycerin, sandlewood essential oil, and lemon essential oil.",

I guess your hair can shed more due to stress and various other factors, but even though I can't say this product was 100% the reason my hair stop shedding I feel confident it helped..",

With these products I only have to wash and condition. Then I use a little bit of the same wash out conditioner as a leave in. My curls have never looked so good. My hair also is not weighed down. I just love this stuff!!",

The shampoo is so moisturizing in itself. However, the conditioner does add a little protection and shine when using hair dryers and straighteners. I highly recommend this product! I will def buy again",
