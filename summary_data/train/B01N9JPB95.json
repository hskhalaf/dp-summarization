I tend to order a size up due to the reflective pieces being a tad tight on the guy's midriff. Other than that, so far so great!! The guys love them and they prevent having to wear the annoying vests all day long, up and down ladders. These shirts have proved their worth to us! We will always purchase from this seller.",

Got to say so much easier wearing these shirts than having to wear a tshirt with a vest over it all day. Gets very warm and these shirts make it so much more cooler, breathable and flexibility of movement and no worries of vest getting caught in the roller lines.",

Most companies require tags on shirts for safety standards verification. It would be awesome if it was an imprinted tag. This sounds petty but for a worker it drives them crazy as you start moving and sweating. All around great shirt though.",
