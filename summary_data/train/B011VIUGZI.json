Check out the two attached images to get a sense of the scale, and how it can fit completely within larger consoles.",

I loop the elastic strap around the seat belt anchor, and it sits just behind the center console, easily reachable by the driver and front and back seat passengers. Its wide mouth eliminates the need to pry it open, which can be aggravating, especially for the driver. I highly recommend it for vehicles and vans with center consoles.",
