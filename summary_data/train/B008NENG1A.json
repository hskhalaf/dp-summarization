Knowing Canon was a reputable brand, I decided to take the plunge with this camera. This was my first interchangeable lens camera, and is the camera I currently use for my photography and videography. I vlog on this camera, using the 1080p recording mode to the fullest extent. The camera quality is excellent, despite the autofocus being slow. The only things I could really wish for this camera is a viewfinder and a flash.",

Focus speed is fixed with the firmware update. I tend to use this for wide shots/primes and my 7D for more telephoto/action/zooming. The two cameras together are a great combo, and the bonus is that they can use the same lenses (with the adapter) and flashes. The M on its own is a great casual camera that can yield SLR results, but the magic really happens when you have 2 bodies and don't have to switch lenses all the time.",

    "title": "Canon EOS M 18.0 MP Compact Systems Camera with 3.0-Inch LCD and EF-M 22mm STM Lens (OLD MODEL)",
    "description": "Style:With EF-M 22mm STM LensInspired by EOS technology, Canon developed the new EOS M Digital Camera. Canon introduced the market to Full HD video capture with smooth, quiet continuous autofocus made possible by Movie Servo AF and STM lenses, advanced CMOS sensor technology, and the processing power of DIGIC 5. The EOS M Digital Camera leverages these key technologies to deliver high-quality moving and still images with creativity provided by Canon\u2019s extensive family of interchangeable lenses.Sensor Type / Size CMOS, 22.3 x 14.9 mm.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n True HD Performance | EOS Full HD Movie Mode with Movie Servo AF\nFor those looking to capture superb quality Full HD video, the EOS M Digital Camera offers a number of advantages. Offering a large APS-C sized sensor, the camera is able to deliver shallow depth-of-field for achieving impressive cine-style results and the ability to capture clean, high-quality video, even under very low-light conditions. \nWith the optional Mount Adapter EF-EOS M, the camera is also compatible with Canon's extensive family of EF lenses for boundless creativity.\n\nCapable of shooting in a number of recording sizes and frame rates, the EOS M Digital Camera continues Canon's tradition of performance, quality and simplicity. The EOS M Digital Camera enables easy manual control of focus and exposure. It also automatically splits files greater than 4GB (FAT specifications) for extended recording without interruption.\n\nMovie Servo AF allows continuous autofocus tracking of moving subjects while recording video. When shooting video with one of Canon\u2019s new STM lenses, Movie Servo AF takes advantage of the lens\u2019 stepping motor for smooth and quiet continuous AF.\n\n\n\nResolution & Recording Sizes\nFrame Rates\nRecording Time Based on 8 GB Memory Card Full HD\n1920 x 1080\n16:9 format\n30 fps (29.97)\nMaximum Recording Time 29 min. 59 sec.\n25 fps \u2013 PAL standard\nTotal Recording Time (approximately)\n1920 x 1080 (Full HD) 22 min. 24 fps (23.976)\n1280 x 720 (HD) 22 min. HD\n1280 x 720\n16:9 format\n60 fps (59.94)\n640 x 480 (SD) 1 hr. 32 min. 50 fps \u2013 PAL standard\nRecording Time Based on 16 GB Memory Card\nStandard Definition (SD)\n640 x 480\n30 fps (29.97)\nMaximum Recording Time 29 min. 59 sec. 25 fps \u2013 PAL standard\nTotal Recording Time (approximately) 1920 x 1080 (Full HD) 44 min.\n1280 x 720 (HD) 44 min.\n640 x 480 (SD) 3 hr. 4 min.\n\n\nBuilt-in stereo microphone, manual audio level adjustment\nThe EOS M Digital Camera has an internal stereo microphone for high-quality audio capture and a wind filter feature to reduce wind noise when shooting outdoors. Sound recording levels can be manually (up to 64 different levels) or automatically controlled. A built-in attenuator is also provided to reduce audio clipping. For more advanced audio recording, the EOS M Digital Camera is compatible with many third-party electret condenser microphones with a 3.5mm diameter plug.\n\nVideo Snapshot\nWith the Video Snapshot feature, the EOS M Digital Camera can capture short video clips (of 2, 4 or 8 seconds) then combine them automatically into one video file as a snapshot or highlights \u201calbum.\u201d With no editing required after shooting, the compiled video is perfect for sharing online or displaying directly on an HDTV via the camera's HDMI port. Additionally, stills can be recorded during video shooting simply by pressing the camera\u2019s shutter button. During playback, video clips in an album can now be reordered or deleted. \n\n\nExtraordinary Image Quality and Processing Power\n\n18.0 Megapixel CMOS (APS-C) sensor\nThe EOS M Digital Camera features Canon\u2019s amazing 18.0 Megapixel CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) sensor. Perfect for enlargements or for cropping detailed portions of the composition, the EOS M Digital Camera\u2019s sensor captures images with exceptional clarity and tonal range. This first-class sensor features many of the same new technologies used by professional Canon cameras to maximize each pixel's light-gathering efficiency and has center pixels that aid in the EOS M Digital Camera\u2019s accurate AF performance. This APS-C size sensor creates an effective 1.6x field of view (compared to 35mm format).\nVersatile ISO Range for shooting in a wide variety of lighting conditions\nThanks to its DIGIC 5 Image Processor, the EOS M Digital Camera features a versatile ISO range of ISO 100\u20136400 (expandable to 12800 in H mode) for video recording and ISO100\u201312800 (expandable to 25600 in H mode) for still image shooting. The EOS M Digital Camera, with the DIGIC 5 Image Processor's remarkable noise-reduction technology, delivers outstanding performance in low light for incredible video and photos.\n\nDIGIC 5 Image Processor\nThe EOS M Digital Camera features Canon\u2019s DIGIC 5 Image Processor. The DIGIC 5 Image Processor works with the camera\u2019s CMOS sensor to deliver images with incredible detail in more situations, without the need for artificial light sources. With the power of the DIGIC 5 Image Processor the EOS M Digital Camera can achieve higher ISO sensitivity and even perform advanced functions like HDR Backlight Control, art filters, lens correction and much more. The brilliant \u201cbrain\u201d of the camera, this engine supercharges every facet of image capture.\n\nHybrid CMOS AF delivers fast autofocus speed for video and photos.\nThe EOS M Digital Camera uses a hybrid AF system to deliver incredibly speedy and accurate focus. Its CMOS sensor has center-mounted pixels that are used for phase-difference AF. Phase difference AF is incredibly fast for general distance determination, while contrast AF is incredibly accurate, no matter the location of the focus point. By capitalizing on the strengths of phase-difference and contrast AF systems, the EOS M Digital Camera achieves precise AF, fast.\n\nSharp and Clear, with Tactile Controls\n\nTouch Screen 3.0-inch Clear View LCD monitor II with multi-touch operation and Touch AF\nThe EOS M Digital Camera comes with a newly engineered, Touch Screen 3.0-inch Clear View LCD monitor II. Using the same capacitive technology as today\u2019s popular mobile devices, this new screen is touch-sensitive and delivers intuitive touch panel operation. Two finger touch gestures (multi-touch) can be used for zooming or changing images, menu and quick control settings can be accessed, and focus point and shutter release can be activated with the touch of a fingertip. The additional benefit of Touch AF makes it fast and easy to focus on any subject, by simply touching it on the screen. Displaying fine detail (at approximately 1.04 million pixels), this screen is perfect for composing and reviewing images. Thanks to a new, solid construction between the monitor\u2019s resin-coated cover and the liquid crystal display, reflections are minimized, and the display can be viewed, without glare, from any number of angles. The LCD\u2019s surface is treated with a smudge-resistant coating to minimize fingerprints and maintain a bright, clear image display.\n\nA Comprehensive System Of EOS Optics\n\nCompatible with the full line of Canon EF and EF-S lenses (optional Mount Adapter EF-EOS M is required)\nThe EOS M Digital Camera features a new style lens mount, called EF-M. Besides the dedicated EF-M lenses, the camera is compatible with the entire family of Canon EF and EF-S lenses by attaching the optional Mount Adapter EF-EOS M. When the adapter is used, the image quality of the lens is preserved, with no light loss or change to image stabilization. \n\nFrom fisheye to telephoto and everywhere in between, Canon offers the most comprehensive lens collection on the planet, with the finest optics and most advanced technologies for whatever application is at hand.\n\nWhen shooting video with one of Canon\u2019s new STM lenses, the camera\u2019s Movie Servo AF feature takes advantage of the lens\u2019 stepping motor for smooth and quiet continuous AF.\n\nEffects for Dramatic and Gorgeous Results\n\nHandheld Night Scene mode\nAccessible right on the EOS M Digital Camera\u2019s Mode Dial, Handheld Night Scene mode captures nightscapes with bright highlights and detailed dark areas, delivering results previously impossible without the use of a tripod. By shooting and combining four consecutive shots at a shutter speed fast enough to avoid camera shake, the EOS M Digital Camera\u2019s Handheld Night Scene mode makes dramatic nighttime photography simple.\n\nHDR Backlight Control mode\nThe EOS M Digital Camera\u2019s HDR Backlight Control mode ensures that backlit subjects are not recorded too dark. By shooting three consecutive shots at different exposures (underexposed, correctly exposed and overexposed) and then combining the images, the final result maintains detail in both the shadow and highlight areas, ensuring the backlit subject is properly exposed.\n\nSeven Creative Filters, plus new Art Bold Effect and Water Painting Effect\nAdding to the fun and creative possibilities available with the EOS M Digital Camera are seven different creative filters that can dramatically alter the mood and visual effect of any particular scene. Creative Filters include Grainy Black and White, Soft Focus, Fish-eye Effect, Toy Camera Effect, Miniature Effect and new filters: Art Bold Effect (makes the photos look like an oil painting, with subjects appearing three-dimensional), and Water Painting Effect (photos are altered to look like a water-colored painting). Since the filters can be applied to the image after shooting, it\u2019s easy to try several effects on the same shot. These creative effects can also be applied to video, for additional imaginative fun.\n\nMulti Shot Noise Reduction\nTo enhance its already admirable high ISO shooting capabilities, the EOS M Digital Camera features an intelligent Multi Shot Noise Reduction tool that reduces noise even further than the camera\u2019s sensor and the DIGIC 5 Image Processor alone. With Multi Shot Noise Reduction activated, the camera takes four consecutive shots, merges and aligns them. This eliminates more noise than the traditional Noise Reduction filter, with little or no apparent resolution loss. Moving subjects are even optimized to minimize subject blur! Thanks to this clever new feature, high ISO shooting has never looked better. \n\n\nEOS M Digital Camera Body\nEF-M 22mm f/2 STM Lens\nNeck Strap EM-100DB\nBattery Pack LP-E12\nBattery Charger LC-E12\nUSB Interface Cable IFC-130U\nEOS Digital Solution Disk, Camera Instruction Manual and Software Instruction Manual CD",
