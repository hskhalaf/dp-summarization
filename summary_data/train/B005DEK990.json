It is nice to see her enjoying her day time hours again, since being able to get a good night's rest. I am happy to find something supplemental, not a heavy duty prescription drug.",

The 3 mg is all I need to stay asleep. I recommend starting at 5mg and using a pill cutter until you reach the smallest dose that will allow you to fall asleep and stay asleep to minimize drowsiness.",
