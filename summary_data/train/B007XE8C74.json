I needed to do a reset because there were 3 possible sensors and 1 solenoid that could have caused the fault I was getting, so I needed to do a reset to see if I replaced the right sensor. Otherwise, I would have to drive around and wait for the OBD to clear the fault. The ODB scanner was definitely worth the money.",

Turns out it is an emissions code and it comes on due to Subaru's ridiculous emissions standards. The car passes smog just fine. I was tired of taking the car in every time the light came on. I would have just left it on or put a piece of tape over the light, but it shuts off my cruise control. This scanner not only id's the code but resets it quickly and easily. I now get asked by all my friends to check their cars. I really love this tool. Would highly recommend it.",
