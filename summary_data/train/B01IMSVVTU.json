I'd disconnect and sync again, but after a few minutes I would once again not have control in whichever game I was playing. Maybe I got a dud?",

For example go to shoot in game the first shot will fire and I have to press RELEASE a dozen times before it will shoot again. Not sure if it is having signal or button issues.

Well it arrived and I got curious if it played emulator games on the cellphone and how well it would be and I mapped PERFECTLY to it. It is very responsive with no lag running PSP and ps1 emulator. Well needless to say my son is not getting this one so I had to order another one. I love this thing!!!!",

The buttons are already mapped to simulate a DS and the battery life is great so far.",
