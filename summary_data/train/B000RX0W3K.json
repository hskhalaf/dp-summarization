Sometimes as you slide it down you need to shake and vibrate the tube to work it down... or put a finger over the top and invert it\u2019s you shake. Those people who say they can roll just as quick doing it the \u201cold fashioned way\u201d, I think they are exaggerating. There is no way this isn\u2019t helpful.",

With the pennies you might get an extra penny in the roll, but who cares it is just a penny. Sometimes it is a little stubborn but I can usually get a preformed paper roll to slide into the tube after I have filled it, which makes putting the coins in paper rolls quick and easy.",

Make sure you place the wrappers at lest half way down and keep your finger on the stack of coins to prevent them from falling through. After a few times, you will whip through wrapping coins. Get the papers from MMF industries as the tubes are color coded to match the papers. Never thought wrapping coins could be so easy. Highly recommend this product.",

The good news is I turn the rolled coins into my bank and if I am over or under a penny they make the correction. I know, the banks rob us of Billions of dollars in the housing bust and I still trust them with my pennies, I am a slow learner.",

I was tempted to purchase an electronic counter/roller, however after reading the reviews of change being miscounted and/or put into the wrong cases, I dediced to get these. It would be helpful if it was clearer on when you reached 50 coins. There are small slots cut into the plasic near the top, however that space is about 1/2\" thick and you could easily fill up each roll with a different count of coins.",
