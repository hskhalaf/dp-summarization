I \"reshopped\" today and found a Canon Elph 800si but - it was only 3x optical zoom not 5x, it weighed more, cost $100 more, had fewer features and scenes (which I really use), wasn't weather resistant and was harder to \"figure out\". I decided to keep my 750 and just learn how to shield the display better. It takes great shots and the automatic scenes are easy to use and easy to switch among. Much easier than my old Olympus.",

I think we will have years of enjoyment from the memories captured on this fine device. It is Olympus quality in a little credit card size box!

Unfortunately the view screen is almost impossible to see in full light so you end up shooting by just pointing the camera in the general direction. I used the camera this past week to shoot a group of dancers under normal room light using the shoot movies mode and with the image zoomed to some extent. As long as the clip is viewed in default format (or 2x the size) the picture looks quite good and the sound is quite reasonable.",

This seems to be a growing problem with new point and shoot digitals. I would have given it 5 stars otherwise.

The macro setting allows you to get within an inch of your subject--as long as you don't need the flash--which is great for well lit subjects. The one limitation, and it's been mentioned by others here, is that you have to be very careful about focusing on your subject. The camera really seems to like to focus on errant spots.",

We also handed it (minus the underwater housing) someone standing in the water to take pictures. The smile on my face was from knowing that if the camera was dropped in the water by accident, it wouldn't matter. I also enjoy the size, having brought it into venues where \"no cameras allowed\" is stated but not thoroughly enforced. :)",

    "title": "Olympus Stylus 750 7.1MP Digital Camera with Digital Image Stabilized 5x Optical Zoom and CCD Shift Stabilization (Black)",
    "description": "Color:BlackFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nOlympus continues to innovate with the launch of the Stylus 750 digital camera, a technically sophisticated point-and-shoot camera offering a number of pioneering technologies such as Dual Image Stabilization, Bright Capture Technology, and TruePic Turbo, as well as a powerful 5x optical zoom that tucks away into a streamlined metal, all-weather body design. The camera is distinguished by a number of premium features, including: \n\n * An advanced combination of the mechanical CCD-shift Image Stabilization and Digital Image Stabilization work together to ensure the clearest pictures possible in any situation; \n * A 5x optical zoom lens with a newly developed lens element to maintain a small compact size; \n * A 2.5-inch LCD and Bright Capture Technology dramatically improve composition, capture and review of images in low-light situations; \n * Olympus' exclusive TruePic Turbo Image Processing engine is coupled with a 7.1-megapixel image sensor to produce crisp, high-quality photos.\n\nThe camera is also available in four colors: silver, black, green, and red.  \n\nGet close to the action with 5x optical zoom 5x Optical Zoom in Slim Body\nOlympus incorporates new lens technology into the Stylus 750 that enables the 5x optical zoom lens (36mm-180mm, f3.3-f 5.0 equivalent in 35mm photography) to bring the action five times closer in a less than 1-inch-thick body--overall dimensions are 3.8 inches wide x 2.1 inches high x 0.96 inches deep. Olympus lenses are known worldwide for producing sharp, vibrant, high-quality images. This is achieved through a number of key technologies, such as Olympus' high-refractive-index lens elements and newly developed dual super aspherical lens elements.  Dual Image Stabilization\nThe Stylus 750 features an advanced combination of mechanical CCD-shift image stabilization and digital image stabilization. CCD-shift image stabilization uses built-in electro-gyro sensors to record camera movement and adjust the CCD image sensor. This ensures that light remains centered on the image sensor to maintain image clarity despite a slight movement on the part of the photographer. Digital image stabilization mode boosts ISO sensitivity and shutter speed so that images remain crisp and clear-free from the blur caused by moving subjects. The combination of the two image-stabilization technologies ensures the best image clarity in virtually any shooting environment. \n\n All-Weather Durability\nTypically, water and photography are a bad combination, limiting outdoor photography options when rain, snow, or sleet are involved. However, the compact, all-weather Stylus 750 can go virtually anywhere. The metal body construction is durable and lightweight with rubber gaskets throughout the interior to ensure that rain, dust, and snow won't get in the way of great photos. \n\n Bright Capture Technology for Easy Low-Light Photography\nThere are times when you want to photograph subjects in low light without having to use a flash, for example, when trying to capture the softness and warmth of a candlelit dinner or natural skin tones in subdued lighting. Olympus' revolutionary Bright Capture Technology makes it possible to clearly compose images on the LCD in low light. With specific scene modes for high sensitivity settings (up to ISO 2500) and rapid autofocus, even fast-action photos can be captured under low levels of available light. Plus, Bright Capture Movie lets you record the moments in the dark even after the candles are blown out! \n\n Bright Capture Technology in Action \n\n 7.1-Megapixel Image Sensor for Superior Image Quality \nThe 7.1-megapixel CCD image sensor inside the Stylus 750 delivers high-quality images that are consistently sharp and vivid even when printed in large-formats-up to poster sizes as large as 15 x 20 inches. \n\n Large 2.5-Inch LCD\nWith a bright 2.5-inch LCD, the Stylus 750 easily doubles as a portable digital photo album. This high quality LCD makes it easier to see images clearly both when shooting and sharing photos with friends without having to download the images to a computer.\n\n TruePic Turbo for High-Speed Response\nOlympus' exclusive TruePic Turbo Image Processor enhances image quality and delivers faster overall processing speeds for rapid start-up, shutter release, and playback. TruePic Turbo enables the Stylus 750 to capture information from all 7.1 million pixels with pixel \"micro-smoothing\" that delivers clearer and more color-accurate photos. The fast start-up of less than one second and nearly instant shutter release time ensure a high-speed response so your camera is always ready to take great pictures.\n\n 27 Selectable Shooting Modes\nWith 23 pre-programmed scene modes, such as Beach and Snow, Available Light Portrait, Sunset, and Under Water Macro, the Stylus 750 makes it easy to capture beautiful images in a variety of lighting and shooting situations. Plus, with QuickTime Movie Mode, the camera can also record VGA-quality videos with sound, limited only by the size of the internal memory or xD Picture Card in the camera.\n\n Built-In Help Guide\nWith the Help Guide function, each of the camera's features is easily accessible even to novice users. By simply holding down the Guide button on the back of the camera, users can access brief descriptions of each of the camera's functions and scene modes. An improved auto-set Shooting Guide provides users with an explanation of which features to use in a given situation, and then sets the camera automatically for the selected feature in the Guide.\n\n One-Touch Easy Print--No Computer Necessary\nThe power of PictBridge technology enables your photos to be printed directly from your camera to any PictBridge-enabled printer without using a computer. The one-touch \"Print\" button makes printing a single-step process. Printing and sharing images has never been easier!\n\n In-Camera Editing \nIn-camera editing features such as red-eye fix, resizing, frames, text options, color brightness, and saturation adjustments enable users to edit photos right in the camera.\n\n Underwater Photography\nThe large 2.5-inch LCD, 5x optical zoom, compact body size, and three underwater scene modes make the Stylus 750 the perfect camera to take along diving. The new PT-034 underwater housing is constructed of transparent polycarbonate with safety-locked o-ring seals, enabling the Stylus 750 to safely travel down to 40 meters below the surface. Large red grips, a responsive shutter button, and a precision zoom lever make it easy to operate even through diving gloves. Plus, with Bright Capture Technology, images can be easily previewed on the LCD even in the darkest waters. (Underwater housing is not included--must be purchased separately.)\n\n Olympus Master Software\nOlympus Master Software provides the ultimate in digital imaging management. An intuitive user interface makes downloading images to a computer quick and simple, and images are searchable by date or keyword in the Calendar View. Also, with one-click editing tools, such as red-eye removal, images can be touched up before printing or e-mailing. Online support, templates, firmware upgrades, and other user services are just a mouse-click away.\n\n What's in the Box\nOlympus Stylus 750, wrist strap, WIN/Mac USB cable, audio-video cable, LI-42B Li-Ion rechargeable battery and charger, instruction manual, warranty card, and CD-ROM with Olympus Master Software.",
