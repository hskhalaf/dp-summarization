      "text": "My family is switching to wheat alternatives (oat flour, coconut flour, etc) and they tended to stick on our old teflon-coated waffle iron. We also recognize that the teflon may be harmful, especially once it gets scratched or starts to flake off. This ceramic coating is amazing, and our stickiest batters are popping right out without issues. We are having to leave the waffles in a little longer to get them 'done' to our liking, but once we got the timing figured out, we've really enjoyed cooking and eating waffles.",

Now, the batter seems to be sticking so that when I open the maker, the inside of the waffle is raw and the outside that is stuck to the grids, is crispy. It is hard to gauge the temp and does not alert you as to when the waffle is ready. Waste of money.",

It's plastic when the rest of the device is metal - that's going to cause a really severe stress point.

As others have mentioned, turn the heat up to high and follow the light indicators on the waffle maker - foolproof. We do no use any oil or butter on the ceramic plates and they are naturally nonstick. Best of all no Teflon to achieve this.",
