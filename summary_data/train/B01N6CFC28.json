      "verdict": "Asics relies more on muscle than finesse with the Gel FujiAttack 5. That being said, this Asics trail running shoe still lacked a few essential protection schemes that trail enthusiasts would dearly love to have. However, it does have a really good quality that never fails to impress runners. It brings luxurious comfort when training on the trail.",
      "pros": [
        "The Gel FujiAttack 5 is a very durable trail shoe based on the reviews of many runners",
        "A good number of runners really liked the support the FujiAttack 5 delivers",
        "Cushioning is plush in this shoe with the SpEVA, Solyte, and Gel Cushioning System combined",
        "The protective components in this model are limited, but they effectively shield the foot from debris and other hazards",
        "The Asics FujiAttack 5 moves the runner from the doorstep to the trail quite well",
        "Traction is provided by a compound that uses more natural rubber than the more solid form, resulting in a more responsive outsole unit"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "The price for a pair of the FujiAttack 5 is slightly expensive",
        "It has a moderately heavy weight",
        "A couple of runners wished for more trail protection features since it has a fairly high price, like an anti-debris upper or a reinforced toe cap"

Thank goodness I found these on Amazon in my size. They are lower-profile than road shoes, have a good tread pattern, enough cushioning, a precise fit, and are great for low fell, trail or multi terrain running.",

      "text": "I would definitely not buy this shoe again. Two pairs (the first was sent back for a fault) both tore to the left of the big toe despite me having a normal foot and gait. Also, the shoe is too heavy in the wrong places. The shoe should have more reinforcement at the front and ball and less on the sides. I wear many Asics shoes for road running but am not impressed with their trail shoes. Finally, the laces easily come undone.",

I have been using them on paths and trails around the Chilterns, so I was very disappointed that after just over six months they started to show heavy signs of wear. This surprised me as I have only been running around 30 to 35 miles per week. I expected to show this wear after at least 12 months as they are not used on hard terrain only muddy trails and paths! I have therefore stopped using the ASICS Gel-Fujiattack 5 Trail Running Shoes, and use Inovs instead that I have been using for fell running.",
