It automatically shuts off after 2 minutes of no vibrations. I put this on the back of my bicycle. I don't think the police in the USA would like it on a car or truck since it could be distracting to other drivers. On my bicycle it works good bt keep moving a little or it shuts off and someone behind may not see you. I like it to take 5 minutes or 10 before shutting back down.",
