Since using this product, when I have a flare up I use this product and within a few days my cyst is gone.",

It\u2019s not for sensitive skin as it is harsh, and you do need a moisturizer after using this product. But if you want to eliminate fine lines this works. My skin is somewhat sensitive and I haven\u2019t had any issues. Heads up the first few times you use it you may have some acne because it clears out your pores. I promise this product works",

I like how it makes my skin so clean, smooth and soft after using it to cleanse my face. However, it can be a little drying if you use it too frequent. So, my verdict : may use as a normal cleanser but not too frequent and definitely not daily.",
