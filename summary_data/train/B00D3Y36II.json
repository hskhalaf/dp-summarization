When trying to wash the throw pillows, the same issue occured with the cotton inside the pillow coming out. I was afraid to even attempt to place in dryer on no heat- tumble for fear it would cause even more damage. If you are unable to take the set to the Cleaners and your only option is a washing machine, this set may not be the best option",
