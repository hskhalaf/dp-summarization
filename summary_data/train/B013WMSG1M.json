The instructions were easy to read and the delivery was quick too!

I wish it was already assembled like the other Belham furniture pieces.",

I will say the consumer service was good and that deserved the extra star.",

The middle section features a drawer on each side and the openings pass through and are accessible from both sides -- features that are wonderful, but not obvious from the pictures. The result is sturdy but light so its easy to reposition and I expect it to last quite a while.",

It also showed up much faster than expected, 2-3 days vs the week and half projected. We got the side table and the bookshelf in this collection as well. We haven't set up the bookshelf yet, but assume we'll be just as happy. Aesthetically pleasing and didn't break the bank! Win, Win!!",
