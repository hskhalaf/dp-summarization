I have been shooting at the deer side of this target for quit a while now and I haven't noticed any significant wear. Still stops the arrows great.

My R20 bolt will stop once in a given location, but not twice. In other words, its good for one hit per location. If you fire two shots at small/similar spot, the bolt is buried or blows through target. The Ravin R20 claims to shoot 435 fps. My chronograph measured it slightly lower.

      "text": "This is the best crossbow / archery target there is when it comes to stopping an arrow and then allowing easy removal. I don't know how they do it but it works. It's not the most convenient as it's fairly heavy but it holds up very well and it's easy arrow removal characteristics are unmatched by any target out there. Only other drawback is you can't use broadheads but I consider this minor since my crossbow doesn't require me to actually practice with broadheads. Plus I use mechanicals which come with dummy practice points anyhow. This is simply the best target you can get overall!",

Before that 4th arrow it would have been 5 stars, but I'm afraid it's not going to last as long as I'd hoped. The rest of the arrows pulled out easily. It was just that one time I had trouble getting an arrow out.",

Negative: quite heavy (my wife was unable to manage it) and cumbersome. Aluminium bolts are relatively easy to remove; high-end carbon bolts (Headhunter, Decimator and such) - pretty manageable, cheaper ones - not always easy. Bottom line: excellent product .

The 4 sides have different pictures to shoot at which is nice depending on your next outing. e.g.-Hunting vs Target practice. It is remarkably heavy which is a good thing as it easily stops my sons 65 lb easton aluminum arrows. I just shot my Excalibur 200 lb crossbow and it stopped my 20\" aluminum bolt (point blank-field tip) with only 9\" of penetration into the target. So I would highly recommend this target for all your archery target needs.",
