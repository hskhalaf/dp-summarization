The flip out AC connector would not stay properly engaged in either the open or closed position.

      "text": "I bought this last month and love it. Anker makes great products and stands behind them. We use it to charge both Apple and Android products and other portable devices without issues. We have 3 portable chargers and this is the best by far because of how fast it charges. It comes with a nice carrying case and charging supplies. FYI, this charger does have some weight to it.",

      "text": "Not only is the powercore+ 26800 a great product but their support is also very responsive and knowledgeable. Had an issue with my powercore+ after 8 months (treated it well just the Q charge port stopped working) - had a brand new one in about 3 days (not a refurb) and sent in the old one. It's nice to see companies that treat you well; a rarity these days. I have also purchased several other Anker products that are still working just fine - the cables are top notch and the additional usb chargers (multi-port, etc) all work great. Good company - I recommend them.",
