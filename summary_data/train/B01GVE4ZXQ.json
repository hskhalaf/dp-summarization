However, when this came out, I was overjoyed to learn that now players can get everything available right now in Killer Instinct without shelling out unneeded amounts of money!!! Collecting Season 1-3 of Killer Instinct on Xbox One, you automatically receive the game and all characters and customizable costumes for all characters that have them. You still need to unlock costume content in the game, but thats not too big of a gripe. The only downside is that I wish I knew of this sooner before I bought season 2....but everything else is okay in my book!",
