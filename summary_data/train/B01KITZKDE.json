Since it's compatible with Macs, I suggest download all pics/video and erase it from the camera to create free space every time one uses it. Also for prolong times when not in use TAKE THE BATTERY OUT; it may leak the cost for a new one is over $25.00! There is a charger where the battery snaps into the charger; if the LED on the charger remains flashing--DON'T UNPLUG IT!!. It has two USB ports (unfamiliar with the variety) to hook up to any mac device, in this case.",

Pair it with the 35mm at 1.8/f DX and you have an awesome duo.

    "description": "Color:Black| Style:w/ 18-55mm| Configuration:BaseBefore the Nikon D3400 Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm Lens (Black), you chose your smartphone camera for convenience. Zooming was clumsy. Shooting in low light was nearly impossible. Capturing fast action was a game of luck. But after the D3400, you'll see that you were compromising image quality. That some of the greatest photos happen when the light is low. That fast action can be frozen in perfect clarity. And that a camera and a smartphone can work together in harmony to make the photos you share absolutely amazing. Features: Stunning simplicity - Photos and videos captured with the D3400 and a superb NIKKOR lens are as vibrant and lifelike as the moments they preserve. Shoot in extremely low light without a problem. Freeze fast-action in its tracks. Create portraits with rich, natural skin tones and beautifully blurred backgrounds. The photos you share will amaze everyone-even yourself. Camera, smartphone and cloud in perfect harmony - SnapBridge has changed the way cameras and smartphones work together-and only Nikon has it. Take a picture with the D3400 and it\u2019s automatically transferred to your compatible smartphone or tablet, ready to share. SnapBridge works seamlessly with NIKON image space, a cloud storage and sharing site, to back-up your photos and to help you create and share albums with your friends and family. The future of photo sharing is here. A camera designed for you - Compact and lightweight, the D3400 is designed to go everywhere you go. Even first-time DLSR owners will quickly feel at home-the camera's controls are smartly laid out for comfort and intuitive control. The bright optical viewfinder provides a sharp, glare-free view of the world, and the comfortable grip enables precise handling. The gateway to better photography - The D3400 makes photography easy and fun, freeing you to focus on your natural talents-framing great shots, anticipating special moments and finding unique perspectives in everyday scenes.",
