Someone wrote about how they couldn't get the wiring box back together when using a metal romex clamp - I didn't have that problem with a plastic romex clamp. As far as use - I don't hear the motor, but I think the noise I do hear is the sound of air moving. Not loud or disturbing, but it is noticeable. The manual says not to use with a solid state fan control. Just for reference I did use a Lutron occupancy sensor switch, connected with my light fixture without any problems.",

High pitches are very annoying to me, but I do not hear any such whine. My contractor installed it in the ceiling when it was too deep for the wall. The contractor had no problems installing it. I like the small front plate -- a large front plate would have been overwhelming in such a small room.",

This is a much a value buy and provide more functionality (build in sensors) comparing to Panasonic 80/110 CFM. Due to its CFM, the noise is lower than Panasonic 80/110 CFM as well. I would not hesitate to recommend to anyone!",

This fan is designed to replace the builder grade fan. so installation the fan is easier than taking down the old fan. The only complaint I have is the wire cover plate screw hole is too small and installing the screw is a pain. I spent 30 minutes just trying to screw in that tiny litter screw. Another complaint I have is the exhaust damper does not shut off the air 100%. I think the design should be improved.",

Furthermore, the fan is not loud per say but has a very noticeable high pitched whirring whine noise that I can hear around the house if left on. I'm pretty disappointed by the vent fan overall, as it does not vent my bathroom as I imagined (smaller than the recommended sq footage appropriate for) and is more audibly noticeable than it was billed to be.",

This is a great fan, I will be replacing all my bathroom fans with this model. The installation is also much easier that that of other brand fans I have installed. I will be buying more.",
