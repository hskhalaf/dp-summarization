It was a plain tub like you get at a grocery deli with a small labelmaker label. It doesn\u2019t look or smell like catnip. They have a carpeted play area and took one sniff and walked away. If they\u2019re trying to make a profit using cheap catnip (if it\u2019s even catnip) they\u2019re not going to get it past the best quality control, as in the CATS!!!",

Nobody reacted to it. Yet if I bring out that poor banana, they are crying and yowling for it. What\u2019s the difference Yeowww?",
