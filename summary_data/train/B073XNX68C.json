I think I need wider handlebars to compensate the weight (or just get used to having a basket on the bars). Overall I am glad I chose this basket. Also, because it is removable so without my dog I can go to market and take off the basket to shop.",

I put the basket on the floor with treats and he hopped in and out, then I picked the basket up, with dog in it, and walked around the house. Next step was bickering him in and walking the bike around with basket attached. Buckle strap is easy to adjust and worked great with a harness. Basket fits this dog perfectly - he can't move around very much so the bike stays stable. Now he can ride with me to the disc golf course and then I use the basket to carry my stuff around the course while he has a nice time on a leash.",

Overall very satisfied with this purchase and highly recommend it for anyone that wants to bring their small dog on their bike rides.",
