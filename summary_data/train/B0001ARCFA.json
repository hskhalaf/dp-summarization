I did try replacing the pads with Brainwavz ones, but the regular size Brainwavz pads don't fit the 240k at all well and they actually have a bit smaller inside opening than the original pads.

I have fairly long hair (Down to the small of my back) and losing some every time I put on headphones is extraordinarily irritating.

Only serious complaint is the proprietary cable being somewhat annoying to detach and reattach, but it connects solidly and has no jiggle. I recommend these over the Superlux HD668's if you're looking for a round over-ear semi-open headset, as these not only fit better but feel more solidly built while the HD668's have noticable give and groaning in its frame.

Compared to the other head sets, this did not bring discomfort after working for a while. The volume in this headset is low. We had to crank the volume up a lot to do post editing with the AKG.

I'll continue to support AKG but not at a lower price point.",

Again like most of the close or semi close back headphone, the singer or instrument sounds like they are playing at 6\u201d above your head. There is lack of space and stage. But if I am that picky I need to buy those $600 headphone right? True. So don\u2019t overly expect but you definitely get what you pay for.",

    "title": "AKG Pro Audio K240 STUDIO Over-Ear, Semi-Open, Professional Studio Headphones",
    "description": "Size:K240STUDIOAKG K240 Studio Headphones feature a classic design that has become a standard in monitoring. This newer, lower impedance, 55-ohm version provides remarkably higher volume level when used with portable studios, keyboards, drum machines and other project studio gear. It's a professional level of performance for the home studio. Features include an integrated semi-open air design with a highly accurate dynamic transducer for naturally open sound quality, and circumaural (around-the-ear) pads for hours of wearing comfort. Frequency range: 15 Hz to 25,000 Hz. Stereo (1/8-inch minijack and 1/4-inch) connections. AKG K240 Studio Features: Low, 55 Ohm impedance, plug-in cable, Self-adjusting headband for optimum fit, Single cable for ease of use, Semi-open, circumaural design. AKG'S MOST POPULAR PROFESSIONAL HEADPHONE. A classic design which has become a standard in monitoring. Now with Varimotion XXL capsule for studio sound at home and for portable use. The 'integrated semi-open air' design incorporates a highly accurate dynamic transducer, and an acoustically tuned venting structure behind the element produces a naturally open sound quality. The circumaural (around-the-ear) pads are designed for hours of wearing comfort, while the steel-cable, self-adjusting headband construction and single-sided professional quality audio interconnect ensure extended reliability in demanding professional studio applications. Proven, popular, excellent - New, improved and even better. Made in China. The item includes the OFC screw type cable.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nThe AKG K 240 Studio is an update of the \"classic\" AKG K 240 Monitor. The new K 240 Studio delivers even wider dynamic range and higher sensitivity than its well-known and widely-used predecessor. The secret to the semi-open K 240 Studio's sound quality is the new XXL transducers in acoustically tuned vented enclosures with circumaural (around the ear) pads. The circumaural pads envelope your ears nicely and reward you with smooth, solid bass and well-balanced, articulate mids and highs.\n\nFounded in Vienna, Austria in 1947, AKG has built a legendary reputation in the professional audio industry for products that perform flawlessly. The reputation of AKG and its celebrated quality are built on more than 55 years of experience, incredible design, meticulous craftsmanship and a clear understanding of what truly sounds right. AKG introduced the K 140 in 1974 and the K 240 Monitor in 1975, which became the most widely used headphones in recording studios and broadcast facilities worldwide. Generations of musicians and audio engineers use these AKG products to create great mixes, hit songs and albums cherished by millions around the world. The new AKG Professional Studio headphones carry on the tradition of these audio tools and are a sound investment that will pay handsome returns with years of flawless sonic performance for professional recording engineers and demanding users of high quality home or portable audio equipment.\n\nDelivers solid bass and well-balanced mids and highs XXL TRANSDUCERS WITH VARIMOTION DIAPHRAGM\nThe new XXL transducers use AKG's patented Varimotion diaphragm to ensure extremely accurate response at any listening level. This technology creates a diaphragm that is thinner, more elastic toward the outside edges for more powerful bass response and thicker, less resonant in the center for pure, accurate mids and clear, detailed highs. The large size of the transducers makes the overall sound more life-like and three-dimensional to capture the emotional and sonic content of your soundtracks.\n\nGIMBAL-TYPE SUSPENSION\nTo ensure your listening comfort, AKG Professional Studio headphones utilize a self-adjusting headband with a flexible steel structure to deliver optimum fit for your headphones without any fiddling. The structure is flexible, yet strong enough to allow bending for single ear use and is durable enough to withstand rough handling. A gimbal-type suspension ensures the earcups of all AKG Professional Studio models will conform to the shape and size of your ears without pressing on them for hours of fatigue-free, comfortable listening.\n\nWEAR THEM AS YOU LIKE\nRugged construction, a non-twisting headband, and powerful sound allow you to use your headphones on a single ear only or wear them in any other way you may prefer. AKG Professional Studio headphones are ideal for DJ and live sound use because they are durable enough to withstand the roughest kind of handling during transport or on stage.\n\nDETACHABLE CABLE WITH MINI XLR CONNECTOR\nThe new AKG Professional Studio headphones utilize a detachable input cable for easy replacement if ever necessary. The cable and headphones use mini XLR connectors for perfect contact and secure mechanical connection. The cable is made of 99.99% oxygen-free copper and has gold plated plugs on both ends including the screw-on 1/8\" to 1/4\" stereo jack adapter for maximum signal transfer.\n\nPERFECT FOR PORTABLE AUDIO\nYou need good quality audio for all your listening--including computer, minidisc, portable CD or DAT player--as well as in the studio. Owing to their high sensitivity and wide dynamic range, the AKG Professional Series headphones are efficient enough to be used with these lower level output sources and still deliver the high definition sound you need when working in the studio or on stage. The excellent workmanship AKG headphones are known for and high quality components ensure loss-free transmission and reproduction of high-resolution signals from all types of digital audio sources.",
