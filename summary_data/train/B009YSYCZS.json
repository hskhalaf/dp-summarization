Perfect for travel, or in my case, daily pumps at work. Tip for use - once you let down just hold down the lever and ride out the flow. You do not have to constantly be squeezing the lever to pump milk (until towards the end of your session.)",

Unfortunately the second pump had the exact same issues- loud squeaking and bottle loosens on its own. I now have two of these pumps and won\u2019t be able to take either to work because they\u2019re too disruptive and the milk will spill as the bottle falls off.",

It is way more comfortable and - frankly - easy to use than my medala double-electric. Even though it's manual, I find it gets more milk, more comfortably than my medals. Super compact, fits in a purse to carry discreetly, and really well-made and easy to use quickly. Totally worth the very small investment to have a comfortable backup that makes pumping on the go easy and pretty darn effortless.

I have a low production and perhaps another issue because I cannot get very much from an electric pump (1-2oz on one side and 2-3oz on the other side). With my older Avent manual pump I could definitely get more milk. The older version had better suction. Though both the old one and the new one are a tad on the noisy side.",

The only drawback is that the mechanism can start to squeak after a few minutes of use due to condensation. Coating the pump membrane with lanolin keeps the squeaking at bay. With that fix, this is perfect for pumping at work because it's quiet, quick and much easier to haul around than a large electric pump.",

I bought this before knowing which bottle my daughter would accept (I was hoping for this line but she didn't like the nipples and it let's in a lot of air). Ultimately, my daughter preferred the mam bottles. So now I am stuck with this pump and have to transfer all milk to different bottles. Super annoying.",

    "title": "Philips Avent Manual Comfort Breast Pump",
    "description": "Philips AVENT SCF330/20 Comfort Manual Breast Pump is uniquely designed for a more relaxing and comfortable expressing position to promote milk flow. Unlike breast pumps that only operate properly when you lean forward, the Philips AVENT Comfort Manual Breast Pump allows you to sit comfortably upright as you pump, while the pump's angled neck lets milk flow naturally from breast to bottle. When you are able to relax, you can produce more milk. This manual pump is great for moms who want to pump either at home or on the go. It features a soft massage cushion with 5 textured petals intended to help gently stimulate milk flow by mimicking your baby's natural suckling patterns. An ergonomic handle and lightweight, compact design makes it easy to operate with one hand. The collection container that connects to the pump also works as a bottle with the included natural, breast-shaped nipple. The nipple makes transitioning between breast and bottle easier for your baby by encouraging comfortable latch on. The breast pump also features an uncomplicated design with only a few parts that can all be washed in the dishwasher. It can also be sterilized using a Philips AVENT steam sterilizer or by boiling in water for 5 minutes.\n\nBRAND STORY\nBy Avent\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nThe Philips AVENT Comfort Manual Breast Pump has a unique design that enables a more relaxing and comfortable expressing position for easier milk flow.
