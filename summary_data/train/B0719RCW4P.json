My first set of earphones above the \u00a350 mark, and only time will truly tell, but after a week with them I think they are a good investment. My only criticism is that the ANC box is very close to the jack plug and can end up pull on the jack. Whether this causes an issue over time, I'll have to wait and see. I am trying to take care and position my mobile so that the pulling is negated or minimized.",

Sound quality and noise reduction of engine noise and other ambient sounds is very good for in ear headphones, but can still be heard unless listening to music while noise cancellation is on.

      "text": "I loved the headphones, noise cancelling was actually pretty good as well. But after about 2-3 months of use they started acting up. If I was on a phone call people couldn't hear me from the mic, couldn't control the music from the headphones any more, and sometimes wouldn't play songs the right way.",

      "text": "I used these for travel for under a year and loved them. The Aux was plugged into the seat aux jack on a plane, and when I removed the cable from the jack the entire metal aux piece separated and got stuck inside the aux outlet, a clean break from the rest of the device. I contacted the company twice about this with photos and they would not cover it. Very poor customer service, I will no longer be a customer of B&O.",

      "text": "This review is for B&O PLAY by Bang & Olufsen Beoplay E4 Advanced Active Noise Cancelling Earphones. These are not by my standards inexpensive at 250.00 certainly the same price range of Bose products of a similar nature. The sound crisp and enjoyable but the noise canceling more of a noise blurring than cancelling. In spite of great sound I am not completely pleased with the less than optimal performance of the noise cancelation technology unless it is just my ears.",

It is true that I do not like ear bud styles, but I can tolerate some. A few can be very well made and win me over. These were not comfortable, I did not like the sound and the box like contraption is unsightly.",

      "text": "I was recently traveling in Denmark and purchased the E4 noise cancelling earphones on June 16, 2017 in the Bang & Olufsen store in Copenhagen. They work well, but are not as comfortable as the Bose. I did not notice any hiss. The big surprise, was that I was charged (in Danish Crowns) $340 USD. The store people told me that pricing for B&O was standard (like you would expect in an Apple store). The B&G official website shows the price as $249. The B&G response to my inquiry was that their individual stores set prices as they wish. So BUYER BEWARE!",
