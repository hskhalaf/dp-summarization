I had to stake and peen the rivet to tighten up the guard and, I deducted two stars because I had to. You shouldn't have to fix a brand new product for it to work properly.",

It's pretty loose, but I never rely on it anyway. Other than that, my dogs are not nearly as afraid of these clippers as the other ones.
