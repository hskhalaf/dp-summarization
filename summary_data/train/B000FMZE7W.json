My advice, don't buy this used. Go with a newer nicer Zune for a little more money and enjoy the fact that Microsoft has made a legit alternative to the ipod.",

The translucent cover that it comes with probably helps to protect it this way, but it makes the item a bit thick (two cm or so). You won't need to get a case for this. The Zune software for syncing media is a bit more circuitous and less intuitive than iTunes, but I prefer how it begins with nothing in sync.",

Many times the people in the discussion board note that the Zune hotline could not fix their problem either. I never had any problems with my ipod.

      "text": "I had some lucky timing and got the Zune 30gb for $99. While it is a little clunkier and not quite as sexy as the 2nd gen Zune it is still a great media player. I'm still waiting on some accessories and I have to say that I am a little disappointed by the dearth of accessories available. The Zune branded items seem a little steep in price and third party manufacturers must not have been all that interested in stepping between MS and Apple on this turf. I'm enjoying it, especially for the price.",

The purchase was for my nephew who lives in another state. The Zune battery life is only 2 hours. It should have a battery life of 12-14 hours. After inquiring, I was told by Justine's to buy another battery. Wow! I could not believe what I was told by that company. The Zune is less than 35 days old. I would never recommend buying anything from Justin's Electronics. I'm thinking that I paid $200 for a refurbished product. You live and you learn. I will never buy another electronic off the internet. Thanks for nothing and taking my money!",

The only thing that sometimes gives me trouble is the bulk of the player, but having once had a 30 GB Mp3 Player, i expected this one to be bulky. I love Zune, and i love this player!",

Synced right up to the music on my computer and ripped a cd with no flub. Not a very detailed review but I'm happy with this product.",

At the current price, it's a steal and you get an excellent product. Videos look amazing, sound is perfect.
