I bought this scan tool, downloaded a free app (there are many), and saw that the only significant transmission code was a faulty turbine speed sensor. I replaced the sensor myself for $25 and the transmission behaves like new. I've had other bluetooth OBDII scan tools, and this is the only one that actually works. And the company stands behind it completely. I am impressed not only with the device, but also with the company, whose owner contacted me directly just to see if I was satisfied. I am.",

Specifically, I now have cylinder head temperature, coolant temperature, transmission temperature (at two different locations), and torque converter slip. These are the critical gauges for towing a load close to the manufacturer's max tow limit. So far, can't get engine oil temperature -- will keep trying. It does not run the battery down in any noticeable way when the truck is left sitting for a week with the Scan Tool installed. The scan tool seems to go to sleep after a while and only reawakens when the truck is started. Works well with the Android program \"Torque\"",

It is a little big in size but that's a small inconvenience. I have it hooked up to my Ford Expedition SSV (Special Service Vehicle - former police car) The reason for 3 stars, is that Torque keeps losing connection to the unit. Every minute or so the feed will interrupt, and Torque goes on search mode. Torque finds the OBDII reader, connects then after another minute connection drops and the search starts again. I know it's not the head unit because it can maintain a solid bluetooth connection to my phone for calls or audio streaming.",

I use it in conjunction with torque pro and have had zero issues reading codes on 20+ cars of all makes models and years. I highly recommend this scanner. If you use it only once it's still cheaper than having a mechanic run codes for you.",
