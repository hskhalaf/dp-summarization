Whole contraption seems nicely designed, but it doesn't contain \"wings\" long enough to fit my VESA holes. Description clearly states it fits Samsung, clearly states that it fits up to 55\", and clearly states VESA 15 max. Unfortunately, I can figure out Samsung, figure out 55\", but VESA is a measurement that, even though I've got the television disassembled and ready to hang, I still don't know how to measure. Seems like company might offer longer wings, except that included information has no contact information for the manufacturer. Too wise, too late.",

If you are a guy and trying to do it by yourself, it isn't going to happen. If you are a lady trying to do it by yourself, probably best to spend the 100 bucks to get it professionally installed. Better yet, don't buy this one. Get one that is easy for one person to put in unassisted. I asked permission to send back the one I bought.",

I'll be going to Home Depot to buy nuts and washers to replace this poor design. All in all, an average product in my eyes.",

My Vizio D32hn-D0 needed 4mm screws and the smallest of the 5 sizes that came with the bracket were too big (probably 5mm) so I took the entire TV down to the hardware store to try various screws to get the job done. I could have looked in the full user manual (not just the quick start) which tells me it needs M4 screws. So if your TV needs M4s, you'll need to get those separately. (To be fair to VonHaus, they're dinky little screws, I think Vizio should have gone larger.)",

It was easy to mount on the wall, but the arm that extends out bends slightly from the weight of the tv which is no big deal unless you stare at it instead of watching tv. I can't help but be nervous about the thumb screw thread slipping off because we didn't have to turn it much but it's holding. I do love how you can adjust it in any which way.",

I've seen other brackets where the two holes on top don't both fit on one stud, and one goes through sheetrock using an anchor. I much prefer all mounting screws going through the stud for more strength. The arms are long and flexible enough to let me mount the the 42' TV in a corner of the room nicely. Definitely recommend this mount, especially for mounting a tv in a corner.",

      "text": "Perfect for a single stud which is what I had above the fireplace. I've got a 25 lb 55\" vizio mounted on it. Couple of tips. When you're screwing in the bolts after you drilled the pilot holes, make sure to have a phillips head that's a little larger so you don't strip the threads. I had an off center stud, so as other people have mentioned, do some measuring because it's a couple of inches off center from where you mount the plate on the TV to where it will be on your wall. Install wasn't bad even for someone with minimal handyness like myself.",

The heaviest is like 55lbs. Mounting was pretty simple. Directions straight forward. The one draw back is the tilt. As per other reviews you can go pick up a nut for the tilt bolt, that is not supplied, and get the tv set up the way you want it. Otherwise it will have a significant tilt to it. I purchased 2 wall mounts of them and I am very satisfied.",

It didn't take too long to hang up and my 36\" tv stayed up there! I read some reviews saying that it tilted forward, but really, that's just a matter of tightening it to your liking. I can rotate my tv any way I want and like the idea of tucking my tv away if I wanted to. Great product and VERY cheap! Get it! Love it!",
