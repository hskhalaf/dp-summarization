This is a great set because it comes with three different round sizes and an added bonus is that it comes with a cute, small heart-shape cake pan. I may just use this to make my husband a mini cake for our upcoming anniversary! This set is made of non-toxic coating material which is BPA free, which is important to me knowing my health and well-being is safeguarded. The latches unlock easily and the pans are very easy to clean. I highly recommend this set for all bakers!",

When cleaning, it was as easy as whipping it down because nothing stuck to it. I am so excited to use the little heart pan!!!",

I was really worried that it will be a challenge to remove the cake out of the pan, but I was so surprised when it basically slid out. It didn\u2019t leak at all. I tried just one pan. If I change my opinion I\u2019ll update my review! So far I enjoy it!",
