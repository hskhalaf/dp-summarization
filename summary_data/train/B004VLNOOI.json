We have 3 dogs ranging from 5lbs to 15lbs. Our middle sized dog is a 14 year old Italian greyhound rescue with rotten and missing teeth. We\u2019ve always had to add water to her food so she could eat more comfortably, but she devours these little ones before we even get the chance to add water! It\u2019s great to see our old gal eating well. Our other two dogs also seem to love these just a little more than the other varieties, the smaller bites are definitely easier for their little mouths to chew. No complaints!",

However, when high activity or other factors create a higher feed intake, twice-a-day feeding is recommended. Dogs should be maintained in ideal body condition and not be allowed to become overweight. The food intake required to maintain ideal body condition will vary, depending on age, activity and environment. Consequently, the amount of food required for each dog will vary and should be adjusted accordingly. The daily feeding amount can be divided into 2-3 smaller servings throughout the day. Feeding Tip: When switching your dog to Beneful IncrediBites dog food, please allow 7-10 days for the transition. Gradually add more Beneful IncrediBites and less of the previous food to your dog's dish each day until the changeover is complete. This gradual transition will help avoid dietary upsets. For your pet's health, see your veterinarian regularly. Provide adequate fresh water in a clean container daily. \n\nGuaranteed Analysis:\nCrude Protein (Min)...27.0%, Crude Fat (Min)...13.5%, Crude Fiber (Max)...4.0%, Moisture (Max)...14.0%, Calcium (Ca) (Min)...1.1%, Selenium (Se) (Min)...0.35mg/kg, Vitamin A (Min)...12,500 IU/kg, Vitamin E (Min)...150 IU/kg.",
