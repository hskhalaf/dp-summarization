I\u2019m definitely excited to add this product into my every day routine at this point. No wonder it came so highly recommended!",

It still allowed me to collect extra milk while baby was nursing in the comfort of my own bed! It's amazing how much milk it actually collects with natural suction. This is not a hand pump but just uses suction in conjunction with your natural let down of milk to collect extra. I started using it during the day as well i liked it so much. You'll be pleasantly surprised how much you get. Highly recommend!!!",

I paid almost $14 for the basic without the stopper or pouch. The next few days it was down in price again WITH the stopper.. so that was annoying. Now for me to buy the stopper(for traveling) it\u2019s almost $7..",

I thought it was the suction at first so I contacted customer service who sent me a clip showing me a method to increase suction, which was helpful, but did not resolve the pump falling off. If I hold it in place, it catches all the milk, but it's inconvenient to have to do that. Without holding it in place, any slight movement tends to cause pump to fall off or if I stay still, the product holds about an ounce successfully then falls off my breast.",

There was no keeping it sanitized while out of the house. I use it mostly for night now when baby falls asleep after one breast and I'm too tired to get up to pump. It releaves enough pressure to fall back asleep and I don't have to worry about my production decreasing.",

Only complaint so far is, although I washed and sterilized this in hot water before use, it still has a slight plastic/chemical smell to it, even after a few weeks of use. For this reason, I do not store milk in the pump, rather in a glass jar in the fridge. I question whether this is 100% silicone because everything else in my kitchen that is silicone has absolutely no smell. I am guessing they must add something to it to give it the bendable quality it has? One star off for durability since it is recommended to replace every few months.",

I used this early on to help increase supply by pumping the whole time baby was nursing and then around 8 weeks, simply to catch let down milk when baby was on the other side.

I returned back to work this week and have been pumping while away from little one. I use the manual pump when I nurse and have been able to get over 10 oz a day just from catching letdown while nursing. It makes it so much easier then having to nurse and then pump and then clean all of the parts. I also keep it on my bedside table at night so that I can collect and not have to get up. I highly reccomend this manual pump!",

I don't respond well to traditional electric pumps and only get about one ounce in a full pumping session anyway. This allows me to catch that much in half the time or less.

The photo I added was from one side only and I had to empty my naturebond out twice.
