The handles are large enough to feel comfortable and substantial, and the little thumb resting spot is a detail that adds a bit of extra panache. The overall quality of these is just so fantastic....the weight and balance is perfect. I'm really pleased with my purchase.",

I'll be getting these as gifts for my friends for the holidays and as house warming gifts. HIGHLY recommend these!",
