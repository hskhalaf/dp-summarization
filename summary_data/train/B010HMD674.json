It is so creamy and never starts to feel sticky or gunky on the lips, which a lot of glosses do. I like the color, but kind of wish I had chosen a different shade. Sugar Sugar looks amazing on top of lip sticks/liquid lips, but I don't love how it looks on it's own. But I guess that depends on your preference. Either way, it's a nice splurge!",

Why did I spend a fortune for lip gloss in a boring shade that doesn't even feel great on? There is nothing that sets this particular product apart from the rest of the designer lip glosses in the market, and this particular one is in a creepy shade that makes you look like you just didn't wipe the food off your lips. There are a couple of pros, however, it will last forever because you will almost never wear it... And you can say you own something by Marc Jacobs. ;)",
