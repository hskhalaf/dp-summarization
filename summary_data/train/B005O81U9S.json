Later I decided to go on for Harmony 200 as I was planning to use it only for TV+Set-Top box. Well, this is so drastically worse then Harmony 300 that I'd advise to keep away from this fiasco... WHY? The most \"tortured\" navigation key landscape (in contrast with H 300) is made of same (monolith) latex material and pressing any of five keys on its surface is same as playing in Vegas casino... good luck...",

But when I changed a lot of my gear last year and needed to reprogram it, the weakness of having to log in to the company website to do this reared its ugly head - there was no trace of my account, so I just lost motivation to deal with it. Maybe someday I'll log in again as a new user and reprogram everything I did that hasn't changed again in order to use it.",

Its a great product and does have learning ability but some things are to complicated for it to learn. I still would recommend it to anyone or its higher counterparts.",

Works perfect on our Sony, Samsung, older AT&T U-Verse DVR, and Toshiba devices.",

      "text": "I'm on my forth one of these...which should say a couple things. 1. The remote does not survive being thrown with all my might into larger, inanimate objects. 2. I obviously like the remote, otherwise I wouldn't have bought it 4 times. 3. If presented with the option to purchase in \"Original Packaging\", TAKE IT. I bought 1of4 w/o the original box, and it was definitely a lemon. I should have warrantied it, but I thought that smashing it into the floor would be more satisfying. Hope this helps.",
