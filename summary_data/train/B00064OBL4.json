      "text": "This is a perfect second camera for someone who takes lots of pictures and already has some prosumer model. It also would make an excellent camera for the casual photographer. The camera is tiny, really really small but takes great pictures. Despite size of camera, alll controls are easy to use. Complex menus are Canon-easy-to-use but you could also just point and shoot and never worry about the menus. Only fear about this camera is losing it. Thought of getting the SD300 but who needs the zoom really for the use this camera will be seeing? And lack of zoom apparently makes picture quality better as camera is optimized for the fixed focal length lens.",

      "text": "This camera was purchased for my wife who doesn't have patience for too many controls or settings. She loves this camera and uses it readily. She has allowed me to try it out some and I like it too; although I don't think it gets quite as good results as the 5 MP Konica that I regularly use. The Konica seems a little better on indoor/flash shots and the autofocus rarely misses. I think that with a little experience with the useful range of the flash, the Canon should meet our needs nicely, however. It fits so nicely in a shirt pocket that there is little excuse to leave it home.",

      "text": "This camera is old (released in 2004) but 7 years later (2011) there is still no camera on the market that delivers such sharp pictures, in such a small package. It has a 39mm (equivalent) prime lens, which is the key to its high quality images. Like SLR lenses, no zoom = much better image quality. The battery is small, so after a few years, you'll need to get it replaced. Camera batteries lose their ability to charge, as they get older. The impact is more noticeable on small batteries. I've had this camera since it was released and it's never failed me. In fact, I own three.",

If I could go backward, I would buy the same Canon SD20 that has accompanied me in my pocket for years. I am never without my camera as long as I have a pocket.

I would recommend getting a larger memory card, since it's amazing how quick the one it comes with fills up. One drawback, there is only digital zoom. This makes it a little hard to take pictures that are not blurry (when you zoom that is), but then again, you could just use a tripod.",

It's cute, stylish, compact and takes great pictures, but my main complaint is that digital zoom merely crops the picture rather than actually zooming, so the zooming makes you lose quality and all my pictures that were zoomed are very grainy. I have to use a huge setting and just manually crop my pictures myself on adobe if I want to \"zoom\". Aside from that, there are no complaints, although I think I'd opt for a Sony the next time around because of their \"burst\" feature (I think it's fun, but unnecessary).",
