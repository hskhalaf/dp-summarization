Durable yet feminine attractive design, these boots are a gem for hard working women.",

The boot is tight to the heel, so unlike others, I have not gotten a blister. I've gotten a lot of compliments about how \"slick\" the boot looks and love the fact there you can buy a boot in a color other than black or brown. The only compliant is the steel toe box that digs in the top of my foot when driving or sitting. I think that's pretty typical of most steel to boots, so it helps to wear thicker wool socks (even in the summer).",

My only complaint so far is that the pair I got (Frost Gray) is more gray than frost, and so ends up looking kind of dull under interior lighting. However, that's a purely aesthetic complaint; so far the boots have held up great in a functional capacity. If I experience any comfort problems or quality complaints, I will return and update.",

      "text": "Amazing boots. Took a while to get them but well worth it. I work in a warehouse after having multiple leafsprings land on my toes I had to invest in steal toe. There about a half size bigger then expected which are how steal toe boots should fit. Just enough room for whool socks! Light arch support,ones with high arches would recommend adding a better insole. But by far the best thing of all... they are PURPLE!!! \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c",
