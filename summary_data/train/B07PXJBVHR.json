I would call them compression shorts as if anyone has ever worn a good set knows that there is zero compression in these. But for the price, they do the job nicely for easy running and weightlifting. What I dont ger is why they changed the material up. It is noticeably thinner and just doesn't feel the same. The seams come apart after one wash and no longer can dry them with out it shrinking. Last set never had this problem and could dry them without any issues.",

Maybe they assume you'll wear a cup but my running is not full contact so I've never considered doing that.

Whenever we would do something active, my bulge was on and poppin. Unintentionally, I was making friends and family uncomfortable. Then I ordered the Neleus 3 pack. I went from an accidental sock puppet jumping around in my shorts at every stride, to a calm, cool and collected athlete. I can\u2019t thank the product enough.",
