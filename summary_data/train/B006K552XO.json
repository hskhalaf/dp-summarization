      "text": "When I first tried this camera I was very impressed...lightweight, super features and output was like you would expect from something much larger. It was perfect as a small travel companion that would be relied upon for high quality stills or video...even the sound was very good. Bottom line: Two months ago the display died and it is now out of warranty and useless. I have been a Sony fan for over 25 years however my last two purchases have been great products with quality problems. Sadly this may have been my last Sony purchase.",

This camera is the same model, just the newer version and I love it. The photos look great, have a nice quality and I love the full size touch screen.",

I really enjoy using the touchscreen feature which is an interesting aspect of it. I know when most people go out looking for electronic products, one of the first questions that come to mind is how is the battery life span. Well it lasts several hours however not for a whole day even if you charged it the whole night. So for example if I charge it for the whole night and I walk around the city for a few hours snapping only a few photos the battery will start dying quickly.",

Only had for few months. Its hard to press the camera shoot button. Everyone presses the zoom or ON/OFF button instead. So not easy to hold and press. ALSO, the view screen went black! I had to send for repair. Very disappointed. But I knew it was discontinued. Not worth the $200 I paid. Would rather get another Cybershot with Wifi!",

Its 18.2MP sensor and 5X optical/10X Clear Image zoom lens capture sharp pictures and Full HD 1080/60i videos. High Speed AF improves focusing speed and accuracy, while Picture Effects and 3D Sweep Panorama modes expand creativity. \n\n\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n18.2 MEGAPIXEL BACK-ILLUMINATED EXMOR R CMOS IMAGE SENSOR\nThe 18.2MP Exmor R CMOS sensor captures ultra-high definition images that take full advantage of the camera\u2019s sharp Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar lens. The sensor enables advanced processing that reduces noise levels up to 6 times more than other sensors, resulting in stunning low light images with incredible details.\n\n\nSLIM AND STYLISH DESIGN\n\nAt just over 1.5-inches thin and only 3.3 oz, the DSC-TX66 is the perfect size to take with you almost anywhere. Slip it into a pocket, purse, or backpack and be ready to shoot memorable moments. The 3.3-inch (1,229K dots) OLED Xtra Fine touch screen with wide viewing angle delivers brilliant-quality still images and movies while enabling easy focusing operation.\n\nHIGH SPEED AF\nTo improve focusing speed and sensitivity, the Exmor R CMOS sensor uses its rapid throughput to deliver high-quality image signals to the camera\u2019s BIONZ processor, which provides intelligent response data to a new high speed actuator motor in the lens. The result is fast, DSLR-like focusing speeds even in low light.\n\n\nFULL HD 1080/60I\n\nRecord crystal clear movies at the highest resolution available with capabilities for 60i in 1080 AVCHD video.1 This provides stunning, fast motion video with less distortion for playback on your HD TV.2 With dual record of stills and movies, you can shoot both at the same time.\n\nCAPTURE THE DECISIVE MOMENT WITH UP TO 10FPS\n\nCapture full 18.2 megapixel resolution images at up to 10 frames per second, helping to ensure that the decisive moment is captured such as the soccer ball flying into the goal. In addition, a mechanical shutter helps reduce distortion when continuously shooting moving subjects. \nOPTICAL STEADYSHOT WITH ACTIVE MODE\n\nOptical SteadyShot with Active Mode for blur-free movies even while walking.4 Camera-shake compensation using Optical SteadyShot/Active Mode has been improved with the addition of new electronic image stabilization. Now it\u2019s easier than ever to obtain sharp, blur-free movies even when zooming in unsteady situations, such as shooting with one hand while walking. \n\n3D STILL IMAGE AND 3D SWEEP PANORAMA MODE3\n\nProduce awe-inspiring images with 3D still image and 3D Sweep Panorama capabilities.3 Photos will take on a new dimension of creative capabilities for viewing the world in a whole new way.\n\nOPTICAL ZOOM PLUS CLEAR IMAGE ZOOM\nMost digital zooms use electronic cropping to get closer to the subject, resulting in unsharp images. With Clear Image Zoom the powerful processor compares patterns found in adjacent pixels and creates new pixels to match selected patterns, resulting in more realistic, higher-quality images. Clear Image Zoom doubles optical zoom for closer photos. \nBACKGROUND DEFOCUS\n\nDSLR photographs are often beautiful because they blur the background, putting the emphasis on the subject. Now the DSC-TX66 can deliver this signature DSLR benefit. The system takes two shots, identifies the background and applies a defocused background keeping the subject crisp and clear.\n\nPICTURE EFFECT FOR MORE EXPRESSIVE PHOTOS \n\nPicture Effect adds a new level of expression to photos, making ordinary landscapes and portraits come to life by heightening mood and emphasizing certain attributes. Select camera models have up to nine different effects. \n\nPHOTO CREATIVITY\nPhoto Creativity allows you to fine-tune your exposure settings, such as brightness, color, and vividness, and quickly choose the right enhancement for your subject. Now you can view Picture Effects and Photo Creativity effects in real time on the camera\u2019s monitor or in the viewfinder before shooting. \nSUPERIOR AUTO MODE\n\nGet cleaner, more dynamic pictures and fewer missed shots. The DSC-TX66 automatically recognizes the correct scene mode, then quickly shoots and combines up to six shots to produce images with greater clarity, optimum dynamic range using Backlight Correction HDR technology and lower image noise using 6 shots layering technology. Superior Auto intelligently detects 36 scenes for still images and movies, making it easy to get the best shot. \n\nFACE DETECTION TECHNOLOGY \n\nFace Detection technology detects up to eight individual faces and adjusts focus, exposure, and white balance to help deliver crisp, properly lit images of family and friends.\n\n\nSMILE SHUTTER TECHNOLOGY \n\n\nSmile Shutter technology captures a smile the moment it happens. Simply press the Smile Shutter button and the camera does the rest. You can also select adult and child priority andindicate the degree of Smile Detection sensitivity. Intelligent Scene Recognition can now be used together with Smile Shutter mode when the Intelligent Auto mode is on. This means that beautiful smiles can be captured with settings optimized for the particular scene, even in difficult conditions such as twilight and backlighting. \n\n\n\nANTI-BLINK FUNCTION \n\nIt\u2019s frustrating to capture the perfect shot, only to review it later and discover subjects blinked during the photo. The Anti-blink function works to help counter blinking and squinting. When the camera is set to Soft Snap, the Anti-blink function captures two images, recording only the photo with less squinting. If a blink is detected in other shooting modes, a warning will be displayed after you take the shot.\n\nSOFT SKIN MODE\n\nPortrait subjects will love the results. Soft Skin mode recognizes skin tones and reduces the appearance of blemishes and wrinkles without affecting the rest of the shot.\n\nINTELLIGENT SCENE RECOGNITION (ISCN) MODE\n\nIntelligent Scene Recognition (iSCN) Mode automatically detects 36 different types of scenes and selects the appropriate camera settings. In Auto Mode, the camera takes a single shot using the optimal settings. In Advanced Mode, the camera takes a photo with the optimal settings and, if in difficult lighting (low light or back light) immediately takes a second photo with another optimized setting so you can choose which to keep.\n\nNATURAL FLASH\n\nConventional point-and-shoot camera flash shots just don't capture colors the way the eye sees them. Natural Flash mode takes a reference shot without flash and then uses that reference to correct the color, for far more lifelike images.\n\nMOTION DETECTION\n\nMotion Detection, along with Face Motion Detection adjusts ISO sensitivity and increases the shutter speed when movement is detected, reducing blur in moving subjects and faces.\n\n\n * \n * \n\n1.
