      "verdict": "The Saucony Breakthru 2 is a versatile shoe that was built using high quality technologies. Its construction allows for an easy transition from softer running shoes to much firmer ones with its firm yet responsive midsole. Most of the materials and construction are pretty similar to its previous version, with a slight change in the upper. It is an affordable\u00a0shoe for running but it a worthwhile choice.",
      "pros": [
        "Its responsive low-type of cushioning is admired greatly by many neutral runners who already tested it",
        "Its outsole is still amazing for many runners who love the softer IBR and XT-900 carbon rubber",
        "It is light enough for tempo runs",
        "Many runners find it stiffer, offering a firmer and more responsive ride",
        "Stability is enhanced with the POWERGRID to distribute and reduce impact",
        "There is no bulky overlay observed with the Breakthru 2\u2019s new FlexFilm over the toe box",
        "Stylish use of the reflective material is an attractive design for many testers",
        "The price is affordable"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "Some testers find messy stitching on top of the sole when the insole is pulled up",
        "Durability is not reliable as the FlexFilm wears out easily, making it ideal only for training and other routines"

I had to dispose of them after the race because the sweat and mud that pooled in them during the rainy run caused an unholy stench. Were it not for that, I\u2019d still be running in them. The fit is significantly different from the Kinvara, which is my preferred shoe. These provided an easier heel-to-toe offset that my injured chilies needed. The toe box is large and I could never get them on just right to completely forget about them, but they kept me injury free for as long as I had them.",

This is a light shoe with a very roomy toe box, the heel cup design is very different than the kninvarna, and this is where I had problems. No issue what so ever with heel slip. Compared to the kinvarna, they initially felt a little chunky, but I've quickly adjusted. Hopefully, Saucony will not progress this into a completely different shoe as they make changes. This seems to be the trend.",

    "description": "Saucony Breakthru 2 Beat your PR every time you run in the Breakthru 2 Upper - Breathable Structure The Breakthru 2 from Saucony is formed from a soft, breathable Mesh construction that allows air to permeate the interior layers to keep the foot cool and comfortable as you power through each stride. This is unified with an internal RUNDRY Collar Lining which secures the heel while wicking moisture away from the surface of the skin allowing the foot to stay dry and the wearer more focused. Merged over to secure the mesh in place, flexfilm overlays supports the mesh structure from torsion and any sharp vigorous movements. It wraps and cradles, hugging the foot in all the right places without ever getting in the way for superior support and comfort. At the forefoot an Open Toe Box design is seamless and offers superior comfort, further augmenting a sock-like feel. Midsole - Responsive Compound The Midlayer foam compound of the Breakthru 2 utilises heel-to-toe POWERGRID cushioning. This proprietary midsole component combines shock dissipating GRID technology with Powerfoam material to create a cushioned and a responsive ride. POWERGRID is a lightweight, ultra-premium cushioning foam that, ounce for ounce, delivers a smoother and more rebound-filled ride than the competition. This midsole engineering works parrallel with the full length SSL EVA, which is Saucony's premium midsole material for lightweight comfort, rebound and durability with superior impact protection. The Breakthru 2 is set with Saucony 8mm offset Technology, this is where Cushioning is distributed more evenly between the heel and forefoot in shoes with an 8mm offset. The result? Your body stays in a more balanced and comfortable position with every foot strike. Outsole - Ground Gripping Carbon The outsole platform for the Saucony Breakthru 2 is constructed with a blown XT-900 compound throughout. This is a carbon rubber material that offers durable traction and control, helping the wearer d",
