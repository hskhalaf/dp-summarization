      "text": "This item just arrived today and my 10 year old son really liked it but it was a little too small, which leads me to review here that it runs small. He is a tall 10-year-old, average build. He can wear a large (10-12) in most brands (Gymboree, Gap, Target clothes, Under Armour, Nike) but this jacket in a large (10-12) was way too small. It was tight to zip, and the sleeves hit an few inches above his wrists. Just placed an order for an XL though, as he really liked it otherwise! Beautiful color, cozy but lightweight fabric. Will have to update once that arrives.",

I will definitely consider buying again next year.",
