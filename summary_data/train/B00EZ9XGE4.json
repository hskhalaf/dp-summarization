I have no idea why it works flawlessly when plugged in, but won't operate on battery, won't even pair. ???? Love the design.",

I'm not a fast typist but the keyboard feels as good as my hi-end Lenovo laptop. I think the iPad/Logitech combination will be fine for travel. I really like the fact that you can easily separate the iPod from the keyboard cover if you are just reading and don't need to type anything. The Bluetooth setup was almost too easy. Go to Bluetooth settings press the Bluetooth button on the keyboard and select the Logitech keyboard on the iPad and it works! No ID numbers or pairing that often make Bluetooth setup painful.",

Would be nice if the charging cord was longer (it\u2019s only about a foot long). It attaches to the iPad with a really stong magnet and they fold together like a laptop. The keyboard can hold the iPad in portrait orientation but it\u2019s not as stable as the horizontal position.",

My primary drawback & something that has been mention by other reviewers is when you close it, the iPad doesn't always turn off. The magnet either isn't strong enough or just not in the right position. Other than this it works well & I really do appreciate it when I'm having to do a lot of typing.",

When closed, the iPad easily comes slightly ajar from the case which unlocks the ipad thereby draining the battery for no good reason. When in use, the iPad is not held in place solidly. Touching the top of the screen feels extremely unstable, and in some cases, even topples the whole assembly backwards slightly. I don't have a perfect suggestion for an alternative, but my best advice is to keep shopping.",

It's not the end of the world, but it is kind of annoying. Barely noticeable, but you can slightly feel it with your hand. Other than that, it works great. Connected in about 3 min.",

There is also a magnetic connection in the dock section which really makes for a comfortable fit when viewing the screen and typing. The \"return\" key is a little small, but also reasonably so considering the compact size of the keyboard. It may take a little getting used to for some. The other keys fall very much the like most other keyboards, and is very comfortable to use. Definitely recommend it. It is a great keyboard.",

Easy to connect to iPad with Bluetooth by just going to settings and selecting the keyboard. Wish the document had come with the product and not had to download it myself. The cover is as hard as the back of the iPad so I feel it will protect it well.",

It is the best if you need a thin keyboard without the protective case.",
