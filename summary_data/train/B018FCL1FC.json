This is one of the most expensive backdrop support systems that you can find in Amazon, but I wanted to be sure that I wouldn't have any kind of issues in the future, regarding the quality of the product. Despite the high price, the system is too fragile. One of the tripod stands broke before the first use. Besides the lack of quality of the product, the supplier - KimOutlet - refused to find a fair solution to solve my problem. In short, I bought a product for US$64,99+shipping cost and I can't use it.",

      "text": "This is a great stand, I use it for conventions and trade shows to display my artwork. I bought this for the 10\u2019 height, and I was pretty impressed. It\u2019s just high enough to display my 11x17 art prints without being too high to miss the top row of artwork. It\u2019s easy to setup, and I could even do it on my own if needed. The stand was a little longer than I thought when taken apart and inside the bag, which might be troublesome if I ever needed to fly with it. But for regular travel, it\u2019s perfect. I would definitely recommended this stand to anyone else.",

There is a mild sag when we use the 4 rods but don't think it's that much noticeable and the seller left a note saying it helps in stability of the structure. Overall am satisfied with this purchase and would recommend this for someone looking for a sturdy background stand.",

The Tripods have spring loaded bar that I could see being useful for a few reasons, and one of them being to fit in the bag. Did I mention the bag included was almost worth the price alone? Pockets inside for each stand and they are nice and padded. This whole thing will save me space and im confident it will last me for a long time.",

There's one thing though that was a bit annoying. Being as though it goes up 10ft high, if you choose to extended it all the way up you have to make sure you get each side the exact same height or your backdrop will be on a slant and uneven. It should have little notches or marks along the pole. But other than that I like it. Its pretty sturdy and it great product for the price.",
