It is tasteless, apart from being a bit salty, and most easily mixed with water and fruit (frozen, fresh, freeze dried) in a blender. Added to hot cereal, it becomes tiny bits of cooked egg white, which looks weird but has no flavour. I\u2019ve started mixing in a quarter cup when I bake bread or muffins, and know that I\u2019m increasing the protein content a bit, without changing the texture of the recipe. I can\u2019t eat dairy products, but I suspect that this egg white protein could be used wherever you have been using whey powder.",

The protein found in egg whites is a complete protein, meaning it contains all nine essential amino acids in the amounts our bodies need to function optimally.

The blender does a great job of mixing it in. I have also added to creamy soups. Just have to mix well or in the blender so no lumps. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a non flavored protein powder.",

I blend a tablespoon along with pb powder in oatmeal and the results is creamy and delicious. Mixed with vanilla greek yogurt it tastes almost like vanilla cake batter, yum! It also blends well in a typical protein shake because you taste more of the other ingredients rather than the protein. I'm very happy with this purchase.",
