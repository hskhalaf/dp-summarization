You can choose either to enter data directly into fields that fill out the standard schedules or use the \"guided tour\" that takes you simply and coherently through all elements of your return--income (wages and salary, dividend and interest, capital gains) and deductions (every possible deduction you might be able to claim or credit you may qualify for). Good linkage between federal and state returns, excellent preview of entered data, running totals of refund or payment due and high quality, transparent screens. Runs a diagnostic to determine whether you've entered data consistently and completely. Makes a sometimes painful process manageable and relatively straightforward.",

Unless you are running a lot of rental properties, the less expensive Deluxe version would have done everything I needed including stocks, home office, etc.",
