When I tried to decrease the intensity, it would not allow me to. I had to turn off and back on. Then tried to increase intensity, and again it went to 20 on its own after I put it at 2 or 3. I want to keep it but will be returning it.",

Especially I have a smaller hand, so I really like this one. I can't tell the battery life yet but it sure can finish relaxing your muscle and back! I personally also like the price! It is affordable, easy to handle, and quiet! Trust me, take this one!",

Using this does help with it and its similar to the one my therapist use to use on me when I was doing my therapy. I would definitely recommend this product.

The harder you press down, the more control you have over the machine but you also don't feel the different speeds available. If you press too lightly then you risk losing control of the machine and it can vibrate uncomfortably over other areas/bones. There is quite some shaking you'll experience from the machine overall while you are holding - I highly recommend using two hands.",

I used it yesterday after basketball for my back, It is really powerful and my muscle get relaxed in a very enjoyable and smooth process if you control the strength properly (like from 1-4). I will recommend to my friends if they want try a massage gun with limited budget! The battery life looks good so far! I used one hour and it took about 5%. Totally worth it!",

When heavy sustained pressure is applied to the muscle through the massage gun, the force improves tremendously. At first I thought it might not be fully charged, then thought maybe I did not have the attachment head pushed in all the way but no. It would be a great purchase if you did not have to apply so much pressure for it to kick into gear. Might be nice for trigger points but not to maintain that pressure as you slide and move across the body.",
