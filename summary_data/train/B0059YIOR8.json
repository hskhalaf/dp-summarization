I ended up a full size larger than I usually wear because the toe areas are too narrow my pinky toe would feel squished by the end of the day and some blister on the top of my toe. But now that the shoe is broken in it's ok. I'd recomend at least a 1/2 size above what you usually wear. The soles are thin but have held up well. The overall look of the shoe is great and it cleans really easily.",
