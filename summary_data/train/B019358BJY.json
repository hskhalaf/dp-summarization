      "text": "Bought this for a quilting retreat that I had to fly to. Nice small size fits in baggage easily and comes with a drawstring bag and a little water cup. When I say LITTLE, just know that the steam runs out very quickly as it holds so little water. I would maybe get three minutes out of it before having to refill. It works nicely and I prefer the pointier sole plate vs other travel irons I have used that are too round and blunt for precision work. I recommend this iron with slight reservation for the short life of the steam, but it is rather expected for a tiny iron.",
