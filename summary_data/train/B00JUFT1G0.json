I know nothing about the backstory or really much about the game. However, I put in a lot of time into the game and never found myself bored at any point.",

This is one of my digs on it however in that it gets so long that it almost seems repetitive. The characters are fun and almost lifelike and the storyline is fun to track. With the endless open world you really can get about as much as you want out of the game. It is gory and dark and a little scary at times with extreme violence hence the M rating so I do not suggest the game for kids that are less than 13 or so.",

Specialties are available at level 10, but only one and no subclasses i.e. DAO. Weapon and armor crafting is easy to understand yet challenging to master. NPC's have depth and their interactions are frequently humorous or add to the depth of the world around you. The overall storyline lacks narrative and isnt really satisfying. Certain factions are left in the cold regardless of your decisions and mutual success i.e. ME3 doesnt exist.",

Also, Dragon Keep does not seem to make that much of a difference. Import or don't import. It doesn't really matter. I am a Bioware fan too. Big disappointment for me.
