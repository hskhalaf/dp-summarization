They looked ashy, fuzzy, had little jagged strings sticking out here and there. I ended up buying some shoe laces at my local dollar store that were better quality. You would think for $50 shoes they could give you decent laces. I upgraded them myself and they look how they should have to begin with. Nice Kicks though! Minus one star for the ugly laces.",
