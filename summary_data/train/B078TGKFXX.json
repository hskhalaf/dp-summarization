The bottoms fit perfectly and the top is a little big in the cups (as I said, I\u2019m not blessed in that area). But overall it was definitely worth the money and is so cute on. This is probably the first time I feel good in a bathing suit :) The shipping was faster than expected and came 10 days before the first day of the expected delivery window. Overall I\u2019m very happy with this suit!",

Other than that, it's absolutely great. Very sexy, fit well and good quality for the price!!",
