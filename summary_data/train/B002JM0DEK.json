If we lose power (which we do periodically), the unit keeps the time current and displayed, even when local power is out and we have no internet connection.

I also hoped that the new unit's outdoor sensor would transmit on the same freq as the old one, allowing me to have two indoor displays of the environment outside, but, alas, it does not. They must have changed freq's. It took almost a day for the clock to synch with the National Standard Time Signal broadcast by WWV, but other than that, and the freq change, the new unit is great. LCD display is easy to read from a distance. No regrets after two weeks.",
