Have to say when putting it together, there were two holes that were off on the track part where the drawer fits--two holes for the little dollrods that you glue in. But, fortunately there are also screws that go there so I'm sure it'll be just fine. But, the holes pre-drilled just didn't line up with each other. Otherwise, very happy with how it turned out.",

      "text": "TV stand looks great and has a solid built. We have moved it from the corner to the middle of the room and actually settled with the middle location. It does not have a back cover and we actually like that. If you want you can install them yourself simply by buying the material as mentioned by a couple reviews. Some reviewers complain that it may be from China and have problems with that. The reality is that a lot of the stuff we buy is made in China. The vendor is extremely accessible and is willing and wants to HELP. Buy this nice TV stand, place it wherever you want, and enjoy it.",
