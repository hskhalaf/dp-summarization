    "description": "With the new d2, LaCie again raised the bar on the industry's most trusted desktop storage product. Get the job done faster - on any computer - with dual Thunderbolt 2, USB 3.0, and a 7200 RPM Seagate hard disk. Thanks to its innovative, all-aluminum unibody design, you'll notice incredibly low vibration and operating noise. It's even possible to push speeds to up to five times faster by installing the LaCie d2 SSD Upgrade (sold separately). With best-in-class speed, versatility, and durability, the new LaCie d2 sets a new standard for desktop storage. The new LaCie d2 combines Thunderbolt 2 and USB 3.0 interfaces to deliver the best possible speeds when connected to any late-model PC or Mac computer. Dual Thunderbolt 2 ports let you daisy chain up to six devices to a single Thunderbolt port on a computer. This means that you could connect up to five LaCie d2 plus a 4K display to an iMac computer's Thunderbolt 2 port, bringing remarkable scalability and convenience to 4K or other workflows. And since USB 3.0 and Thunderbolt 2 are backward compatible, you always get the absolute fastest speeds your computer allows.",
