Just not as nice as other stuff I purchased. As you can see from photo it\u2019s quite smaller than other brands. Same foam but size and amount is much less. If I needed more or didn\u2019t have other stuff for fireplace, I would return. Like I said- it does work and sticks well, but I\u2019ve found better elsewhere.",

The Bow-Tiger is much bigger (wider and thicker) which was really good for around our fireplace. However, this one by Bebe Earth was nicer for our island, because we didn't want a big thick cushion, we just needed a soft edge cover. Because its a little lower profile, it fits in nicely and doesn't make the island stand out. The tape on the Bebe seems really sturdy.",

My corner/edge work was not as precise on my part but for my first attempt it was easy, simple, worked but I would have used a razor blade or utility knife instead of scissors. My only comment the corners have the 3M tape attached but the rest of the edge protection you have to apply yourself using the included roll of 3M tape. I wish, like the corners, the tape was already attached. It would have been easier and more user friendly.",

The tape used must be a second-rate 3M adhesive because the cost of good quality tape alone would be more than this product as a whole.

I found it easier to fold out the edges and place the corner before the sides just to stay in alignment. It cuts easily with scissors and is stretchy enough to get a nice match to the corners.

I purposely whacked my hand against this to see how squishy it was and it didn\u2019t hurt me one bit. I feel so much better because my 10mo old is fully walking now but sometimes trips. This has taken so much pressure off of me to constantly be near him during this milestone. It looks good too, besides my obvious shaky hands.",

Got a nice email from the company telling me to apply and let the adhesive sit before use and it worked perfect. I have also removed it off of the table the first time I ordered it.

You have to peel and stick the tape yourself...but it only takes a few minutes and the edges and corners are well covered and you wont have to be as concerned about your little ones bumping into those sharp edges and corners. I'm really pleased with this product. The cow door guard is a really cute bonus too!",
