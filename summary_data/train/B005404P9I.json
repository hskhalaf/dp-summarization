At load my CPU typically runs between 50-65 degrees C. It is easy to install and overclock (if you don't know what to do then just read your manual or watch JayzTwoCents so that you can learn how to properly install your CPU). The CPU Core Voltage that I'm running at fluctuates between 1.341 - 1. 367 volts on average (for those wondering).",

The driver who delivered it signed the delivery themselves and left it at my backdoor which is not fenced in and is less than 10 feet from my shifty neighbor's door and next to a busy street with a sidewalk. It's a very expensive product that required a signature and they didn't even bother to leave it in a secure location?",

I've had the exact reverse experience, and then I got suspicious of my 5820k running so much hotter (with a corsair H80) than my i9. Turns out the H80 pump was set to operate on low. I turned that up to 11 and now all my cpus are nice and cool. So really it's about your cooler and how you configure it.",

The second is that there is no cooling fan that comes with the CPU. It is sort of like \"Batteries not included\". I am sure that this not only saves money for Intel, but most installers don't use the provided fan as they prefer a bigger cooling fan with more capacity. Overall the i9 is a great chip.",
