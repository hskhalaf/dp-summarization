The strap behind her foot was higher, so even when I tightened it to the maximum, her foot still wobbled. Although the older sandal version ran a shoe size too big, she could still wear it securely. So, I returned the sandal. It looks fine - it is possible my daughter's foot is too narrow for this shoe.",
