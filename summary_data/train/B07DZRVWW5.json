It stayed in place all the way to work, even when braking. I have a Samsung Note 8 with an Otterbox Defender Case. The phone will not fit in largest compartment sideways. I don't think it will fit without the Otterbox Case, to be honest. It's hard plastic and very sturdy, but I was hoping to put my phone in there sideways while driving. The width is okay but the length isn't.",

The change is all in one neat easy to retrieve place. And the double usb is quite convienent too. I will say I do wish the main part was a little larger, not deeper, just longer. Doesn\u2019t hold my phone very well. I have the iPhone Sx max. All in all I love it and will be purchasing another for my daughter.",
