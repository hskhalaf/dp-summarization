I went out for a rip on my bike and ended up crossing a river. Long story short I didn't make it. Me, my bike and this back pack witch contained my phone wallet and keys were all fully submerged in water. I did some pricey damage to my bike but because this back pack is water proof my phone wallet and keys were perfectly dry.",

You pay for the quality you get, but it certainly is not a bad deal. I am able to fit my bike lock, a sweatshirt, and my camera, which is all I need for my rides. Adjustable straps and front buckle make it easy to carry on your back with out discomfort. Just about as light weight as material can get, which is also a plus. Overall, not a bad purchase.",

The smaller front pocket will hold your keys, phone and a snack bar (this is what I took hiking the 1st time I used it). Perfect for my needs!",
