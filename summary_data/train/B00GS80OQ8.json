I\u2019ve got another pioneer head unit single din in my other car and this one doesn\u2019t even come close to my other unit. You have only 1 custom eq of your choosing & on top of that you can only customize the treble & bass. If you like to do more customization in your audio settings, this unit isn\u2019t the one for you. Also, I have to turn the volume up to 40-56 to get decent volume. Max volume is 62. Not what I was looking for. Good for people who don\u2019t know much about car audio. Will update if anything goes south.",

I have to talk pretty loud, but my car is older and a bit noisy so that's probably why. The radio station preset buttons feel cheap and awkward - that's probably my biggest complaint. I had to call tech support and they were actually pretty helpful - I didn't expect that. The sound was cutting out intermittently, especially when the car went over bumps. They told me the unit goes into a \"safe\" mode when there is a short in a speaker. Sure enough, one of my speaker wires was bad inside the door.",

The design is dated and tacky but the price is right. Another problem is the buttons- every button is really two or three buttons which makes it tricky to push what you want unless you lean your finger one way or the other. You have to push the buttons very hard to make them work also, and I find that irritating. The sound from the unit is good. The USB input function doesn't seem to really work.",

Track information is displayed with multiple display options. Function buttons (Next/Previous; phone, etc) are conveniently placed on the left side. Included remote works well, but with the Axxess unit, is not needed. Small footprint (NO CD player! THIS IS A DIGITAL MEDIA RECEIVER!) allows it to be installed in glove box or in a deep double DIN well, so I think this will work well for tablet modders. Sound without amplification sounds fine to me. In the brief time I've had it, it's a great unit!",

Pros: Good sound; easy pairing with Bluetooth; Pandora \"just works\" automatically and it's nice to have Pandora controls, including the station list, right on the radio. Cons: Display is too dim to see during the day, and the most dimmed setting is still to bright at night. I miss having controls to adjust balance and tone--you can do this, but it's buried under a couple of menu layers so not accessible while driving, especially since you can't see the display very well in daylight.",

The controls are rubbish, spiky little things to forward the track and buttons placed so that you inadvertently hit the source button when trying to hit others. Sound is only so so and the unit overheats pretty badly. Overall I'd say they were going for someone who wants something that looks faux fancy and skimped severely on every other thing you'd want in a head unit. Avoid.",
