Weight to age guides are great as well to let us know we are keeping on track between pediatrician visits.",

It\u2019s really easy to use and stores several of the last weights taken, which is nice. The only downside is that it fluctuates A LOT with a wiggly baby and does not have an averaging feature. But if you are patient, you can get a pretty accurate reading. Overall good value.",

I have used this and then taken my child to the doctor the same day and the measurements always differ. It\u2019s not usually a large difference but enough when I\u2019m trying to keep adequate measurements. I wouldn\u2019t recommend if you are looking for accuracy.",

    "title": "Ozeri All-in-One Baby and Toddler Scale - with Weight and Height Change Detection",
    "description": "The Ozeri All-In-One Baby and Toddler Scale combines weight and height measurement technology, built-in memory, age and gender specific growth charts, and a bonus head circumference measuring tape to provide everything needed to confidently monitor a child's growth. The Ozeri All-In-One Scale precisely weighs to within 0.1 oz (0.01 lbs or 0.005 kg), with a maximum weight capacity of 55 lbs / 25 kg, for best-in-class accuracy, and features built-in memory for up to 8 unique infant profiles with auto-recognition technology. It also stores up to 15 weigh-ins for each infant profile so that you can monitor and track growth data in between doctor's visits. The Ozeri All-In-One Scale also utilizes a sliding measurement board that digitally captures an infant's height, from 18.1 to 31.5 inches (in), or 46 to 80 centimeters (cm), with a precise graduation of 0.1 in / or 1 mm (0.1 cm). Featuring net change detection, the Ozeri All-In-One Scale instantly displays an infant\u2019s current weight and height, and the net change in weight and height since the most recent measurement. The Ozeri All-In-One Scale includes a Unit button that conveniently switches weight and height measurements between kg-cm / lb-in / oz-in / lb:oz-in, and a Tare button that instantly subtracts the weight of diapers or clothing, for accurate net weight determination. The Ozeri scale is also equipped with a convenient Hold button that quickly captures weight and height measurements with a moving infant. Fully equipped, the Ozeri All-In-One Baby and Toddler Scale includes 4 AAA batteries, an accessory measuring tape for measuring head circumference, and easy-to-read growth charts from both the World Health Organization and the CDC, with age and gender specific charts.",
