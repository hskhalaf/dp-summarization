Even though I packed other shirts, I kept washing this shirt in the sink, hanging it up to let it air dry, and wearing it the next day. Unfortunately, all my pictures look like I only have one outfit, so I intend to order a couple more in different colors. Much better than having to use sunscreen all day long. Since I ordered a medium (I usually order small) and it fit perfectly, you may want to consider getting a size larger.",

No further instructions from the company. First wear and now it is garbage. Thanks Vapor Apparel.",

We tried twice to purchase this shirt, but even the largest size did not fit her (and she's not huge up front or anything). I love them for me, but until they adjust the fit (and point that out in their advertising), I woudn't recommend them for my female friends unless they are very slim and like a TIGHT fit.",

My shirt arrived in a plastic bag with a little teeny hole in one of the sleeves due to a removed price tag perhaps. It looked like the start of a run in the fabric.
