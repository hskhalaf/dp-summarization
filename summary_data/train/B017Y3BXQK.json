They performed so well I bought the 7\" & 9\" combo pack and finally threw out the funky old scissors I had that didn't work so well anymore. I guess these scissors won a Good Design Award in 2016. Not sure if that is some marketing hype or not, but they perform very well, are comfortable - and like I said, I bought the combo pack after buying a the 8\" version and being very pleased with the design.",

They are borderline shears -- suitable for cutting heavy cardboard and semi-rigid plastic as well as thin paper. Some users may find them to be a tad too large, but for me (I'm 6'2\" and have large hands) they are very ergonomically comfortable and easy to use. Solid, sharp, stout, and extremely well made. Multi-purpose scissors that I am sure to use often. Bravo Westcott.",

However, I would prefer if it was straight rather than bent (these are kinda like dressmaker's shears). Westcott DOES have a straight Carbo Titanium product -- but it is an inch shorter. I would also prefer if the blades were a bit longer (they are 4 inches in length -- 4-1/2 would have been better). From what I can tell, Westcott does not make a product such as I have described -- but I am HAPPY to make do with this item!",

I've taped then (layers and layers) and they're better now, but will never be a really good fit. I can't open them open as wide as I'd like, either - again, because of the size of the grips. It's not that I have odd hands - I've never experienced this problem before with scissors. The blades are also very tight, though I guess the screw can be loosened a bit for that. Gave these 3 stars somewhat reluctantly because they do seem so well constructed. But I doubt I'll use them much.",

However beware of the regular nonstick Wescott 8\" because they break easy and only this kind has a big metal bolt for the pivot axis. The thick blades and center pivot bolt make these rock stars on cutting anything heavy. Get these for about $6.50 at the writing and be proud. I love my 8\" Fiscars titanium nonstick soft grip for flowers but these are needed for the thick stems and will not disappoint guaranteed.",

They slice right through paper and thin plastic without even having to cut, or rather, move your fingers. They cut through thicker plastic as well with no struggle or frustration. They have a nice, solid feel and weight, and comfortable grips for your fingers. I will eventual replace all of my scissors with these. I suggest buying several pairs, if you can afford it, as you'll want to keep a pair handy everywhere.",

I've put my name in permanent ink on them because I won't share! (but I will buy anyone else in the household who wants a pair, their own.)
