      "text": "If you're looking for a high quality mash tun, this one may fit the bill. I think its more suited for 10 gallon normal gravity beers or 5 gallon high gravity batches. There is approximately 2.5 gallons of dead space which will make it difficult for low or average gravity beers to fully convert. Also you'll need to have a pretty high water to grist ratio to get it to work. you could consider filling up the dead space with marbles or plates or something. Also I recommend putting in a dip tube to ensure you get more efficiency out of the tun.",
