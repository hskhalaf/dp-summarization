My son ended up getting a horrible diaper rash that wouldn't go away no matter what we did. As soon as we changed to Pampers it vanished. I feel guilty for ever putting these on my child.

Furthermore, butt sores and skin peeling started appearing and looked like it was never going to go away until I switched back to Pampers Swaddlers. Pampers Swaddlers is best due to the netting they have. The pooped soaks through the netting, keeping it somewhat away from the butt cheek. I believe the netting helps keep the poop from being pushed out (leakage) and possibly help prevent butt sores. In my experience, I am staying with Pampers Swaddlers until I find something just as good or better.",

Some might complain about the sagging when it's full, but it really should just be changed at that point. Some might also prefer Pampers, but those tend to leak out the back for us. These might feel a bit wet when soiled, but they don't really leak if overfull. Overall, satisfied with this purchase and would most likely order again.",

Huggies kind of slip off baby butt and the side straps do a weird thing. Huggies side straps are much stronger than pampers. The biggest plus for huggies is that they are unscented!

Even though it does say last 8 hours or overnight, don't let your child bathe in their urine, that's how they'll end up with an UTI. Overall, awesome diapers. They're my go-to diaper. Oh! And a big appluse to Amazon delivery person!! I was away from home and worried my package would be stolen since I live on an intersection. But a delivery picture came through and they HID my package away from public view for me!! A sigh of relief.. thank you!!",

But this package from Amazon is having a lot of issues and we will not purchase diapers from Amazon again, we worry it might not even be authentic to have multiple problems like this. We have to throw the rest of the diapers out. Very disappointed.",

      "text": "Every child fits diapers differently. That being said, these have so much elastic around the legs that all pooh comes straight out the sides. These were perfect for my son, they are horrible on my daughter. If you let them get too wet, little particles will appear on your kid (the moisture collection particles from inside the diaper). Won't be buying these again. I like the Target Up and Up brand now. They hold a whole lot more now, they keep the pooh contained, and they are made of natural materials, so more biodegradable. Oh, and they are super affordable!",

Another thing is you have to verify the delivery days sometimes you will need them before the days you expect it, so make sure you update the date and you will not have to worry about diapers. Oh and totally forgot the amount for the price you can't beat that :)",

My advice is that if you value your time and don't want to spend your days cleaning diaper contents off of clothing, stick with Pampers swaddlers.",

I\u2019ve used Little Snugglers and Huggies that had a different Mickey Mouse design (maybe Little Movers?) and did not have nearly as many leaks. Compared to other Huggies the fit is odd too.
