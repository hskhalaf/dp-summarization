Hitting off the turf mats provided a grabby traction. off grass, it is perfect. The X soles are soft so time will tell how long they will last. Leather top is nice and I get compliments on the color combo. Folks with wider feet may have pressure on the sides of their feet. i woudl get a half size larger if I had to do it again.",

They do hold more sand when exiting a trap and cut grass in general than my regular soft spikes. Seems to be the nature of all spikeless shoes according to others. I'll go spikeless in the future. Besides it looks like Dustin Johnson wears the same shoe. Doesn't improve my driving distance though..",

They are very comfortable but definitely have a lot of support-feet don't shift around in them even though the toe box is ample with no toes rubbing the inside. Importantly, after a round of golf my heels are usually very sore. But, I had no heel pain after a round in these shoes. I consider them a great find and an excellent product. Although folks say they run a little small, I am between a 10.5 and 11 medium and I tried them both and went with the 10.5, which fit nicely.",

Traction and stability both excellent as you'd expect from a \"tour level\" shoe, but walking comfort was the major standpoint. For $120'ish I'd highly recommend.",
