I have used mine about 50 times from diving to surfing and it still looks brand new. I rinse it every time I use it with freshwater. It is a little loose around my neck but otherwise it fits decently well. I have long legs and a long torso and the only thing I would change on the suit would be a little longer torso. Otherwise the arms and legs are plenty long.",

I was able to shift it all down and fold into my ankles like a cuff. Worked well for cold waters in the Galapagos. Good arm action-stretchy pits. Was glad to have it after seeing (and smelling) some of the shoddy rental suits on our tours. It packed up tight. I would recommend.",

My wife is 5' 4 140 pounds and she got a size 7 which worked out great with only some dead space in the arms as well. They are comfortable and for the price seem to be great quality. I would say you're probably OK to about 70 degree water in these, some people might say you could do a little colder but that's where I'm putting it.",

I'm a teeny bit soft around the middle (hey, I'm 45) and this is the ideal size for me; couldn't be better if it was custom fit. If you were a bit leaner it'd probably still work for you, but any taller/wider you should definitely go up a size. Height-wise (my biggest concern) it's perfection. Very comfortable, great freedom of movement, warm (not tried it in the water yet but it has all the wrist/neck/ankle seals you'd expect). Looks well made, not 'cheap' at all; neoprene is snug and comfortable and stretchy where you want it. Really a great deal.",

I was at the high end for a size 9 (I'm almost 5 ft 8 and about 145 lbs, with a 36\" bust and 40\" hips), but it was quite a bit too big. Specifically, the legs, chest, and arms were all too large. I returned it and will be trying the 7, but I'm worried that will be too small. I recognize that wetsuits are hard to fit, but I am not atypically shaped and by their chart, the 9 should even have been a bit small. I think manufacturers need to offer a wider range of sizes.",

Whether you're an experienced diver or a beginner to wearing a wetsuit, this one lasts through the wear and tear.\n\nComfortable for All-Day Wear\n\nGo right from snorkeling at the surface to diving in the deep; this 3mm neoprene full-body wetsuit forms to your body for maximum comfort and doesn't irritate your skin. \n\nEasy Donning & Doffing\n\nAn extra long leash and #10 YKK zipper makes it easy to slip into your wetsuit just before your dive or layer under other gear for cold-water activities.\n\n SIZING DISCLAIMER:\n\nFor best performance, Seavenger wetsuits are designed to fit very tightly to provide maximum insulation. A well-fitted wetsuit should allow the wearer to breathe normally and move with some effort but may feel slightly constricting.",
