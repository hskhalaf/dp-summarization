They're well made and exactly as described. If you have clothing that falls off of other hangers, these are the ticket. Many of my wife's tops are hard to keep on a wood or plastic hangar, but no problem with these things. If a t-shirt gets near one of these things, though, it sort of grabs the hanger everywhere the two touch. They're great non-slip hangers. It just turns out that I really hate non-slip hangers . . .",

The best part is these things are impossible to tangle. On a daily basis, they have removed the chaos and improved my outlook. Love them!",
