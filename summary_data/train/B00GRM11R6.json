The biggest issue is that the arm does not extend far enough to actually hit any target. Even on the \"Feminine\" wash cycle, water doesn't hit the \"Posterior\" target but mostly shoots up my back. The fan is too weak to dry anything and it's aimed only on the left cheek. The remote is too difficult to understand (has no back-light for night time use) and the printed instructions are too complicated, the pictures too small. I'm sadly disappointed and apparently it can't be returned. It is useless to me.",

The product delivers. I feel so much better and no irritation. Temperature control is great. The colon cleansing feature is great for folks who have difficulty with constipation due to some pain meds. Definitely worth the price paid. Only frustration is that when I push for female wash often it does posterior instead and I have to push the stop button sometimes three times to restart.",

It fits our elongated bowel fine, and is very comfortable to sit on. My only suggestion for improvement would be to backlight the remote control for use at night.

      "text": "This bio bidet is truly the best toilet seat on the market at this price range. It has everything anybody could want in a toilet seat. You can adjust just about every aspect of the toilet from temperature of water, and seat, to spray pressure from the nozzle, and heater. You can also adjust the width and direction of the spray as well. This is truly the pinnacle of bidets, there is not one negative thing with this seat . I highly recommend it, you will not be disappointed!!",
