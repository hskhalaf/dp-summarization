That would have been acceptable if it were good quality bu the pictures are grainy compared to the logitech c920 and to the microsoft hd webcam I was trying to replace. The software seems outdated too as there were mentions of windows 7. Instead I have setup my wife to only use manual focusing at least we get good images.",

      "text": "Bought this camera to replace a 12 year old Logitech C930e. The C930e was an amazing camera and worked perfect on Mac. The only reason I am replacing it is the mechanical parts of the camera are wearing out. It has worked on every mac I have owned since 2010. That was my baseline for the 9000 pro. There are reviews that say the 9000 does work on Mac, but that was not my experience. The 9000 pro does not work correctly on MacOS. MacOS doesn't see the mic correctly, it is labelled generically as \"usb mic\". The light adjustments are very wrong. The zoom is wrong. I do not recommend this camera for Mac at all.",

I had better results setting the focus manually for the typical range I sat in. The quality of the microphone is decent, but not excellent.

For Skype and other conference uses, it does the job well and is worth the few extra dollars over lesser models. The built-in stand results in the camera being placed on a table and producing those unflattering up-the-nostrils views. Mounting it higher produces a more flattering view but draping it over the top of the monitor may not work on some montors. Taping it to the monitor back is more secure.\\ As always, kudos to Amazon. After dealing with some other online companies, the Amazon commitment to customer satisfaction continues to be the gold standard of online retail business.",

I also like the software that comes with it, which makes it easy to do things like record video presentations. The light that indicates when a signal is being sent was a nice bonus. The only downside is that it's hard to clamp the camera to many thin monitors or a laptop. It will stay there and is plenty steady enough for video conferencing, but it's possible to knock it off.",

Picture quality is also quite good. My only misgiving is that it doesn't really attach well to my screen. It's just sort of propped or lying on top of it and doesn't seem very secure. Hasn't been a big issue because this is on a desktop computer screen that really isn't moved around much. But somehow I though it would clip on a bit more securely. Overall good though for the money I paid.",

Also had to change multiple settings on logitech and skype software to stop software from loading at Windows start up (relatively easy to do). However, these negative aspects are inherent to any new piece of hardware/software these days, so I don't take them into consideration -- just want to advise. Consider your internet bandwidth limitations with any webcam, especially a great one like this -- high quality video & voice need high bandwidth (both on your end and on the other person's end).",

One problem: for some weird reason, the software prevents Thunderbird from updating itself, so if you use the Thunderbird mailer, you must terminate all webcam processes (including the little icon in the system tray) before doing mailer software updates. This procedure is annoying but not difficult. If the webcam software is running, Thunderbird updates get stuck in an infinite loop. Only in Windows could two apparently unrelated programs interfere like this!",

      "text": "This camera raises the bar for webcams (not very hard!). It has good color, very good light sensitivity, and good resolution. It works well in a high contrast setting, like a bright light in a normal room, and still shows faces clearly. Of course the image quality isn't as good as a real digital camera but it is a webcam after all. The software is quite sophisticated and has some cute features which are fun even though they don't work 100% of the time. It's the best webcam on the market right now and fairly priced.",

I accepted the 100 MB+ update, and found that it removed all of the high resolution options for the camera. I uninstalled the software and returned to the original drivers. Works great for Skype. The included Logitech Vid is lame since it doesn't have any echo cancellation and I got terrible feedback loops when I tested it.",

The mounting system is effective for laptops or flat panels. The camera is capable of fairly high resolution for video recording, but seems kind of slow showing signs of smearing on pans or movement. The auto focus, auto exposure, and auto color balance do a good job making the cam easy to use. The only negative is the cord is quite long which leaves a lot of extra cable on a laptop. If you are using a desk top, this might be a positive.",
