      "text": "This device is amazingly accurate. Every test measurement I tried was within 1/32 of true. When I say \"within,\" I mean less than 1/32 of an inch just to be clear. In other words, the measurements were effectively perfect. The only flaw that I have found is the display. The fraction is placed right on the edge of the display and it is very small. Any shadow makes reading the output difficult, especially with older eyes that can't focus on small text. If you don't have this or a similar tool tool in your arsenal, get one. It fits easily into a pocket, it's super accurate, and easier to use than a tape measure.",

Usually I can brace or rest it on some object - even my knee or the ground -. but there have been a few situations (too lengthy to describe) where that was not feasible. An ideal device should have a more sensitive (ie, easy-to-press) button. Otherwise, it's consistent & reliable. 2) The instructions for more advance features are not easy to read.",

Can calculate area, volume, triangle, indirect measures and some others I haven't used. I have tested it up to 240 feet (80 meters) approx. with success. This is a great measuring device. It is very easy to use. I highly recommend it !",

My second complaint is the laser is easy to see if you're in shade or inside, but when the sun is blaring on whatever you're aiming at it makes it impossibl to see.

    "title": "Stanley STHT77140 Laser Distance Measurer TLM330",
    "description": "Size:330-Foot RangeStanley STHT77139 Laser Distance Measurer calculates distance, area and volume. This device can measure a distance up to 330-Feet (100m), with accuracy of +/- 1/32-Inch (1mm). The continuous measurement tracking function finds distance from a target quickly and easily. The addition/subtraction feature is a convenient way to calculate in the field using standard measurement units. This unit can also calculate an indirect measurement using Pythagoras; measures distances even when point A and/or point B is not accessible for linear measurement. Stores the last 5 measurements taken for reference. The multifunctional end piece makes true corner-to-corner measurements easy and accurate. In addition, this unit also features an inclination sensor; integrated digital leveling identifies position for accurate measurements. Features a backlit, 2 line display which provides visibility in all working conditions, along with an over-molded housing which makes it water and debris resistant for durability and protection. Uses (2) AAA batteries, included. This is a Class 2 laser product, Power output \u2264 1mW.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\nThe STHT77140 laser distance measurer TLM330 accurately determines distance up to 330 feet and also calculates area and volume (view larger).
