Now mu husband can have more than 2 feet of space in the main closet =) I did not use both hanging bars in the middle because I needed the space for my 30+ dresses. This is super sturdy and well made. I got the bronze/brown color because it has wider shelves compared to the other ones. I was also able to diy add a curtain rod in the front to keep my Newf from slobbering allover my clothes hehe",

I had two hanging linen shelves before this, and I found that If I cut them into pieces of 2, I have a basket for clothes, socks, underwear etc. on the shelves.. No need to by wicker baskets. I removed the clothes that I would not be wearing for the season, and stored them elsewhere in very heavy plastic bags made by Ziplock.",
