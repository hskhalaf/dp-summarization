      "text": "On receipt the battery charged but would not power the laptop when it was disconnected from the mains. Returned to the supplier a new battery was installed and since then the laptop has given every satisfaction. Of pleasing appearance and well constructed this laptop is highly portable because of its compact size and light weight. Purchased on the basis of an enthusiastic review in 'Which?' I would endorse the magazine's favourable assessment and warmly recommend this laptop to anyone contemplating the purchase of a machine in this price range. I doubt there is any laptop on the market offering better value for money.",

It deserves 5 stars. The lack of customer service is a worry. The phone number given in the vendor details does not work and they don't answer emails. While I am pleased with the machine I would not use the seller again",

I told them about it about a week before the warranty was up... but i didn't follow up a diagnostic check for about 2 weeks and which point they said there is nothing they can do - it is out of warranty. Technically they are covered but it is shocking bad customer service.... plus i have since realized its a common problem for such a high end laptop.",
