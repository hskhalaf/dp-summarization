The texture of my lips is improved but if you generally take care of your lips you might not notice as much of a difference. But the tone has really improved. I bite my lips and before this mask they had dark spots, cracks and blotchy areas. Now my lips are a beautiful even pink. The jar is quite large and you only need enough product to cover the tip of the little spatula. Definitely worth it.",

It will restore moisture to your lips. If you want BABY SOFT lips then this is your holy grail product!",
