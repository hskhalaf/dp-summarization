I\u2019ve been wearing them for many years and the gold cups seem to have a longer lifespan. And 3.) the eyelets on the gold cups are 18kt gold plated and I\u2019m a baller like that.",

It seems that the insole starts at the heel and only goes up until right before the ball of my foot which is fine when putting the shoes on but when by taking them off my foot drags the front edge of the insole and peels it back. This happens within a few days and has only become worse. Now the shoes are uncomfortable to wear because the insole doesn\u2019t sit flat anymore so it\u2019s also pressing on the bottom of my foot. I expected better quality from a pair of $140 shoes.",

That was until I needed a pair of brown leather boat shoes. Based on my friends recommendation, I decided to pull the trigger on these and never looked back. The lamb skin is the softest leather I've ever felt. The soles and insides of the shoe provide great support and I can wear them all day without taking them off. I took these with me on a trip to Cabo for President's Club and I'm glad I did becase they were so comfortable. You will NOT regret it!",

I also blew out the sole near the ball of my foot so bad that I bruised my bone. This all happened within three months of buying them. I would have just bought regular Sperry's if I knew they were going to get trashed so easily. That being said, I'll actually just save my money and get another pair of Oak Street's (awesome) or Quoddy's (classic).",
