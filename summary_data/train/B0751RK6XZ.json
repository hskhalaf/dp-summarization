After wasting several hours over several days with TP-Link technical support, they were not able to resolve the issue or issue a replacement product! Buyer beware, you will not have a warranty if any company besides Amazon (or TP-Link) fulfills the order. While I can't recommend this product because of the aforementioned quality and warranty issues, the functioning parts of the router are exemplary. Setting up this router was incredibly intuitive and easy; I should know considering how much troubleshooting I've done. The working 2.4g band is blazing fast and stable as well, with nice coverage throughout my home (through 2-3 sheetrock walls) and up to ~100 ft into my yard.",

I have totally lost connectivity, both wired and wireless, twice in the first 6 weeks of service. Rebooting and quick power cycling didn't help. I had to unplug the router for several minutes to regain a connection. At twice the price of my old router, I expected much better! EDIT: After the 4th failure in 7 weeks of owning this router, right as the Canadian Gran Prix was starting, I decided I had had enough! Thanks to Amazon's amazing customer service, I am returning this defective product ans shopping for a new modem. I now hate this modem: 1 star!",

Bought it from user ratings and the people pleased with the coverage. Coverage isnt any better than my 7 yesr old Netgear. Would have gone with the Netgear, but i had 2 go belly up with firmware upgrades in less than a week. I am also pretty sure the \u201cnew\u201d Netgear i purchased wasnt really new. Will keep it even though for the coverage it is way over priced.",
