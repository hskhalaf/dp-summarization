It is a great small powered screw driver with easily changing bits. The tip/bit change mechanism is very well built and a clever idea. I like my new tool very much and I believe you will too... well ... your new tool, not mine.",

All in all though it's a good purchase. You can buy a holster (which I did) and if it had variable speed it wouldn't need a clutch as much.

      "text": "One of the biggest problems with power screwdrivers is that it is easy to lose the various driving bits as well as to do a quick change on the fly. This product solves both of these issues. The rotating interchangeable driving but holder is a truly fantastic and long overdo evolution of the power driver. Probably the most useful instance is having a pilot drill bit and the Philips and flathead in one cartridge, making it easy to drill a pilot hole and quickly switch to driving the screw.",

You can swap out the small drive bits for longer drive ones( If you have them). This things a a little bulky, But handy to have, time will tell how long the battery will last. Happy with purchase.",
