      "text": "I like the operation and they work great. But the construction is poor. I'm not going to return them, but I do need to mix up some epoxy and glue the magnets back into their spots so that they will attach to the bases. They are currently priced at $8.50. If you have some epoxy laying around that needs to be used or keep a supply, $8.50 probably is a fair price. The batteries that are included probably need to be replaced with decent batteries anyway, so we will call that a wash. Again, the price is fair, these are fairly decent on visibility and are small and easy to store.",

    "description": "Color:RedWhether you're heading to the neighborhood market or driving cross-country on a family camping trip, when on the road it is always critical to be prepared. Keeping safety tools, such as emergency flashers and a working flashlight allows you to prepare for the unexpected. The Life Gear Glow Emergency Flares (3 Pack) are long lasting LED signalling lights. Containing no chemicals or flammable materials, LED flares are a much safer option than incendiary flares. These LED lights are re-usable over and over with up to 150 hours of battery life. Simple to use - Just twist on for solid red, turn off and twist again for blinking red light. The magnetic flares can be attached to the metal body of your car or set in the included base as a stand alone flare creating a visible, long lasting emergency light at night.",
