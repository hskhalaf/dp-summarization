With the amount of staples needed to do all the bunks, my wrist would be sore for a week. This stapler plus Arrow's 1/2\" stainless steel staples did the trick. Sweet.",

I started at 60 lbs. pressure and didn't get a flush penetration. 70 worked fine and has not torn through the screening. This Arrow pneumatic saved my hands and a lot of time.
