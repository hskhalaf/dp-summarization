This makes the child seat tilt forward. Otherwise my son fits in the seat comfortably. He is about 30 lbs and 35 in tall and has plenty of room in the seat. Overall seat worked as expected.",

At first I was skeptical if he would even fit into this but once I received it and put it on my bike I had no doubts whatsoever. I did not install it myself but rather got it assembled with my Bike at the Walmart where I got my bike from but it has been really easy to remove it for solo rides. Its sturdy, the straps are perfect for keeping the child safe and the material is sturdy and looks of good quality. All in all great value for the price and lot of fun with my son.",

It takes a minute to get used to the weight adjustment (more weight in the back, which probably could cause a fish-tail effect if not careful.) But once you're used to it, its a blast!
