Guaranteed to make your lashes clumpy, stick together, and have weird zigzags. Just like real spider legs! If you're not a fan of that look, this product is probably one to skip. I didn't think it did much for me beyond what a normal decent mascara would, it was a pain to use, and ended up kind of clumpy and gross. def wouldn't buy again.",

The only downer is after 2 months I'm ordering another one because the small tube with fibers is running on empty while I still have plenty of the actual mascara left. Another good thing is it stays on all day. I don't believe it's waterproof, but normally I'd have racoon eyes by the end of the day if i don't buy waterproof, but this holds up all day and washes off with just warm water when you wash your face at the end of the day.",
