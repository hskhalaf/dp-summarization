This one definitely lasts. I even went and ordered a second one (same monster brand). I'd recommend it.",

It comes with a protective case that easily opens with velcro, and is very easy to operate. All it takes is switching the button to on (on the side) and pressing the button directly above the power switch. Easy to turn on and off, super cute zebra design, and from the sound and look when it is activated it is NO JOKE. Very pleased with this, and ordering additional units for late Christmas gifts.",
