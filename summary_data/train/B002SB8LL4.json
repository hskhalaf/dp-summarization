I used it open this time, but it still only took about 12 minutes. It's very easy to use. Easy to clean as well since the plates come right off and can be put in the dishwasher.

The biggest complaint is that the non-stick coating started wearing off after about 4 months. It is acerbated by the heat not being even on the plates. So, one end gets more use than the other and the coating has worn off on half the bottom plate. The plates are easy to remove and clean that makes the condition bearable. Replacement plates are not available. I've ordered a Foreman grill with non-stick, removable plates that I hope will last better.",

And last week, half of a burger stuck to the plates and remained there. I had to scrape it off with a spatula and reconstruct the burger on the bun. I sincerely expected more for my money.",

If you do wash this in a dishwasher, plan on replacing the grills every 6 months. If you wash them by hand, you may get 1 1/2 years before the non-stick coating bubbles up and peels off. After a couple months, the non-stick coating loses its effectiveness, so things begin sticking--which makes the coating more likely to peel as you try to clean it. I only use my grill about 1x each week, and I have already had to replace the grills once, and they are now almost unusable again--all within 2 1/2 years.",
