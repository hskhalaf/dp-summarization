      "text": "This bread knife looks nice and sleek and might be decent enough to cut soft breads and tomatoes. However, as a real bread knife, it's useless. It arrived sharp but the design fails to cut through real bread crusts - that makes trying to cut such a crusty bread with this knife extremely dangerous since it just slides off without leaving a mark on the crust. Given the low price, I didn't expect the same performance as a high quality bread knife but I have a cheap tomato knife that does a better job cutting my crusty breads. Therefore, I do not recommend this product if you enjoy artisan style or German bread, which usually have a nice hard crust.",

I'd expected this to be just the backup, but it has definitely become the favorite (even over the other new knife), though admittedly not by a lot. Both are really good knives, and often enough a 2nd one comes in handy! The other one is more of a \"ginzue\" style, and as such I think it does tomatoes a bit better.",

The knife looks elegant but as for using it for slicing or cutting fruit, its dangerous. I sliced a tomato and I had to push down hard the tomato got smashed. One has to use brute strength to slice which can lead to accidents. Even slicing bread was a joke. Do not buy this knife.",
