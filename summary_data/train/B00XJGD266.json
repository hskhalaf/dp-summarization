This thing is leagues above those. First time I used it, tried in on some packed, melted and re-frozen snow I thought it couldn't move. Went through it no problem, shooting it 40-50 ft. Not much this thing cannot handle. I live in Maine on top of a mountain, so I needed a strong one. This will work for me.",

The chute does wiggle a bit due to the design, but doesn't impact snow removal. Only thing I didn't know was this engine doesn't have an idle or throttle feature. Once you start it, which has been easy, she runs full throttle.",
