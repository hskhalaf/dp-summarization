Since he is extremely hard on headphones I did not want to buy an expensive pair. He has managed to keep these ones in tact and has used them a lot. I would highly recommend these and if they do break I will buying another pair just like these because of the great quality. I think that anything that survives a year or more with a rough 8 year old boy is worth buying again.",

My other headset squeezes my ears too much and leaves me with a little pain after a couple of hours.

When I first used these headphones to listen to music, the sound quality was very disappointing -- it sounded like the music was being muffled through inches of foam or cardboard. My old inexpensive headphones still work, so I did a side-by-side comparison of sound quality using the same song. The difference in sound quality is HUGE - my old cheap headphones sound loud and crystal clear - these headphones have much lower volume and the sound is muddled and indistinct. I guess you get what you pay for - next time I'll spend the money necessary to obtain good-quality headphones.",

I do like the size of it however. Not too big that it looks huge on my head. The sound quality is good. My only problem with this is that there is already a problem with the wiring. I only just got it yesterday and the sound is already cutting out from the wiring.",

Unfortunately, lost the right channel just shy of 4 months of light usage. Checked the cable and all connections, all are ok, but when wiggling the place where the cord goes into the headphones, the right channel comes back briefly, but cuts out again after a short while. Wish they were made a bit more durable, but I guess for the price one can't complain too much. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend these- might spend a bit more to get something that will last longer.",

I didn't even have a chance to undo the cable. Only reason I'm leaving it two stars is because I have no idea how the sound quality is (I wasn't even going to try it out because it was so uncomfortable). Next time I'll stick to the more familiar brands. You get what you pay for.",
