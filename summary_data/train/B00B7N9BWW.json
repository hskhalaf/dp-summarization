      "text": "This was purchased for our 13 year old grandson. We selected this particular model from the many available primarily because of the size of the zoom and also that it has a rechargeable battery. Although some reviews seem to favor regular AA's, we know the amount of disposables would be hefty. I purchased an additional battery and separate charger so that he always has enough for extended use. This camera has all the bells and whistles you could need but the best thing is the quality of the pictures, which are excellent for a camera this size and price range.",

I am constantly getting the \"red square\" indicating I do not have focus lock when I'm shooting in low-light. And by low light sometimes that means with the window open and the room light on. I constantly have to move it around to a scene where there is some contrast before it will lock. The infrared beam is clearly projecting, but it doesn't seem to be helping much. I have everything set to auto, and my older Canon had no problems at all taking these shots. The Canon would focus in complete darkness. Very disappointing.",

However, it states you can sync with your smartphone, but it does not tell you it will not work with all of them. So make sure your phone is compatible before you buy it. If I would have known this issue with the Samsung phone, I would not have purchased it in the first place.",
