Six weeks later, I can pound metal again, but I still have to baby my right arm. My experiments with hammers have proven that hickory is the way to go, and the \"anti-vibe\" aspect of this Stanley means it isn't quite as bad as a normal all-metal hammer. All-metal hammers are pretty much evil for blacksmith work. Save your elbow, buy something with a hickory handle!",
