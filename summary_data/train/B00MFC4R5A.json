      "text": "This coat is similar in weight to Patagonia's Fiona parka. I ordered the XS and it fits perfectly. The coat is well made and I like the color (Titanium) a lot. Thought I'd found a perfect lightweight winter parka until I zipped it up. The zipper won't lie flat; it curves and kinks, causing the front of the coat to bunch up and not hang smoothly. Disappointing. I'm returning the coat.",

      "text": "I almost never write reviews on products, but when one is this lame, I feel like it's a duty. First, this coat won't keep you warm in 50 degree weather. It is trash bag thin. Second, instead of having an interior pocket or two, it has two sleeves that appear to be pockets, but are not closed on the bottom so are completely useless. Third, my wife ordered the color Titanium and it looks like the color of a battleship. Besides the attractive design of the coat as depicted on the site pictures, the product is essentially useless.",

I debated about size after reading reviews but ordered a large and glad I did. It fits perfect. (Some of the coats I already have are size large and some medium, but large in this coat is great). I am very happy with this purchase. The only thing I wish was different was a flap to cover zipper. But I love coat anyway.",

I used this coat in weather as cold as 5 degrees F, and it kept me very warm. It has nice big pockets and is comfortable to wear. I'm so glad I bought this! Please note this does seem to run big. I went one size down and it's the perfect size.",

Compared to other down coats in the same category this one did not have a hood (faux fur), no two way zipper, no zipper on size pockets, and no knit cuff to keep out cold. It runs a bit small so size up. However, look at other coats as I think you're paying for the designer name I'm returning this one for a coat with more value for the same money. I should have looked at more coats before ordering.",

The zipper in the photo looks fine but IRL it is an awful bright gold zipper that seems way too wide. It is all you notice. There is very little down. It is super thin, you wouldn't wear it if it was below freezing. Huge disappointment.",
