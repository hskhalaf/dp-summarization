      "text": "This device can not stand alone! Meaning, even though you can pair it to many bt host devices, you cannot take calls on it. WHEN PURCHASING WATCHES FOR USE WITH CALLS, MAKE SURE IT HAS AN AUDIO OUTLET! Even many Samsung reps are not aware that these kinds of WATCHES are on the market. Please do your research and check out YouTube or another source before buying a smart watch! This one is not worth the money! It's a watch. That's it.",

The software design is amazing compared to the apple watch, especially the main menu. I especially love the way you could navigate with the circular dial. There are some app's you could download like different faces, GPS, and much more. I got this product on sale for $299.99 and I'm glad I did! I strongly recommend it!!!!!!!!",

This watch gets noticed. Word to the wise, though: buy yourself some screen protectors at the same time. Most basic screen protectors are inexpensive, come with a few in the box, and will save you when you realize exactly how often a person dings their watch against random surfaces.",
