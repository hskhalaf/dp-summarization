One thing I love is the fact that it fits my handlebars because they're pretty big and they give you two different sizes for handlebars. They also give you multiple sizes for your phone. It's not only great to get extra pieces but they're also sturdy as hell. And then there's the fact that you know that your phone is secure or not going to blow off the bike especially when our phones cost 800 to $1,200",

I continued to use it without the springs using the rubber holder to keep the phone secure. Eventually, the plastic slid off the rail and I just gave up on it. It was good while it lasted. The big X shaped rubber holder made me feel like it wasn't going anywhere. The roads where I live are terrible so bumps are a concern. I didn't want my phone to pop out.",

My unit was damaged in shipping (no one's fault in particular) and the company promptly sent a replacement.

      "text": "For my Yamaha FZ8, there is not enough space for this mount below the handlebar so I had to buy a nut and install it upside down on the bars. I imagine that means this will not fit most standard / naked motorcycles. Other than installation, the build seems to work well, it has been a few months and my phone has not dropped or even been close to dropping out of the mount. It comes with extra mesh holders in case one rips which is nice.",

Cheap and effective, the draw backs are if you are using headphones, the strap can get in the way, and the strap might be on your volume/power buttons, which means at highway speeds the phone wiggles a little bit, pushing the buttons. The last one isn't a huge issue, just something I noticed can happen. Overall, good product for the financially conscious, does exactly what you want with mild inconveniences.",

The only thing that seems odd, because it is so adjustable with the ball and socket - it is rather tall and the phone is maybe 2-3 inches above the bar it is mounted too. I would love to for it to be flush...but that is not how this one (or any I can find for a stem mount) are designed. It works great and is super adjustable to your bike.",
