Loaded 500lb bike with 200lb helper chasing it up the ramp, second ramp is a must, so thankfully this is a pair. Large bolts, solid welds, good build quality, excellent design. Lost a star because the straps it comes with are garbage. Why even include them? If you buy this, buy ratchet straps, and use those instead. Probably unsafe to use the included ones, as you can't tighten them enough to hold the ramps in place. Not the ramp's fault, but putting them in is less safe than just a big warning sticker that says \"strap me down\" or something.",

They appear to be sturdy and well built, They handled the combined weight of my ATV and me (roughly 850 lbs.) no problem. They are light and easy to handle, due to the arch they require a little more space for storage but no big deal. The additional length is great for trucks that sit a little higher. I didn't give them 5 stars because of the welds, they are adequate but complete welds at all joints would have earned 5 stars.",

If there was one way to improve them it would be to beef them up a little more so I can load my garden tractor (it weighs 1800 lbs which is above the 1500 lbs rating for these ramps) and maybe make them fold in three to provide for a smaller package. But even without these improvements, these ramps rock. Lighter than the ones made of steel, yet they will handle any ATV, motorcycle or garden machine up to 1500 lbs.",

The included adjustable safety straps offer secure loading, and the three rubber-coated 4\u201d mounting fingers on each ramp will prevent scratches on your truck bed or trailer.
