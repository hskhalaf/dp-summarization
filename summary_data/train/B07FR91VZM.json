( Bought DeMarini Sabotage - Too heavy of an end cap makes it swing like a drop 5)- Easton Ghost stung like crazy - Marucci Cat 7 barrel to big for new USA standards . Good luck out there",

We also considered the 2-1/2' barrel version that is a -13 but my son thought it was too light when he tried it. My 9 year old loves it as a replacement for his Easton. Very sold bat for the price. Plenty of power in it for kids in the intended age range.",
