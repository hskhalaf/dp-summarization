      "title": "Inferior to a SSD",
      "text": "Having used the 32GB module for a while and I have to say I'm not impressed. Because the cache is so small (27GB of usable cache) it fills up very quickly so the benefit of the cache is very limited, the OS frequently is slow to boot up. SSDs have tumbled in price making Optane an even less attractive option. I have just switched to a Crucial P1 500GB SSD and what a big improvement it is. For Optane to consistently boot up the OS and applications it would need to have a much bigger capacity but that would make it ridiculously expensive. It's far better to use a SSD so a can't recommend this product.",

If you put aside the firmware updates my motherboard needed beforehand and rebuilding my PC with a GTP partition I still found the intel software to be a pain. Even though it saw the hardware it wouldn't see it as a device which could boost the current hard drive. I see these as limited function now having set one up and replaced it recently with an M2 hhd which just flew from the start. Personally I would say save your money for a fast boot drive than faff with one of these.",
