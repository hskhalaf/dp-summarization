This one's description claims a \"richer bass\". My primary usage of this speaker is listening to audio books. The deeper voices sound like they have a very slight echo. I haven't tested their claim, of roughly doubling the battery time. It seems to have come at the expense of slightly larger size and weight (5 1/4\" .59 lbs versus 6 1/2\" .80 lbs). So this speaker will sit in a lesser used area of the house and I'll stay with the earlier version for my primary listening.",

As advertised, the sound clarity is among the best of the many portable Bluetooth speakers I have used. Only negative for me is volume. Being an old rocker, I desire loud or even louder, but NO device I have ran across provides thumping, ground shaking sound, which I suppose, is entwined into power consumption and of course, speaker longevity. That said, the Oontz systems are most superior to other similar products. Not 5 stars only because of volume issue.",

It's fine if you're indoors, but get out in the sun, and you cannot see whether it's on/off, or paired. Finally, the buttons - they're difficult to see (just raised patterns of black on black).

Long lasting battery life; above average volume and adequate lows but the speaker cannot stand side-by-side with other more costly brands such as the JBL Flip. If that\u2019s what you require (louder with more low end), I suggest paying a bit more and buy another product. However the OontZ Angle 3 will do the job for the cost. Overall, as I mentioned in my opening statement, this product is appropriately priced.",

I take in into the shower while showering, and set it on my counter while not showering. Product is water resistant, and is definitely wet after I shower. I keep it on a shelf, so it never receives a direct hit from the shower, but it is wet enough that I towel it off afterwards. Product is not meant to be fully submerged in water, but it definitely withstands the wetness from being on a shelf in my shower! Great sound whether used for music or podcasts. Highly recommend!",

I also like the included audio cable and jack for direct (non-Bluetooth) operation. An excellent product.",

I finally decided to upgrade after the charging port on the original speaker was having some issues. The reason I came back to this brand was how good the first speaker sound quality was, and this speaker even sounds better. Has a better quality of sound, more bass definition. The oiginal speaker battery would last for over 11 hours of continuous play time. I hope this new speaker will also hold up as well.",

So I think I let it play for probably 30ish hours (maybe more) on one charge at a lower volume. The sound is very clear, even at higher volumes. It doesn't get grainy or overly bassy.
