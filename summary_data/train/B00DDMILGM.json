My children have almost never had a diaper rash, and my youngest daughters physician was checking her out the last visit and commented that it was the cleanest looking diaper area she's ever seen. No redness, irritation, and my babies seem to like them. I also love that you can get these in the subscribe and save. It costs almost the same as Target, but the convenience factor is worth so much to me that I still prefer amazon if I plan ahead!",

Now we are only spending $24 per month for diapers! I've read some negative reviews about this product, so these may not work for everyone... but they worked for us. Maybe buy a small pack and see how they work for your baby before you invest in the big box.",

No more nighttime diapers! So with baby #3, it was a no brainier; we started out with Luvs. It's even better that we get even more savings by subscribing on Amazon.",
