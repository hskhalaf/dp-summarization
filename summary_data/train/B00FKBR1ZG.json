Cleaning the scrubber itself is easy because it can go in the dishwasher, I just drop it into the silverware basket before running a load and it comes out sparkling.",

This chain mail makes it so easy to scrape off all the stuck on gunk without scrubbing off the seasoning. Super easy to clean and after months of use it shows no signs of wear.

      "PATENTED XL 8X6 DESIGN FOR DURABILITY. We don\u2019t use just any chainmail. The Ringer uses premium grade never rusting stainless steel that is machine soldered, and built for strength. The machines that manufacture our patented product were originally intended to protect police officers from stab wounds. When life is on the line, you can\u2019t risk chinks in your armor. We bring that same strength to your kitchen sink and believe in quality that won\u2019t let you down",
      "MADE IN NORTH AMERICA. When you buy the Ringer, you aren\u2019t going to be left with some flimsy, hand-crimped chainmail made overseas which will pull apart and end up scratching your skillet with a rough ring edge. Most competing products are manufactured in China, leaving you with a low quality scraper. We searched worldwide to find the best quality around, and we found it here in North America. Simply put, The Ringer is set to last as long as your cast iron skillet",
      "TOUGH ON GRIT, GENTLE ON FLAVOR. Wash off the grit AND preserve the flavor with soap-less, detergent-free grit removal. You don\u2019t need to fear your seasoning being stripped off by harsh soap or cleaners. With The Ringer all you need is warm water and you\u2019re good to go. Let\u2019s keep your flavors in the family, not with the fishes. Works great in addition with cast iron seasoning or cast iron conditioner",
      "MULTI-USE SCRUBBER, DISHWASHER SAFE. Kitchen sponges are 200,000 times dirtier than a toilet seat with 10,000,000 bacteria per square inch. Gross, we know. Don\u2019t worry; this multi-purpose scrubber can be used for cast iron, glassware, stainless steel, a pizza stone, plates, baking sheets, a tea pot, cookie sheets, cauldrons, tortilla press, a hibachi, a waffle maker, a pie pan, a Dutch oven, griddle, woks, and casserole dishes. To clean, just throw it in the dishwasher",
