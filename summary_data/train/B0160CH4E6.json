The day of the party was a little chilly so we put them in the water table for the kids instead of water. I had used two jars which was too many for the water table but would have been great for the kiddie pool. They are definitely messy, slippery and crush underfoot but they don't stain and were easily swept up and off the deck. They have also rehydrated after it rained so we continued to play with them in the water table. Very cool.",

The only thing is that I thought the container was larger than the picture provided here but now that I look at it, it looks about right! You get a ton of beads in this little package and so far we have used just about 1/4th of the bottle just to play with. These beads last forever. At first I thought they would pop like a water bubble but they are gel. They are just really cool. So many things you can do with these. I'm going to use them as a \"fishing tank\" for my kid's birthday. Can't wait!",

The beads grow to a good size in a fairly short time (about marble-sized) and hold up well. Unlike some others I've seen, they seem to be fairly durable and don't break apart easily.
