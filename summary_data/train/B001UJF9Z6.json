Easy adjustments, clear, sharp, compact, waterproof Performance in low light is good. Easy to stow when not in use. I would proudly recommend these to anyone looking for a fairly priced set of quality, compact binoculars and already have.",

Not the best suited for hiking. So I was looking for something small and lighter but with decent optics. These are exactly what I was looking for. Excellent quality. Very sharp, crisp optics. Light and easy to pack. Quite simple to adjust. I realize that these are not top of the line Leupolds, but for the price I am extremely impressed. Just what I wanted. These are made in the Philippines \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\udded (Hell of a lot better than China \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3!) Highly recommend Thanks for reading",

      "text": "I was amazed to find some Leupold binocs for such a good price! I had a pair that I lost somehow, and it didn't break the bank to replace them. Quality is what you'd expect from Leupold, I have experience with their rifle scopes, and was not dissapointed in these binoculars. The vision is crystal clear, they are easy to focus, and convenient to carry. Small form and ergonomic shape make them comfortable to hold while viewing, and durable casing doesn't make me feel like I am handling a glass slipper. Obviously they aren't super high magnification, but for me that isn't a big problem. For the price, I doubt you will find anything better quality than these.",
