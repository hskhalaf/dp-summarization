A few noticeable changes from the SP-1: - the new design feature soft grip feelings on the side while maintaining a sleek look and better stand - quieter, faster printing - rechargeable battery - clearer film count and battery life - more contrasted prints The only downside I could think of for not getting this printer is if you enjoy the old-timey faded look of original polaroids. Since the SP-2 is a higher resolution printer, the images come out sharper and more contrasted -- which is not a characteristic of traditional polaroid photos.",

My kids love that they can snap photos on their phones and come back to print \"Polaroid\" photos. We have had no issues connecting to the printer. We've downloaded the app to our smartphones, and it has worked perfectly every time. Highly recommend!",

If you're a perfectionist, and hate wasting film or lugging the Instax Camera, get this! Best to adjust the contrast and saturation a bit to make the picture more visible, as it often makes pictures a but bright (idk how else to explain)",

The app definitely helps when you use automatic enhancer, to brighten the photo once it's printed, but even with the app, I find the photos to be dark and grainy; which is especially difficult with a picture so small. I bought this as a fun activity to do at a bachelorette party and bridal shower, so I thought this would be an ok option; but I honestly would have paid for a photo-booth rather than the DIY method I did with this printer.",

The film isn\u2019t the cheapest thing out there so I didn\u2019t want to risk throwing away print after print.

It increased a little more dynamic range, but the result would end up to be less saturated like SP-1. It gives a better skin tone, but lacks of punches for landscape. It's good addition for usb charging and rechargeable batteries. The building quality went down from SP-1 as well. It's taller, and narrower, also lighter, but it's built from even more plastic.",
