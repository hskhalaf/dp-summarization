In her case they've sat unangled on a keyboard tray. Her old one finally broke and we replaced with model 2. Which to our surprise is noticeably more ergonomic because it requires less force to click...probably due to the availability of additional gestures under the latest Mac OS's that differentiate pressure as well as number of fingertips. So a big win for those with hand/wrist/arm issues of the carpel and related varieties.",

Scrolling vertically or horizontally is a breeze - that's one of the best features. Highlighting or dragging takes two hands on the pad, one to click and hold, the other to drag, although i haven't tried experimenting with drag-lock yet. I'm learning to use the Trackpad left handed pretty quickly, which gives my right hand a nice break.",
