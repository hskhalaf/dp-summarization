When I play videos on social media, either the picture goes black or the audio stops working. The settings seem to have a mind of their own. I miss calls and sometimes folks say they called me but I never call back because not only does the ring go out intermittently but calls aren't showing up. This phone will slide if it is on an even floor. I just got this pos in April. I have to put up with this junk for 2 .5 more years. Stick with Samsung - it is superior in every way.",
