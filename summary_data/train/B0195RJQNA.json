We just tried the \"new\" G-Form guards that supposedly have the material that harden's upon impact. After a full 3 months of AYSO my son has asked to go back to Nike Mercurial, which he says are more comfortable to wear and give better protection. I do want to mention that I think the Nike sizing chart is off. My son is a small 10.5 yr old, weights about 74 pounds and is about 53\" or 54\". We had to return the small and we ordered a M and a L as he is in between. Thanks, D",
