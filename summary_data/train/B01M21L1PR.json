      "text": "I purchased these gloves as a 3rd wedding anniversary for my husband, as the traditional third wedding anniversary gift is leather. I purchased these in size 9.5 US standard Men's size with the cashmere knitted lining. My husband loved them and they fit him nicely. He was very satisfied at how warm they keep his hands with winter now here. They are very soft and pliable. The touchscreen texting ability of these gloves do work, it's just that is seems that he has to use the very tip/point of the glove to be able to use the ability. Think like using your fingernail to navigate a touchscreen.",

      "text": "I got the cashmere option and absolutely love the materials of these gloves! However there are two issues with these gloves: first the cuffs aren't tapered/tight, which leads to an air gap between the gloves and the wrists that can allow for cold air to enter the gloves. They should've made the cuffs with some elastic material that would make an air tight seal at the wrists. Secondly the finger slots for the index, pinky, and thumb are too long, which creates an empty flap at the end of the glove that reduces finger dexterity.",

I like them tighter for driving and mobility. Beautiful leather on these gloves. Don't know how warm they are until I try them out. I am looking forward to wearing them this winter. It would be difficult to find anything of similar quality for this price in the Chicagoland area. Thus, recommended!",

It was a bad call... I only lost one glove this round and when I put on the cashmere/wool vs the fleece there is a HANDS DOWN (no pun intended) winner in the fleece. It's much thicker, much softer, less itchy. Not to mention the fleece is at a lower price point. If you read this and are thinking about which one to buy. DO NOT think twice. You will be MUCH happier with the fleece. However, this is still a quality glove.",

I'm guessing what happened was when it was bulk-packaged and transported from the manufacturer, before being individually packaged, it was damaged by the packing/shipping materials. This was very upsetting and disappointing because I ordered and received this pair of gloves right before a ski trip (not for skiing, but just for the cold weather), so when I noticed that it was damaged upon arrival, I didn't have enough time to get a replacement before leaving on the trip. I ended up returning for a refund after my trip, and didn't have a decent pair of gloves on the trip.",

They are not the kind of gloves that are going to keep your hands warm on cold days. I wore mine on a 25F day and my fingers were cold after a few minutes. They do work well with cell phones using touch. Get the right size if this is important, as a tight fit is needed to have the touch work properly.",

As for warmth, these will not replace your winter gloves as it will only protect your hands from Fall weather. Winter cold will penetrate these gloves after 10-20 seconds. But if you're in the car and have a cold steering wheel, these gloves will provide good grip while not feeling cold. Probably the best use of these gloves.",

The lining being cashmere is barely noticeable and the leather is pretty nice for the price, but these are just $30 gloves. You get what you pay for. So for $30 they are pretty good. I think I would have given them 5 stars had I gone with the non cashmere lining and saved a few bucks.",

I bought these for sub-zero temperatures during winter, and they're worth every penny. They go well with my leather coat, and the touch screen finger tips actually work! I bought the ones with cashmere lined on the inside, and I love them. I used the scale that amazon provided, measured my hand with a sewing tape measure, and the gloves fit perfectly.

The cashmere lining is perfect for a driving glove In sub-zero temps, but I do feel like they run a bit big.

I measure out as a solid 9.5 and judging the way these fit and feel I am sure they will stretch over time. These are a GREAT glove, and I don\u2019t think you could find anything better under $150-200! Stop hesitating, and buy them!",
