We have traveled with them and reset them to work on the WiFi of where we are staying and come home to reset them and use them again. Bottom line is that they are easy to install, viewable from anywhere without an additional cost and have good video. Downside is that they don\u2019t rotate or scan, but the view angle is large enough it really isn\u2019t necessary.",

      "text": "I think they must have updated it (reading the 1-star reviews.) I have had no problems with the device or features. The device is amazing, it has every option one would need, LED lights, camera (day/night vision), speaker (to-way), magnet base to tilt the monitor, air quality, lullaby, snapshot, and motion/sound tracking with snapshot! The packaging was top notch, the unit is well made, the App is easy to use, and setup was done in 5-10 minutes. Disclaimer, at first there was some delays in loading, possibly due to the cloud service. However, I have had no issues other than \"unable to connect\" for like 1-5 minutes (closing and resting the app usually works.) Perfect device!",
