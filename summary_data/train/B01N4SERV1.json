The bag will fit the pump, a cooler and parts, but just barely. It is a tight squeeze and you basically have to take out everything at each pump and tetris them back in. Knowing what I know now, I would not have bought this bag.",

Perfectly fits my in-style pump (with hole for plug as a previous reviewer stated so you don't have to even get your pump dirty by taking it out!!!) and the medela cooler bag for 4 4 oz bottles.

I\u2019m able to fit the pump and tubing, 2 bottle assemblies with flanges, a hands free pump bra, the small Medela cooler, and 4 breast pads. There is not room for anything else, and that\u2019s ok.
