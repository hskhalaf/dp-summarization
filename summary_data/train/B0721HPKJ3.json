      "text": "I spent weeks deciding what projector to add to my low end home theater. It is not a high resolution projector, but once the movie starts on my 100\" screen, it draws me into the story, with the bright picture, and good color. I watched Avatar in 3d last weekend and the 3d picture was darker than on my tv, but the huge picture and effective 3d resolution more than made up for it. For the $225.00 i paid for it, I don't think I could have done better than this Benq.",

I had several text documents that were typed single spaced and digitized for the presentation. You could read them OK, but it was a bit fuzzy. If I had to do it all over again, I would have opted for the higher definition optics in the next higher level projector. Had I more time to prepare for the presentation, another option would have been to edit (re-type) the documents. I believe that would have helped in my situation, too.",

You can barely hear it when the volume is at max.",

They will cut you off before you have finished addressing concerns and disconnect the call if you match their tone. BIG MISTAKE trying a product from a no-name company.",

All my friends have been impressed by it. It's not the top of the line, but quality is so good, no one will ever know.
