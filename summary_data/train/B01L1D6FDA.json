My feet stay dry even if my shoes are soaked and water logged. I wasn't sure at first, so I decided to put on cotton socks under these socks and wear my tail running shoes into the shower. I then removed the shoes and stood in standing water in the shower. After, I removed these socks and my cotton socks were only a little moist, definitely not wet. I see how long their waterproofness lasts over time, and for how many wash cycles.",

I use these for launching my kayak, and then wear them while kayaking, without shoes (I have a pedal kayak.) The outer layer is wet, so I think the sensation I\u2019m feeling is that the air chills the outer lining, and so it seems as if my feet are damp - even though they\u2019re not. All in all, I am happy with my purchase, but other reviewers talked about having \u201ctoasty\u201d feet; not my experience; not cold, but a slight feeling of cool dampness.",
