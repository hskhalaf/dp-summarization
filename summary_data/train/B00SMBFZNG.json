First the lights would not turn off, but the units continued to work, now both of the units are dead even though the lights are still lit. I am contacting Vizio now to see if there is anything that can be done to rectify the situation. If they can, I will change my rating.",

It installed easily with the included wires, and after adding stilts to my television stand, it slides right under the TV.

In my case, the optical install quit working after about 15 minutes. Instead of getting in the weeds with trouble shooting that, I opted for the fall back RCA install. Works great. It was nice to have that option available with cables ready to go.",

The remote is easy to use, and all of my other remotes synced with the sound bar without me doing anything. The only issue that I've had over time is that dust collects on the speaker foam and it's really hard to clean.",

First, you do have to use the remote for this sound bar in order to get sound from your TV once it is hooked up (but as long as you are not a person who loses remotes, that should not be too big of an issue). Also, the cords they included with the product did not work with my TV. I had to purchase an HDMI cable, which is fine and was easy to hook up.",
