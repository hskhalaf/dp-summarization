The combination of the beard comb is... well... it's there. It's a cheap piece of wood with some grooves cut in it that does nothing your average comb wouldn't do. That said, the boar's hair brush is worth it for the price of the set. I'd buy it again, but the cost reflects the workmanship.",

The shedding was worse during the first week and then it slowed down. I had read other reviews where people complained about this and others that had no problems with excessive shedding. I ordered a second one several days ago and I'm going to see if it also sheds excessively. If it doesn't the first one is definitely going back before my 30 days are up. If it were not for the excessive shedding, I would definitely give this product FIVE STARS. The brush is great if you have a long or longish full beard.",

Comb feels kind of light and cheap compared to most beard combs I've purchased but it was not a big deal form me, it did the job but now the \"paint\" is chipping off of it already so I wouldn't recommend this one.",
