I have some good guesses but they appear to work inconsistently. I'm sure reading the manual would clear it up but I hate reading manuals. I always can figure out what things mean just by using them over time. But in this case I'm still somewhat puzzled. Bear in mind I've not gone out of my way to figure it out. I'm just saying I hate when it's not obvious.",

The controller can be knocked off, but they do stay in place. 3. Charges completely, quickly. Cons: 1. The lights. They're really bright. I won't have a lot of cords strung out to keep all of my controllers ready, and Nyko makes the best chargers available. I've tried several other brands and not been happy like I am with these. I pick up the charger when I get the console if it's available, or I wait impatiently for it to be released if it isn't available.",
