HOWEVER, the 2 sided tool that includes the electronic wipe DOES! It's like magic. I rubbed and rubbed at the screen with the microfiber cloth, but couldn't get it perfect on its own. But a couple light swipes of the tool on teh surface after I did the majority of the cleaning with the cloth got the screen looking like it came right out of the box at the Apple store.",
