If you want a portable grill I\u2019d suggest to keep looking. However the thing does look fancy AF",

Others have mentioned that the 1 lb. propane cylinders are sometimes difficult to screw on but we didn't experience that. Overall a very good purchase. This is the third one we have purchased but the first for ourselves. Others were gifts several years ago and they are still performing admirably.",

I am unable to lift the standard LP gas tank that comes with larger grills. The screw-in canister is GREAT! And, this grill is perfect for smaller decks and porches. I, also, purchased the cart & cover and am EXTREMELY happy with all three. The choice of colors makes for a fun grill and has been a topic of conversation for my guests who 'help' me while I grill. Who wouldn't want a purple, fuchsia or other fun color grill?! This isn't an inexpensive grill, but it is the BEST!",

Contents was not properly secured by cardboard packing. That aside, product was typical high-quality that I've come to expect from Weber. Ultimately returned product because I was looking for a grill with bars, vs a cast plate with openings. Also, box only contained only one grill plate although picture showed two plates. Hopefully the shipment wasn't missing one and I don't get challenged by Amazon for not returning everything.",

Next time, I would buy from Home Depot or another seller. Anyway, Weber is a fantastic company and they sent me a new starter. I installed it, and the grill works well. Recommend stand and cover. Also, I recommend using Weber brand products. The other stuff may be a little less expensive, but you'll be happy with the quality and fit of Weber accessories.",
