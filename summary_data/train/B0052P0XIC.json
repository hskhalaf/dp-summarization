I have been using this cleanser with the day lotion, night cream, and lip balm. I would absolutely recommend this brand.",

It does not strip your skin, and the milky consistency leaves your skin feeling soft but clean. I find it does not work well to remove makeup for me, but using it in the morning that's not a problem. It's also good for your second cleanse if you are using a heavier oil type cleanser to remove your makeup first.",

Rinse the towel and put it on the face (feels like the real spa) and the use a toner and moisturizer. Make sure you use only good-ingredients ones like Andalou products. My skin is clean now since I use this milk and no overdrying cleansing gels or foams. I also wear mineral powder foundation instead of pharmacy-brands.",
