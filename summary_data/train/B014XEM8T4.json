I was optimistic about the product when I first bought it, but now since I bought a real hot lather machine I would say do not buy this product. Save your money and spend a little more on the Campell Campbell's hot lather machine. It is hot instantly, thicker cream, and a longer extension cord. More classy looking too.",
