In the near future, DLSS and Ray tracing support will widen the performance gap.

I think the issue is with nVidia's chips. Plenty of videos by Gamers Nexus or Joker Productions on YouTube for more details on that. I knew it wasn't a value buy, but I should mention the price. nVidia has gone drunk with the sales they made during the bitcoin mining boom. The fact that folks still need to pay $800+ for the performance of a 2yr+ 1080 ti is absurd. With all those profits, you'd think they'd QA the product better...

      "text": "I bought this a few months ago for a personal computer build. I haven't had any problems with it at all. The three fans seem to keep it very cool even after running for extended periods of time. The LED's are also very nice although I wish there were more preset lighting effects in the software. This card is very big so make sure to have the measurements of your case correct. I am very pleased with this card and I don't think I have even tapped into its full potential yet.",
