Now I can't read them at all. Called customer service and agent said she never heard of this problem before and the only option was to have the unit replaced, However, I had to pay shipping. \"We don't pay for shipping at all.\" is the exact quote. It's not worth my trouble; the new unit will likely do the same thing. Time for my trusty Dymo labeler. Nice woman, but poor policy.",

The cord and wall plug were extremely hot - and I narrowly missed a fire/disaster. I'm returning the product to Amazon for a refund. Please note the dangerous consequences of that ill fitting door that other reviewers have mentioned. (There's no option other than to put one star here for a review, of course)",

Both sides of toast are beautifully browned to what setting you wish (I prefer 4 myself for my thick cut french bread I have most days) and the bagel setting is great for bagels because they get toasty on the top (cut side) and stay a little chewier on the bottom. I tried bagels on the toast setting and I preferred them on the bagel setting.",

It's taken me a while to learn how to make decent pizza. I now put the pizza stone in second from bottom rack and turn on broil (500 degrees) and heat the stone for close to an hour. I then make the pizza a parchment paper, put it in oven on top of parchment paper and 5 minutes into cooking I remove the paper and cook another 10 minutes (15 all told). Comes out very tasty. Have made banana bread many times, Italian cheese cake, and hamburgers. So far, so good.",

It does get very hot and cooks food quickly and, assuming it lasts, would be a good little oven for the price (presently @ $200) if only the door would shut.",
