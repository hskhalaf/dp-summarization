      "text": "I am really impressed. This is excellent, high-quality lavender. The scent is robust, and it's clearly potent. I had become accustomed to using another bottle (from a different brand) without diluting it at all. When I got a bug bite and decided to test this, I did the same: applied 1 drop directly to the bite. There was no burning or irritation. There was a fast reduction in the swelling and itching - but I also had to take a nap! I had forgotten how sedative lavender can be: a good reminder. It was a good nap, too ;-) Anyway, it's a great bottle of lavender, just remember: a little goes a LONG way!",

I was running out of my one bottle, so I decided to order the dual pack. When I opened the container, the smell was very rough and not at all what I was expecting. It did not smell anything like the first bottle I purchased. I went ahead and opened the second bottle that came in the pack of two, and I had the same result. A harsh smell that was nothing like Lavender was present. I hope this didn't happen to everyone purchasing this product.",

I also add a few drops to my laundry soap dispenser to make our clothes smell extra fresh. This is a very large bottle that should last me a long time.

The write up of this latest order says it's a blend of Bulgarian and French Lavender",

It seems diluted, not full 100% essential oil, it's almost as if it's already mixed with water. I'm very disappointed in this product. Original review...... I'm not thrilled with this oil. The scent is just not what I was looking for. Bummer. I was going for the price.",

Believe it or not this essential oil isn't too \" oily\"a few drops does the trick without leaving any heavy residue A few days after we receive this, I received an email from the seller with a PDF attachment of additional benefits and tricks for lavender will use... Quite a nice touch. I would definitely buy this product again from the seller",

I am used to YL EO quality and thought I could save some $ by diffusing cheaper brands, BUT this EO does not smell like 100% pure lavender essential oil. There seems to be a very strong \"chemical\" undertone. It kinda reminds me of lavender scented cleaning agent or laundry detergent. It is too much of a hassle to return it however, so I will be using this for my laundry or adding it to my cleaning agents. I have used doterra, young living, now and aura cacia EOs and so far they have smelled the most pure.",

My dogs do not itch either. Occasionally I fine mist the back half of their bodies and whatever itch was there is gone as well. Can't believe how well it works.
