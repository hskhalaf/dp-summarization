So if you are a taller person I would recommend something taller. By no means is this the manufacturer's fault. Entirely on the buyer. I like the feature of the zipper pouch in the back to store the chairs storage bag. The cooler bag is more like a beer pouch. I used it to hold my phone. All in all this is a great chair.",

But if you want to sit back and take a nap, there is no head or upper shoulder support at all, and you cannot 'sink down' into the chair to lean your shoulders back because then your legs are uncomfortable. If you need a solid, strong, collapsible chair for sitting up in - this is great. If you need something to sit back and relax in by the camp fire (as I did) - this is a bit too rigid and 'formed'.",

As far as comfort, it\u2019s about as expected. It would be nice to have more cushioning, but that would make it difficult to collapse. So, I just use a pillow. But overall, this is the second chair I\u2019ve bought by this company and this one is an upgrade from the previous chair. I would definitely recommend for short term uses. Not for hours on end.",
