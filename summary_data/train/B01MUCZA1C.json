      "text": "I confirm reviewer Chris Bunting's findings... the new 2nd Gen dimmers with QuickFit are flawed. Using them with a dimmable Feit 850lumen (Costco purchased) LED recessed light setup (5 ttl lights), the lights flicker at high speeds (almost have to stare off angle from the lights to see it clearly), the switch itself has a noticeable high speed clicking (not the typical quieter buzz of gen 1), and most importantly, the dimmer function does not work for these lights. (I replaced a non smart wave dimmer, so I know it is not the lights themselves.) I highly recommend reading Chris's review. And DO NOT BUY Gen 2! I have like 16 of the Gen 1 and they are all great.",

Three different bulbs seem to be compatible with other manufactures dimmer, but not this one... Swapped out to Lutron dimmers and they are fine now. So if you want flashing lights for your Discotheque, these may be the perfect fit for you. If you want them in your office or den, better look elsewhere.",

      "text": "This newest revision of the GE Z-wave dimmer by Jasco has been well improved. There is now a jumper for the ground wire to make daisy-chaining multiple switches even easier. The switch housing itself is smaller allowing more room behind to fit the bundle of wires into the electrical box, and there are no break-away tabs like on the previous generations. The auto-detection of Line/Load seems gimmicky and hopefully does not lead to any issues down the line. I used this switch with an older gen fan control, so I had to be certain of which side was hot. Quick to detect in Smartthings and works as great as they always do.",

The wiring was never complicated but is easier now with line/load interchangeable leads just in case you didn't know or care which was which - the switch autosenses and does the rest. Of course a neutral (and ground) are still needed as there is actual circuitry in this device. Pairing with a smartthings network was easy and straightforward.",

These switches fit kinda and the boxes kinda work *sometimes*, it's a tight fit. I had to replace at least one of the boxes to the newer 4 inch deep box to accommodate 2 or more switches in the box.
