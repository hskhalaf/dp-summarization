I'd at least be able to play until my cons needed charging, and then I would have to have someone else handy who could put them on the console to charge, and then be there to take them off. I needed a charger within my reach, and this one filled that void successfully. And, it charging four at a time made it a win/win. It's built solid and sturdy, and the top-mounted charge lights are easy to see from where I am. I should've bought this when I first bought the system.",

There is going to be a level of resistance. It does get better with time (the more you insert and remove them) as seen on the right. The one on the left I bought for my bestfriend, and was testing out before giving it to him and I can say that they have the same experience in terms of insertion and removal. So that is something to keep in mind.",

They are seriously bright. One of the charger channels is tighter than the others, but since I'm not sure if its the charger or the controller its not a serious gripe.
