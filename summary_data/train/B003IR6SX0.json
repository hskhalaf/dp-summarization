      "text": "My son broke the glass bowl on his Huntington fan awhile ago. I found a bunch of light fixture type kits but dragged my feet on buying one because I was scared it wasn\u2019t going to fit our specific fan. Boy, was I wrong! This kit comes with SO many parts and colors of covers and finials, I have trouble imagining a Huntington fan it wouldn\u2019t work with! I should\u2019ve bought it awhile ago. It took me 10 minutes total to sort through the pieces and figure out what I needed... although to be fair, we were just missing a bowl and the two last pieces. Either way, highly recommend!",

Took about an hour to install first one and about 30 minutes each for the next two. They made the old plain fans look great and added lots of needed overhead light to the room. Highly recommend!",
