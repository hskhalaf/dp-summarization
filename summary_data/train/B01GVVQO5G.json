The stool allows my legs to be in many different positions, unlike an office chair, which offers only one or two positions for my legs to extend. It swivels and never falls over and has a most comfortable cushion seat to sit on. Yes, it's a little pricey but comfort has a price. It is well worth it.",

The seat is a shock system so with it extended at all you can sorta bounce up and down like a pogo stick. That's not a bad thing as it's probably more comfortable with it moving a little like that.

If the base was heavier and flat against the floor, and the shaft moved from within/inside the base/anchor instead of a rounded, rocking base, it would be much more effective.
