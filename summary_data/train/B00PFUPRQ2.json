That said, the band is a serious issue, as it's velcro and wears out far too quickly if you need to take this brace off multiple times each day. That said, there *are* alternatives to the velcro band, so I suggest that you get a replacement (one of which I've linked to below and included a video demonstration of), cut off the included band and put on the replacement so you don't have to worry about the band wearing out.",

Bottom line... this is what you're looking for. After 10min you won't even feel it. No one asks about it or notices it and I wear all the time. It comes with this sticky tiny pad, that you place on the inside of the hard L shape plastic; makes it very comfortable. I'm still not sure how the hell it works but it does. I no longer have wrist pain and I'm programming upwards of 15 hours a day.",

I have purchased two other braces for the half the price and found them to be more comfortable and effective. While this did provide *some* pain relieve, it was very uncomfortable and frankly, didn't seem worth $25 as it's nothing but a velcro strap with a plastic L-shaped type piece that is designed to support the wrist. I expected something more substantial for the price. I wouldn't recommend the product due to the lack of comfort, the price, and the minor pain relieve. The traditional carpel tunnel braces for half the price are far better and more comfortable.",

I wake up in the middle of the night from either slight shooting pains or numbness and so far I havent had any recurrence since I bought this. I had a minor problem and contacted the seller and they fixed it right away. I am so impressed with everything. I will definitely buy more and RECOMMEND this to anyone who is thinking about purchasing this. For some reason this works!!!",

I use it at work to help my stupid wrist and I find that my hand strength is there when I need it to be. I've slept in it, and wake up to a hand that isn't as numb as it used to be. Even got a friend one and she loves it too. To jazz it up some I put a Star Wars sticker on it, cause I am an adult.",

Also the logic of how it works is, at least to me, is questionable. I am not a doctor however. I would say ask yours or take a chance. I gave it 2 stars because it may work for some with larger or fatter wrists.",

    "title": "M BRACE RCA Carpal Tunnel Wrist Pain Relief (Regular, Black)",
    "description": "\u200b\u200bThe M BRACE RCA is simple: it provides a functional approach to wrist-related problems by supporting the normal structure of the wrist, allowing the body to heal itself. The device has been reduced to a brace that supports the carpal tunnel without debilitating constriction and immobilization. This ultra-lightweight brace (less than half an ounce) allows for normal user activity to continue without the burden of pain. This means healing actually takes place even while the user continues to engage in the work or leisure activities that may have brought about Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) symptoms in the first place. The M BRACE RCA maintains the normal U-shape of the carpal tunnel without compressing it, so that median nerve irritation is minimized and healing may commence. By allowing expansion and retraction without interference, the resultant contact between the median nerve and the carpal tunnel wall is effectively ended. The device allows for full flexibility of the wrist, promoting rehabilitation of the soft tissue structure within from passive use. The brace is also effective in preventing structural fatigue which may result in CTS. The M BRACE RCA is manufactured utilizing top-quality materials. The carpal tunnel brace itself measures a mere 1-1/4 inches by 3 inches while the ultrasonically attached VELCRO-brand heavy duty strap is one-inch wide and comprised of double-layer \"skin friendly\" folded-loop material. Two optional Latex-Free adhesive foam pads in your choice of 1/8\" and 1/4\" thicknesses are included inside the product box along with an illustrated Important User Information sheet. The bottom line? This innovative yet simple device is a comfortable as well as effective therapeutic and preventive solution in the treatment of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome!",
