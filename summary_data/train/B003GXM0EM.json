      "text": "Since purchasing this machine we have made around 10 loaves of bread with it, 2 jams and the filling of a berry pie. the results when following the recipes are great with the exception of the orange marmalade, I think it requires way too little pectin, marmalade was runny. Added another couple of tablespoons and ran it through the jam cycle again, much better. The recipe is great though, I had home made marmalade on home made toast this morning. Sublime! After a few uses machine starts to fail. This is now on our second unit. Very dissatisfied. Review has gone from 5* to 1. I would now no longer recommend this product",

      "text": "This machine works, but there is a serious issue with it. Even though this is an actively sold/current product, the product manufacturer (Oster) is not producing replacement parts for it. A critical part, the bread pan, is impossible to replace. Go look at Oster's website to see the write-ups on this. Oster refers pan requests to their customer support 800 line. After you call in there, you'll be informed there are no replacement pans. Net, this breadmaker becomes a piece of trash the moment that pan becomes non-functional. That does happen. To Amazon Vendor Mgt organization - You have a vendor that is knowingly and willfully creating unnecessary e-waste. What are you going to do about it?",

When it switches you over to talk to a representative, it says \"due to a high call volume, we cannot talk to you at this time\" and hangs up. No other options offered. Over and over and over again. They clearly do not want to provide any support. Therefore, it only gets one star. I definitely would not recommend this product.",

There is a fault in the design however and that is a divot at the top of the dough hook where liquid gets in. This also seeps down into the channel where the shaft that turns the dough hook connects to the rest of the maker. Dough ingredients seep in and sometimes pick up grime and seep back out into the dough. This part is difficult to clean and any residue gets disgusting and smells really foul. We love the pizza dough but after three or four years we are going to try a different machine.",

It may be better for those recipes. So far my best loaf came from a King Arthur Flour recipe for whole wheat machine bread, with regular, not white, whole wheat flour.

I've been particularly impressed by how sturdy it is -- it fell on the floor once, and the lid detached seamlessly and was reattached seamlessly. I've been using King Arthur's dark flour recipe (replacing parts of the flour with steel cut oats and cut almonds, adding some dried cranberries, and using honey instead of sugar), and the bread is absolutely delicious -- I eat the crispy ends right away no matter how hungry I am.",

The bread maker also gives you the estimates the time for the bread to be ready.

It's a pain, but it makes such good bread most of the time that aside from the odd deflated look to the loaf, it's worth the money. Might not buy it again, but if you want a basic, affordable maker and are willing to deal with the issues, it's fine.",
