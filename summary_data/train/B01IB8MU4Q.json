But size 101\u20442W fit spot on, they seem waterproof, and unless you're tromping through deep snow, they're high enough to keep the wet stuff out. They are not insulated, which makes them winterized only in temperate climates. Timberland supplies their standard, rock-hard insoles, which, thankfully, are removable. I suggest finding a better, more comfort oriented pair of insoles, which seems to be my blanket recommendation for all Timberland footwear. Still, I found these boots well-suited for daily wear in the winter, even if they would not be my fist choice for back country gear.",

The waterproof quality just topped it off. And they look really great!",

As far as fit, I go a half size larger to make room for heavy socks, otherwise they fit perfectly and will not leave room for thicker socks, especially in the winter.
