Just pull the elastic on the bottom however high you want on the calf and pull the excess fabric down to the preferred length! My only complaint is the button on the top is very noticeable.

      "text": "Really wanted to love this as I am breastfeeding and this jumpsuit looks like it was made for it! It is cute. The fit is a little funky, I am more pear shaped with larger hips/butt, but even with my larger breastfeeding boobs, the top was loose and sort of frumpy. Unable to keep my bra covered. I still found a way to make this work, with safety pins because I liked it so much, but after only 4 months of owning (and truthfully, only wearing this maybe 5 times total, the snap keeping the top together broke. Wouldn't purchase again.",

I ordered the short-sleeved jumpsuit in navy. It's very low cut and grapes; I'm short-waisted and busty, so a cami or bralette over a real bra is a must. But, it's surprisingly flattering and can be dressed up a little or down. The material is a little heavy, not quite a light jersey knit, but still really stretchy. Will be buying another is green - just trying to decide on Med or Small!",

My only concern is that there is a small button across the chest that keeps the two sides together. It's held by a small elastic clasp and I am worried that might break off. Otherwise I would have given this outfit 5 stars. I think if you have to go to the bathroom in a hurry you might have a hard time getting that tiny elastic off the tiny button fast enough.",
