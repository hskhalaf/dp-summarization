The rubber flap did have a good texture and provided enough grip but once tight the strap felt like 60 grit sandpaper, very unpleasant experience. Perhaps it's just the fit and finish of the unit i received.",

After seeing the reviews (and price difference), I decided to give these Cobra Grips a try. As you can see by the picture, there is more padding, which makes heavy deadlifts more comfortable. The padding also provides greater wrist support on pressing movements. The Rubber Grip Cobra piece also covers more surface area and secured the grips better than the versa on heavy pulling movements. Assuming they hold up as long, I find the Cobra Grips superior to the Versa Grips in every way.",

A man in the gym even asked me where I bought them. At first, I felt a little embarrassed to be using them for such small weights. However, if I can pay a reasonable amount of money to avoid injury and possibly very high doctor bills, then it's totally worthwhile. Everyone has his/her own starting point.",

I let the weight rest on the grips, this transfers it to my wrists instead of my fingers/grip. It did help a lot. But, I think I will stick to alternating grip without wraps.

I lift recreationally, (I'm a 5' 1\" female and ordered the Fit size), so I'm not worried about forearms, etc, but I went up 15lbs in Sumos and RDLs (5x5s) with these suckers on.

      "text": "The Cobra lifting straps are built like a beast. Very thick leather, stitching is solid and the wrist wrapping part is secure, comfortable (way more comfortable than many others) and rigid enough for support, but not so much that they did into your wrists. The only issue I have found is they need to be about 1/2-1\" longer in the bar wrap \"cobra\" head. They don't completely wrap around the bar, which makes lifting very heavy weights a little tricky. It's even worse on thick or padded bars. I would still purchase them again and highly recommend them, but just note that one deficit in design.",

I was worried that leather wouldn't be as grippy but it's been great! The leather \"tongue\" definitely feels better and more pliable than rubber. One other thing I like about Cobras is that they come in one size, as opposed to Versas that you had to measure and get your sizing right. We'll see how durable Cobras are.",

I feel like this protects and cushions the wrist when you strap these tight. The other ones didn't have it and it ended up pinching my wrists. The second reason is that the strap flares wide at the top. This gives me more surface to wrap against the bar. The competitors didn't do this, and it wasn't as easy/comfortable when using.",

Very nice and versatile gear to have for the gym. You won't be disappointed in having them. Many more uses than what I use them for.

The grip is longer and the texture is smother so the grips don't hold the bar as well as we had hoped. They have good padding around the wrist area and these might work best for larger hands/ thicker bars. Ultimately, they don't compare to Versas. :(",
