I never post reviews on Amazon, but some of you people need to get a grip. If you are a normal person, that works hard for your money.... buy these glasses. You will not find glasses like these at W*lmart at any price..Fact!",

Perfect for putting in the freezer for cold beverages or just as a nice weighted glass. Feels very durable and just like most restaurant quality Pub glasses. These are truly 16 oz. glasses.",
