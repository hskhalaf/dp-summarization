Hair clings to it and doesn\u2019t escape the fabric. The anchors will rip if you adjust the cover after those are in place (FYI). Truly this cover can be reversed if you had a really muddy or dirty situation you wanted contained. The straps and connections leave plenty of room to fit just about any truck style bench seat. Cut outs for seat belts are a plus too! See pictures for further reference.",

I did not achieve a good enough fit in my 2013 BMW 328i. My main goal is to protect my car seats from 2 toddlers climbing in and out, and kicking the seat, and I didn't feel like it covered enough on both sides to protect the seat as the kids are climbing in/out.
