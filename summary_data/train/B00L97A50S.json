I am attaching a couple of photos to show the color we received since other people are commenting on it. Although the color isn't white as it appears in the product photo, it is a pretty shade of light tan linen.",

We use our bench in our carpeted bedroom and didn't want the casters digging into the carpet, possibly developing holes and tears due to the tiny surface area of contact that each metal caster makes with the ground. Without the casters, there is much more surface area to spread out the weight.",
