My daughter doesn\u2019t want to use it because of the odor. No minty smell. And it leaves your skin itching. Definitely not the same formula. So disappointing because it was so awesome",

A fair warning though, when you put it on near your temples, the menthol or something from the essential oils can irritate your eyes a little. I don't recommend applying right before driving. Wait a few minutes to get your eyes used to it. It'd like is you were to get up close and personal with some Vicks. Your eyes can water. It doesn't hurt or anything. The smell is also pretty pleasant. I will update further for more troublesome headaches as I bought this for my husband with headaches that don't respond to medication.",

Have tried so many things to help them, and when I saw this, I thought I\u2019d try it too, although I was a bit reluctant since I don\u2019t really believe that essential oils can help. But, I decided what the heck. Anyway, this stuff doesn\u2019t work on migraines. It might work on minor headaches, but definitely not on migraines. It literally just made my head greased up with essential oils. And it made me smell good. I don\u2019t recommend.",

I often find that cold is a trigger for me (cold air from the a/c in the car, wind blowing, cold shower on a hot day, etc.), and this leaves a cooling sensation on the skin. Maybe it was my imagination, but one time was enough for me to throw it in the trash. Oh, and the smell is VERY strong. If you're triggered my scents, stay away from this. The scent was for sure a factor in worsening my migraine.",

It sounds like it works for others but for anyone who already uses oil directly in their temples/forehead/neck, this does not provide the same affects.",

This will take away the nausea and the throbbing, but you do still feel out of sorts. Better than the full migraine though, so go for it!",
