This is very disappointing considering Amazon is usually very attentive to their customers. Will happily change my review to reflect the fixed product once a solution is found.",

I love the font options and ability to connect to Goodreads, and since it's the same size as my old one, I was able to pop it straight into the cover case I already owned. Winning!

It occurred to me at that moment that the Kindle had 'disappeared' and allowed me to immerse myself in the book so fully that I felt as if I were living inside the story rather than reading text on a screen. That is the defining mark of a good e-reader. Thank you, Amazon, you've made a new friend.",

Since I got mine, I've ordered 2 more, one for my husband and one for my son. They love theirs as well. It's a great product!",

You can adjust text size to fit you comfort level and you can read in beautiful bright beach sunlight or just as easily in the comfort of your darkened room. There is nothing more beautiful than having thousands of books in a cargo pocket easily accessible. It weighs about the same as my cell phone.",

      "text": "High quality reader. Unfortunately it has a big problem for me: IT CANNOT DOWNLOAD E-BOOKS FROM MY LIBRARY ! Most library systems nowadays, including the one I belong to, require the installation of an App in order to download E-books. Kindle E-reader does not support any App. Therefore I decided to install the library App on my iPad and iPhone and returned the E-reader. My recommendation: if your library system supports multiple libraries -- mine includes over 80 libraries -- chances are there will be a lot of electronic books to your liking for you to borrow for free when you use a smart phone or a tablet. Otherwise Kindle E-reader is a fine choice.",

      "title": "VERY FRUSTRATING!",
      "text": "I have had a kindle paperwhite for a while; haven't used it much, preferring books to digital text; but it's easier to carry so I decided to try again to overcome the frustration of not being able to remove Samples, for instance, of difficulty with knowing where I am in the text, etc. Today, I tried to register it, as I have the app on my iPhone. That was simple; it was impossible on the Kindle, using the Amazon account address and password. ...If ever there is an update to the Paperwhite with a good keyboard, I'll try again, especially if there is a simple way of removing samples, already read or not wanted.",

      "text": "I read more now that I can carry a large collection of my books with me. This is small, light and compact. It doesn\u2019t give off a glare and it\u2019s easy on my eyes. I love and use mine so much, I purchased one for my 12-year-old. We check out books from the library for her and she is pleased. I feel so happy when I see her reading her Kindle. It is very convenient. Great purchase.",

      "text": "I decided i wanted to buy my first kindle hoping it would get me reading more and I couldn't be happier. I was deciding between this model and the newest 2018 paperwhite. After doing some research and comparisons I decided I would prefer some of the features on this model more (specifically the black kindle logo and the indented screen!) I was pleased to see under buying options I could get a Used version of the device for only $81. When it came it looked brand new and has been working perfectly! So pleased with my purchase! It's so easy to read on and you don't have to put stress on your hand by holding open a stiff paperback",
