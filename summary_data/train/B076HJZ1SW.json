I hate paying $$$ for Nike or UA products but in the past those are the only ones that fit properly, especially when it comes to compression gear. I am glad I found these. I purchased the bright yellow/green since I do a lot of running early in the morning and wanted some added visibility. For reference, I am about 5' 6\" with 32 waist and purchased a M and they fit great, just a little long but I am used to that with my height. Hope that helps!",

Not sure about the compression capabilities so if that is your main concern you may want to get a more expensive brand. These are best for extra coverage against the elements or aesthetics if you want to compliment your outfit or not show too much skin in public.",

Further, being so thin, I find they aren't particularly supportive. and they're not good for exercising outdoors for temperatures below 50\u00b0F if there is any wind at all. Nevertheless, these sport tights are pretty cheap, especially if you a 3-pack. And they do make a decent base-layer to wear under your regular pants in the middle of winter.",

I simply fold band over once, everything stays in place. I preferred this brand to the four others ive tried... this is the one I reordered. ps, the grey is a lot lighter shade than others, almost a silver as apposed to a charcoal or heather grey. probably lighter than I would prefer, but I still wear them.",
