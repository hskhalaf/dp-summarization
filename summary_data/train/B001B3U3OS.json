You can run over them (which happens a lot) and the ball can run over them and they last! its perfect for making obstacle courses for the kids to dribble the ball around and they are highly visible. I will never go back to the standard tall cones after using these! I did not buy a strap for them however I did grab an old belt that I use to keep them organized and together!",

These disc cones are large enough that the numbers I wrote were easily visible, they can't be knocked over, and they sit so low to the ground that they do not blow around. Very pleased with them.",
