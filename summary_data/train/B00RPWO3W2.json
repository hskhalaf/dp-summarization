      "text": "The 8 outlet surge protector is amazing. It also has 2 USB charging ports which makes this surge protector the best option if you have multiple devices and products that need charging. The outlet plug is flat which means that it can be plugged in behind a dresser or cabinet and will sit just a few centimeters off the wall. The surge protector has handled multiple devices plus high voltage products all at the same time and has never tripped power. I am pleased with this bestek product and am a previous owner of two of their other surge protectors as well.",

But still spacing is wider than most I have tried and it seems possible to use all eight AC outlets if I needed to. We\u2019ll see how this works out overtime, but after several weeks of use so far, I\u2019m satisfied.",

I thought it might be nice to be able to charge more than two things at one time, especially since some of the chargers come with large irregularly shaped heads. This strip allows for all kinds of plugs, and it has changed our charging station into a very efficient \"Grand Central Station\" of power cords. The six foot cord length is nice but unnecessary for our situation. Comes with a velcro strip to bind the excess up, which is a nice added feature. A well-thought-out product. Very happy with this buy.",

The gazebo is fed with a dedicated 20-amp circuit with GFCI. Several days ago the GFCI started tripping. When reset, it would trip again in maybe 10 seconds or so; sometimes less. Troubleshooting conclusively showed that the Bestek power strip was the culprit. I tried the power strip on another GFCI circuit with the same result. I have used other surge protector power strips in the gazebo for years without issue. I wanted the Bestek one for the USB ports to tidy up the separate USB chargers plugged into my original power strip.",

Tried multiple cables and all the ports to rule that out as the issue. Cables all work with a known QC charger on my phone and while it charges from the USB ports on the power switch, it definitely is not quick charging. A bit annoying. Hopefully I don\u2019t have the other issues that people seem to be reporting also. I hAd good hopes given the rating and number of reviews, but find myself disappointed.",

Got this because we have a charging center and the wall outlet wasn't enough and the power strip was only helping a little. Now we can plug a USB cord in directly and have enough AC outlets to spare. Cord a little long as our wall outlet is next to the power strip and the cord is heavier so it does get in the way. The supplied cord tie helps to keep the cord contained. It does what we need and that's whats important, right?",

I placed one on my dining table where kids do homework and can also charge their phones which they used charge on their laptops. Now all the cords stay off the floor and the dogs cannot reach them. The area stays tidy and we are no longer searching for charge blocks since you can plug directly in. I like the surge protector as an added feature.",

I am able to plug adapters (cube shaped) into this surge protector without having any difficulties with trying to make space for other cables. All the HDMI charging ports work wonderful. I have a double monitor setup, Alienware Aurora (gaming PC), PS 4 and a 2018 Mac mini receiving power from this outlet. I am not experiencing any delays, shortage of power or any form of obstruction. Overall, this is an amazing product.",

There's two high power ports, one low power port, and one \"auto\" port. From my experience that allows you to charge one modern phone and two low-power devices, leaving the low power port empty. In my case this comfortably charges an HTC One M9, an old model Chromecast, and my bedside clock which for some reason is USB.",
