So if you are an audiophile and love to hear things how they were meant to be heard in incredibly clear detail, these are your headphones. If you are a bashed that likes to crank your bass, there are many other cheaper alternatives out there, as heavy bass is what these were built for.",

But something was lacking in that I found myself not listening to music at the coffee shop, which had been a strong, regular practice with Bose over the ear noise canceling phones. For me these Shure buds maintain losing the bulk and weight of over the ear phones; and, if memory serves also add a deeper delight in the music, so back to the smiling.",
