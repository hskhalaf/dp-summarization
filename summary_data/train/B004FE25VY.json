Even the picture on the box shows the pad with the measurements and only shows the pad section at 6' 10\" it does not include the overhanging part with a small pocket which hangs over the front. The actual pad is only 78\" long. They need to fix the product or change the description to indicate the actual length. When buying online you rely on the descriptions to be accurate. I will request that they send me another one that is the proper size.",
