She just informed me it's been falling apart, coming apart at the bottom, all the dowels coming loose in one corner since then and it is now June! This made it so when her Dalmatian inside the cage moved around, the leg would fall off and the dog could reach through and try to get nearby items with her paw. Very poorly made in my opinion. Pros: Large, looks nice while it's together. Works as intended as long as it states together. Cons: Falls apart after short amount of them. Causes legs to fall off just from dog moving around.",

We decided to just use the cage without all the thin woodwork that obscures the dog's view. He is very pleased with the large cage and new Kong mattress I put in it. So it has value but not so much as originally designed, in my view. The wires in this cage seem a bit under sized so there is a frailness to it and the doors are not well aligned with the locking mechanism so they can be difficult to open and close. I do not recommend this product.",

We don't hear from her until 7a.m. everyone we know have dogs, and all agree this is a beauty.",

The top piece was broken on two corners, and one corner piece was split in half when we got it. I complained but to no avail.

The front panel that removes so you can take the tray out NEVER stays on... it has just 3 or 4 magnets and they are not strong enough to handle movement by the dog. Also, the wire crate itself is not sturdy, and the wooden part comes in pieces: corner pieces, bottom, and top, so they tend to move around as well. I would purchase it again because it is half the price of others, but wish the measurements and description were better.",
