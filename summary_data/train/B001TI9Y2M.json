Cons: Other than viewing things really close up you can't really see anything. You can't expand out far enough to get a clear view of planets, stars, astroids, or comets (which we had passing us in 2 locations this summer). I was able to view things better with our binoculars than with this telescope. Totally bummed.",

I loved the added feature of the free app that you can download to know when certain meteor showers or constellations will be visible. I highly recommend this product!",

We tried to set it up, but the screw part that connects the telescope to the tripod is not a threaded part. So apparently someone put the wrong part in the base or the part wasn't threaded in manufacturing. Will update when we try it out.",
