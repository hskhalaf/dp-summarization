This one was extremely lightweight-to the point that it sank right through to the surface you'd placed it on as soon as any weight whatsoever was placed upon it. After ONE night of gentle ordinary use, the topper tore in numerous places simply from the act of us trying to roll it up for storage for the day. I am extremely disappointed and would strongly discourage anyone from purchasing this product!",

Softens up the ultra firm mattress perfectly, and we are noticing a better night's sleep immediately. Seems to be of high quality, although it has no cover.

It was a very firm mattress to begin with, sometimes causing my thigh to go to sleep. I sleep on my side. It seems like a quality product, but it did not help my back problem at all. Also, I did not feel as if it offered any cooling versus the mattress alone. I used it with the same high quality mattress pad that I have been using with the mattress alone.",
