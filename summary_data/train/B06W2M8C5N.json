      "text": "LOVE LOVE this stroller! It lives up to it's \"agile\" name. So easy to maneuver, even with 1 finger. Works great for our 11 mos old and even our tall 3.5 year old has used it at times too and still fits inside just fine. The 1 hand closure is simply MAGIC and it takes almost no room in the trunk! The canopy is nice and large and it even has a big peekaboo window. We added a universal parent console with 2 soft insulated cup holders and some pockets, which added the only missing detail. I can't imagine a more perfect stroller for 6mos to 4 year olds, and the price is great too!",

The only things I like better in City Mini are the harness buckle and tires. The buckle on the Britax is hard to fasten and gets stuck easily.

      "text": "This is a very nice three-wheeled stroller. There is a little assembly required, but it's essentially just putting the wheels, the canopy and the car seat attachments onto the stroller body. It arrives in a very large box and assembly only takes about 5-10 minutes. I'm no expert in strollers, but this seems to be built very well. The wheels spin nicely and turning it is very smooth\u200b. The canopy folds down easily and the handle foam is very soft. I love how much storage is included beneath the buggy. It's easy to collapse and fold away when you need to store it and easy to transport when you need to go somewhere.",
