We don\u2019t have a bathtub but a very large sink and it fits well, however I have to add a TON of water to get the basin filled enough to be high enough to cover baby\u2019s body. For my purposes it might have been more water wise to buy a standard sling type baby bath. If you plan on filling a whole tub anyway this might be nice until baby is sitting up on their own. Also, baby would startle the first month or so because he didn\u2019t feel super secure, so he would throw his arms out like he was falling. Washcloth on his chest helped with that.",

I also had to hold my baby\u2019s head so that she does not slide. She alway did not look comfortable. This Angelcare baby bath solved my problem! I can directly put this in the bath tub. I don\u2019t need to hold my baby\u2019s head. She can sit in there and chill. It is very comfortable for baby and me!!!",

She's not sitting up consistently on her own so I tried a different mesh bath tub support that was basically useless. My girl is SUCH a wiggle worm that she would slide right off of it. This product makes a huge difference with the little support in the crotch area that my girl can kick and flop and go crazy and rarely has any issues. I think she's maybe partially slid over it once which can be expected as they get older with better control of their bodies. Glad I caught this on a sale!",

I\u2019m on the floor with this teeny little life laying in this tub looking up at me and holy cow is she slippery and the tub in slippery and I\u2019m on my knees worrying about dropping her... so soon I\u2019m giving this tub to a friend who thinks she\u2019ll like it and ordering a blooming bath flower for my sink. Not a bad product but I found out it wasn\u2019t for me.",

      "text": "We bought this a little late - around 6 months - but it was helpful for transitioning to sitting in the tub. The design allows water to flow all around the baby, easy to rinse. Sits well in the big tub. Obviously, parental attention is still required - when my baby arched her back she could get her bottom over the bump on the end. Once she started sitting up, it kept her from sliding around - she could sit up with her bottom at the bottom. Also highly recommend the Keter Bath Seatfor the sitting up stage. (We used it with our first who crawled long before she sat - her sister didn't really need it.)",
