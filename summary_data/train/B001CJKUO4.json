Leaving no option other than a refund! So after fully assembling my brand new grill, I can not use it and I have to wait to be refunded! So this is False Advertising at its finest!",

They told me to have him box it and they'll exchange. He did not want to go through and repackage so he hammered and worked with it to make it work. After a couple more Amazon calls, we came to an agreeable solution. Thank you Amazon.",
