They were not chewing on it first or anything they just looked at it bit down and pulled up and it ripped. The fabric is one of the thinnest fabrics I have seen while still being called \"denim\". The only thing really nice about this bed is the foam, but I would just recommend buying the foam and making your own since that Is what I have to do now. Using proper 1050 ballistic nylon.",

It's now 2018 and STILL hasn't developed a \"dent\" after all these years. Looks just like a new bed-still giving that soft but firm \"tempurpedic-type\" comfort our babies love. Our shepherds have since passed and now its our lab mix's fav spot. The covers that come w/bed have protected it and kept it clean and odor free.

Highly recommend. UPDATED TWO YEARS LATER TO ADD: bed still holding up strong. The interior waterproof liner, however, has degenerated so I will be replacing the liner.",
