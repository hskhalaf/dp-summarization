It's important to understand how hydration affects the different measurements so you don't become discouraged or get the wrong impression about your outcome. Being within the hydration range is essential and if you're not, your fat percentage goes up and your muscle (and bone if you're really dehydrated) goes down. The more hydrated you are, the more accurate those two measurements will be, and the more preferable if you're trying to lose fat and gain muscle.",

    "description": "From Tanita, The Body Fat Experts, comes the BC 554 Ironman Innerscan Body Composition Monitor. This scale is a unique and highly accurate body composition monitor. This product not only measures weight and body fat, it also tells you your muscle mass, body water %, basal metabolic rate (BMR), metabolic age, bone mass, visceral fat and rates your physique! The muscle mass feature indicates the weight of muscle in the body. The Body Water % is the total amount of fluid in the body expressed as a percentage of total weight. The BMR is the daily minimum level of energy or calories your body requires when resting (including sleeping) to function effectively. The Metabolic Age compares your BMR to the average age associated with that level of metabolism. The Bone Mass is the weight of your bone in your body. The Visceral Fat is the fat in the abdominal cavity (stomach), surrounding the vital organs. The Physique Rating is a rating of your body type; 1-9. Its sleek, modern design of glass and silver accents is a compliment to any bathroom. Monitor your health and fitness with an Ironman Body Composition Monitor.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe Tanita BC554 Ironman Glass InnerScan Body Composition Monitor Elite Series is one of the most comprehensive body monitors on the market today that's designed for home use. Using advanced Bioelectric Impedance Analysis (BIA) technology that was previously available only to medical professionals, health clubs and professional athletes, this monitor analyzes a full range of body measurements, including weight, body fat percentage, body water percentage, metabolic age, bone mass, and physique rating. It's a mouthful of measurements, but what it means is that with the Tanita BC554, you now have the unprecedented ability to monitor your body and the effects of your diet and fitness routines, comfortably and affordably in the convenience of your own home.\n\n \n\n\nMonitoring features help you keep tabs on your body composition and health. View larger. \n\nThere is more to healthy dieting than weight loss alone. Body fat percentage measurements are also important indicators of good health. View larger. \n\nThe Tanita BC554 Ironman delivers advanced body monitoring technology with a sleek, stylish design. View larger. With the Tanita BC554, up to four users can benefit. Simply supply your gender, age, height and weight in the memory, step on the scale, and the monitor does the rest. The results are analyzed according to each user's information, and the result -- displayed in the monitor's 2.25-inch LCD screen -- is the one of the most comprehensive at-home readings you can get. This monitor, which is about the same size as a typical bathroom scale, is ideal for anyone who is serious about monitoring their health and fitness. Knowing your body fat percentage -- the amount of body fat as a proportion of your body weight -- is essential if you want to create a diet and exercise plan that helps reduce the risk of certain conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Body water percentage is the total amount of fluid in your body expressed as a percentage of your total weight. Maintaining a healthy body water percentage ensures that your body functions efficiently. The metabolic age level is related to your body's metabolic rate and helps you maintain the daily minimum level of energy or calories your body requires when resting or sleeping to function effectively. Even though your total body weight might not change drastically over time, your muscle mass and body fat levels may be changing. Keeping tabs on them can help you stay at a lower risk of certain diseases. As you become more active and reduce the amount of body fat, your physique rating will also change accordingly. The physique rating helps you maintain a diet and fitness program to achieve your desired level. And knowing your levels of visceral fat -- the fat in the abdominal cavity and surrounding the vital organs -- can help you keep heart disease and high blood pressure at bay, and may delay the onset of type two diabetes. In short, this monitor gives you essential information and greater control as you work to stay healthy and live a more active, vital life.\n\n Operating on four AA batteries (included), the Tanita BC554 is intended for use by persons up to 330 pounds and is backed by Tanita's 3-year warranty. \n\n \nNote: Pregnant women should not use this monitor, and if you have a pacemaker or other internal electronic medical device, you should not use the body fat reading feature.",
