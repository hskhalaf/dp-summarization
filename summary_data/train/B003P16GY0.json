      "text": "I returned this item without opening it, and was charged nearly $25 restocking fee. It must be difficult for an employee to put this back on a shelf. I will never deal with this company again. Cheapskates!!!!! Don't bother with Pyle anyway, I have 5 friends who have this junk and they do nothing but complain it only works for 1 bike season, and then the amp goes. I was going to try it and after all of their complaints decided to send it back. It's garbage and their customer service sucks!",

      "text": "Unless my unit is not working properly, when using an MP3 player I have to adjust the volume on the player as the volume does not change by adjusting the units volume. It works really good with SD card, but I wish you could skip folders not just songs. For the size of this unit it is perfect for golf carts and similar uses. Plenty of power, but it does not take much as there is no engine noise to compete with. Love the wireless remote, nice for hitting mute when needed. We had to make our own mounting brackets as the provided brackets are made just for round such as handlebars of a bike.",

Mounted the Amp right on the Handlebar using an iPod Handlebar Bracket so I can just unplug it and throw it in my Saddlebag when I park the bike. Worth the $88 I paid for it.",
