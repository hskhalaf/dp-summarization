The mechanism within the light switch itself is unnecessarily complicated and difficult to replace, unlike every other ceiling fan I've seen.

Regardless, this fan should have lasted longer than a year and a half without needing any kind of replacement. I'm not happy with this purchase and won't buy another Hunter fan.",

We put new bulbs in...nothing....about 5 days later we went to turn on the fan and nothing. We had an electrician check the wiring and everything is fine. Sucks because we really like the fan :(",

Also would have been nice if the black wires from the fan were marked which one was for the fan and which one was for the light to make hooking it up to the dual wall switch wiring easier.

I placed 2 candelabra cfl bulbs that were 60w equivalents, and with the bowl in place, it's not enough light to read in the room. Tried higher output bulbs, but it tripped my surge protection.

Ours is mounted at nearly 14 feet in an A-frame cabin but still moves air quite well. There was a lot of extra wire available so could have added a good length of pipe to lower the height, but I opted not to due to time constraints of getting the job done and that may have lent itself to vibration problems. As it is, it didn't even require blade balancing. Good purchase.",

For my purposes I used the supplied shorter downrod, and the remote receiver fit fine under the hanging bracket under the canopy cover without a lot of effort. The blades required no balancing having been tested in both directions at all three speeds. They DO in fact have two different patterns on the two sides, though they are so similar in color that it is virtually indistinguishable after installation -- the grain is the primary differentiator and thus scarcely noticeable. It would be an improvement if there were one side with a distinctly different shade.",
