I expected more cushion and comfort. But for this price you cant expect too much. Overall, I am happy with purchase and would buy again based on the looks of the shoe alone. They also do not squish my toes like new balance and nike tend to. They have a bit wider toe area so they are more comfortable. Just need a good insert if you need better arch support.",

A little bit looser than I would have wanted but nothing that can't be fixed with a bigger sock. I have feet that swell so getting my size right with swelling is impossible sometimes. Love the way the shoe is made to be almost aerodynamic. It's Fila and Fila is a good brand. Great budget work out shoe. Would recommend, and the size calculator on this item is awesome!",
