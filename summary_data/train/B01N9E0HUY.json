The bird twitter works for wake up but is annoying and not the slow awakening I am looking for. If you are looking for a nice player with cool lights this is a fun and nice sounding clock and I highly recommend it. If you need an alarm clock it is not the best choice. I sent it back.",

There are no other choices, and you can't use bluetooth to set an alarm sound/song. The only option is to put a file on a drive and plug it in. Also, if you're not actively using it, the time doesn't display- you have to tap the top of it to turn it on, then it'll turn back off in a minute. I'd rather have a $5 functional alarm clock and get some nice bluetooth speakers. The directions are terrible as well. Very much regret this purchase.",

I wish I had at least 6 more months with it. I feel like most of my electronics give out at about 2 years. That's my expectation, though most electronics should probably last longer.",

      "text": "This was the most obnoxious thing to operate. Not intuitive at all. Have to cycle through every setting to get time set, including the one that makes obnoxious AM radio sounds, and every color option of the light. Did not come with a power adapter/cable. I gave it to my kid to use as a night light. She's using my old cell phone charger to power it. Lord help me if I ever have to set the time on it again though. I might just throw it in the trash instead. Don't bother with this one!",
