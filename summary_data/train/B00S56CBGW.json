We have a big shedder in our border collie mix and have been able to shake it off and/or sticky roll it with no issues. It's comfortable to sit on and looks great. Not sure how you reverse it because of the band in back, but we like the chocolate color. Very happy with the purchase!",

It was too light to match the rest of my furniture, so I exchanged it for the tan, and that has been great. THIS IS SO MUCH EASIER THAN WASHING THE WHOLE COUCH. My husband likes to sleep on the couch, and he refuses to use sheets or take evening showers, so the couch has been very funky, to my deep frustration. This cover makes my life so much easier to handle. The kids spill raspberries and blueberries on this regularly, and the stains have washed out.",

The color is perfect, the material is comfortable and it was simple to put on and hook up the strap. I\u2019m very impressed. The next test will be putting it through the wash. If it comes out in good shape I\u2019ll be ordering another. A++!!",

This is where my dog likes to prop his head so covering the sofa arm is important to us. If they would have moved this section forward about 3 inches and then attached, it would have been fine.

This is the last sofa cover I need to buy :) The sizing detail is very helpful to fit the sofa properly and the wide elastic strap going across the back works great. I have tried several other covers and this one is the best. I bought the dark chocolate cover and it looks really nice and stays put. The price is good and delivery quick. My pup is happy and so am I. All good :)",

They use their paws to dig in the couch before they lay down and they haven't even put a dent in it. Sadly, the little cloth pieces that hold the strap to the main part almost immediately got a hole each of them where the hook slid part way out. And just yesterday (after having it a month or so) I noticed one of them has almost completely torn off. It will still work but it won't be held up by the strap. I wish they would have use similar quality material on those two pieces.",

I have large dogs, so maybe that is why it didn't work, but I ended up wasting money on two of these and can't use them.",
