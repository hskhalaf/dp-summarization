I am a 'Manual ' Camera freak much to my surprise with a little supervision the automatics are very usable.. Oh what a surprize Zebra for stills, allows you to nail the exposure easily. Raw and jpg, so good thinking of just using jpg's as the camera output for its size and specification is second to none.",

I'm thrilled with it can you tell.",
