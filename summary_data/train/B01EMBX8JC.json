Did not receive that or any information about that offer. Not sure I will purchase another item like this off of Amazon.",

It is compact, very manouveraable, the forward light makes it easy to see the path. The suction is great, and the best feature for me is the replacable bag - for so long I have had bagless cleaners and tipping out the full cups was a nuisence. But with the bags there is no dirt scattering around and replacing them is so very easy. In all, kudos Oreck this is an outstanding cleaner!!!",

You can easily vacuum under a table or bed. I love the bag design of Oreck vacuums. They filter allergens so much better than bagless models. And it may sound scary, but the bag is so easy to use and easy to replace. An added bonus of this vacuum is that it is American made. I highly recommend this vacuum!",
