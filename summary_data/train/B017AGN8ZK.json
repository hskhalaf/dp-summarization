      "text": "Bought the Surge because I wanted to consolidate devices, as I had been wearing both a Charge HR and Garmin on my runs. After withholding judgement for a month, I am now officially unimpressed with the Surge, primarily because the GPS is unreliable. On most runs, the GPS either tracks erratically or just stops altogether. Also, on the increasingly rare occasion that the GPS tracks throughout the run, FitBit doesn't sync workouts to MapMyRun (despite advertising otherwise), so I have to manually download/upload a .tcx file to MMR. Finally, no auto-pause, cadence, and elevation charts make the Surge fail even the most basic tests for a running watch. I'm switching back to Garmin.",

It then becomes very frustrating (if you're not able to sync regularly) when your smartwatch \"with one job\" fails even at the simplest of tasks. I found myself cursing technology and opting for a simpler watch that has no software or updates...just tells time and has a stopwatch.

Actually I babied it more than any electronic item ive ever owned. Remarkably cheap construction for a $250 dollar watch. Just replaced it with Microsoft band 2 and coukdnt be happier. Last fitbit product I will ever buy. If that was all it would be enough to sink the product but for whatever reason on a weekly basis it would stop communicating with my iPhone and wouldnt keep track of my steps. Just overall poor design and function.",
