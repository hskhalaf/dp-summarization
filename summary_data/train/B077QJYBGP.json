The fabric does not stretch. I don\u2019t like that because it leaves so much fabric/sequins at the calf and it makes my calfs look HUGE!!! Overall, wonderful buy \ud83e\udd29 Also, they seem more emerald green in the light but when not exposed to much light you see more of the blue. They are still so beautiful and I\u2019m so happy I bought them for my birthday party!!!",
