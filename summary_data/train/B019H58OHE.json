I have no idea why they call it Bigfoot as the razor is fairly light and extremely comfortable to hold, the handle is a little longer than the standard razor and easy to manipulate on your face. Best of all is the shave close comfortable and smooth with no razor burn, a delightful beginning to any day.",

I did use a Parker blade instead of the mild blades that came with it. The two piece head has slip notches that keep the blade in place. Both pieces are very light and thin. Not sure what they are made of but this is a travel razor.",

Also a tip for those just beginning safety razor shaving, do yourself a favor and invest in a pre-shave oil/cream and a variety pack of razors to get the best one for you.

Good memories are restored, except for the feminine handle. The blades are junk at best, but I will live with the short handle, or improvise, adapt, and overcome by adding something that extents the length of the handle.",

The travel case is cool though and in the meantime the head does screw onto Muhle R89 base to give it more heft.",

Make sure you tighten the razor completely after putting your blade in, to get the maximum blade angle, and let the weight of the razor do all the work, apply no external pressure. The razor has no guard, so you need to be careful shaving, but the mild blade also helps keep your face safe. I got no cuts on my first ever shave with this razor. Overall this blade is very good for a beginner, if you invest the time needed for a safe first shave with it.",
