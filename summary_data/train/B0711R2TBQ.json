      "text": "I love these. I'm a hip hop dancer and teacher, and I wore these last night for the first time (4 classes) and again this morning (2 classes). They are comfy, fit well, look great, and are great for dancing because they don't have a ton of traction like running shoes. I don't lace the upper lace holes because I like them a little looser on my ankles (same with my Converse). While I love my Converse, these have a more supportive insole. Glad I got them!",
