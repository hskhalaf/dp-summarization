      "text": "Fun game for the whole family. Good for 4/5 years or older. My 4 does have a hard time controlling the turn because the game changes from land to air to water, it\u2019s just how the game play is. Graphics is okay, game control is not bad. Kids friendly, with many characters to pick from. Overall animation is great. If the game senses that a player is struggling with certain aspect of the game, such as turning, it will suggest a guiding line for the player. This game is a good alternative to Mario Kart. You can do 4 players split screen.",

For those of us who don't play video games there is definitely a learning curve on using the controls to get the cars to do what we want. It gave my son an opportunity to teach me something and demonstrate his compassion to me for my consistent last place finish. I will get the hang of this soon because it is VERY FUN!!!",

Compete across land, water and air in incredible transforming vehicles that change from cars to boats to planes mid-race. Master your driving skills as you drift, barrel roll and boost to overtake your rivals, or use your weapons tactically and unleash your All-Star move to gain the winning advantage. \n\nIt's not just your fellow racers you need to watch out for: as the road falls away beneath you, or the river runs dry, new routes emerge and your vehicle transforms to take advantage of the terrain.
