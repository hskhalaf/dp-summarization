I use it for checking email, surfing web, and purchases from my favorite online stores. I like the touch screen feature that my Chromebook did not have. I don't play video games, but many games are available to download from google play. I am a happy customer.",

The tablet detaches and re-attaches snugly from and to the keyboard. There is not too much clutter on screen, and none of the message noise that a previously purchased off brand had.
