We chose to replace these bulbs with LEDs, but most LEDs we found on Amazon (both dimming and non-dimming) do not turn completely off when used in this fan. This prevents you from having a dark room at night when the fan is active (which we found annoying). We finally found one LED goes 100% off using the remote control:It's not dimable, but this was preferable to the alternative. Let us know if you find a dimmable version which also works.",

Between running the fan and running the light, you're going to use 145 W. And you might not get as much light as you want. On the other hand, the mini bulbs make the fan more compact over all, so if dimensions are critical maybe this is the fan for you.",

Since the large remote receiver is not prewired and takes up to much room, it makes it impossible to install the outside housing to the ceiling bracket. Stay away if you want to keep your sanity.",
