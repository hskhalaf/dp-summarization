The straps are kind odf difficult to get on how they criss cross underneath. I also find that they aren't proportioned to the belly strap. The leg straps are halfway loosened but the the belly strap is completely tightened and it sags a full 1\" down. I'm going to try to figure out how to shorten it, for now it shifts to the side.",

He hasn\u2019t tried to shake it off so it\u2019s comfortable on his back.The big plus is being able to attach the leash to a stainless steel ring on the top of the bag.
