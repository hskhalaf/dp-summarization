Unlike traditional LSAT books, the Trainer actually provides you with a single methodology that makes it easier to breeze through the LR section. I would also recommend buying the Logical Reasoning Bible too though because there are some essential tips in there that the Trainer doesn't go into much depth on. But overall I would say this book is the best.",

The 2 months I spent in this book was so much better than than the 5 I devoted to Powerscores LR. (Though, I suppose PS gave me some basics which may have made this book easier to learn.) I used Powerscores for LG, so can't comment on the LG section in this book. I went from -7 in LR to -2/-1. Also very excellent strategies and mindsets for Reading Comprehension. Powerscores was severely lacking in this area as well. The book is written in an engaging manner, with subtle humor and excellent organization. You won't regret this purchase. Time well spent.",
