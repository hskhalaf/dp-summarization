Seriously though, if you find yourself in need of a well crafted, multi-purpose, super sharp cutting tool, I definitely recommend these.",

Scissors didn\u2019t work at all because fibers were trapped where the two sides join thus preventing the blades to meet. I looked online for a more suitable tool and found these carpet scissors. The cutting ability is great but these are not ergonomic so your hand will still take a beating. I believe this product would be much improved if it had longer handles with a thicker grip for easier handling. I\u2019d buy these again because the cutting ability is great but would have someone else use them for me.",
