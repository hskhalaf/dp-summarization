After less than 3 months of limited use it started leaking air every day. Didn't expect it to last forever but less than 3 mos is pretty bad. Vendor only covers 60 day warranty so you' re going to be out of luck next time you set this up when guests arrive and it won't stay inflated. Pretty sad for an expensive airbed.",
