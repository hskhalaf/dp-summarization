All black was unavailable on the Fizik website, so I found them here for the same price. Happy with them, would recommend. Also should note I\u2019m using these on an indoor spin bike with Venmo SPD pedals.",

Shopping around, I have to admit, I was drawn to these Fizik's largely for aesthetic reasons - the look like a road shoe and come at a bargain price. I've been very pleased so far. The sole isn't as stiff as my road shoes, and I'm told that is a good thing for gravel anyway, they're easy to adjust and to walk in. They're not super easy to clean after a dusty ride, but that's probably true of most shoes. I'd definitely get these again, though, and might consider a road Powerstrap pair when it's time for a replacement, too.",

Having moved away from traditional road shoes to MTB variety of the last few years (mtb shoes seem to wider overall) fizik\u2019s gravel specific shoe sounded interesting Ok. So. For real. They comfortable. Yes they are narrow (i dont have a super wide foot @ 13.5) but not insanely narrow. The straps make the shoe a little more forgiving up top (some give over what you\u2019ll find with a ratchet or BOA system) I\u2019m using them with SPDs. No issues with clearance getting into the pedals or flex around the cleat area when pedaling Hopefully they stand up to heavy use",
