Even set to bright daylight, don't count on being able to use the built in monitor to see what you're shooting on a sunny day or even overcast outdoor shoot. This is very limiting since I shoot mostly with a gimbal and had to purchase an external monitor. The other thing that doesn't make sense is not having an audio output to monitor audio while recording. The visual feature is pretty good, as long as you know where your range needs to be, but you'll miss little things like the subject bumping their lavalier without using another audio input.",

UPDATE: After a year an half of enjoying this wonderful camera, applying all the updates etc. Amazed on its performance, I never really paid any attention to the fact that every time I inserted the memory card I would have to struggle a lil'... until last month my memory card would not go in at all, I tried every which way I could and broke two 64gb memory cards on the intent... so my advice to anyone having this problem from the beginning do not ignore... Now to have it repaired I have to fork over $500.00 I live outside the US....and the camera is now worth twice that..",

Extended grip is welcomed, provides confidence in hand holding without neck strap. Autofocus: not evaluated. Image stabilization: I cannot see the difference in still images and have not evaluated in video. Internal buffer: \"Huge\" with the proper memory card. Summary: The primary reason for me buying this camera is the huge buffer, second is the Image stabilization which should help with adapted manual focus lenses. I would have no problem using this camera or recommending it for travel, weddings, portraits, airshows, etc. etc..",

It outpaces my Director of Photography's A7RII for 4K capture, which is primarily why I purchased this model. That, and the built in stabilization.
