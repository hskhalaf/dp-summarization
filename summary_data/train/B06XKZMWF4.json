Mouse's tail got caught in it for a bit but he was able to pull it back inside and seemed pretty much ok when I released him over a mile from my house into the woods. He's lucky too, because my patience was running thin with him - if this trap hadn't worked he would be dead instead.",

Each mouse was there over night before it was released outdoors. Now the trap's spring door does not close after bate is placed in the rear of the trap. Cleaned the plastic traps and recycled them. Excellent method to catch a mouse but the design of the latch is a major flaw. Mine were both useless after each first catch. No recommendation",

The gate Is fairly light so I don\u2019t know if this causes the mouse any pain, but neither mouse seemed to be able to free its tail and one was very distressed. I\u2019m also not sure if it could cause pain when it initially snaps shut. One other comment: the instructions recommend peanut butter but we have had much better luck with raisins.",

Flaw Two: The catch on the pivot plate, which held the the spring door in place was plastic and stuck out. When the mice couldn\u2019t get out, they started gnawing on the catch and after the 2nd mouse there was no catch to hold the spring door in place.

And after awhile like in my case the peanut butter got moldy after no mice entered and had to be washed out well. I am in hopes none enter as we have mounds of snow outside, where would I release for their survival?",

So bottom line works well but just don't leave it in there to long. If the side with holes \"clicked\" in place it would be a better design. (See photo)",
