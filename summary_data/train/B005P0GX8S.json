I'm not certain as to how I'm going to get that missing 3 hours back from my life, but, I'm sure I'll recoup that time from somewhere.",

Also it is Piano Black, not City Red which is fine but it would have been nice to know. It does work and with a new cover it looks fine. Still I would have rather spent $10 more dollars and had a phone that was in better condition.",

So now I need to buy one with a different adaptor. Also for some reason it won't find my bluetooth but maybe that's operator error.
