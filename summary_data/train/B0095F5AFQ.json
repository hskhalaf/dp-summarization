This camera is a real heart-breaker: really fine lens and sensor resulting in surprisingly great photos and all from a very small, stylish camera. As a result of its premature failure, Panasonic Lumex, not Fuji, got my business when I replaced it. Shame on Fuji for not not recalling this highly disappointing camera.",

    "title": "Fujifilm XF1/Blk 12MP Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD (Black)",
    "description": "Style:Camera Only| Color:Black| Product Packaging:Standard PackagingTravel light. Shoot fast. Capture the moment. The FUJIFILM XF1 is the latest introduction to the award winning X-Series line of digital cameras, and is an incredibly versatile camera that gives you the highest level in image quality along with high speed performance, all in a compact, sleek form factor with retro looks. The large 2/3-Inch 12MP EXR CMOS sensor and EXR Processor have been precisely paired up in the XF1 to provide the best image quality and fastest performance possible. With fast Auto Focus even in low light and high speed continuous shooting up to 11frames per second, you never have to worry about missing a shot. The XF1 has a bright Fujinon F1.8-4.9 wide angle manual zoom lens (25 100mm equivalent) that helps produce amazing images even in low light conditions, as well as beautiful booked (blurred background) effects that are almost unheard of in a compact camera. Beyond producing superb clarity from edge to edge, the 4x manual zoom lens ring actually doubles as the on/off power switch and offers 3 unique camera positions: from fully retracted (easily slide into your pocket or purse for easy portability), to a locked Standby mode (ready in an instant, but save some battery power while you\u2019re not actively shooting) to Shooting mode. The multi-faceted lens offers high speed operation (0.55sec startup in quick start mode) and quick/precise zoom control. The stylish XF1 body combines a lightweight and durable aluminum body along with synthetic leather covering to enhance the overall look and feel of the camera. Available in three different colors (Red, Black & Tan), the choice is yours to decide which one best suits your style.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n\nFUJIFILM XF-1 DIGITAL CAMERA\nLightweight, durable aluminum body parts and synthetic leather covering enhance the feel of the camera in the hand, with texture that resembles genuine leather.\n\n\nDISCOVER THE BEAUTY OF F/1.8, AT NIGHT, INDOORS, WHENEVER LIGHT IS LOW\nThe bright f/1.8 lens lets you capture quality pictures not normally possible with a compact camera. Noise is kept to a minimum without boosting sensitivity, while camera-shake and subject motion are prevented due to high shutter speeds. And thanks to the large aperture, you can also create attractive \"bokeh\" blurred background effects.\n\n\nHIGH QUALITY PHOTOS & MOVIES WITH THE EXR CMOS\nEXR Auto with Motion Detection instantly recognizes 58 types of scenes, instantly optimizing every setting from exposure to white balance, and switches to one of three different sensor modes for the scene and subject: HR High Resolution for well-lit conditions, SN High Sensitivity/Low Noise mode for low light, and DR Dynamic Range mode for high-contrast scenes.\n\nSPEED RESPONSE WITH EXR PROCESSOR\nThe EXR processor offers a fast AF in dark scenes: a fast startup, 0.55-second response, means you'll never miss the moment. And locking on to your subject in as little as 0.16 seconds, High Speed Contrast Detection AF captures even spur-of-the-moment shots with sharp clarity at maximum 4x zoom. Plus,unlike other more conventional premium digital cameras, the XF1 autofocus system reacts quickly even in low light, making it possible to shoot high-quality hand-held photos indoors or at night.\n\n\nMANUAL ZOOM & EFFORTLESS OPERATION\nUnlike power zoom, the XF1's zoom ring provides direct manual controls, keeping the zoom action very smooth. For telephoto shots beyond the 4x optical zoom range, Intelligent Digital Zoom doubles your zoom to the equivalent of 8x zoom and delivers excellent sharpness and detail.\n\n\nMORE CREATIVE PHOTOGRAPHY FOR YOU\nFor creative needs, various shooting options and functions are available. With a new feature Advanced Filter, you can select out of six special effects: Pop Color, Toy Camera, Miniature, High Key, Partial Color, and Dynamic Tone.",
