My Galaxy Note 5 was far superior with its stylus, but I'm not sure if this is the fault of this stylus or the iPad itself. That said, overall, it's an OK enough experience. You can usually tell in context what a word is, but if you are writing anything semi random, like a password where you couldn't contextually tell if a letter is supposed to be a U or a V, you will be in trouble. Pairing the stylus with Penultimate and Evernote was very simple. Charge seems to last quite long.",

      "text": "I bought this for my iPad mini. Love it. It is now so easy to write on my iPad. I have tried two other types--those with the rubber tips (ugh) and the Adonis Jot Pro that uses the little clear plastic disks. I like the Jot Pro (and use it for my work-issued iPad) but the Jot Script 2 is much better to use and easy to charge. The only downside is that not every app recognizes the Jot Script. But, my two favorite apps do. If you like to write on your table was much as I do, then this is the perfect device--at least until a better device comes out.",

Now I will come to product review, This stylus is 10th Century stylus, prototype product. After receiving it, I fully charged it, Then I connected it to penultimate , I could see very heavy lag while writing, If I write little faster, This doesn't write complete alphabets. I tried all kind of apps, but this is one of the bad stylus that I would never want to write anything because of its writing quality. I won\u2019t recommend to buy this stylus.",

But today when I got this pen and tried it on my iPad with Penultimate and GoodNote4, the performance totally ruined my expectation. This pen simply doesn't do the job. The tip of the pen is very loose. I guess it is designed to \"ink out\" when the tip is pressed and stop \"ink out\" when the pressure on the tip is gone. But it is a bad design. The beginning and the ending part of your line is not detected and when this comes to hand writing it is very annoying. You simply cannot recognize what you've written down.",
