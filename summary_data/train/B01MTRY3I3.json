However this time I took a chance - and sized a half side down. I wear women's size 11 in most shoes. So I ordered a 10.5 in these.. and they fit like a glove. They are as bright as they appear on your screen, and yes comfy so far. I'm looking forward to running in them tomorrow (on treadmill) tomorrow. I love the look.. the fit and I think I'll be buying adidas more. I usually buy Reebok, Nike, and Ascics. This is a great buy overall, for me at least. Love it!!",
