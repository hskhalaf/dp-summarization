Put new batteries in it and still would not run. The motor had burned up or just stopped working. Go elsewhere for a bubble machine cause this is a waste of money!",

I wish i could get my money back but it would be the same amount as the shipping.. The bubble maker sits at an angle that the hubbles actually leak into the fan area which makes a huge mess out the back. I could put up with that if it blew bubbles.. And it does for a few minutes but, then it turns into a big mess. See pictures. I will never buy one from this company again!",

This machine only has on fan even though the opening for the blowing fan could have more to produce more bubbles and it leaks ....a lot",

      "text": "This worked just as described and my 2 year old was delighted with a flurry of bubbles...for about 45 seconds. (Literally) After that, the motor sounded like it had a drain in power and the fan, though it ran, didn't run fast enough to put enough air through to produce bubbles. I tried turning it off and then back on, but it never had enough power again to fully produce bubbles. I would assume that this would be a problem when batteries are drained, but I had new batteries and wouldn't expect a product to blast through them in under a minute. I picked up Billion Bubbles from a local big box store and, so far/fingers crossed, have been pleased.",

Don't think you have to fill up the bubble dispenser in order to get a lot of bubbles if you fill it up you will be outside with bubbles all day .

This is a perfect gift for kids who have a hard time blowing bubbles themselves. Even our cat got in on the act and tried chasing the bubbles. So much fun to watch kids laugh and giggle and the cat almost doing somersaults trying to catch them.",
