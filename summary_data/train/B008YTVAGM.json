Over the span of the past 3-4 weeks I received 2 very short 1 sentence emails/questions about if I did something and then nothing. I definitely don't recommend this product. It hasn't come close to what they said it could do (never even worked out of the box) and their customer service follow through when contacted is horrendous.",

Though without decent instructions I never was able to figure out the difference between the red and black pads. LOL",
