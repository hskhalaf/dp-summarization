Unfortunately, there seems to be some (unspecified) plumbing or configuration that's necessary on per-distro basis; I was never able to get this scanner to function on my Fedora Linux installations for more than one or two scans at a time. I guess I should have paid attention to comments regarding Canon's indifference toward open-source software. Regardless, I'm sure that this could be a fine peripheral when used on a platform supported by Canon's official software.",

(Be careful about multiple scanning/printings. It remembers the setting, and you can get 10 copies when you want one. --Personal Experience--) It also has the ability to scan multiple items at once, and automatically separate them for separate usage. That is nice when trying to digitize old photos.",

Scanned documents come in a little too dark, it takes several seconds to scan anything, and the scan quality is not as good as the resolution would indicate (yeah, it probably hits the advertised resolution, but the image noise sort of wipes that out). However, this thing is incredibly cheap. We mostly use it to archive documents that we are on the border between keeping/shredding. So, for a great price, this has saved us some storage space and hopefully will save us quite a bit of hassle when it comes time to retrieve one of those old documents too.",

And have a clean hand towel (soft) to wipe dust off the photos before you put on scanner. Also have a piece of paper near by when you're scanning because it can be a great photo scooper to get the pictures off the scanner so you don't leave finger prints on scanner.

It takes its power from the USB cable (it doesn't need an electricity supplier). Personally, I chose to disconnect it from the computer when I am not needing it. However, I discovered that it warms up quite quickly when I connect it for a job. In less than a minute it's ready to go. It also comes with a software that turns a picture of a text into selectable text, and you can save it as a .pdf. I like it and I do recommend it.",

I did not want 226 MB of installed hover-over-your-work little icons that do in fact require you to wade through online manuals to figure out how to make the buttons work. Counterintuitive? Yeah, just a bit. The scans are nice, I suppose. But it really took me an hour to get to one.",

The only downside I can see is the occasional anomoly when scanning photos (akin to the effect you used to see on TV when the subject was wearing a finely-striped shirt), but changing the dpi setting has been able to overcome that for me. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this for anyone who wants a cheap multipurpose scanner.",

I recommend don't losing the USB cable that came with the scanner as it may be necessary to power the scanner.. most usb cables are real cheap. don't use a cable too long as it won't work. One downside ... no bundled software however it works well with word , adobe acrobat and other programs.",

The ease of use (task buttons on scanner) is obviously improved, though the software is a bit peculiar for a person who gets used to normal Windows applications (with a menu, and a few toolbars, something like that). I have not tried other scanner makers (like Epson, HP, etc.) but for the price (I got it from Amazon for $38), I am very satisfied with its performance.",

Almeida4.0 out of 5 stars Great for portable use, but you get what you pay for.Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2019Verified Purchase I've had this scanner for a few years now, and it does exactly what I purchased it for - to be an inexpensive portable scanner for when I want to scan books from the library, or at an office desk that doesn't have a scanner for some strange reason, or anything else if I'm working not at my main desk. And it does great as that 'grab and go' scanner! It fits in a backpack, draws its power from a single USB cord, and works plug and play on Windows. Mac can be a bit temperamental, but installing the latest driver from Canon's website fixed most of the instability issues I was having.\n\nDon't buy this scanner if you need a film scanner (doesn't really scan them all that well), need archival/ reproduction parameters with little to no setup (the quality of the scans is decent, but I do have to tweak them in Photoshop for design use), or if a squealing scanner for maybe 45 seconds a page will upset your cubicle mate (not the quietest or quickest scanner I've used). Mostly up to the fact that a cheap scanner has to cut corners SOMEWHERE, and while I would not call it flimsy, it clearly is a consumer, not prosumer or professional level build quality.Read more One person found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Gina5.0 out of 5 stars Love this scanner!Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2010Verified Purchase I scrapbook and was transitioning from manual scrapbooking to digital. I had tons of pictures that needed to be scanned into my laptop (thousands). We looked at the small picture scanners that scan hundreds of pictures in an hour or so. Decided against them because even though fast, the quality of the scans were grainy and you had to use sleeves for the pics. They didn't get good reviews and were double the price of this scanner. This was one of the cheaper full sized scanners we found on Amazon, we decided that the Canon name had to be good for the price. IT IS! It is SO easy to use, nothing complicated at all. The software was easy to load and very user friendly. I discovered I could scan multiple pictures at a time and the software would separate them into their own files so there was no messing around with trying to cut and paste in order to do multiples at one time. It is really light weight and basic. The quality of the scans is fantastic, they looked as good as the original picture. I would recommend this scanner to anyone. You usually get what you pay for, but we were more than pleasantly surprised at the quality of this Canon scanner.Read more 650 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse RogerB5.0 out of 5 stars Outstanding performance for such a low priceReviewed in the United States on December 18, 2011Verified Purchase I have been very satisfied with this scanner. It was simple to setup. Software installed very easy on Windows 7 laptop. Software is not real intuitive but after reading the manual you will be able to navigate it just fine. It powers from the USB cable which is nice. Be sure to install the PC software first BEFORE you connect the scanner to the PC. I was up and scanning in about 10 minutes.\nI purchased this scanner mainly for scanning about 1000 photos. I think the scanner did a great job in scanning the pictures. Great resolution. Now, here is what sold me on this product. The scanning tray is about 10x17 in size. You can put several pictures on the scanning bed and as long as you give them some space between each one the scanner will recognize then as separate pictures! I can scan 5 -6 photos at a time? I am scanning at 600 dpi and can scan 5 -6 photos in about a minute from the time I press scan to the time they are transferred to my PC.\n\nI have only scanned about 100 photos at the time of this review but I would highly recommenced this scanner.Read more 31 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse George D1.0 out of 5 stars Great images, but absolutely the clunkiest and least intuitive ...Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2014Verified Purchase YOU'LL BE SORRY ! Great images, but absolutely the clunkiest and least intuitive interface and menus imaginable. I am reasonably intelligent, college-educated, US Air Force trained, technically competent, and holder of an FAA airline captain's pilot certificate. I can program a remote, program a GPS, and program a flight management system as well as cook bacon and toast bread at the same time. But whoever designed the interface stayed up late many nights in a row trying to figure out the least obvious way to arrange functions on the software -- and they succeeded! Just imagine the worst features of Windows 8 and Office 10 rolled into one and you'll be somewhere close. A plague of poor sales on the House of Canon!Read more 10 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Josh VINE VOICE 4.0 out of 5 stars Great everyday scannerReviewed in the United States on September 1, 2013Verified Purchase This is the perfect scanner to go with your laptop. It is very small and does not require a separate power supply. I keep mine tucked away under my desk and only take it out when I need it. That way it isn't always just consuming valuable desk space. When I need to use it all I have to do is plug it into the USB port on my computer and it's ready to go!\n\nThis scanner and the Canon software allows you to do multiple things. I mainly use it for scanning documents to PDFs and also for scanning in color photograph prints.\n\nAs a PDF creator it is nice because you can easily convert your paper documents to PDFs for sending contracts or for just eliminating some clutter and moving your file cabinet into your computer. The only downside is that since it doesn't have any type of document feeder you have to scan each page separate which can be a little time consuming if you have large multi-page documents.\n\nFor photos it works great. I'm slowly converting a huge collection of family photos into digital copies so I can just manage all my \"new\" photos from digital cameras with my \"old\" photos from film on my computer in one giant library. A nice feature when scanning photos is that you can place multiple photos on the scanner at the same time and it will recognize where the edges of each photo are and automatically create separate image files for each photo. This allows you to quickly scan 3 or 4 photos at the same time.\n\nAll in all this is a great little scanner and the price simply can't be beat!\n\nOne piece of advice is you may need to run the platen calibration routine once you get the scanner setup. This is accessed from within the ScanGear software. I initially had an issue where my color photos had banding lines and a yellow offset to the color, but this was immediately fixed once I ran the calibration program.Read more 6 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse See all reviews from the United States TOP INTERNATIONAL REVIEWS \nTranslate all reviews to English A reader5.0 out of 5 stars Works well with LinuxReviewed in the United Kingdom on March 8, 2015Verified Purchase I bought this because this model is known to work well with Linux (unlike the new 120 model, which doesn't work if your Linux machine has only USB 3.0 sockets). It works perfectly. It's scanning speed is a lot faster than the ancient scanner it replaces. The fact that the scanner gets its power from the USB cable rather than from a mains adapter is a nice bonus.Read more One person found this helpful Helpful Sending feedback...Thank you for your feedback.Sorry, we failed to record your vote.

I purchased in for the use of my 75 year old father who is staying in India. The menu is extremely user friendly - my father picked it up with very limited instructions.\n\nIt comes with a CD for product installation. After the CD gets the program installed on your computer, it is quite easy to use. it has a feature to scan multiple documents at one go - can save the scan either in PDF and picture of your computer. After the scan is done, it has a feature to work on the scan size too: You can crop the size of the scan.\n\nComes at a reasonable price, energy saving and a scan machine for everyday use. I thoroughly recommend it.Read more One person found this helpful Helpful Sending feedback...Thank you for your feedback.Sorry, we failed to record your vote.
