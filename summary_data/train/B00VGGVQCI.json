      "text": "I had 2 coffee pots in mind as my Cuisinart Grind and Brew 10 cup started leaking like the other 3 I\u2019ve had. It was between another Cuisinart and this. A lot of the negative reviews were due to the maintenance which I am used to. I wish I would have got this coffee lot sooner. The coffee comes out so hot and I can adjust the brew strength to my liking. I run it on 3 for strength and it is perfect every time. The cleaning of this machine is way less than the Cuisinart. By far my favorite coffee pot I\u2019ve ever owned. A+ Breville!!!",

The machine is not designed to boil away coffee. Preheating the carafe by rinsing with hot water prior to use will help keep a potfull hot for a reasonable amount of time. Cleaning the unit requires some care, but it should be expected of grinder/brewer. \"Average\" in this case is not a bad score. I highly recommend this product.",

We have kept the machine meticulously clean, especially the coffee disk since that was the problem with the first unit.

Thermos keeps coffeee hot for 4hours (without preheating it with warm water). Easy to change number of cups, easy to switch to single cup and has lots room to put tall travel mug under dispenser. Love the preset feature which is also simple to set up. Top quality and works as advertised. Absolutely no issues!",

The cleaning of the grinder is also fairly involved as you have to take off a couple of pieces to get to the shoot opening and give the grinder a thorough brushing. For me, the high quality coffee makes this extra maintenance worth it, but someone unwilling to do this maybe should consider a more maintenance free machine. Great coffee though!!!",
