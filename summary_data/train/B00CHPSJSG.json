The girth is really adjustable with a wide velcro band, so you want to buy according to your dog's body length so you can shield them from the rain. Love the ducky pattern! One thing I'm worried about is washing it. It's really thin plastic so I'm not sure if it can hold up to a washer machine. Will probably have to hand wash and lay out to dry.",

The XL fits my dog perfectly. Her measurements are: *neck to base of tail: 21\" *around the neck: 18\" *around the chest, under the armpits: 28\"",

It is secure and adjustable to fit, so when he shakes, it doesn't slip around. I washed it on cold in the delicate cycle, and it was fine! It air dried quickly too. My only complaint is that when the hood is down, he sometimes can't see, so I have to adjust it every once in a while.",

Material serves the purpose but is fairly thin/lightweight so would likely tear easily if snagged. Ordered three sizes for three different dogs and all fit as expected/advertised. Birth strap is forward enough that make dogs can relieve themselves without interference. Hood is awkward/useless so I just fold it back out of the way. Main shortcoming is a lack of rear leg loops...if the rain is accompanied by any wind at all, the lightweight material billows up in the back like a loose cape and no longer does its job. I will likely retrofit leg loops to solve this problem.",

They were cheap, so i'll keep using them...I just need to find something for their poor heads. And a way to keep the darn things from sliding.",

My other major complaint is that it's very light with no weighting or any way to fasten down the back end, so that in strong wind (which often accompanies rain, of course) the back end flies up, leaving her rear end exposed. On the plus side, it looks nice, and the material is truly waterproof.",
