I blind folded him and took him out to a park he had never explored and gave it to him. When he saw that Garrett logo he lit up like a kid at Christmas! Best off all he found a Colonial button right off the bat! This model was much more sensitive than his previous one, it has settings to filter out metal types so you can narrow down your search. Garrett needs a bumper sticker that says \" Go Garrett, or Go Home\" LOL Nothing compares! Thanks so much!",

I dug a silver plated copper wedding band, a runners medallion and several other things that brought a smile to my face. Also found a bunch of clad coinage. The battery is still 75% full! I would highly recommend this machine to anyone wanting to get into the hobby or a great upgrade to a beginner's machine. Very satisfied with it!",

If you pass over a Target 3 times and you only get a signal once, you're probably going to dig trash. I would highly recommend the Garrett pro pointer. Even though it cost almost as much as the detector, it will speed your recovery time greatly. Happy Hunting!",

Target ID is extremely accurate at small depth and not accurate for deep targets. This is a metal detector that can find targets at 8 inches! Discrimination works great, you can filter out iron and steel. This is a professional metal detector for 200 dollars!",
