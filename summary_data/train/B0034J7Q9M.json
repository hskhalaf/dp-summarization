I was disappointed in the quality of the print. The \"new\" device did not stamp the complete date clearly. Letters in the month are unclear. Numbers were clearer. Additionally, the little wheels the user has to turn to change the date are so small that I find it impossible to change the date--something I do daily--without getting ink on my fingers. Just a heads up!",
