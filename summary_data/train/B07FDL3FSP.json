      "text": "We ordered this in July for my daughters birthday in October. It was the only thing she wanted and it was not cheap. 0 stars. It doesn\u2019t work because the app is not compatible with the newest i0s software. So it is unusable. They are working on an update but until then the connectivity will not work. And no timeline. It could be months. My daughter said she would like to wait and see because it\u2019s what she really wanted. But until then it\u2019s useless. $200 on something that doesn\u2019t work. Save your money and get something else.",
