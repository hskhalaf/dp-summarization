They're tall. Well, hello, they're wine glasses. Because of their shape, my dishwasher has a hard time cleaning them thoroughly. But that's alright. I re-rinse them by hand. If you use a rinse aid, they come out looking great.",

That said, these are some fine quality glasses. They are thin and delicate feeling, which is always a sign of good glassware. They are nice and large, so if you\u2019re like my mother that means less trips back to the bottle. The price is good for name brand. Your guests will have no doubt that you are a wine connoisseur as they sip out of these beauties.",

For the most part, I drink red wine in your standard glasses for that type and in spite of my lack of expertise, I can tell you that this set of (two) glasses is an excellent value. The wine kinda grabs the sides of the glass and holds on (in an attractive way), they also have a nice heft. Inexpert claim: these glasses are of excellent quality for the price. I'd buy them for my more skilled than I am at understanding wine friends.",

The rim is a perfect feeling for your lips, not too thin and fragile but not so fine that it feels breakable like some fine crystal. The only drawback for me is the base is too wide to fit in the cupholder built into my sofa. I have no problem storing these in my cabinets even though they are taller than my other wine glasses.",

I mainly drink reds and prefer a classic Italian styled wine... nice, interesting edges and flavors while being super smooth. You need a really good glass to get the aroma and taste right so that it's perfectly aired out. This glass seems to do an excellent job in all areas, plus they are super high quality crystal glasses that should last a lifetime (well, barring my own clutziness or Amazon's shipping methods!

I'm far from a wine expert so I really can't say that the glasses make my wine taste any better but it definitely enhances the experience. The glass has a wide bowl that tapers at the top so it leaves plenty of room in the glass to aerate the wine and allow the aroma to waft up while you're sipping. I wish I had a rack to hang my wine glasses as these are fairly large and they take up a lot of space in my cabinets but that doesn't diminish my overall opinion of how great they are. I would recommend these to any cabernet lover.",
