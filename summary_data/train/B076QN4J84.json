      "text": "I was very excited to get this product! I make egg bites in it for breakfast. I washed it thoroughly with soap and water before use. I put my egg mixture in, but the pan was super flimsy so I had to put it on top of a cookie sheet. I baked my egg bites in the pan, and they came out very nice. But, when I eat them they tasted like plastic. Hopefully, over time the muffin pan will eventually not make my food taste plasticky. It was very easy to clean too!",
