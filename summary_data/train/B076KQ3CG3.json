She's about 37\" tall and 30lbs, so a 2/4 might've been a better bet, but there wasn't any sizing guidance I could find beyond the age range. It would be nice if height/weight were correlated with sizes somewhere on the product description, so you could have a decent chance of choosing the right size.",

    "description": "\"One-piece swimsuit for little children ideal for any kind of water activity. It is a must-have for the swimming pool or to go snorkeling in the sea. The sides, the collar, and the sleeves are made of Elastane, an elastic fabric that works like a second skin, protecting against the harmful sun ray (UVA - UVB) and against jellyfishes. The front and the back part are made of 1.5 mm Neoprene to ensure warmth and to offer an extra protection against cold, perfect in case of prolonged water exposure or in windy days. The front zip (made of the quality YKK) makes easy the donning and doffing. The Swimsuit is designed for kids aged between 2 to 10 years old, refer to the size chart to get approximately the most suitable size for the child. The product is like a second skin, it is normal to feel it tight when worn. Rinse with clear water and let completely dry after use. The Kids Swimsuit is designed in Italy by Cressi and made in China. Cressi has been a brand pioneer in Scuba Diving, Snorkeling, and Swimming equipment since 1946. The product is covered by a 2-year limited warranty.\"",
