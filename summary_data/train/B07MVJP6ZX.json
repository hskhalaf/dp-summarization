      "text": "I was looking for some alternatives to wrapping paper for Christmas and birthday presents. I think the bags have cute designs, came with little gift tags and string. The fabric is thick enough to obscure what's in the bag. I feel like the smallest bags are a little hard to find a use for (gift cards, candy)? I can see how they would be nice goodie bags, but that's not what I was planning to use them for. Maybe I'll have to just find a use for them around the house instead of as gift bags. But for giving friends and family presents, I would prefer a larger array of bags.",

They come with gift tags on which I wrote \"Stay safe\". I wrapped the hand sanitizer in pink tissue and placed it the drawstring bag. So cute! I would definitely buy it again!",
