I have a 14.2 hand gaited gelding who I bought them for. The size small fit him perfectly. I had no issues with these boots and I used them on a camping trip this weekend with heavy rock. Over the whole weekend they held up, stayed in place. They were muddy on the outside but clean on the inside by the end of the day. Had no issues with anything getting inside them or slipping. Very happy!!! I ordered SIZE small/COLOR turquoise.",
