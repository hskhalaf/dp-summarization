I figured it could just be a manufacturer defect, so I went ahead and ordered a pair. Unfortunately, I have both issues with these headphones. The bass is as good as it gets, and the sound quality is fantastic as well. They're not really noise canceling at all, to be honest, but that's not why I got them. Since they're quite literally a pain to wear after 30 minutes or so, I might be getting a different pair of headphones sometime soon, which kinda sucks since the sound quality is amazing on these.",

They can also be used on my Xbox remote and when plugged into the Xbox controller it doesn\u2019t drain the battery. Did I say they are versatile? My only gripe is that when paired with multiple apple products it will drop the feed every thirty seconds until you turn off the Bluetooth on the paired device your not using. Once BT is disconnected it\u2019s fine.",

Very tight on my head though, you have to stretch it out by leaving the headphones stretched out on a small box. After a few days, it was wearable.

      "text": "So I paid about $100 for these after taxes, and I am very impressed with how good these sound. I bought these mainly because I am a bass freak and these definitely deliever. Skull candy covers your purchase for up to 2 years after buying these but I have a lot of confidence that these will last. They are so tight against my head sometimes it hurts but I think I'll get used to it. The sound is worth it. And the way it vibrates on my head makes these different than any other overear headphones I've tried. Jamming with that new song you just added is when you're gonna realize these headphones transports you completely.",

I've only had them 2 months and they are starting to crack where the headband retracts. I would have to say to anyone wanting these to stay away. I'm bummed the sound is great but there is no way they will last. If your thinking you will just use them at you desk and be gentle with them they will still break. It's the plastic they are made of it's brittle and will crack.",

First time trying SkullCandy and not impressed. Won\u2019t be buying from this company again. I got new headphones that just put these to shame.
