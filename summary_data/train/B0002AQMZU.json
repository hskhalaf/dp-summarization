My sweeties are too dear to me to take the chance so I am throwing out this product. The toothbrush design is ridiculously useless so also gets tossed.",

My 11 year old Boston Terrier is moderately cooperative with brushing, but just getting the tooth gel in her mouth leaves her breath fresh for 24 hours. !st week I used it she had some very mild bleeding from the brushing, but after 1 week it is gone and the gums seem much healthier. She does get her teeth cleaned at the Vet periodically, so she does not have terrible problems-just older doggie breath, which is now gone. Yeah.",

First, I don't have to use as much as other brands because this is a gel and stays on the brush better. This makes it the most cost-effective toothpaste I've found. Second, it foams up just the right amount to provide full coverage without making a mess. My dog seems pretty neutral on the flavor. She doesn't love it like some of the other brands I've tried, but she doesn't seem to dislike it either. I'm not using it for a treat, and the fact that she doesn't try to lick it off the brush actually makes brushing easier.",

She won't even let me get in her mouth. :( So, in other words, this was a total waste of money for me. My dog is a bichon frise (22 lbs).

Over all if your dog eats his or another animals turds then this will atleast cover up the smell while he licks the face of a person your not so fond of while you laugh inside",

No offensive scent. The rest of the ingredients are natural.
