There's no greater feeling than smashing your stemware in the neighbor's driveway at four in the morning while screaming the virtues of the Vivocci Elegent Plastic glasses, even if the police tazing you in front of your disappointed mother-in-law (who refuses to stop crying) is the last thing you remember before waking up next to a man with a raccoon neck tattoo in the county clink.

I'm a bit if a glassware snob, and really do not enjoy the feel of a plastic cup rim against my lips. These Vivocci stemless wine goblets are the exception - they are really nice to drink from. I recommend washing them by hand to preserve the quality. I would buy them again (and likely will, since I got four as an experiment before investing in a full set).",

These are not thin on top and actually appear flat not rounded and you can definitely feel it when you drink.

There's also a round 'frosted' dot underneath the glass; also, for me, a non-issue.

I have broken a wine glass on accident before, but these are great for what I need and can hold quite a lot. The cups feel a little big in my hand, but that's because I'm short with smaller hands. Overall, would recommend if you want to feel a little classy while being casual, but would not gift unless they were looking for party or pool glasses due to the very visible seams in the plastic that you can feel somewhat when you hold them. Otherwise they look and work great.",

We are very pleased with them and it has solved the problem of breaking wine glasses on the porch and patio. I highly recommend them to the other dudes that would be stuck with cleaning up shattered glass wine glasses!",

How do you tell people not to touch their glass after they use sunscreen? So much for outdoor versatility--I guess you can only use these after dark when you don't need sunscreen. So, so disappointed.",
