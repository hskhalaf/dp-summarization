It also includes a reliable WiFi connection and a fair array of music and video inputs, including cameras and PCs. Its a shame Sony doesn't upgrade to a full \"smartbox\", and then I'd give it the 5th star, for sure. As it is, Sony provides a good selection of apps, but many have made deals with Sony and require paid subscriptions. For $50, you can get an Android \"smart TV box\" and get thousands of FREE apps with FREE access to every movie and TV show ever produced, as well as LIVE TV and movies still in theaters.",

Sony's support line is not 24x7 so I waited until the next day. While trying to connect to support, ran through the wifi setup again and it connected immediately. Have watched one BluRay dvd, one standard dvd and listened to both Pandora and Slacker - all excellent quality. This unit replaces a \"new\"which failed in less than a year. Since I've always owned Sony TVs I thought I'd try the Consumer Reports top-rated Sony BluRay player. So far, I'm not disappointed.",

We had an existing wireless network and it was easy to connect the DVD player. There was a bit of running back and forth to the computer to get/input activation codes from Sony and Netflix. I played around with some of the other streaming options and they all worked well. Amazon streaming is included on the DVD player though it isn't listed in the specs above (it is advertised on the 570 but not this model for some reason). I'm happy with this purchase and would consider it an excellent gift option for family.",

I bought it to both play and stream and both features work great. We play DVDs, Blu-Rays and stream both Amazon and Netflix. No problems with any of it. It is so easy to use I even took it on vacation to use in our rental condo. My only complaint about the player is that I can't get Netflix subtitles to work. It is probably user error but that is all I have to complain about. Highly recommended (although I suspect it is no longer manufactured).",

The Bridesmaids, Goodfellas will look alike on DVD and Bluray, but Dark Knight will show the difference between DVD and Bluray! A little noisy when changing tracks or chapters on the disc. But no big deal, all disc players are electro-mechanical and would make some kind of noise.",

It was much easier to set up for her to watch Netflix on her TV than to show her how to hook her laptop up via HDMI. For internet connectivity I used hardwire ethernet. Since then, she has moved in with me and we now use it as a secondary bluray player in the bedroom. Having WiFi as a built-in option is nice since I avoided having to run an ethernet cable to the bedroom. While ethernet connectivity was flawless, on rare occasion the WiFi connection has dropped out. It doesn't occur frequently enough to be an issue.",

I was able to make connections, including the built-in Wi-Fi within 1/2 hour of opening the box. The picture quality is Sony quality, as desired. The Wi-fi Internet has worked without lost of a single signal while contected to online video. For us this is the perfect machine, we're so pleased we will be purchasing 2 more.",

Can't complain! This player can read any types of dvd/blu-ray discs. No stoppage encountered! Buy it if you can. I don't think this model is available for sale on Amazon. You can find it on other websites linked to Amazon.",

This unit provides the necessary wireless (built-in)connection to my media server. The only think lacking is the ability to prevent access to certain media (rated PG13 and up movies). I wish there were some parental controls available. Otherwise, this is a wise buy. At just over $100 (I paid $108) this is by far the best feature-rich WiFi unit on the market for the money.",

The remote control can be a little ackward to navigate with, but it was expected when you try to use a remote control as a \"keyboard.\" The menu is easy to navigate and understand. It is very similiar set up and feel to a Sony Playstation 3 (not surprising). I set up the Amazon Prime Instant videos and Pandora. Now my wife has instant movies and streaming music. I have not yet used it to watch any blu-rays, so I cannot comment to the quality of playback. Overall I am pleased with the purchase.",

    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n3D TECHNOLOGY CHECKLIST\nThis product is 3D-related. To help you get a great 3D experience, use the checklist below to ensure you have everything you need. 3D viewing requires:\n\nA Display\nFirst, you'll need a 3D-ready display--whether it's a 3D HDTV, 3D projector, or 3D computer monitor. These displays have more processing power than standard 2D models for displaying 3D images in rapid succession. A Source\nYour display may be ready for 3D playback, but you'll still need a device to read 3D content. This can be a cable box with a subscription to a 3D channel, a 3D Blu-ray Disc player, or a PlayStation 3 system. 3D Content\n3D content--the actual entertainment, in other words--will be played back using the source mentioned above, whether it's a 3D broadcast from your cable provider, a 3D Blu-ray Disc, or a 3D video game. 3D Glasses\nFor now, the vast majority of 3D HDTVs require glasses for 3D viewing. Many use powered \"active shutter\" glasses, others polarized \"passive\" glasses. You'll need one pair per viewer, and they'll have to be compatible with your display, whether they're the same brand, or a pair of \"universal\" glasses designed to work across brands. HDMI Cable\nTo connect your source (such as a 3D Blu-ray Disc player) to your display, you'll need a high-speed HDMI cable. Cables with this designation feature bandwidth speeds up to 10.2 Gbps (gigabits per second), for carrying the 3D signal without any loss of quality. \nIf you want to get more information about 3D, shop our 3D products, watch videos, or interact with other customers, we invite you to visit 3D 101, our customer center about everything 3D. INTERNET-READY DEVICES\nInternet-ready devices use your broadband connection to deliver dynamic content to your television, whether it's streaming video from Netflix, new music from Pandora, or a quick glance at today's weather forecast.\n\nAlthough there is overlap, each manufacturer offers a unique bundle of free or paid services, including streaming video and music, social networking apps, online photo galleries, news and financial updates, weather info, sports scores, and a variety of other smartphone-like applications.\n\nManufacturers continue to add new content to their offerings, keeping customers current through firmware updates, and making a bit of research a prudent step in your buying decision.\n\nLearn more about Internet-ready devices and HDTVs, how they work, what services are offered by different manufacturers, and exactly what you'll need to get started at our Internet TV 101 customer center.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2011\nEnjoy Full HD1080p Blu-ray Disc movies--even in 3D.

A perfect complement to any home theater, the BDP-S580 is ready for the future of home entertainment. When paired with your 3D HDTV and active shutter glasses, you'll get the ultimate at-home 3D viewing experience.\n\nSony's 3D Blu-ray Disc players will play 3D Blu-ray movies in Full HD 1080p, plus your collection of standard Blu-ray movies.
