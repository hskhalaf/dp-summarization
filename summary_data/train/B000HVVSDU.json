The wheels are too far back to act as a decent fulcrum, so if you have any weight on the platform, you have to keep a lot of pressure on the handle (pressing DOWN) to keep it balanced. Decent carts are designed so when the load is tipped back, there is at least some weight required to be held by hand...but this works opposite and makes pulling the cart troublesome.",

For a Costco run, or similar, I use a plastic egg crate down low and then stack a flat on top of the egg crate. Getting a little weight up higher makes this cart a little more balanced in real use.

The only reason we bought a new one is because we live in a salt air climate (Florida). We have rust around the wheels that was making it hard to open and close the wheels but they still worked.pressure. We were afraid we were going to break it so we got a backup just in case.",

It folds up very small and flat so it takes up almost no room in the car, which is important to me. Most of my car space is taken up by merch and supplies, but I slide this in on top or on the side in the tiny space left over. It's also very light and easy to handle and fold/unfold. It's easily one of the best things I've bought for my little shop!",
