We are a family of 5 with 3 kids under age 5 and we do several loads of laundry a day. This machine is a life saver and I love it so much. I will be so sad when it finally does need to be replaced. I will probably purchase this same machine again.",

Maybe in part do the the improper draining, residual soap and smell is also a problem. We fixed this by running while sitting in the bathtub. That seem to be the only way to get the unit to drain properly.",

Also for those of you who plan to use the machine in bathroom the drain hose needs to be lower than the unit to drain properly.

This unit only lasted a year. It no longer spins dry.. I have decided on a smaller unit for space savings purposes. It is a great little unit. And served me well for at least a year & 1/2.",
