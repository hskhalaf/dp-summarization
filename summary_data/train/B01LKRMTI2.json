I have noticed that if my bunny pees where the tray meets the wood it'll leak but that's the only spot. My bunny also likes to chew on the wood here and there so we bought some wood toys for him to chew instead. We change out the bedding twice a week and don't have a lot of problems with excess urine so maybe that's the difference with the other folks. So far this is a great purchase for the price.",

The height is pretty close at 46 inches. It's cute and was easy to assemble, however 4 pieces to ours were busted at the joints when we took the pieces out and required a significant amount of wood glue, clamps and reinforcing nails and screws. Pretty over priced when you consider that. I wouldn't buy it again, nor would I recommend it to anyone.",
