Granted, these are needle files, so they're not exactly robust. And, I was working on steel (making a round hole into a square hole), so I was applying moderate force. Still, I think they could be a bit more durable. Bottom line: I would recommend them - just be careful with how much force you use with them. As skinny as they are, they're easy to break.",
