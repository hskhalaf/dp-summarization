Feet don't necessarily sit flat like in some boots, but kind of in a \"toes up\" type of fit. I saw reviews that stated that the lace hooks at the top were flimsy and broke easily. I've not found that to be a problem. I feel secure walking on ice and in snow, quite unlike those uggly boots that have no tread.",

These are what I would call a mid hiker and really do not support your entire ankle. I would get something a little bit nicer next time for the extra money. Update: The teed wore off super fast and they don't have any grip Left, and after 10 months they are not waterproof anymore. At all. I had 1 pair of vasque and they lasted 15 years so that's a little disappointing, understanding that they were much more expensive. At this rate I'll End up spending more anyway.",
