I love the mirror top (who wouldn't like to believe that the cake continued on and on..) and the crystals were fancy yet still simple and pretty. The stand does have some tarnished/gold effect so don't expect it to be shiny silver, but I think it added to the nostalgic antique-y design. Overall it made my dessert look super exciting and gave it that extra touch for entertaining and also looks incredible on top of my cabinet when not in use (especially when the sun catches the crystals!).",

The top mirror portion is not level, giving a crocket appearance once the cake is displayed. I like the stand but pricing is high for the quality.
