Atelier stemware is machine blown in Parma Italy and made in Luigi Bormioli's proprietary SON.hyx material. SON.hyx produced glassware is an exciting fusion of elegance and technology. In addition to having ideal bowl shapes, fine rims and beautifully drawn stems, glassware made in SON.hyx is extremely brilliant in color, has a beautiful sound, maintains its clarity after thousands of industrial dishwashing cycles and possesses an extremely high level of durability.
