It's great for a family boat who are not interested in shooting the rapids.. Yet...",

Looking forward to doing a river float with it. We don't use the fishing rod holders. But the seats are comfortable. The cup holders are convenient. We've used the \"cooler\" beneath the center seat to store are wallets, keys and such. The paddle holders are super convenient for transport. It has just been such a joy to be out on the water with my family making lifetime memories. And it is this canoe that is giving us these opportunities.",

We aren't near the limit, and that probably wouldn't have made a difference, but it could mean the difference between taking and not taking the dog on a camping trip when we are loaded with gear.

My wife and I went out with our dog, and if any of us moved at all, the canoe started to tip. We couldn't turn around, reach for things...nothing. Every time my dog stood up, the canoe started to tip. It looks heavy and big, and it's even wide in the center, but the stability just wasn't there.
