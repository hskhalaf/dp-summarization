The posh styling comes with a well-crafted build that guarantees durability.However, the shoes are not just all about style and sturdiness as they\u2019re quite comfy too. In fact, they\u2019re excellent for just about any regular everyday activity including walking and driving. The only drawback to these shoes is that they\u2019re slightly heavy, but that\u2019s understandable since they\u2019re made out of smooth leather.",
