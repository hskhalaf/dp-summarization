Well...after three months of regularly hitting these balls into a net, they're holding up perfectly fine. Yes they have some wear and no, they're not the best balls in the world, but for the price, I'm very pleased. Maybe some of the reviewers have older kids who hit much harder, but for my kid, they're perfect. I've attached a photo, this is the average wear on these balls after three months....not bad in my opinion.",
