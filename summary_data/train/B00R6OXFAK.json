Which also brings up the issue that this thing is painted and slick, and the mattress does move around a little on the frame. If it bugs me more, I'll put some grip tape or other friction tape on the frame to keep things in place.",

      "text": "Got this for my nephew to put his bed on. It was easy to set up. However, seems like cheap metal that will bend easily with weight and movement. The metal has some jagged edges and doesnt have any grooves or anything to help keep the bed on. Being on a slick floor (no carpet) makes the bed and mattress move around a lot when you go to sit on it or get up. Hopefully it doesnt fall apart moving around so much. It definitely needs felt pads or something under the feet.",

I would just get the AmazonBasic one instead unless it lowers back to what it was. *** Good product, quality parts, easy to put together, no missing pieces. For those worried about mattress sliding, this product has a very sticky \"tape\" on 8 of the support bars and that will keep it in place. Once all the pieces are together it's impressively solid. If you're a heavy human significantly above your recommended weight range, or a couple of said heavy humans, this product is not for you.",
