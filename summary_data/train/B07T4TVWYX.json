It did not cause them any pain nor did it aggravate underlying problems. There were users, however, who\u00a0weren't pleased with the colorways the shoe came in. Nevertheless, the second version of the Hoka One One's Gaviota still proved to be a supportive shoe that allows runners to go the distance.",

        "One runner mentioned that he was able to run in the Hoka One One Gaviota 2 without experiencing any pain",

        "Some testers mentioned how great the shoe felt",
        "Unlike other shoes, it did not aggravate their knee and foot issues",
        "A lot of reviewers appreciated the level of comfort delivered",

        "Almost all female testers commented negatively on the color selection available",
        "It would have been better if there were more vibrant options, they said"

I run about 3-4 miles daily and the padding was already gone by a month. Foot pain and leg pain immediately came back as a result. On top of that, the shoes are very expensive. If you have the money, get them. However, be aware that the durability is questionable.",

I think they were an 8-9 maybe a 10 & now I have to do what really annoys me paid return or not I have to go to the UPS store & return them. These shoes may be good but I think they should say that perhaps we err on the smaller size & perhaps Customers should order 1 or 2 sizes larger.",

That\u2019s what supports flat feet and these were in the top 10. I bought them thinking that would be just okay but they were more than that. Having them on is like stepping on clouds but with stability. They look big but they are so light. If you have flat feet, get these. You won\u2019t be disappointed.",

Over the past few years I've gone through so many shoes trying to find a brand or pair that feels good and works for my job. Most days I would come home with pain in my legs,feet etc. Due to the nature of my job. These have almost completely fixed all of those issue! I'm getting older so some is to be expected but these shoes have been amazing. They're corrective and have really helped a lingering hip issue I've had which has resulted in just so much more pain relief I've had overall. Love them I'll be buying another pair!",
