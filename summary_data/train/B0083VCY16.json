This arrived with the letters rubbed off and is a completely flimsy toaster. I actually went to one of the big box stores to look at the REAL Krups toaster (same model) to verify that this one is in fact fake. Also, there is no stop/cancel button so your food will either burn or not toast completely. And if you touch anywhere around the top of the toaster afterwards, you will burn the crap out of your hands. Super dangerous, obviously being returned.",

This seems very flimsy compared to my old Breville, I'm surprised that it gets past the Consumer Product Safety Commission. As other reviewers have noted, it gets blisteringly hot on top, although it stays cool on the sides. It's easy enough to brush the top by mistake, and a child could easily get burned. Which I could overlook if it were a great toaster, but the range from a setting of 4 (out of 6) to 5 is the difference between crisp but barely brown and burned. Maybe with time I will find the optimal temperature--as one reviewer pointed out, it may depend on the type of bread.",

      "text": "Nice toaster for the money nothing fancy but it works well and toast very even. UPDATE: Still like toaster but one safety issue in my opinion. The feet of the toaster does not grab a hard smooth counter top. When you use the cancel button the pressure required to depress it causes the unit to slide. So you have to hold it in place with one hand and depress the cancel button with the other. Easy right? NO! This toaster shell gets hot so you cant hold it in place from top so its sides or back and get hot enough to sting you when you touch it.",

If you try pressing any of the buttons it just slides backwards until it backs into something. So good luck pressing that cancel button while the thing is 900 degrees and moving around everywhere. Next, the tines that hold the object to be toasted are too short, so if you attempt to toast something thin, it's falling into the toaster, never to be seen again. Last, it doesn't eject smaller items like muffins or pastries far enough, even with the pull up handle feature. It might be okay with some design changes, but don't bother until then.",

Other highlights include blue LED indicators, a high lift lever for smaller items, two removable crumb trays for easy cleaning, and cord storage to help keep countertops looking tidy.
