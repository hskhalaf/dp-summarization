      "text": "This desk was a lot smaller and shorter than I expected, with very little drawer space and surface area. It does look nice but here are my issues: 1. the top shelf is very flimsy and won\u2019t hold much weight, 2. the single drawer is so shallow that even my little cylindrical pencil sharpener won\u2019t fit into it. 3. The tilt up feature is basically useless because the ENTIRE surface area of the desk including the cup holders tilts up all together. I\u2019m constantly struggling with shifting my items around this tiny work space, and literally need another desk to put my stationary items if I ever want to tilt the surface up.",

So far ive had it a month and haven't used it much other than to keep things off my floor, the reasoning is because whatever art supplies you want to store onto the shelf and flimsy black plastic containers will guarantee to fall if the desk were to be bumped into.",

I wish the drawer was bigger so you could put an organizer in it and store more supplies. I also wish it would push in farther, it sticks out a bit.

Also, on Step 3 of the assembly instructions, part number 16 is reversed...the picture for the left one is mistakenly pictured on the right side and vice versa. If you install it the way it is shown in the diagram, the drawer will not close all the way and stay open about an inch. Written directions would have been more helpful, but diagrams were fairly clear.",

Took a while figuring out and scratched the paint a bit trying to do it myself, but eventually got it. Durability is good for the most part, don't tighten anything too tight or try to hold only half the base up, it can cause the metal to warp. When placed properly and used properly, everything is good. The glass shelf can handle 20 lbs, the glass table can handle 25 lbs. I am 5'6\", the table is perfect height for me.",

The second one was returned twice before the final one arrived without shipping damage.",

The bent part is one of the frame members, so I straighten it out and finished assembly. It is just frustrating to go through all hoops of purchasing, and hiding for the holidays, and then find out there are workmanship issues when you are against the kids expectations of their holiday gift.",

Cons: It took an extra two days to process; both pieces of glass have clear warning stickers that are way too hard to get off; the assembly takes a while. (On a side note, they also delivered the table to the wrong house, but that's because it's hard to find my house :p) Overall, this table is perfect for me and looks grand! I searched everywhere for a nice glass drafting table, and this one fits my needs exactly, it's very sturdy and it keeps your supplies very organized.",

More important (to me) was the assembly. An inexpensive consumer product should not, in my opinion, take 3+ hours to assemble. The directions were difficult to follow and not illustrated well. Finally, a couple of small parts (screws/bolts) appear to have been missing (it is also possible that I dropped them and cannot find them, to be fair). The material that comes with the packaging encourages the consumer to call their \"friendly\" service department number, which, it turns out, is disconnected.",
