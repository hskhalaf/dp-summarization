Once you hear the low battery warning in the ear buds, they'll be dead within a minute so there is no early warning about the battery life. To avoid this, best to check the buds battery life on the device (phone) and keep them charged using the case. Sound quality is ok. Overall nice product.",

They are also big and a little heavier than others I tried, so on long hot afternoons, they start to wear on you. However, the sound makes these my go to budget earbuds.

      "text": "Bought these to replace my semi-wireless headphones (which are bluetooth, but left and right are wired together). I primarily use them for running and they generally stay in my ear, unless I am too sweaty. They don't seem to be affected by sweat, but the position of the phone is critical for decent usage. Sadly, I prefer to keep my phone in my right back pocket, so these headphones cut out a lot and sometimes have a really weird delay of about a tenth of a second between the two sides, causing the sound to have an annoying echo. I'll keep using them, because I enjoy the truly wireless feature, but I'm eagerly looking for a replacement with better technology.",

I can't even listen with one earbud because it irritates the heck out of me. The only saving grace is that when I listen with both buds, they lose signal independently of each other so I don't notice as much. Overall, even though I like the sound these have I would not buy them again because of the bluetooth issues.",

The charging case is sturdy and the magnets are perfect to keep case together and buds safely charging. The prongs in case can stick in the down position and bud won't charge if you don't check them before you charge. They also are the best fitting of any earbud I've used. Very comfortable and small enough to not be a hindrance with movement. I've never had one fall out which is a 5 star bonus!",

My wife went for a walk this morning and the right bud lost it's charge?? Not sure what happened to it? I have placed both of them back on the charger to recharge. I guess we will see what happens. So far, i'm pretty disappointed. Any advice from Upperfit certainly would help.",

When using only one it consistently beeps in my ear. And the sound fluctuates up and down even with the volume on max. If I had it to do all over again I would probably choose another brand.",
