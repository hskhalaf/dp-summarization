Continues to spin for a bit after let off the trigger. Greasing it helped a little but did not fix my issue. Still works fine still has the power will continue to use it till it goes out.",

I have spent weeks trying to remove this bolt using the traditonal methods (heat, penetrating oil, etc). Next, a 46mm castle nut torqued over 300lb. First, I tried by hand with a breaker bar with a 3ft pipe over the handle. I stood on it and bounced but could not get it to loosen. Then I tried the Ingersoll Rand impact. Problem solved! It handled the huge nut with ease. Dont forget to get the red cover sleeve to protect your investment!",
