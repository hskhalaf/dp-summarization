      "text": "A good addition to my modest collection of wine glasses. But it's a bit much that Riedel has decided to offer slightly different sizes and shapes of glasses for each major type of wine. This is the ultimate in what economists and call \"product differentiation,\" a well-worn marketing strategy to expand the market for the original product. Offering wine-specific glasses is based on the dubious assumption that a wine will taste better in a glass that is designed especially for it. Red wines might arguably need bigger glasses for wine fresh out of the bottle that needs to breathe a bit -- for sippers who can't wait for that first sip. But a little patience eliminates even that justification.",

I keep an inventory of at least 4-6 of these stemless as well as 4-6 of the stemmed Riedel glasses, but the stemmed Riedel glasses seem to \"survive\" the dishwasher less than the stemless ones.
