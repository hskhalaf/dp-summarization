It does pretty good on splatter control. When all is said and done though I don't think the ultimate splatter control screen has been created yet - it would require 2 screen layers where the holes offset each other. But that would not be fun to clean as grease would be trapped between those two screen layers.",

In addition (photo) one part of the screen that was not directly over the cooking surface has scorched on the top but not underneath. Neither soft scrub sponge nor a bristle brush has removed the black marks. Will have to purchase a steel wool pad and try again. Not certain whether to recommend or not. No opinion on sturdiness or durability because only used once so far.",

The holes in the stainless steal are larger than those in a wire mesh screen and do allow some oil to splatter our of the pan. When I purchased it I loved the idea of a quality, stainless steal splatter screen that would last a long time and work for whatever size pan I needed it for, however this doesn't do as efficient of a job as I'd like.",
