It only works with ONE cable company's VOIP and the description does not state that. I found out after wasting 3 hours with Mediacom trying to get it to work. Mediacom said call Motorola so I did. I sat on hold for 45 minutes!!! listening to Motorola music and being told every 2 minutes that I was next in queue for 45 minutes.... Horrible customer service. When the gal finally answered, she was rude and said that they no longer support any other cable companies for VOIP.",

However it (1) does not come with a battery, (2) amazon does not sell it (3) Motorola does not have it on its website and (4) when you get to Motorola support (after 45 minute wait) they know nothing. So if a ned for back up power is of any concern or you just want peace of mind, get yourself another model. Note the 7711 (without battery) is fine and I\"m happy with it. But I would not have bought if I had known about the lack of a battery availability.",

However, if you choose the right model, like this one, I am beating the cable company who charges approx $10 per month for the modem. The tech agreed with me and hooked it up quickly! So, buy your modem and don't rent. Your paying interest, essentially, for something over the course of 2 years, rather than just buying it outright!",
