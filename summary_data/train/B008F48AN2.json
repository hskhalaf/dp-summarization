There are a ton of exercises that you can do with this. I was hoping to be able to take it to the beach with me, but it is too heavy and bulky to do that, but it doesn't take up too much space in my condo. It is easy to assemble, made from strong, durable material and wilI be a part of my fitness routine for years to come. I am extremely satisfied with this product",

If it were any taller one would have to jump up to get in to starting or ending position which could place undue stress on the shoulders and could also cause injury if your muscles are blown at the end of the set. This is perfect height to pretty much step into and the spacing bewtween the grips is where it needs to be to avoid hyper extension and injuries. All in all great product at a great price",

This could be irrational thinking, but the tool doesn't lend itself to confidence and safety. I have tried on both carpeted and rubber surfaces, but the feeling is the same. That's it! The problem is not in the material, but instead, the construction. To alleviate this, the bottom bar requires lengthening to expand the support and widen the dip path. In the meantime, I may attach a sled to the front and turn it into a toboggan.",

It\u2019s not so short that weights hanging from my dip belt would hit the floor. Cons: At 175 lbs + 60 lbs hanging from my dip belt, the handles begin to spread as the frame flexes when I dip. I don\u2019t get the feeling it would collapse, but it\u2019s unnerving nonetheless. I see why there\u2019s a deluxe model with triangular reinforcement plates at the bottom. Other thoughts: Foam grips, while comfy, are not my preference. I might not wait for them to wear or tear before I replace them with grip tape.",

I wouldn't think it would be that difficult to make the height adjustable. If I could adjust the height, it would be a 5*. It's still usable. But, I'd prefer it to be a few inches higher. Also, you have to position you hands about half way in the middle of the grip. If you place your hands on the ends, it tips a bit. Overall, it's a good product. I use it a lot and like it. Just a few slight tweaks would make it awesome, though.",

      "text": "For the price you really can't complain. Took maybe 10 minutes to assemble solo. I recommend a ratchet with either a 17mm socket or 11/16, a shallow socket may not cut it. I personally used a 17mm ratcheting open end wrench. I'm 5'10\" 175lbs and have no issues doing deep dips. The unit is pretty sturdy on tile and even better on rubber work out matts. I don't see the grips lasting very long though. That's about my only gripe.",
