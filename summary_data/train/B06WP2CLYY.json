I \"mopped\" my entire 900 sq. ft. apartment in less than 15 minutes, with very, very minimal effort. Just turn it on, occasionally spray the cleaning solution and go. Seriously, it couldn't be any easier. The white microfiber cloth afterwards was BLACK on the bottom, so I know it worked...and I thought my floors were clean!!! Just spend the $99 and get it, and never handle a drippy mop again.",

Make sure to clean the floor first and then let the Bissell work it\u2019s magic. I like that the sprayer is focused on what is just ahead versus the way the many competitor products spray everything within a 10foot radius. The cleaner works quietly and is simple to use. It is like having a mini floor buffer.",

      "text": "I rarely write reviews for products, but this thing is absolutely amazing. I've always hated mopping; it's sweaty work, and with three floors of hardwood and tile, it's time consuming. I used the spinwave for the first time today and I was blown away. It's super easy to use, and I was able to get the whole house done in a fraction of the time it used to take me. I love that it angles down low enough to fit under most of my furniture as well. Guess I won't be putting off mopping floors anymore!",

It doesn't really clean anything off the floor at all. It just pushes the dirt around. As someone with a toddler and German Shepherd, I thought this product would help reduce the time it takes to clean. However, I just have to add this to the sweeping, mopping, deep cleaning regime I already had. It does make the floors look nice, but that's only after I've done 10 other chores to make sure there isn't a single thing on my floor before using this product.",
