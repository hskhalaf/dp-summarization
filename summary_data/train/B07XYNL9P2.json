      "text": "Solid leather shoe with a legit boot sole. Shoe/Boot hybrid. The el Camino of footwear. Exactly what I needed. Leather mid rise keeps my ankles secure. I always swap to orthotic insoles, and these were very standard with the swap. They fit like every Chuck Taylor and the sole slips less than standard chucks except on wet smooth concrete surfaces (they tend to slip on a couple of the sidewalks with exposed rocks, when raining- when dry, no slippage noted) love these, would buy more in other colors if they had my size. My favorite CTAS to date-",

I tried on different thickness of socks, tried not tieing them all the way up, etc. But they still started to rub a blister on my ankle after taking a short walk in them. The problem might be that I am a woman with small ankles, that is the only thing I could think of because otherwise they seemed to fit fine. I ordered a 6 as a size 8 woman...really wished they worked :-(. Returning was was super easy though.",
