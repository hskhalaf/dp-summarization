      "text": "This system was purchased for a 2015 Nissan Sentra. Once installed, the unit wouldn't work properly with an iPhone 7 and the rear back up camera only worked when the camera function was selected. My husband spent hours on the phone with tech support, who verified that all the wires were properly routed. The audio system is being returned for a refund, and we are headed to eat Buy to find a suitable replacement.",

      "text": "If you need a solid CarPlay unit at a good price, this is the one for you. The touchscreen is capacitive when competitors at this price are using cheaper resistive screens. The interface is pleasing and easy to navigate. As of early 2018, this is the best CarPlay unit on the market for its segment. Bluetooth mic quality is as good as OEM setups I have used on other cars. Setup is easy and the unit comes with all the necessary adapters including remote power for a backup camera which is a nice feature. If you have an older car and want to spruce it up a bit, buy this radio without hesitation.",

      "text": "I added this to my 2006 Ford Van including the microphone and a backup camera. This is a HUGE upgrade and works almost flawlessly. The only caveat is that is is bright at night. That aside, I HIGHLY recommend this especially if you have an iPhone. Apple CarPlay is pretty spot on. Messages are super easy via voice as it reads to you and you can dictate. Everything else is very cool and your Apple Music integration is flawless. Other good additions are Whats App, navigation is cool and podcast work well also. Well done & easy to install!!",

We needn't have worried. I was easily able to connect the deck to my smart phone via Bluetooth. The AM/FM radio also works great and I can plug my iPod into a USB port in the glove box so that it charges while it plays. The sound is fine for what we need and it can easily be adjusted to focus the volume to different spots in the vehicle. Bottom line: This serves our needs perfectly.",

I was able to make phone calls easily through the voice commands and the sound quality was really good even with the old speakers in my car.
