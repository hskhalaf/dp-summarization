      "text": "I recently got into this line of figures and missed out on the originals, including the 1.0 Frieza (Freeza in Japan). So I quickly decided to purchase this re-release and I am glad I did. The sculpt is just like the original just slightly modified, especially in the head. He has excellent blue shading throughout, which makes the figure pop. Frieza comes packed with accessories as you can see in my pics. Looks great with the Warrior Awakening Goku figure. Overall, I'm highly satisfied with my purchase. This figure is a must if you missed the 1.0, are a fan of Frieza, or just like cool figures\ud83d\udc4c",

And let me tell you, at least in my humble opinion, that the newer version of Frieza just looks so much better than the original. The overall colors of the new Frieza looks better than the old one. Although the older Frieza\u2019s face plates to me they look just a little more better than the newer version. But hey, at least we have this new version at a lower price! I just wish they could\u2019ve released the same face plates as the old one, but this is just my opinion. This figure is a good buy and I totally recommend it \ud83d\udcaf%!!!",
