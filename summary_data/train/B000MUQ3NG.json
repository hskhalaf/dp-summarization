      "verdict": "While it has a few minor flaws, Kodak's Wi-Fi-enabled EX-811's strong feature set, good image quality, and online integration with the company's free EasyShare Gallery online photo-sharing service, make this frame a top choice in the digital photo frame category.",
      "pros": [
        "Built-in wireless connectivity allows you to tap into your home wireless network and stream images from your Windows PC or the Kodak EasyShare Gallery online photo-sharing service",
        "The frame has a bright, relatively sharp 8-inch diagonal display, 128MB of built-in memory, plus slots for virtually all memory card types, as well as USB connectivity for computers and thumbdrives",
        "The EX-811 supports MP3 and video playback (with sound), ships with a small remote control, and is compatible with PictBridge-enabled printers",
        "Lastly, it's easy to set up and has a well-designed interface"

After attempting to hook this through my home wireless network for a second time, it didn't take more than 5 minutes! Music and pictures are loaded and all is well! I have the clear frame in the mail as well so, that I can change it from the black. I love this product! Not having to worry about having enough storage space is exceptional and so worth the extra money for those with wireless networks.",

Note however that I have seen this frame freeze up (just while being on and doing its thing), and thus needing a power-off-power-on cycle (no need to unplug, as there is a switch). For the price, feature packed!",

Went to software to see if I needed to Sync it and the software doesnt recognize/acknowledge the frame (only cameras). Also, cant get Kodak picture transfer software to work to transfer files via computer/USB. The Kodak website contact/chat room is closed and, of course, there's no \"800\" number to call anyone either. Should have done more research before buying!",

That single issue is enough for me to only give this 2 stars. After all, for those non-graphically inclined, it would render the product useless.

SD card has to be pulled out and re-inserted each time it comes on to see pictures on card (this is the biggest minus). Downloading from Kodak network is very slow - almost not usable. Overall - I would recommend. Probably wouldn't pay for WiFi capability next time.",
