Handle feels a bit flimsy/flexy, but not too much so. Would like to be able to manually select blade speed, instead of the \"load\" determining the speed.

      "text": "Just used this for the first time and I'm very satisfied with it. I used to have an electric mower and although the cord was annoying, the lack of buying gas and tuneups was worth it. But with the battery I can mow the lawn in less time without managing the cords. Part of my yard is on the other side of a street and stringing the cables was a pain. I got the 4ah battery and after finishing the lawn I had 2/3rds left. The only thing I would do different if I had it to do over was get the two 2ah lighter batteries.",

I got home from work late and didn't have time to switch it out of mulching mode. Even with wet, tall grass and in mulching mode, it did a great job! The yard looks great. If I started walking faster or went into a thicker area, it would audibly use more power, which was neat. It never stalled and cut the front and back yard with juice to spare. This is more than enough lawn mower for me. So far I'm very happy with my purchase. Hopefully it'll hold up.",

It took four attempts to get my yard completely mowed. I think this would work better for people with patio homes. Also, my yard is flat, and I still had to push a little hard since it isn't self propelled.",

      "text": "This mower does everything a good gas mower does without the noise, mess and pollution of a gas mower. The metal body feels better than the all plastic brands. I have had no problem mowing my .3 acre lawn, even wet. It will mow my lawn twice before I need to recharge. My only worry is that there are some sensitive circuits inside and I know that if it gets wet or damaged, the whole mower is junk.",

No problem, I just grabbed the other fully charged battery, dropped the other on the charger and went back to finish. I thought the weight was going to be an issue but this thing is really light and easy to push. I like that it folds and can stand up straight, makes it easy to keep clean.",

In any case, has been used on a rut filled yard with roots and hills w/4AH battery. No broken perch. Very pleased. No maintenance going into next season has me excited!",

Partially cut grass comes out from the discharge chute and directly underneath. This forces you to pull the mower backwards over the mounds of grass from the previous cut. 2. The mower has two power modes. However, unless your cutting very short grass AND gong very slowly, it jumps to the high power mode. The lower power is only used when just starting the mower. I would not buy this mower again. Unless you're cutting grass that isn't high enough to cut in the first place,",
