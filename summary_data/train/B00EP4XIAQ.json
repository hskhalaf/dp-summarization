I got this for my 6 year old because I believe he has ADHD. He struggles to stay seated when it's time to eat, or in class. But with this seat he is able to stay in his seat during meal times, which has almost NEVER happened. He is even able to focus more on class work because he can wiggle around in his seat thanks to this. It's amazing!!!",

One side has longer nubs that poke into your backside more than the other side. Both sides can be used, it just depends on your child's preference for how much sensory input is needed. It stays in place on a chair without slipping. And, the best part, it really helps my child focus!",
