I can set up alerts/phone notifications to get just enough information without be overloaded.

And ALL the cool things you can do with Alexa integration. arm - disarm by voice, guard and arm simultaneously, announce what's open, trigger routines, I'm still finding things I can do with Alexa. If I need to expand the price won't kill me :) teaching the family how to use it was easy peesey. each having there own code is a plus something they can easy remember. Yes I would Definitely recommend!",

      "text": "If you're considering a Ring, and especially if you have used other alarm systems - BEWARE. This system does not let you set rules to disarm automatically. It's easy to set up, at a great price point, etc. But when I went to do the final steps, I got stuck b/c I know I won't remember to disarm every morning. An automatic setting like this shouldn't be missing, especially from a customer-obsessed company like Amazon. Now I've got the whole system set up, and can't use it.",
