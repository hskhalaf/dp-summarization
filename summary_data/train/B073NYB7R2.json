I am a grown man with strong hands and have to use my dominant hand to lock these locks. I can barely do it with my weaker hand. I expect my wife will be unable to lock them at all.",

Tumblers work well and are very easy to rotate and read. The push button release works as intended to unlock and lock. Also has a red indicator that pops if your lock is opened by the TSA. Due to the locks having the TSA key lock this should prevent your locks from being cut during inspections. Received 4 for $19 bucks so $5 each, I feel this to be a good and fair price given the metal construction, quality and overall flawless workings",

It gave me a peace of mind knowing that when I stowed the bag and dozed off to sleep, the contents are protected. I'd recommend it to anyone who's looking for a simple TSA-approved lock.",

The best thing about this lock is the indicator pin that pops up if TSA opens it. I wish every lock had that option! But it\u2019s only good if you use a luggage like a hard case.
