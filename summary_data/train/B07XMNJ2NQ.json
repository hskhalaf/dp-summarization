They complimented its lightweight and comfortable build, true-to-size measurement, fashionable design and color options, and narrow fit.

In conclusion, this model was considered good enough for casual use and light walks, but may not be comfortable and durable enough for more demanding purposes.",

The color (mauve) is really feminine and cute and not too pink. I've already gotten a bunch of complements on them!",

The cushions are not necessary as they are comfortable without them, but as I mentioned I have foot issues (plantar fasciitis) and the sneakers are a game changer. I use them for exercising and lots of walking. And the price? You can't beat it!",
