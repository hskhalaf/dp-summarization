Easy to slide in and out of a pocket - great protection without excess bulk.

I don't recommend doing this on purpose, but my phone has tumbled down the stairs and the screen has remained intact. It has dropped face down and remained intact and functional. This definitely protects the phone from dust, dirt, and occasional drops. I trust Otterbox's Defender line to protect my phones. I'll keep buying them as long as they keep making them.",

It fits perfect and doesn't lift off the screen. I dropped my S8 multiple times outside with zero problems.",

      "text": "OtterBox cases are always durable and do their job well. This is my second time purchasing this case for a Galaxy S8 because how well my personal one has held up. The only issues I have are that if you do not likely bulky phones that this case will make the phone a decent bit larger and after a year or longer of opening and closing the charge port cover the rubber cover started to not stay as firmly secured. It is not the most flashy case but if you prioritize protecting your phone over how it looks OtterBox is always a instant purchase when I get new phones be it personal or for work.",
