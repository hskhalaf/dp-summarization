It's made of a hard plastic and the small, thin felt padding they have on it is not enough to cover the entire plastic part and so the hard plastic presses up against my skull and is a bit uncomfortable.

      "text": "Especially since I've been in a minor bike accident, I think everyone should wear helmet especially if they are doing something other than going uphill..things just pop out of nowhere and you just get unlucky, getting into a bike accident doesn't seem much to do with your biking skill level. It's bulky but it has a dial on the back and fits my head pretty well. Yup I wish it was less bulky but for 20 bucks, not a bad design either. It keeps you safe! All the helmets are safe regardless of their price, so if you are okay with something that is not as compact, just get this one and you'll use it well.",

In addition to the adjustable chinstrap, you can adjust the straps that go up the side of your head thanks to a locking mechanism to adjust where the straps fit around your ears. The adjustment dial to secure the helmet around the crown of your head is key. The design is pretty nice for a sub-$30 helmet. I am pleased with the quality at this price point.",

After a visit to the emergency room, I had no broken bones or neck fractures - I never use to ride with a helmet but decided a month ago I should get one. Thank God! Saved my life!
