Wayyyyy cheaper than stock towing mirrors option from Ford and I don't have to deal with oversized mirrors when not towing cuz I can simply remove these when not in use! Would go this route again.",

      "text": "After using these mirrors for almost two years, they perform well overall. Obviously, being manually adjusted, it can take several attempts to find that happy medium for highway use and backing. The driver side mirror didn't tighten very well with the provided shim and thumb screw. Consequently, that one blew off on the highway, so it had to be replaced. The mirror itself seems to be of good quality and remains to be clear, free of any flaws with the materials. I use mine towing a 5th wheel camper, and do believe these are the best extension mirrors you can find, just really pay attention to any slightly loose fitting. It should be snug when it's right.",

There is a wedge the holds them on with out shacking or marring the OEM mirror. The extra mirror was too stiff when it was unpacked so I used silicone spray on the inside where the mirror pivots. I worked it in before putting them on piror to their second use. Without the silicone it seemed the mirrors would break when adjusting them. I was looking at the hundred dollar plus tow mirrors, but for me these will do the job.",

Nobody makes a slip-on mirror for the Expedition and for some stupid reason Ford had to use different mirrors on Expeditions even though it's the same chassis as F150s. While they do not technically fit properly they will slip over the top but not quite over the bottom. In my case I just put two self-tapping screws into the back of the mirror to attach it to the factory mirror and it holds great and looks fine. Doesn't vibrate like the \"universal\" ones do so it's actually useful.",

I got tired of having to manually adjust them based on the trailer i was towing. They work well for the price. I put the small convex mirrors on them to try to help with visibility but that didn't really help all that much. If you frequently tow different trailers you will have to adjust these every time which gets tedious. It goes faster with a second person. I would just save your money and buy the true factory style tow mirrors which have much better visibility and are powered.",

I included a pic showing how the top fits on the mirror and it is plain to see that these mirrors are not molded to fit the stock 2006 mirror. Overall, very disappointed.",

      "text": "We bought these mirrors for our 2008, Ford F150 pickup. According to Amazon's \"make sure it fits\", they would not fit. However; the manufacturers website had recommended this model number for our pickup. They actually fit perfectly. The factory mirrors on our pickup have the LED turning indicators at the bottom. The mirrors fit securely with very little vibration. Our drive was down highway for several miles and then 5 miles of washboard road. Great deal.",

I rated them down one point due to the fact that the right hand mirror will not stay adjusted, it seems to vibrate downward and outward--a minor problem IF I remember to readjust each time I stop. Also, I had to drill holes in the bottom to allow the courtesy light on the bottom of the mirror to be functional. I would suggest that CIPA could do that and it would not be a problem for vehicles not equipped with the courtesy lights. Aside from these two problems, they are easy to install and remove, and improve rearward visibility when towing a travel trailer tremendously. I highly recommend them.",

Regardless of when these events occur the common problem is that they can create significant and potentially dangerous challenges to drivers' rear field of view. For over 20 years CIPA Custom Tow Mirrors have provided the optimal solution to deal with this problem quickly, effectively and inexpensively, no matter the make and model of your vehicle. Augmenting your vehicle's standard OEM rearview mirrors CIPA Custom Tow Mirrors are aerodynamic, sliding snugly over your vehicle's existing rearview side mirror and feature an additional mirror on the outboard end that can be independently adjusted. The result is a new and improved rearview mirror assembly that extends your towing vision, without obstructing your existing vehicle mirror. \n\nDURABLE CONSTRUCTION AND EASY INSTALLATION\n CIPA Custom Tow Mirrors are made from durable ABS plastic, with the additional outer mirror built into each, constructed of scratch-resistant glass. This rugged construction ensures years of unobstructed towing use that can be counted on in the most demanding of situations. Mirror installation is tool-free and when done correctly and carefully poses no risk of scratching to your vehicle. CIPA Custom Tow Mirrors attach to your vehicle's existing side rearview mirrors using a secure wedge-lock design. Once the Custom Tow Mirror's main section is slid over your vehicle's OEM rearview mirror, the high-strength plastic wedge included for each mirror is placed between them. The wedge is in turn held in place with a threaded knob that passes through the towing mirror to press the wedge against the original mirror with the end of the wedge holding the towing mirror firmly in place. In addition, included neoprene tape pieces are placed on the wedge and also inside of the towing mirror during the first installation. This tape acts as a cushion that protects the vehicle mirror from scratches and damage that could inadvertently be caused during installation of the towing mirror. Together this makes CIPA Custom Tow Mirrors extremely easy to install in seconds by virtually any driver, of any level of experience and the perfect midline priced solution for all your towing needs. \n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX*\n * 2 \u2013 CIPA Custom Towing Mirrors (driver's side and passenger side)\n * 2 \u2013 Installation wedges (driver's side and passenger side)\n * 2 \u2013 Long strips of neoprene tape (for inside of mirror)\n * 2 \u2013 Short strips of neoprene tape (for wedge)\n * 1 \u2013 Illustrated instruction sheet\n\nONE-YEAR LIMITED WARRANTY\n CIPA products are warranted to be free from defect in material and workmanship for one year.
