It's not strongest crib in the world, but it gets the job done. I did see a lot of bad reviews of how easily it chips and let me tell you, it has nothing to do with the fact that this crib is only $100 because the $500 crib we originally purchased for my daughter still chipped when she would bite it! Little teeth are SHARP!",

So overall if you just want a crib this one is great and pretty easy to assemble. But if you're looking for something truly convertible maybe consider your other options.",

We initially put duct tapes around it to cover the ripped up sharp wooden pieces as it had taken so much time to assemble it and we thought it would be too much trouble dissembling it and returning it. However, now that we think about it again it is a safety issue and we would not keep it even if it is free.",

Regardless of the weight of my 5 month old, it shouldn\u2019t do this as it\u2019s marketed as a convertible crib. The bowing poses a major safety issue as baby cannot roll out of the dip in the center easily.

It has had to be tightened a couple of times but, that is to be expected. Plus I've had a toddler and a preschooler jumping on it. We currently have it as a toddler bed and I'm impressed with how low to the floor it goes. My son could fall off and not get hurt or be startled out of sleep. I highly recommend this crib for anyone who wants a great looking crib at a great price!",
