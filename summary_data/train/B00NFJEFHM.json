      "text": "Incredible flavor, a bit more vinegar than many hot sauces - but a really good vinegar taste! . My husband raves every time he uses it. My son also really like the garlic hot sauce (we did the gift box too). After you try this, Louisiana hot sauce (or the other dozen standard store varieties) absolutely will not stand up. I bought this the first time as a novelty stocking stuffer for adults, but never expected the rave reviews. My husband mentioned he would buy this in a gallon jug if available. I'm not a huge fan of any hot sauce personally, but must admit this stuff is really good. I would 100% recommend trying it out.",

The flavor, degree of hotness and consistency is right on and the label is great as an added bonus. We had a Bloody Mary competition at Hop-O-Nose marina on Saturday between all the boat owners. I always have made a Cajun style Bloody Mary which everyone loved but when I replaced the Golds with Zombie Cajun it took it over the top and we won hands down! There was some very stiff competition but all agreed the Zombie Cajun was the best ever. Your sauce has now replaced all others in our house. Thank you for the buzz.",

It is also blends very well with food because it is not too vinegary. I can taste the salt, but it is not too salty and the salt helps balance the taste. Most hot sauces set the serving size just at 1 Tsp. Zombie Cajun sets their serving size at 1 Tbsp, which is much more in keeping with how hot sauce should be used in my judgment. Excellent sauce!

      "text": "I'm glad it was cheap. A little more spice than kechup. It does have a cajun flavor but don't think of this as a hot sauce as I did. On the heat scale it would be way down near the bottom. I used it as I would Tabasco Sauce and was no where near it. Even their Chipotle Sauce is hotter. Can be used as a cajun sauce I guess. Maybe in days gone by they made a good hot sauce but not now. Filed in the recycle bin.",
