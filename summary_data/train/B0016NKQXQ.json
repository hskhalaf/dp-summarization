I cannot recommend it. Dave",

The thing I really like about this frame is that all my parents & in-laws have to do is basically turn the thing on and watch the pictures--I can do all the setup beforehand. The picture quality is very good, I think.",

If their product is defective, they replace it no questions asked and they cover all shipping. Not true with Kodak. So buyers, beware. I had to put 1 star only because I can't leave it zero.

The faces in such pictures are distorted, as for example nostrils are magnified, lips are squared-off, etc. Close-ups look much better as there are a lot more pixels dedicated to represent each feature, allowing the natural shape of the facial features to emerge.",
