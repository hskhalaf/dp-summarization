Start up is extremely fast, apps launch up right away & shuting down is faster than before. I own a 500GB 7200 rpm and love it, until I saw a friend of mine upgrade to a 64GB SSD by Crucial. Overall performance is very good even compared to newer drives. Firmware update is quick. It was very easy to install and after reading the reviews, I trust that this drive will last the life on my mac.",

This SSD is still going strong but just does not have enough space and does not have the performance that I need now. Moving this to an older rig, this did suffice to use with working with photoediting, video rendering and editing along with some medium high performance gaming. While it is disappointing that the new line of Crucial SSDs have not lived up to its previous m4 line, I hope that in the future it does change and can once again compete with top brands.",

It's ridiculously fast (415 MB/s) and it uses the more reliable 25nm two layer NAND (which has twice the expected life of the newer TLC triple layer NAND). I have this, a Samsung 830 and the new 840 Pro as well as the new Crucial M500; and there is zero perceptible difference between them. The only difference I ever noticed is, the Crucial is less expensive. They're all MLC (2 layer NAND). Don't let the MTBF (mean time before failure) being the same fool you, manufacturers can fudge those numbers as they're \"estimated\". MLC NAND is much more reliable than TLC (like what's in the cheaper SSD drives e.g. Samsung 840 Evo)",

I've been extremely impressed by the support from Crucial in the way of firmware updates; I believe that there have been 4 updates since I purchased the drive. Like most SSD's, this one is extremely fast and makes my system extremely responsive. Originally had Win 7 on it (boot time including POST was 20 sec) and now have Win 8 (boot time including POST 12 seconds). I've read enough about SSD failures that I do regular system images, but, this drive has not skipped a beat - highly recommended!",

I get similar results from an Intel 520 series SSD on another system. However, the Intel drive costed twice as much! I won't make that mistake again.",

Just have to keep in mind to pair it with a good processor and motherboard. Minimum 1.5Ghz dual core is when I started to see real improvements in response times from this HD.",

      "text": "I have had the 64GB model installed for a couple of months as a boot/program drive in my new system with an AMD FX-4100, ASRock Ex4 and 8GB of Kingston HyperX with Win 7. This is the fastest booting system I have ever built or used. Time from pressing the power button to the fully running is less than 15 seconds and that includes a 3 second delay for the BIOS page. Lightroom 4, PSE 10 and all my other programs now start in just a couple of seconds. I only wish I had gotten the 128GB or 256GB version, but the price was quite a bit higher at the time.",

With the I7 core, the computer was competent enough. This SSD storage solution, hands-down, trumps all these benefits. Granted I cleaned the OS and optimized the system.

      "text": "I was leery on getting this drive, this is my first SSD. I wanted the 256Gb to be my minnimum but this one had a good price on it. Installation went smoother than I could have ever hoped for. When it came in I imaged my reqular drive. Then placed the boot image and the system image on this drive. At first it wouldn't boot, but I had forgotten to tell the bios it was my boot drive. Then it still wouldn't boot so I put in the orginal Windows DVD and fixed the boot partition, then it worked and has been working great eversince. I would recommend this drive to all my friends and family.",

      "text": "Drive is small, quiet, and very fast. My Windows performance disk index went from 5.9 (which was the bottleneck) to 7.7 (on a scale of 8). I had a difficult time transferring the operating system initially- my Windows 7 was intended for upgrade only, not a fresh install, and installing WIndows XP and then re-upgrading would have been a real pain (and I'm not sure XP would have liked the drive). Fortunately, I discovered \"Paragon Migrate OS to SSD 2.0\" - [...] , which was well worth the $20 it cost for the trouble it saved. It copied the OS over with just a few clicks, and it's worked perfectly since then.",

    "description": "Capacity:256GBFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n\nTHE CRUCIAL M4 SSD\n\n\n\n\nAward-winning quality. Award-winning performance.The award-winning Crucial m4 SSD delivers powerful performance gains for SATA 6Gb/s systems. Designed to empower your system, the Crucial m4 SSD offers faster application load times, faster boot times, and increased durability compared to a traditional hard drive. The results speak for themselves: blazing-fast sequential read speeds of up to 500 MB/s for any file type. \n\nCutting-edge technology. Quality component testing. Built with advanced controller technology, Micron proprietary firmware and high-speed synchronous MLC NAND, the Crucial m4 SSD is engineered to deliver consistent, blazing-fast SSD performance. From the extensive research and development that led to its ultimate design, to the hours of testing and validation spent on each NAND component, to rigorous compatibility testing in the Crucial Performance Labs to ensure component functionality, the Crucial m4 SSD is built to last.\n\nConsistently fast speeds. No exceptions and no fine print. Theres a reason the Crucial m4 SSD has garnered numerous international awards since its launchit does what its supposed to do. No matter what kind of files youre working with on a Crucial SSD, youll experience high speeds with no drop in performance.\n\nUnlike other SSDs on the market, Crucial SSDs treat all files the same, regardless of whether theyre compressed or uncompressed. This is important because the files most people use everyday videos, mp3s, advanced graphics files and zip files - are compressed files and thus unable to be compressed any further. While many SSDs on the market achieve faster speeds by using file compression, many of the most common file types cant be compressed, resulting in SSDs that often deliver drastically slower speeds than originally advertised. With the advanced technology of a Crucial SSD, however, youll never have this problem! \n\nCrucialquality you can depend on. Crucial is a trusted name when it comes to SSDs, and thats no coincidence. As a brand of Micron, one of the worlds leading manufacturers of SSDs, we work with our engineers to design, refine, and support our drives. With over 15 years of experience in the memory industry, NAND component testing, and the ongoing development of advanced technology, we continue to innovate without sacrificing what has made us great: high-quality upgrades and outstanding customer service.\n\nCrucial SSDs. Performance you can trust.",
