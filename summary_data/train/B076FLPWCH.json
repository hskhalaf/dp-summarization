The only thing that was alarming to me was the sound of the steam coming out, but it was a matter of making sure that the steam was steady. I have only used this for chicken soup and for applesauce so far but it is a treat how easy it is to set up, start, and then eat great food.",

So easy to put on and take off. A much better design for sure. Yes, the bottom is thick and foods cook evenly without burning or scorching (most of the time!). Easy to clean. I like this one.
