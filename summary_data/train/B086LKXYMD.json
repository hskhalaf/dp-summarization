Sometimes it would only be for a few seconds and other times... minutes. Good buy depending on what you're using these ear buds for. If you're listening to music in the gym or using this for sound on your phone, I would recommend. TV, laptops etc. I would not suggest these ear buds.",

Then I saw these from Sony, read all positive reviews, liked the price and bought - although with some trepidation considering my earlier experiences. However, any negative thoughts quickly disappeared as I find them excellent in all respects. They fit in the ears very comfortably and securely and are perfect for my gym workouts, walking and running. Great sound and I have yet to experience any drop-outs. A really good buy!",

The real selling point is that they are for active use, and I found the fit to be poor, even after trying the alternative rubber tips. They haven't fallen out yet, but they FEEL like they might, and the fit isn't good enough to for passive noise cancellation. Sweat-proof, and with touch controls, they tick most of the boxes for active buds, but the fit leaves me short of recommending them.",

      "text": "A very good pair of earbuds. The sound quality is incredible. I've always been a bit wary of earbuds as previous ones I've owned have been disappointing to say the least. These are great, and the battery life is very good too. You get a USB 3.0 cable inside and replacement earbud covers depending on the width of your ear canal. Fantastic and highly recommended.",
