Probably caused by the shipping company. The figure itself is an amazing recreation of the Dragonzord. The figure improves upon the original in every way, and is not that expensive. The problems I have with the figure though are more for its combined modes. When you fold the feet up to combine him with the megazord, the feet will want to fall due to them being diecast. Also the figure being so heavy causes the megazord to lean. Other than that this is a must have for any collector.",
