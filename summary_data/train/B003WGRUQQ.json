      "text": "The clock is pretty good, and my daughter *loves* the radio. The only problem is that if you don't set it to wake to the radio, the buzzer beeps for about 30-45 seconds, then turns off on its own. Unfortunately, my daughter doesn't wake up to that (despite it being pretty loud), and it just turns itself off and doesn't beep again until the next day. So, if you are a light-ish sleeper, or get up easily in the morning, this could be great for you. For us, it doesn't work well... I may end up switching it to my son's room, since he is a lighter sleeper.",

I've been using it with the display off and the projection on which brings me to complaint #2. When a number displays that doesn't require the top or bottom to be illuminated, the number displays as a smaller size and is difficult to read. This is not an atomic clock. Any reference to auto time set is referring to the battery back up.",

But, the image is made of small bars of light with large separation between them; it is extremely hard to read the display when what you see if a bunch of \"blobs\" of light with large spaces between them.

    "description": "Color:Black BodyConvenience, reliability, & modern design come in the form of the EAAC601 Projection Alarm clock by Electrohome. This advanced clock radio automatically sets the time and date and saves all your alarm settings when the power goes out. Plus, with time projection display, dual alarms, temperature display, a large backlit LCD with dimming options, and the ability to play your smartphone, tablet, or MP3 player music, this is the only alarm clock you\u2019ll ever need.\n\nView the time/date & temperature clearly on the large 3.6\u201d blue display. The dimmer options (high, low, off) let you reduce the screen\u2019s brightness for those sensitive to light and the auto dimmer feature will disable the screen completely for night time use. This alarm clock also displays the indoor temperature (C/F) and the current day/month/year.\n\nProject the time on your ceiling or wall, so it will always be in full view from anywhere in the room even when you are lying in bed. This feature also allows you to tilt a full 180 degrees, so you can project the time or even the temperature. The adjustable focus allows the projected time to always remain crystal clear.\n\nThis smart alarm clock is preconfigured with the correct time, all you need to do is specify your time zone and it will always be accurate, even after a power outage.\n\nLong lasting battery backup restores your alarm settings and automatically adjusts for daylight savings time.\n\nSet two separate wake times with the dual alarm feature for you and your partner. You can also choose to automatically disable the alarms on weekends, allowing both of you to set your alarm schedule once! and forget it!\n\nListen to your favorite music using your iPhone, iPad, or Android device through the 3.5mm AUX audio input or using the built-in digital AM/FM radio with 20 station memory.\n\nWake to your favorite radio station, or the built-in buzzer.This unit also has snooze, sleep, and nap functions.",
