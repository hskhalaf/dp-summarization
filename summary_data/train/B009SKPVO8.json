      "text": "I use this strap for the 70-200mm f/2.8 lens and dslr body combo. It is sturdy enough for the job and keeps my hands free for portrait directing. The shoulder pad likes to move around during operation. I find myself having to constantly adjust the pad back to the top of my shoulder. The screw for the mount looks very sturdy and performs well. If you are not familiar with a 70-200mm f 2.8 lens, it weighs a few pounds and is made of mostly metal. The screw and plastic bolt combination does a nice job attached to the tripod collar of the lens. Overall I recommend the strap for its price.",

I was looking for something better than the strap that came with my camera because it's really uncomfortable and the material used for the strap is not great quality. I also wanted a sling that can be screwed into the tripod mount of the bottom of the camera. This was the best strap for the price! The clips for the straps are sturdy compared to the ones that came with the camera - a big plus! The strap doesn't bother me much, even after a few hours of carrying it on my shoulder. I love the idea of such easy access for the camera. Great buy!",

When I put it on I always take 2 seconds to check that it's tightly secured and it always is. I very rarely use a tripod but if I used one a lot this may be annoying having to unscrew every time. Camera easily slides up and down the strap. Highly recommend it!",

      "text": "I just love it. I use it a lot while traveling or playing music on the street, you can walk and your camera wont bump you on your chest, you cam reach it quickly and always in the right position. I recomend a lense hood, because it may hit some wall if you turn fast, nothung dangerous but there is nothing wrong with a bit extra precaution. It goes very tight to your side so you dont have to worry about hitting anything",

After trying several camera sling-straps costing anywhere from $70 on down, I have decided that this is the absolutely most perfect sling. One very simple adjustment, smooth sliding movement for camera. Secure screw-on tripod mount fitting. Long enough to wear at my hip. Nice wide shoulder stay-put pad with light padding. And nicely finished and well-made at a reasonable price! Looking for a sling strap for your DSLR? Go no further. Highly recommend. I also like the Joby-brand sling strap as well.",
