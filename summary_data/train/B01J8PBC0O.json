I love that it comes with great characters (Moana, Maui, and Hay Hay the rooster, plus a couple coconut characters). I really thought the boat was neat. The kids thought it was great that you could store food inside. There's plenty of room for all 3 characters to fit on board. The little island is fun because you can put the stone on the \"evil\" volcano part and spin it around to make it \"good\" or \"happy\" again kind of like the Disney movie! Anybody will love this set!",

There are a number of lego kits that allow building \"sets\" and characters from Disney animated children's stories. Despite the \"6-12\" age recommendation, my two 5 year old girls could do these types of Lego kits when about 41/2. This kit has specialized pieces, some quite small--and a large Maui, but non-readers can follow the instructions for first assembly. The specialized pieces are essential, so plan on keeping the kit in one or more re-salable plastic bags when not in active use to avoid losing essential parts.",
