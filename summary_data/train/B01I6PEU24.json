They immediately became her favorites. So much so, that she is elated every time they are laundered and ready to wear again. So I bought another pair. Now, at three pairs later, she is still excited for pajama time every night. These are well made \"jammies\" that have brought a little bit of sunshine to a sad situation. Thank you for making my wife smile!",

Although my day clothes are size 8-10, the large size in these are snug in the bust and hips on the shirt; and the waist and rear of the shorts. The shoulders and legs have ample room. I'm going to snip the elastic in the waist to make these work for me.",

The top fits great with a little extra room and the bottoms are pretty big. They stay up but I might add a quick drawstring to the waist for added security. For the price I'm pretty impressed by the quality and fit.",

      "text": "So the fabric is really soft just like any bamboo fabric is. I did stay cool at night as well. The major downside is there is not a front or back in the shorts, so the fit is off. I found that odd. So literally you can wear them either side which is not how we are shaped so I don\u2019t know why they are constructed in this way. The elastic is on the thin side for me also. They looked extremely frumpy on me. I\u2019m 5\u20195\u201d, post pardum about 195 lbs. I ordered an XL. I could have ordered an Large if it wasn\u2019t for the elastic. If I didn\u2019t already wash them I would have returned them.",
