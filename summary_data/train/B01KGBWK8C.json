It's just loud enough to still jam out. There were some reviews on the helmet where people had said that they had to get new aux cords to replace the stock option. My music wasn't playing right at first either so I thought that's what it may be. However, I quickly realized that you had to push fairly hard to join the main and female ends together. (reassures me that they won't easily disconnect while skiing) After that it worked like a charm.",

My only major complaint is that the chin strap is single strand nylon and fits under the chin near the throat, which is not very comfortable and feels a bit like its choking you when it's fastened down tightly. Would be five stars if they changed the chin strap to just be double nylon to fit on the chin!",

So there is an annoying wire that you have to deal with. Overall thankful for the sturdieness of the helmet though! Worth the purchase",
