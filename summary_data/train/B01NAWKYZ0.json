I love the feel of this compared to the Xbox controllers too. Damn you Nintendo... now I have 4 joycons (for mario cart), plus an extra controller, plus a charger, plus the plastic steering wheels. What will you make me buy next :).",

After very light use(I own a ps4, xbox and gaming pc) of the controller, within 6 moths the left joystick stopped working in the up position. I only use the pro controller when playing more than 2 player games like mario cart. I contact amazon support and nintendo support they told me the controller has past the 3 month nintendo accessory warranty, so an exchange is not possible. Nintendo mentioned a $40 dollar repair fee since it is out of warranty. Very disappointed with nintendo because the pro controller is very pricey. Again, I expected this to work longer than 6 months with very light use.",

Seems like they should clarify what \"hardware\" is in their warranty -- seems like a controller is \"hardware\" to me. Also seems like they should fix/correct the defect in their product since this appears to be a very common problem.",

      "text": "It's a great controller that obviously has a serious defect. This is the second pro controller I've bought that have the same issue. The left joystick (upward control) stops working after a month's worth of play. I primarily use it to play Splatoon 2, which requires the user to use the up joystick motion the majority of the time. It's expensive for a typical controller, but it's worth it because of the motion control; however, as I mentioned, it's got a big defect that definitely needs looking into. I've also researched the internet and other users who play Splatoon are having the same issue.",

Once it's paired though, it stays paired. Battery life is fantastic. I still rate it five stars because the pairing issue is a unique one that most people will never experience.

Not recommended for incremental movements for games that require motion detail, unless you're willing to spend extra time practicing for that specific game or unless the game has that all movement where you can physically direct the controller to position on screen. Once you know how to work it, it's okay; the joysticks are kinda stiff meaning they either go one way or the other and you can't move just right in a smooth, slow motion if you need to do it quickly like a computer mouse. Does last a long time on one charge which is a huge plus.",

For example, when you press \"right\", it often activates the up or down directions as well. It makes 2D platformers a bit of a pain, and Tetris 99 is nearly impossible with this D-Pad.

It\u2019s got a nice heft, the rubberized grips feel good, the sticks and buttons all have very satisfying feedback, and best of all I can use it to turn on my Switch. About the only issue I have with it is that since the D-Pad is so close to the left analog stick and the - and + buttons are in a slickly different position and not raised, it\u2019s a pretty big adjustment from using the Switch\u2019s Joy-Cons in Breath of the Wild. I find myself having to think before and while I\u2019m trying to use those buttons.",

With Smash Brothers Ultimate being released in December, these controllers were a necessity. They fit the hands nicely, they are well built, and I feel like I have finer control over any game I play. Docked one star for the cost. Seriously, Nintendo? Drop $20 off the cost and I'd give five stars. One nice feature is that they can be charged with a common USB-C cable, meaning that we no longer have to spend money on proprietary power supplies.",

It feels very well made. The analog sticks have a better feel to them with greater resistance than the standard Joy-Con. The buttons are larger and firmer. The vibration feedback is improved as well. Battery life is great too. If I had any complaints it would be that not all games support the controller, some for more obvious reasons than others.",

I'm not super worried about those features but I didn't want to need them in the future and come up short. If I buy a 2nd controller I probably will get the licensed aftermarket one and not spend as much as this thing (which is a little absurd for a controller).",
