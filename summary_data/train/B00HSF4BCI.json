For the other reviewers who had similar problems, Kuhn Rikon can be reached at 415.883.1101 Pacific Time. *************************** Original Review Lasted less than 3 months before breaking under light usage. Return window closed, no warranty. Very cheaply made. Would give zero stars if I could. This is one reason I'm disliking Amazon more and more. Once the return window is closed you have very little recourse.",

Took so many batteries it was heavy and uncomfortable to hold and to make matters worse, burned through batteries like a hot knife through butter. The ratchet grinder moves with ease and is actually \"fun\" to use. I have one for salt, one for pepper and a third for grinding other spices. Don't hesitate to buy this, you'll be very happy you did!",

I tried grinding coriander, which was useable, but not super fine, and left a lot of coriander dust inside. I don't think I can use it for any range of spices, but I did have some salt to put in there and it works great for that. So if you're looking for a salt grinder, get this.

So it takes FOREVER to grind a tablespoon of something and the cute ratcheting sound gets old pretty quickly.
