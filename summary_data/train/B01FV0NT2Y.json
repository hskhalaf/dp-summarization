If you have a fairly high swing speed - I'm around 105 with driver - you need to grip a bit tighter than is ideal. In less than two months with probably one to two rounds a week and a few range sessions I decided to replace these with much firmer grips. That said, if you've got a slower swing speed, aren't prone to sweaty hands, and don't need to worry much about torsion control, these are quite nice.",

I use a ultra-light grip and have never had the club twist, even in the rough. And they are smooth, so no blisters. No on-and-off on every hole to putt. Talk about better pace-of-play. Beware of counterfeits. I got a set on Ebay that looked like the real deal, but they weren't tacky like these. I called Winn to see if they changed their formula. They had not. If you had never used these, you might not have noticed the difference.",
