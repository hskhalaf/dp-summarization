I do not know what the complaints about making turns with 4 wheel drive being more difficult than with 2 wheel drive mowers are. The steps you do with a 4 wheel drive is no different than with a 2 wheel drive. One other thing, the cover of the drive control on the mower had a small crack. I called Husqvarna and they are shipping a replacement by FedEx. A class A company to deal with.",

I have no problem getting it back up up the hill and I find that it actually helps me keep my footing getting back up. The only negative I could find is that handle bars aren't adjustable. I'm a taller person, so no issues for me, but smaller people may find it uncomfortable due to the position of the bars, especially if they're mowing on a slope. Other than that, I like the accessories, it run smoothly, easy to start, and easy to clean.",

His hips make a push mower punishment, but he says the propulsion system takes most of the pain out of it, and he just guides it everywhere.",

After only 10 hours of use, the vent had sucked so much dirt into the gas tank that the engine would no longer run. Husqvarna's warranty bears a convenient loophole which excludes any \"fuel related\" problems. Although less than a year old, the repair cost me $128.00. Furthermore, Husqvarna offers no apparent method by which to contact their \"customer service\" department. Such was my experience with a mower from the (self-proclaimed) Global Leader in Outdoor Power Equipment.",
