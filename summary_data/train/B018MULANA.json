I'm not impressed :( I won't return them but I'm not a fan of the button mechanism. Don't see the need after having many other brands that work fine without that feature.",

Debating should I order again or go to the local box store to pick one up?",

I prefer the shades that don't have a button on the bottom. These have to have the button pushed to go up or down and it is awkward to operate sometimes.",

      "text": "I bought this two years ago for a bedroom bathroom. It keeps light out better than the bedroom roller shade. The reason it keeps light out better is because it can be cut precisely to avoid light coming in at the sides. It does pass a small amount of light through the shade but overall it blocks more light than the roller shade, because of the tight fit, even though the roller shade does not pass any light through the actual shade. Recently, the raising and lowering mechanism is showing some ware, but even if it broke today I'd buy it again and keep my 5 star rating.",

    "title": "The Miro Brand, 48\" x 64\" Room Darkening Cellular Window Shade, Cordless, Trimmable (White)",
    "description": "Color:Room Darkening White| Size:48\"X64\"The cordless cellular room darkening window shade is constructed from textured non-woven polyester fabric that gently blocks natural light from filtering into the room without sacrificing privacy. The cellular fabric also provides a level of insulation to stop cold or hot air at your window. This shade features a unique spring tension device located inside the bottom rail for cordless operation, to operate simply just press the button located on the bottom rail and pull or push. The cordless cellular shade is easy to size and install at home. If you need to cut down the shade to fit a window, you can use the included utility knife and sizing tools; however, we recommend using a heavy duty knife or saw to cut more efficiently. The maximum reduction is 18-inches; 9-inches from either side of the shade. The shade is 100% cordless, so it is safe for children and pets.",
