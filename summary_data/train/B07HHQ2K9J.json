The phone came with Android 7 installed, but upgraded easily to Android 9.0, not sure if there will be any further upgrades. Pure stock Android, so maybe a better chance.",

That phone was a complete waste of $70. So after nearly 2 years of terrible functioning, I purchased the Nokia 5. This is a wonderful $90 cell phone. Great build quality, fast performance, superb call quality, very good battery life , fingerprint security all for under $100. Upon arrival, I switched existing Sim card into the phone, signed on with Google account and magically had contacts and apps on the new Nokia 5. I no longer hate interacting with my phone.",

Nokia support told me that I have to contact the seller, and the seller, Amazon, was unavailable. Amazon customer service did absolutely nothing - \"your return window has closed, sorry, no options here\". I absolutely don't recommend this phone for two reasons - first, is poor product support and second is that it may really die - an update gone wrong will affect the hardware, better don't take the risks and take something more reliable.",
