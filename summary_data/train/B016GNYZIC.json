Can't say much about the adhesive since I just superglued it to the case, but I can say that the magnet is so strong that I have to lift one side off first to remove it from the mount. This results in the mount sliding out of the CD slot a little here and there, but it's no big deal. Also, the grey silicon cover on the cd slot side of the mount loves to grab hair and dust but again, doesn't impact functionality at all. Overall definitely a great mount.",

I have all my coworkers in my dept placing orders for these now that they've seen it in my car. I didn't have to say a word, the thing sells itself. The magnet it awesome, phone has never fallen out. I like the fact you get 2 backings so you can put one on the phone itself and one in a phone case if you want. Also the fact that it is movable left-right within the CD slot, so you can choose exactly where to put it. The quick release button works perfect. All said, excellent purchase!",
