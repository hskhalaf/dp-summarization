      "title": "Great Picture Quality, Surprisingly good sound",
      "text": "I originally intended to purchase this projector strictly for business meeting presentations. And it's perfect for projecting PowerPoint Presentations onto a whiteboard. The projector is extremely bright, so your audience shouldn't have any issues viewing it in a brightly lit room. I couldn't resist testing it out by using it for Youtube, movies, etc., and that's where this projector amazed me. I projected a movie onto a blank wall in my home and was blown away by the video quality and clarity of it. The speakers can also get surprisingly loud. Minor complaints include a semi-loud fan, and it gets extremely hot after a few minutes of use. Would recommend for home theater or office presentation use!",
