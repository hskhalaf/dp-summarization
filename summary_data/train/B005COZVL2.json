      "text": "First thing I noticed these are way too large for the size. I got the same size as other coastal boots I own and these are huge. There is no ankle support whatsoever. After a month or so the boots started falling apart and cracking. Then all the lace holes started rusting. Less than 6 months and these boots were done. I\u2019ve had other boot brands last me 2-3 years. I\u2019d hoped for 1-2 years out of these. After 3 months it was noticeable they weren\u2019t holding up. And less than 6 months and they were virtually unusable. I\u2019ve had other boots from Coastal that were good products. These are not one of them. Wouldn\u2019t buy again.",

As he works with chemicals, to strip the wax from the floors, that practically destroys everything it comes in contact with, we needed something sturdy, slip and chemical resistant.

He says they fit perfectly and are very comfortable when he's working.",

The only thing that I didn't like is that it has lace eyelets all the way up and not the lace hooks like some of their other styles of boots, so it takes a little longer to lace them up, but that really is not that big of a deal.",
