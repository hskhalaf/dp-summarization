They are great colors, the melon is a little more pink that I'd like but my four-footed children aren't picky as long as it delivers the kibble. I do make sure to remove them and wash them each time so they don't get chewed up/gross. I really, really, hate using anything made in China for my pets but I didn't have a lot of choice with this particular purchase, so I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.",
