It is better than the IQ balls in the sense that it is not constantly getting stuck under or behind furniture because there is a weight at the bottom of it, so its hard to roll around by design. It is very sturdy. I took off one star because unlike some other food dispensers, the hole is not adjustable. Because of this, my dog was able to get all the food out within a couple minutes. Updating to 5 stars. I've had for about a year and it's the only thing I use now.",

We would have to leave food in his kennel at night because he would actually get sick from not eating. This solved that! We just put some food in it and he bobbles it throughout the house. He always eats the food that comes out and bobbles some more. This would be great for any dog that eats too quickly, as it only dispenses a few at a time. We never even need to put treats in there because he enjoys it enough to just use food.",

      "text": "This Kong Wobbler really helps my miniature golden doodle slow down her eating. Normally, she, like most dogs, gulps down her dry food in seconds. To help control her overeating, our vet suggested using this wobbler to slow down her consumption. It did not take her long to learn how to liberate the food. There is a single hole, your dog just needs to knock it over. Like Weebles of my childhood past, the Wobbler wobbles but doesn't fall down. This lets your dog bat it around and dispense treats or dog food. The 2 halves easily disassemble for loading and cleaning.",

That said its no where near what Kong stands for as a company which is kind of a bummer. If your dog is even just a moderate chewer I would stay away. It hasn't proven dangerous, it just won't last nearly as long as other puzzle toys we've tried.",

Our pup has not destroyed the other type - we've had two of the traditional type for over three months. I assumed the Kong Wobbler would be the same material, but it was not.
