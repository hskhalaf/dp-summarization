These nursing pads are great! Very soft and comfortable, and much gentler on sensitive skin than the harsh itchy disposable pads. I don't have to make any adjustments during the day, as they don't bunch up in weird spots or shift when you change positions. They're also easy to clean; I just put mine in a mesh garment bag on the gentle cycle and they come out looking good as new.",

The softness helps when nipples are sore, but for the price I wouldn\u2019t buy these again. I invested in my other brand Kindred Bravely that hold way more before leaking. The whole pad has to be soaked to leak with those.",

After letdown, the hearts are totally soaked! The so-called overnight ones are not much more absorbent. Only good thing is that these conceal extremely well!!! Other than that, probably returning them as my skin itches after these get soaked. I have tried another brand that claims 100% bamboo material and it doesn't cause my skin to itch.",

Also, as another reviewer said they get soggy and gross if you really leak into them and you have to change them once they\u2019re wet or you\u2019re sitting in that moisture. I wear them when I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll leak but want to feel secure, but not when I actually expect to have leaking. Disposable ones are much better for keeping you dry.",

They can move a bit especially if just wearing a tank or loose fitting bra so when out and about I make sure to wear a little snugger bra so that they are sure to stay in place.

I also like the idea that I'm producing less waste. My nipples occasionally stick to the cloth fabric, but not very often. They are absorbent and have not leaked through the fabric. My only gripe is that they don't lie flat against my breasts - they require some creative positioning so that they don't show through a thin shirt or bra. Darting in the design would help them lie flat against the natural curve of the breast.",

The natural bamboo fibers really do keep you from leaking through. The overnight pads are also great if you're lucky enough to have a little one who is sleeping through the night and you're not doing as many feedings. They are also great if you have sore or chaffed nipples. As a first time mommy and nurser, I've had a lot of soreness from nursing. Bamboobies made me so much more comfortable in between feedings. I would for sure recommend Bamboobies for any nursing moms out there!",

I've been using them for 3 months and while I don't have much leaking, the thin pads tend to stick to me if they get just a little milk on them and it's not fun to peel them off. The overnight pads are nicer and feel softer than the daytime pads. You can find reusable pads for cheaper that are more comfortable.",

You still can't see them through a bra, though. Also, I may not leak as much as other women so the Nuk pads have been working for me as well, and those are a smaller size and fit more easily into my bras though definitely not as comfortable.",
