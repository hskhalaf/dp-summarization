Packable in its own pouch that can act as a small purse or carry-all. Pouch has a carabiner that I like to attach to the zippered pocket. Around the \u201ccuffs\u201d are elastic pulls you can cinch up to keep the rain and wind out. Such wonderful attention to detail! This is the best rain poncho I\u2019ve ever had. Also very flattering on. May order another!",

Also I'm of a shorter stature and the sleeves do not reach my wrists. For the price though it's cute and I like that it zips.

It can be challenging to get it started zipping in a high wind, but that's no big deal. The only thing I didn't like is the caribiner. Great idea, so I replaced the cheap one that came with it (and broke on the first use) with one I already had.",

      "text": "I started making grocery deliveries this year and it's been rainy where I live. I wanted to get a rain poncho for particularly rainy days and this poncho fit my needs perfectly. What I like is that any adult size (or almost any) can wear it - even if you are plus size, it has snaps to loosen (or tighten) the arm if needed and is wide enough across that I could fit at least two of me in it (and I am plus size). It's made of material that seems like an umbrella and keeps most of me dry when I wear it on rainy days. I'd highly recommend this product.",

It is super cute, has options to snap on the sides so you have sleeves or leave them open for a poncho look, folds up super easy and the pouch to put it in is actually large enough to fit it even if you don\u2019t fold it nice and fancy. I used this in NYC on a cold rainy night and it was so convenient! The polka dots made it whimsical and I received many compliments. It\u2019s a rain poncho people - hard to make it a cute look - but THIS is the one!",

I'm giving it four stars though, because there is only one pocket in the poncho, so if you want to put anything in it that has any sort of weight in that pocket, you're gonna get that 'lopsided' feeling, and no opposing pocket for counter-balance. Also, there is no way in HAIL this poncho is going to get back into the cute little teensy matching bag. I'd rather they skip the bag and put in the second pocket, or make the bag bigger, and forgo the pocket altogether.",

There is a bit of elastic at the sleeve ends so you can put your finger through it to keep the poncho extended. At least that's what I'll use those bits for. I am very pleased with this poncho.",

BOTTOM LINE: The poncho sports a really nice design, is available in a lot of colors and designs and has a soft fabric feel but it does NOT keep water out. Water seeps through. I would say this poncho is water RESISTANT only. For me, at 5'9\" the the poncho goes down just below the knee in front and little lower in back.",

Very nice fabric (it's not plastic), I haven't worn it yet, just tried it on, it's lightweight and very loose so it can go over even coats. It has an elastic loop, theorically to hook the end of what would be the sleeve to your middle finger, but the fabric is not so long, it reaches my wrists, so the loop is unusable. I think that it's not necessary anyway, since the first clasp closes both sides quite near to the wrist, I think that'll avoid the fabric to move up the arm.",

Unfortunately, the first time I used it, I got completely soaking wet to my underwear. There is only a 30 day return period. I am stuck with this useless poncho. I would not recommend anyone to purchase this if you want to be protected from the rain. I cannot even get a refund. Is there lower than a1 star rating?",

Hood is plenty big and protects your whole head from getting wet. It's not too hard to stuff back in its pouch, so works well for travel. Back home, I use it a lot for my public transit commute - I can fit a large purse or backpack underneath with me so everything stays dry.",

The zipper runs rough to begin with, plus it kept catching on the fabric it was sewn into so I had to release where it caught multiple times on its way up. This poncho would be great if, in addition to the zipper, it had 2-3 snap closures so that zipping wouldn't be necessary to keep it closed.",
