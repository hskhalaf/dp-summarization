I would love this bike if the one I recieved didn't break every week. I am extremely disappointed in the quality of the bike. Edit: More road use, the axle broke again. This is ridiculous",

I did swap out pedals for clip ins, and added some bars on the ends for additional riding stance. The seat is remarkably comfy. Pretty darn nice entry level bike.

The bike is fairly light weight, easy to transport on a roof or rear bike rack, and has quick release clips on the front and rear wheels, for easy removal and security.

I brought it to the local bike shop and they said that they couldn't figure out what the problem was after attempting to adjust the front derailleur, swapping the chain and ensuring everything was tightened properly. If you get a bike that works properly it is probably pretty decent, but I think mine was defective.",

No. As others have mentioned, the seat is hard, and perhaps the cassette isn't top quality, and it isn't as light as I would have liked, but remember the price of this bicycle. I bought it three months ago and my butt has gotten used to the hardness of the seat. It could always be replaced with another softer one for just $15 or so. Do I have buyer's remorse? No, not at all. Quite the opposite, I would buy it again, and would even recommend it to friends and relatives.",

      "text": "Great bike for the cost! I ride it a lot on the bike trails in Atlanta. No real issues, I was looking for something affordable that didn't suck and looked good that would ride well in the city. Also I like straight handle bars like a mountain bike and this fits the bill. You can always upgrade parts as needed (I upgraded the seat). The frame is what matters and it is light enough and solid. Came in a big box half put together. Takes 30 minutes with basic tools and a bike pump and you are out the door!",

One of them came with a damaged tire already, we sent it back and got a new one within 2 days, 2/3 were packaged different then the broken one. We attached a Heavy Duty Cargo Rack to it which works quite well.",
