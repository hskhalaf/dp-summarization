For $9.99, and prime 2 day shipping, I was not sure what I would get. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the product. It was exactly as pictured. It does shed a bit, but with some burlap products, it's unavoidable. It certainly was not a problem for a 1 day party. There is plenty of string to hang the banner, and it's already pre-strung. No typos with my order.",

This banner makes a very natural background in the photographs, because of the natural sand color of burlap. However, the burlap terribly shed debris. From the moment I take this out of the box, whenever I touch it, whenever I move it around, it keeps shedding the burlap debris... It made my room messy. And it has some smells too. Not terrible, but you might want to air it out for a day.",
