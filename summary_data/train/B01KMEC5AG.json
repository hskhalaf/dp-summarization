I loved replacing the empty and uncomfortable milk jugs the instructor provided with these comfortable barbells. I liked the option of using the pointed end for less resistance versus the flat end for more resistance, After trying a classmate's round version I will buy a set of the bigger round ones in the future for additional resistance. These barbells dried very quickly after use.",

I started taking water aerobics classes this summer & would always get stuck with using the heavier weights that no one else wanted (mainly due to others hogging the lighter weights for their late arriving friends). I ordered these water weights because of the unique style, lightness & the price. They arrived in two days & I felt awesome showing up to class with these weights. The water resistance is perfect for me & I would highly recommend them to others who are considering purchasing them too.",
