Easy to use, I can train new guys to use them in literally less than a minute. Long lasting, i have at least two of these in the field being used daily that we havent changed batteries in for at least two years. If you dont need a megger or something complicated but you use a meter every day this is a great purchase.",

I use this for measuring amps on compressor leads and it helps verify power consumption. This is spot on compared to very expensive equipment we use for data logging. Glad I chose to go with the expensive one! If you have any questions about this review please email me at ReviewOne23@gmail.com!",

In order to measure amps, you need to measure only one leg of the circuit. For an appliance, this meant splitting the cord or opening up the outlet so as to measure just one leg of the circuit. Much easier if you purchase a line splitter. ( Amprobe ELS2A AC Line Splitter) This meter is very accurate and sturdy and will last a lifetime.",

Remember, you can't measure current by clamping an extension cord or a piece of romex. Current running out the black, and back on the white will cancel each other. You have to expose one wire to clamp that one to get a real current reading. Not a big deal.",

That said this meter feels cheap, overly bulky for what it is, and the hold button is to easy to engage without realizing it. I guess that's what you get at this price point. In conclusion I trust this fluke will keep me alive long enough to save for a higher end (300-400$)meter.",
