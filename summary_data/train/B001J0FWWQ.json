But adaptive bikes are EXPENSIVE not to mention big and bulky. We heard about Mobo through a Facebook friend whose child also has CP. They had gotten a Mobo for their child and adapted it with pedal straps and a harness. We decided to go for it. After some adjustments; pedal straps, the Mobo Mini seatbelt/harness and a lot of practice, our little girl is now speedy. Thanks for making a great bike, Mobo!!",

He's able to go up slight inclines, but if the hill is too steep he cannot peddle and I have to give him a push. It took him a minute to figure out the hand break but with continual assistance he mastered it. He's on it about 1.5 hours a day so it is great exercise for the big guy! Highly recommend this bike!",

My son is adjusting as he always does to products that aren't built for him. He loves it. He has watched his big brother ride a bike for years and now he can ride one too without having to balance.",
