Image quality isn't going to win any awards, but again, it's fine for my use and doesn't really look too bad. The build quality is good, easy to use via the onboard buttons and the Android app works fine. The desktop software needs some work, but once you figure it out it does an ok job.

The other editing software included doesn't handle Youtube conversion and is buggy to boot.

I was concerned I would have to invert the video in post-processing. But the camera handles that setting just fine. I was concerned about the weight load on the small model plane, but no problem. One thing I had to re-engineer for is that the full-180 field of view requires the camera be mounted below the lowest portion of the plane's under-structure (e.g., skids).",
