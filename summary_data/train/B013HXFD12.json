Each bag is very well-made, and accommodates a lot of items, including my 8-inch clutch-wallet, 7-inch hold-anything case, sunglasses, keys, cell phone (iPhone 6), pens, coin purse, and other items. Whether the bag is empty or full, it stands sturdily on its four metal feet. The saffiano leather is stain-resistant with its color uniform throughout. The quality is topnotch, and the price is reasonable. I say go get yourself one, or more. You deserve this beautiful gift.",

The bag has wonderful structure and really cute fabric lining. It's my new favorite!",

The problem I had was it was missing the attachable shoulder strap. The strap is always located inside of the purse. The picture online clearly shows the strap. This was an important feature for me as I always use the strap option on my purse. The other KS bags I have are from department stores and while this bag was nice it was extremely hard and stiff. Don\u2019t expect a soft supple leather. I returned the very next day after receiving. I couldn\u2019t keep something this costly with a missing piece.",
