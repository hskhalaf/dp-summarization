It is a very rich, cool grey color, and the minimalist pattern will go with anything. I plan to get another to use at the end of my bed like a throw to add to bedroom decor. The cotton material is just so nice to the touch!",

This towel was super soft, absorbent and my hair loved it! The color is really really nice (see the video). Since the photo is indoor, video will give a better idea of the color.

Since it's so lightweight, it's even better than a terry cloth towel as a cover for some protection from the sun. If you like to roll up your towel and use it as a pillow on your beach chair, this probably won't do since it's only about 3\" thick when rolled up. It dries quickly.

Towel is easy to clean (just threw it in the washing machine with no special cycles) and kept its color, form, and texture well.

It folds up so small so it takes up no room at all in luggage and it\u2019s big enough to wrap around you and stay tided! I liked it so much, I\u2019ve just ordered two more as gifts. You will not be sorry if you are looking for a towel for all the same reasons I was. I highly recommend this product.",

I have purchased similar Turkish towels in different colors, but they're not as long as Wetcat's Turkish towels. They are a little rough at first, but it doesn't bother me. Overall, I highly recommend these versatile Turkish towels. You can feel like you're on vacation year round!",

Worth it but would look at reviews regarding absorbency if that is what you need.",
