It's a total win for a bowl of ice cream...but not so much if you're looking to be able to put it on a cone or in a root beer float. Like I said, it makes soft ice cream.

I left it unattended for and as the ice cream froze, the paddle would start to jam which caused the unit to move. I came back 15 minutes later to see the content on the floor. The ice cream was frozen along the chamber walls but did not manage to freeze some of the content in the center. Ultimately, I decided this was not the product for me.",

If you look closely at the warranty, you are required to pay round trip shipping in order to return the bowls which they may or may not replace at their discretion. I would call this a non-warranty disguised as a warranty.",

It's not bad at all, just a little louder than a dishwasher. Some said it overflowed & if you let it go longer than 30 minutes, it will overflow, just keep an eye on it. I give 5 stars & love my purchase & highly recommend it.",
