It's not a push scooter, but you can really move once you get the hang of it. It was very easy to put it together (10 minutes per scooter) and the top folds down. It's still wide at the wing tips, but easier to store and fit in the car when it's folded up. It appears sturdy and well-made.",

Oh and by the way if you're looking for the Allen wrench is they are taped onto the back stabilizer bar. I was so frustrated when I couldn't find them but once I put it together I saw them.

From there you bend at your knees and start wiggling your hips side to side which helps the scooter to move. The more you do it, the faster you will go.",

We've had the traditional Razor scooters for our kids over the years but this one takes scooters to a new, more interesting level of entertainment. Our son likes to ride wheelies and spin in 360 degree circles on this. He is very happy to have this over the other forms of Razors.",

The kids have been as young as 4 when they started riding the first one and up to our oldest granddaughter who is 11 and she still loves it. Much better that a regular scooter as they move it by wiggling their behind. As they get older they do some spins, etc on it. They love it! Keeps them occupied, so I love it too!",

      "text": "My friend had one of these for like 2 years. One day we were wheeling (aka doing manuals) for about 3 blocks when the frame where you stand snapped! For casual/basic riding u really don't need any protective gear (coming from a 13 year old) because you don't get very fast. You might want to wear a helmet if ur doing things lime 360s on the back 2 wheels. I will update this when I get it for a further review",

      "text": "Wow, these Razors are so fun for our 6 and 9-year old kids! They took about 15 minutes to put together and seem very sturdy, strong and fun. I would recommend a helmet since they can spin very fast and have a bit of a sharper learning curve for young children than the standard scooter. We have only tried these out in our large garage since WY winter prevents us at this time, but they had hours of fun on Xmas day and continue to do so. Great riding toy for the price.",
