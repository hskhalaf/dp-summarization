Left them outdoors on a porch so they always were going through all kinds of weather. I used them for barn chores, cutting up dead trees and our land is quite mucking. I bought a pair for the wife and she loves them as well. They are tough as nails and soft as a babies blanket. Now I have a second pair and fell in love with them all over again.

My feet stayed warm and dry. The height is ideal because you can move in them quite easily. They are a little heavy but not bad, personally I like the weight.

      "text": "I wear men's 9 1/2 wide shoes so I was concerned with ordering men's size 9 boot. I was surprised that I had so much room in the toe wearing a cotton athletic type of sock. By coincidence, I had recently purchased a pair of UGG shoes which came with an extra set of wool insoles. I tucked the wool insole into the Muckboot and the fit was perfect- just the right amount of wriggle room. I wore them in the house for a couple of hours and my feet were warm but not sweaty. I have confidence that I'll be fine all day in the rain.",

They are not so uncomfortable that I would send them back though.",

    "title": "Muck Boot Chore Classic Men's Rubber Work Boot",
    "description": "Ideal for landscaping and other general outdoor work, these Muck Chore Classic Men's Rubber Work Boots keep feet dry and comfortable all day long. The 5 mm neoprene is waterproof and shock-absorbent. It also retains heat and is flexible to adjust to the natural contours of the foot for good support. In addition to outer waterproofing, these men's rubber work boots keep feet dry on the inside by wicking perspiration away from the skin. Built for durability, these men's work boots have easy-to-clean rubber overlays and outsoles. Circumference: 17 inches.\n\nNothing will get by these things! Perfect for the outdoorsman (or woman), this boot was made to last and work hard for you. It has a protective, waterproof shell with a soft and flexible shaft, breathable airmesh linings, and a slip-resistant rubber outsole.\n\nThe story began in 1999 with the sole purpose of building the most comfortable, high performance footwear on the market. The need for a more comfortable boot for use in messy and tough conditions led to the design of The Original Muck Boot Company brand footwear. Every boot in the line is expected to deliver the same 100% waterproof quality and comfort that inspired the original footwear. In just a few years, the line has grown to more than 20 styles, all designed to tackle tough conditions in agriculture, lawn and garden, outdoor sporting, equine, and pet care. Today, the Muck Boot brand defines a standard of comfort and quality that goes beyond the expectations of customers around the country.\n\nSee more",
