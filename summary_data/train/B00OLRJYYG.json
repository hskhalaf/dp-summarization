      "text": "This is our fifth Britax car seat for our son. I've never been disappointed in these products. They are sturdy and durable, and install soundly in all three of our vehicles (full-size pickup, crossover wagon, and sports coupe). They are a little hefty to install, but that's to be expected with a quality car seat. This will probably be our last Britax, since this one will accommodate him until he grows out booster range. I strongly recommend this brand to anyone in the market for a car seat of any type.",

My son loves it, too. Our only complaint is that the two pull-out cup holders don't snap into position and tend to slide back into the seat base if not occupied.",

The only downside is, my almost 5 years old has some issues threading the seatbelt through on his own. However, it's not enough of an issue for me to take a star away. It could be just something he has to adjust to or it could even be my car. Either way, great car seat and I feel so much better than buying him a more expensive seat knowing that the protection is there if he should ever need it.",

You have to pull both tension straps at the same time to get even tension on both connection points. If you pull one, then the other, the seat feels loose.
