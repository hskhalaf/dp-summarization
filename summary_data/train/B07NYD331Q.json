I had gotten them for the shower but they were useless so I tried them in the sink as well- no good either. My previous luffa sponge held its shape decently. These also began shedding within 4-5 uses. Asking for a refund!!",

From what I see it's about twice as much for the bigger, nicer ones. It does soften a bit in water, but it is meant to be a little rough. Quality makes sense for the price.",
