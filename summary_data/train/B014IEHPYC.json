It seemed kind of small, almost petite, but after more consideration, I noticed it was pretty robust, not cheaply made. The size can be an advantage for quad, side by side riders and those who backpack, although a little heavy for you minimalists out there. It's multi-use, which offsets the size thing as well. For Jeep and 4x4 drivers you might want to consider a full size shovel. This one goes in my RZR.",

Can't imagine going camping without it. I do bring it 4x4/wheeling as well. It would be a decent emergency shovel if I got my rig stuck, but it's so small that it would be a bit of a pain for that. So I might suggest a larger shovel for that. But for general use, certainly recommend!!",

It can be hard to get it tightened enough not to slip when working in sandy conditions. Lastly it would be nice if it wasn't stright or 90 but if there was a slight bend option as shovels are a lot more comfortable and easy to use if they have a but of a angle at the end.",

Otherwise it feels tough, the serrated part has bent serrations and its not sharp in any way, but with the pick axe head it is a true multi purpose survival tool. It would be useful as a weapon in dire situations as well.",
