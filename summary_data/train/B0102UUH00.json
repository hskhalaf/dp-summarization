(See product images of chrome bars holding bar.) 2. I do not exceed the height or weight capacity. (M, 5' 10'' 168#) 3. The other bar is showing signs of torquing/bending as well. I still use the ball but have to be extra careful not to roll off the base when I move around my desk. In hindsight, I should have purchased the other model with a back. It looks sturdier. See the attached photos showing the broken vs. normal threads.",

The chair is sturdy..a hard plastic like \"Little Tykes Toys\" the metal stablity bar is on the front AND back..it screws in, top and bottom..the casters snap in I hope it doesn't break like the other reviewers said theirs did!",

It was a little tough getting the wires to insert correctly in the holes provided so that I could secure the other hardware but with a little effort I was able to get it put together in about 30 minutes. The reason I am giving it four stars instead of five is because I received the child sized ball instead of the 52cm ball that was supposed to be packaged with the chair. However, I contacted Amazon customer service and they were able to assist in getting the issue resolved quickly.",

I have 3 because I replaced old hard uncomfortable chairs with these; these are MUCH easier on the tailbone! They work great as an exercise tool. They are made from a thick rubber-ish material (durable), and they come with a hand pump which is fairly easy to use even when they are entirely deflated. The plug is leak-free. I would buy this product again.",

The locking mechanism should be similar to strollers; locked when the 'tabs' are pulled out and unlocked when they are flush/pressed down. Instead these wheels require the 'tab' be pulled (sticking out) in order for it to roll freely in an unlocked position. Your heels will constantly bump the sides of the casters and inadvertently lock the wheels. Very frustrating. If you ever change the design I would truly love a replacement set!!!!!!

I am so happy. I am not tall though (I'm 5'3\") so maybe if you are bigger than me this may not be an adequate size? I think the height is perfect though and my back and posture feel so much better already! And you can replace the ball with a bigger ball if you need to!",

      "text": "The enclosed ball was too small. Not only did it not inflate to the size it was supposed to (52cm), it was too small to work at my desk. That was with leg extenders (bought separately) on the chair. Leg extenders on the chair make the chair sit 2\" higher. I returned the chair and ball, thinking the wrong ball had been sent. I received a replacement with the same size ball. I decided to cut my losses, keep the chair, and order a bigger ball from a different company. The pink ball you see is a 55cm and is much better. Again, this is with 2\" leg extenders on the chair.",
