One of the hook is broken , the top part of the bra cup folds out and you can see the line under my cloth.. I basically cannot wear it again. Thats almost $70 down the drain.",

I wouldn't necessarily order down but I am sort of in-between those sizes to begin with. It gives a nice lift and cleavage and seems comfortable.

When I read the reviews for this bra I was a little skeptical, and I needed a strapless bra to wear under a bridesmaid dress so I decided to give this a go. Can I just say, IT IS AMAZING! I wore it the entire day through the ceremony, reception and after party and I can honestly say it did not budge. I didn't even remember I was wearing a strapless bra because I didn't have to tug on it one bit. Amazing and well worth the price.",

To be fair I am not the main target for this bra, I have less to be kept under control than the average girl, but I imagine it would work very well for others who are more well endowed.",

It doesn't need constant readjustment like every other strapless bra I've tried, considering it has 4 hooks in the back the band stays 100% in place all day long. It also doesn't give the dreaded saggy-boobs affect that most unsupportive strapless bras give me; it keeps things supported and pushed up, but I'm not spilling out of the top either. I absolutely love this bra!!!",
