Sound is really good, clean and crisp. . The only thing that worries me is now the wired to the headphone part are exposed. Be careful.",

Bluetooth signal is very good as well, even through brick walls i get no interruption at all. The battery has not died yet and used the Bluetooth mode for about 9 hours now. Only con to the headphones is unless you have smaller sized ears you wont get full noise cancellation and the cushions are quality material but not comfortable for more than a few hours.
