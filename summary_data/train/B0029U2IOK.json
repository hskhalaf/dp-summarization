The handles on the large ones are very comfortable, but the small ones not so much. (Am I the only one who doesn't understand why the handles are smaller on smaller screwdrivers? I mean, my hands don't change shape so why do the handles change shape?) They are strong little buggers and the metal cap means you can really whack them (or use them to whack something else) so I definitely recommend them. Ugly as they may be. :D",

The price is great as well I would recommend them to friends so I def would recommend them to strangers.",

The tips fit fasteners perfectly. Tools have a nice finish and feel sturdy. The handles are a little funky at first, but now that I'm used to them I actually prefer these over any of my other screwdrivers. The strike caps are handy for when you will undoubtedly use these as pry bars or chisels (I know, you're not supposed to, but we all do that). I would recommend these to anybody looking for an above average set of screwdrivers at an affordable price.",

While the cast appearance implies less durability I have yet to have any flexing issues. The color is great and the sizes included cover all your simple bases. The ends fit screw heads well and don't slip. Overall I am very pleased with these tools.",

When you actually have to use those tools you'll learn quickly you don't want tools from Harbor Freight, but you also don't want to pay for tools from some other vendors. This is one of those sets that will make you happy. They don't chip and fall apart in the middle of job.",
