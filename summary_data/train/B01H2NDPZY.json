      "text": "Wow. I am extremely picky when it comes to headphones. I've tried a ton of offerings from Beyerdynamic, Audio Technica, Akg, you name it. These Focal headphones are the headphones I've been looking for for ages. The tonality and balance that these bring along with the soundstage they present is near perfect for my needs. They are intimate but expansive. Voices sound so natural and pleasant, the highs go high but aren't icy. Bass has bunch but is restrained and nicely placed in the mix. In short they sound great. They are supremely comfortable with very nice leather pads and comes with a nice case and a detachable cord. These headphones are a no beainer.",

      "text": "Brought these on my last trip. Pros: easy to drive with a minimal amp (Shanling M1). Love hearing the little nuances like the keyboard on the far left in Trans-Island Skyway. Very enjoyable, relatively flat, natural representation. Vocals and mids are a bit forward I would say but not exaggerated. Excellent isolation - no noise cancelling necessary in my opinion. Cons: Long wear is uncomfortable, however that's why they isolate so effectively. They are not slender. I'll consider keeping them at home, but no road trips.",

The sound is very satisfying - strong bass, clear midrange and clean at low and high volume levels. The noise cancellation is solid too! The ear cups are deep enough to be comfortable and the headband is padded with an easily adjustable depth. Overall, an A+++.",
