Leak proof/spill proof, I just toss it in my backpack and don't even need to make sure it is upright! I've only used it with water and pedialyte. Not sure how it would do with carbonated beverages, I've I noticed with my older child's cups that carbonation and leak proof straw cups don't work out.",

With other cups I couldn't get the handle to line up with the spout and this was very frustrating. The handle can also be removed later to not look so baby-ish. Great cup!",

The cover is great to have on so that if the cup is dropped nothing will get on the spout, but it does tend to fall down and get in the way when the baby drinks by himself so we usually don\u2019t leave it on. The only other thing that could be improved is to make the spout easier to get into to clean.",

This can sometimes take a few minutes to do. You have to pull it firmly and make sure it's all the way through the lid, and then push the outside lip all the way inwards. If not, it will get caught on the threads of the lid and will definitely leak. That's the reason for 4 stars (product design). As for the purchase, everything was excellent. Item as described. Fast shipping. Would recommend seller to others.",
