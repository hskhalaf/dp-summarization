      "text": "Ordered on February 12, 2018. The item worked great, after the first charge. Two days ago I placed it back on the charger and nothing happened. I read the troubleshooting guide and it said that I should wait a few minutes, as the battery was possibly completely depleted. After one hour on the charger, there was no change. I have sent repeated emails to Foreo customer service, but they have yet to get back to me. I can't find a phone number, which is really hard to believe. $100 and just one mohth of use. I wish I could get my money back or get a replacement. Very disappointed in Foreo and their customer service on this one.",

I've especially love to use it before I shave, it seems to lift my hairs so I can get a closer shave and my skin has been extra smooth from it. I will continue to use this twice a day (morning, and night) and if I will return with a follow up review in a few months. Also it states I should have about 50 uses from one charge and since I've charged it on day one I have yet to re-charge, so it looks like its living up to its stats so far.",

Also, the instruction say that once the brush has a complete charge that its will project a solid light, instead it constantly blinks. Overall, I am happy with it.",

It alerted me (short pulse) when it was time to move the Foreo to another part of my face. After about 60 seconds, finished.
