This product has a lot of small pieces so not great around toddlers.",

It help kids learn new things about science, They can make 12 in 1 kit solar robots and it will teach it how to do work. Very clear instructions for him to do it mostly on his own! So my nephew has made a great sixth solar robot! He really likes this and it is educational.",

But the robot kit includes nine small self sealing bags, which make it easy for us to sort all the parts before assembly.
