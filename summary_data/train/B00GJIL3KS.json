My Achilles tendon hurt so I can leave it on by my chair and just push it on and off without going up and down the stairs when it's wet. Power is great and the nozzle adjusts to short of far distance. It's feels good holding it, like if you drop it it's not going to break. I bought one. Now I have three. The other 2 are for the back.",

When one hose needed replacing, we couldn't get the nozzle off so we tossed it all, thus the need for another nozzle. I didn't have to think about which one to buy. I've had others in the distant past - I knew this was the one I wanted. Super heavy spray, strong spray, with a force tip or you can spread it for a wide spray. It great.",

      "text": "If you want a garden hose for flowers or grass, this would be fine. If you want to clean something like cracks between pavers or small openings, this doesn't do the job. Though it shows a very small diameter hole for the water to exit, in fact it has no possibility of providing a steady high pressure jet of water for spot cleaning. It is far too big an opening and there is no diminishing channel to force the water into a thin but strong stream. It's okay for big jobs but not worth having for fine jet high pressure cleaning needs.",

      "text": "I've had this a few years now and it is pretty beat up, but still the best, highest flowing nozzle I've ever used. Sprays significantly more water than even well built metal normal nozzles at farm stores. If you have the pressure, this will really shine and save you time. I do recommend using high quality hose, as my wife bought some smaller flat/folding hose, and it worked pitifully compared to my good stuff. Plus, isn't it always fun spraying much farther than your neighbors?",
