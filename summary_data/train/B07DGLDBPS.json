I was told it was my mattress - because the box spring wouldn't allow for sinking... so I wanted to try one thing before I ended up in more debt with a new mattress - and I ordered these slates! It felt like a WHOLE NEW BED. No more sinking - and great support. I can sleep again - and it came at a very cheap fix!!",

      "text": "what a great product! Wanted to throw out our old, heavy, dusty box spring but still wanted to keep the bed and mattress. Found this and tried it. It is a space saver, gives the bed a lower profile and sleek look and easily supported my guests without issue when they stayed with us. Loved it so much I got another for my sleep number bed. Needed extra support for the molded plastic base. Amazing difference! Like how the wood is covered in fabric. Makes it easier to install.",
