This works perfectly. No more sliding off and dumping a roast or chicken into the sing while I am readying it for the stove. Thanks RAJ. I am happy with this board and I recommend it. ** One caution: Surface is extremely slick and many foods, raw meat in particular, will slide right off of the board if you are not careful.",

I've also noticed that it doesn't take on the color of certain vegetables like my older ones did. So when I cut spinach or beets, the color doesn't get into the board at all. It washes right off. The rubber edging does keep it in place while cutting. I'm happy with them!",
