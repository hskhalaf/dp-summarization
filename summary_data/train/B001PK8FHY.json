However, I definitely liked my older model better, despite the new one's sleek, modern look. It's less user friendly making the various settings harder to switch. Also the camera's lcd screen has poor quality. When the pictures are loaded onto your computer they look okay, but when you're taking the picture there are green spots and people are a bit washed out. It works fine for me because I only wanted to cheap point and shoot to carry around with me wherever I go, but I wouldn't recommend it.",

The Nikon Coolpix S220 really fits my specs beautifully. I am not very electronically savvy, yet I had no trouble learning how to use it. I recommend, though, getting a neck lanyard so that you can carry it around your neck - this would make it less likely for you to lose or drop it somewhere. My only complaint - and it's just a very tiny one - is that without the view finder feature that other cameras have, it is often hard to see the image you're photographing if it is a bright clear day.",

It is small and easy enough to use, but the photo quality is absolutely terrible. I tested it in a variety of situations: inside, outside, bright light, low light, and even shot some video. I would say it failed every category. The photo quality is perhaps a step above a cellphone camera (but not by much) in my opinion. I returned it on Black Friday and purchased a Canon SD 1200 IS. It unfortunately cost me about $30 more, but I think it will end up being worth it.",

Inside the museum, the pictures came out grainy and I noticed the camera couldn't take decent pictures at night. Night pictures looked blurry and out of focus. I orginally paid 149.99 for this camera and then resold it taking a loss of 69 dollars. Avoid this camera at all costs. I'll stick to Cannon or Sony for my next camera purchase.
