I started using Skechers a few years back, because I was having a hard time finding a sporty shoe, that lasts under heavy use. The last pair I bought had different widths, including some extra-wide sizes. This shoe didn't seem to offer that. Anyway, I bought the size I thought would fit. At 1st it seemed a bit tight on the sides, but, now, the leather is getting stretched/conditioned, it seems to fit like a glove. As w/ anything, the verdict will be out, on how well these hold up, but, so far, I'll give them a thumbs up.",
