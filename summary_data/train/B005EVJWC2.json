Also, the inner part of the stick slides out to roasting length and slides back in to a length that would fit in your suitcase, so we'll be taking these with us on a plane trip later this summer!",

There are 5 45\" telescoping skewers and each has a unique handle color - red, blue, yellow, black and green. They also have little red rubber caps for the skewer ends.
