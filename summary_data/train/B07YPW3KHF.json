I believe this is due to the ozone odor and potential health impacts of too much ozone in an indoor space. Strong smell when operating ozone function, which is how it deodorizes items. Smell and the safety concern makes the deodorizing function inoperable in my opinion, unless you can place it someplace like an attached garage. So, it becomes an over-priced glove/shoe dryer. The drying power is OK. I've only used it for gloves and it takes pretty long. Some smell (like a plastic, electric smell) even when just using the drying function. I returned the one we hadn't opened.",
