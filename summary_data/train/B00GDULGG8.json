I have them running with the D-9601 amp. The high db ratings mean that you need less wattage to reach higher sound levels. If you want a setup that can have clean deep bass but still have the capability to turn them up and rattle store windows ordrive people out of their minds-this is the choice of sub.",

AMAZING! I have them wired in parallel down to 1ohm total and the amp pushes them really hard without breaking a sweat. I can't tell you how happy I am with that setup. For under $600 in total it blows away $2000 systems I have heard in other cars.

      "text": "I had one of these single subs in a ported box powered by a Pioneer GM-D8601 amp. It had a funky smell for the first month it was breaking in after that it bumped really loud. I always played it at 50-75% with the bass controller provided with the amp. Today I decided to put it up to 100% and not long after half a song was done playing there was a final thump and my car started to smell like an electrical fire. It worked great for what it's priced, but I guess the single sub couldn't handle that amp. Purchased Jan. 30, 2017 and it blew June 6, 2017",

Works great still makes crisp loud bass. I listen to a lot of rap and EDM it can hit all the notes. I run the sub as well as all my speakers off a 5 channel SSL 29000 watt amp. Works good. Gunna buy another one of these bad boys make a second box to get the shaking back. Highly recommend to any bass heads out there. Get a ported box if you have the room in your car tho!!",
