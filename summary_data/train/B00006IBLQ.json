Excellent microfiber cloth that does exactly what I need it to. Very soft yet durable and appears to be easily cleaned (though I have not tried to yet). I just drape it over my chromebook before putting it into the case and I have it with me wherever I go. Helps a lot in class when you don't want fellow students eyeballing your gross screen and wondering why you are such a grease ball. :-P But seriously, a nice little cloth and well-priced.

You can wrap one around your digital device while you travel to prevent scratches, you can wipe your glasses with them without streaks. They trap dust like a magnet. If they get dirty, throw them in the dryer. Only downside is that you have to huff hot air onto screens with spit stains/water marks to wipe those off. You might get light headed on a large monitor.",

      "text": "I'm not sure how this cloth does it, but it cleans the surfaces of iPhones and iPad's beautifully. I don't add any cleaning agent and it seems to just erase the fingerprint marks. I bought this because I used a friends cloth. He had his in his car for a year without washing it and he used it on a daily basis to clean his cell phone and sun glasses. It still cleaned my iPhone wonderfully. I used my newly cleaned iPhone to buy this cloth for myself on amazon.com : )",
