Not to mention, its durability did not compromise comfort which also earned appreciation. It, however, disappointed customers with its restrictive fit.Having all that said, the pros of Newport Eco from KEEN makes it worth a try. Potential buyers should try this first to determine if the width works for them.",

These shoes are the real deal! After hiking over 50 miles thru deserts, mountains, cities, and trips into the Dead Sea and Jordan river these sandals never disappointed me! I would definitely recommend them to anyone. They fit about a half size larger than what I usually wear, so I went with a 10 versus a 10.5. One added bonus: the odor-resistant feature on this show is for real! Just ask any of my 28 fellow travelers!!!",
