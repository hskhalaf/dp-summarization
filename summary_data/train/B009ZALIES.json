Shouldn't be a problem for a bigger sedan or an SUV. - The rollers make it easy to move around while picking up the balls or between car and court. It may not seem like a big deal, but it is just so much move convenient having the rollers there.",

Hard plastic doesn't hold a screw well, especially when the normal use of the product includes repeated torque, in this case side-to-side stress. So the screws fall out, usually on the tennis court, where you usually lose them. And they are difficult to replace with a bolt/nut because the slot is constricted. I have never used the wheels, which seems a little silly given the weight of tennis balls, but were I walking some distance to the court, I might consider this a good feature.",

As others said, screw in the [optional] wheels first, then other's will fall in its place and use the original box picture as a guide for efficient installation.
