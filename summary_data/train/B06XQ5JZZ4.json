Not sure if it would handle much more snow, or a lot of wind, at least not without some reinforcement. But it stays a few degrees warmer during the winter nights and heats up fast in the morning. This thing is a great deal for a small greenhouse.",

I was able to start all my tomatoes, basil. herbs and peppers ahead of schedule and they are already blooming. yay. Im very happy with this addidtion to our yard. I bought some heater wire (for greenhouses and hotboxes)) and attached it to hardcloth (wire) and cover w. dirt and it becomes a heated greenhosue in winter w. a small fan. I wold definitely buy again.",

The other at the other end.\u201d As it is, there aren\u2019t any written instructions. Only a small diagram full of numbers. Super stupid.

Sturdy, Modern, Quick Assembly, withstood the 6 hours of hurricane force winds and constant rain last week here in Texas. The mesh windows let air through while deterring pests and birds and also helps to regulate the temperature inside. March 28th was our seed planting day and everything is going well so far, these photos were captured today. Buy the greenhouse. You'll love it!",
