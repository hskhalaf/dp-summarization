The battery burned right through the bag and caught my work bench on fire, then burned my transmitter, and some other things too. If I wouldn't have been home, it might have evwn burned down my house. Never trust one of these bags to help contain a fire. They won't even slow it down. I thought I was being safe, boy was I wrong. I now charge my lipos on the side of my house on a concrete slab with nothing near them to catch on fire. This Teenitor bag Failed, miserably.",
