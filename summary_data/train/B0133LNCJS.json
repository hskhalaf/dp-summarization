I had a two story trixie cage but now due to us moving to a smaller place I needed a little smaller cage. They love this cage and on the outside I put a fence so they get plenty of floor time. Piggies are happy usually they only sleep in there as they are running around outside their cage 90 percent of the day. I didn't use the plastic water bottle because I have a glass one for them.",

Easy assembly, several useful features including the front door is the entire side of the wire enclusure. The water bottle is good and a good size but the holder doesn't stay. I went back to two pieces of wire for the bottle and it works well. I didn't use the upper level/hideout because the boys stayed there all the time. They haven't managed to upset the food dish, but it does tend to migrate around the bottom of the cage. Overall, a good solution for two caveys!",
