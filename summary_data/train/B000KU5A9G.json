I love the 4 sided over the 3 sided ones because I don't change a wiggly kid standing at his feet. we place it on top of the dresser and not in a framed changing table so the 4 sides is perfect. I like that it is small so it doesn't take up a ton of space, but it is still large enough to fit my 2 year old for changes. this pad withstood 2 kids and only gave out because my 2 year old pulled it down during naptime and ripped and pulled out the stuffing. Apparently his toys weren't interesting enough. Baby #3 got a replacement of the exact same one.",

I like it, and right now it is in our living room since we have an infant.. but I don't LOVE the product and think maybe i could have just purchased cheaper product.",

We will be keeping it because we decided to open it up, add extra cushion for softness and comfort for baby. We're also going to order a very soft velour like cover to make it comfortable and look better in general. As is though wouldn't cut it for me.

However, since it curves up all around to prevent the child from falling on all sides it ends up being a bit short for a toddler that is approx 16 month old. We will still occasionally use this for now but will definitely use this once our new addition comes and with that, I believe would be a five star product since it will be long enough for our baby. Overall pretty good.",

Before ordering, I wasn't sure if I'd like that it was contoured on all 4 sides instead of just the long sides, but I do like it this way. In fact, the contour seems deeper than most changing pads which makes it a little bit safer in my opinion - my daughter is very wiggly! It's very easy to clean when my daughter isn't quite \"done\" when I think she is and there's no diaper under her.",
