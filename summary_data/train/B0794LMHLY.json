      "text": "This speaker, after the Gen 2 echo, didn't blow my socks off. It sounds great, but then my gen 2 sounded very good also. I also have a pair of gen 2's grouped as a stereo pair, grouped also with an Echo Sub. I wouldn't even consider replacing those Gen 2's with Gen 3's. With the Sub doing a bunch of the system's work, the system sounds great to me already. So if you're buying new, get the Gen 3 for sure (not a used or refurbed set of Gen 2s) If you have Gen 2s, you probably should keep them. Unless you are a toy boy like me!",

Also I bought these to use as stereo sound for my fire tv but it turns out that it is not compatible and even though my tv has Bluetooth as an option it still only plays through one speaker so it doesn\u2019t make since to use it. Very disappointed with this product and wish I never bought it. Would not suggest buying this or any other Alexas",

Echo would stop playing music and books for a time, then just start back up. It double beeped periodically. It was not my Wi-Fi because my Dot had no problems at all. Music and books skipped and was garbled now and then. I reset the new one and did everything to rectify the situation. I then decided to keep my first generation and return the third generation. The third generation was introduced in September 2019. Too soon? Maybe or perhaps it was my particular device.",

The only con is not with the echo itself, but with volume controls within the alexa app. It would be very beneficial if users were able to control Left/Right channel volume controls independently from one another rather than solely as a pair.
