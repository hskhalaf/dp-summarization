The failed cherries are pretty easy to ID since there is no \"exit wound,\" just a cross from where the mechanism missed the pit. It has not stained when washed off with water after use. Ended up giving some as gifts after I positive feedback on a the bowls of cherries I brought to a few playdates. I'm do not like single function kitchen tools, but this and the OXO strawberry huller (link below) are 2 tools that just work and really save time.",

Sometimes the pits are hanging on to the cherry but easy to remove and 2. wash the pitter immediately after you finish using it or it will be hard to get the juice and fibers out from between the top and the white interior \"plate\" that covers the \"plungers.\" I'm happy with my purchase.",

If you line up all four cherries' stem ends (minus the stem of course) directly upright in the little cups, and give it a good whack, maybe one pit in 50 won't come out perfectly. Good enough for me! It's not built for the ages (plastic, and those cutting tines are going to get dull eventually), but ah well. It's also a little bulky in the drawer. Nothing frustrating, just a bit more drawer real estate required than those scissor-action, one-cherry-at-a-time units.",
