I also like that it reports both release (peak) and plate speed at the same time. It also has better range than most of the other radar models available. The features come at a premium price wise but if you care about accuracy and consistency this is the best radar I have tried. This is one of three different radars I have used and it is my favorite. I also like that you can set it to continuous mode or control it by the trigger.",
