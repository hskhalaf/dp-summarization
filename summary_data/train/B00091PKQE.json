But, this was the best chicken I\u2019ve ever cooked on my Pit Boss smoker, hands down. I am looking for whole chickens on sale and may purchase another one of these so I can do two at a time. We used Dr. Pepper plus rubs both in the Steamer and on the chicken. Great flavor, smoke, and moist beyond belief.",

Even though I have plently of vertical room for the turkey to stand up like the lighter chicken, the turkey had to kind of lean over. It was fine because this container remained in position. I cooked the turkey with the container inside an aluminum roasting pan. I used a smoker. But, this would work just as well in a closed BBQ grill or even a regular oven. The meat comes out juicy. Of course the same was true for chicken. I would recommend this to anyone.",

    "title": "Cook's Choice Ceramic Steamer Beer Can Roasters Combo Pack- Sittin' Chicken and Turkey Marinade Barbecue Cookers- Infuse BBQ flavors",
    "description": "Beer can chicken has never tasted so good. Grill to perfection with the sittin' chicken or sittin' turkey flavor infusor. Simply pour in your favorite beer, add a few dashes of seasoning and slow cook on the grill or oven for the most tasty chicken ever.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nThese two ceramic cones, one for a chicken and one for a turkey, make an easier and safer alternative to cooking with an actual beer can. The method is the same: liquid is put in a cylinder that goes up inside the bird's cavity, and as the liquid heats during grilling it creates steam that keeps the bird moist. Beer isn't even required-the Sittin' Chicken or Sittin' Turkey cones can hold butter, olive oil, garlic, fruit juice, soda, or chunks of onion, apple or lemon. For extra flavor marinade can be injected into the bird and the outside rubbed with spices. An onion or potato stuffed in the neck opening of the bird helps keep the moisture in. After a couple hours of slow cooking on the grill, the result is a bird crispy on the outside with flavorful and moist meat. \n\n The ceramic cones are designed with wide bases to prevent tipping, and are glazed inside and out to make clean-up a snap-the cones go right into the dishwasher. Spraying a cone with a nonstick vegetable spray before sitting the bird on top will make the job even easier. The underside of the base is unglazed to go directly on a grill. If the cones are used in an oven, a pan of water or sheet of aluminum foil needs to go underneath to catch drips. The Sittin' Chicken measures 5 by 4-1/4 inches, while the Sittin' Turkey measures 6 by 6 inches and can hold a turkey weighing up to 18 pounds. This set with one of each makes a great gift for the outdoor chef. --Ann Bieri",
