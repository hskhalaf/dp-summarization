      "text": "Nutmeg grinders are hard to find. Especially good ones. To me, grated fingertips are not worth the hand grinding option, and the round graters are horrid. But THIS one is AWESOME!!! It holds a lot of extra nutmeg, which are super easy to move over to start grating, and the spring is strong so it does an incredible job of keeping the pressure on the nut to get a good grind. The only problem I've had is that if you accidentally get two nuts over to the grinder side, it won't grind and it's REALLY hard to get the 2nd nut out of there. And fresh ground nutmeg is so much more amazing than canned stuff!",

      "text": "For being a Cole & Mason product I was really looking forward to using this for quick grinding of nutmeg seeds with a high quality design. The design is flawed as it begins to have issues as the final tip of the nutmeg begins to near the shaving mechanism it tends to spin and not shave any more. If that didn't happen the claw that grasps the nutmeg would begin to carve a circle into the top of the seed instead of hold it in place for proper shaving... Pretty disappointing as other products I've used by Cole & Mason are spectacular. Skip this one.",

Then someone said \"If you have a pepper mill for pepper, why not a nutmeg mill for nutmeg\" and I started to be swayed. After finding myself not using nutmeg because I did not want to wash my microplane I was convinced and I ordered this. And I am glad I did. The good: - Holds 6-7 nutmeg fruits - Grinds smoothly - Loads the next nutmeg without a second though The ok: - Takes 0.75 as long as my microplane to grind the same amount of nutmeg. I was hoping for faster All in all I am happy.",
