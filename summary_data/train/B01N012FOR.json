They also came inside a really nice reusable bag, that I will probably use to store the case in when I switch out cases (I like to mix it up and go back and forth between what cases I use). Arrived on time too.",

Comes with a soft keyboard cover and port plugs. These plugs are off color, but will be used regardless.",
