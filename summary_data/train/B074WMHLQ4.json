And if I were the 12 year old, I would have gone crazy with it on my own. The breadboard that comes with this kit is similar to the breadboard I bought when I was 13 and, adjusting for inflation, I think the whole Arduino kit cost me what that first breadboard alone cost me. The DVD is excellent and clearly shows how to build everything and use everything in the kit. Projects will take you 30 minutes tops to make and learn from.",

I have had pretty good luck with the other parts. One of my LED display's has pixels lines out when displaying certain numbers. Makes trouble shooting a bit harder at times as well. Over all, not to bad a kit since I got it on sale for $28.00, but I am looking more closely or as much as I can on the site for higher quality parts and working away for \"kits\". I would rather pay a bit more for quality vs quantity.",

The pdf tutorials are laid out in such a way as to be very easy to understand. And the included video's come in handy as well. The variety of parts and shields keep it fresh so no one gets bored too quickly. There are a few mistakes that I ran across in the pdf tutorials regarding how some of the experiments are connected via the breadboard, but a keen eye can spot them and make the right connections when needed.

After I bought my kit, I bought two others for family members who had wished to get into electronics in the past. They state that the tutorials are very nice, short and sweet, not overly complex and the lessons take the student slowly through the material. Great stuff for beginners.",

The selection of sensors and gadgets is good, but it would be great if the provided set of connectors included some extras such as alligator clips, pincer test probes, and header pins. Anything that would make it easier to integrate pinless breakout boards (e.g. Adafruit VEML6075) without the need for soldering would be fantastic.",

Pros: Easy to program on Slackware 14.2. Cons: The female ends of the female-male end jumper wires are fairly loose, and don't make a good connection. A needle will help with that, though. I'll try to remember to update this as I learn how to program it all on my stm32 board.",
