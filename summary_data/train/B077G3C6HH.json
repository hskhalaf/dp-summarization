They are really quiet tho, but I'd rather have a cooler system for a better overclock. Im seeing a 20-25c drop in temps with the H150i with Vardar F4 120er fans. I used the same fans on the H100i for reference. Really worth it for an I7 8700k if you're overclocking. My chip would thermal throttle with the H100i almost instantly at anything over 4.7. Now im sitting at 5.1ghz and in the high 70's mid 80's while benching. In games its at 40 or so.",

Cooler itself is very quiet and I've had zero issues with it so far (purchased/installed late Feb19). I've overclocked my CPU to 4.6 Ghz, am currently playing X4 Foundation on max settings, and the temperature gauge for my CPU has barely nudged upward.

The software (ICue) is something that you must download once you finish installing everything as that software is what allows you to control the fan/pump speed as well as the RGB settings. All in all, I definitely suggest buying this liquid cooling system. Easy to install and there are instant differences.",

Doing this will prevent any whining noises as well as extend the life of your AIO!",

And then also the Corsair liquid CPU cooler. So that's my set up and I can play Apex on ultra high graphics for 8 hours while having multiple streaming and multimedia programs running and my CPU never gets over 51 degrees Celsius. The CPU cooler runs smoothly and sounds beautiful. Software is meh because the updates are constant it seems. and every update i have had to re do some portion of my settings every time. THE CPU cooler always runs perfect, but im talking about color settings.",
