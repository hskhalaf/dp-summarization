I use a hand cranked burr grinder and a kettle with a long spout, both of which are worth having anyway, but combined with the Chemex, I can make a perfect cup every time.",

As for the coffee it makes with Chemex filters, every boutique coffee roaster I order from rated at coffeereview.com recommens Chemex coffeemakers.

I only make a cup or so at a time, so my only regret is having to use an entire filter for just one cup. I plan to see if the filters will compost once the weather warms up.",

      "text": "I love cold brew coffee, but it's not cost-effective to make jug after jug. This tastes a lot like cold brew--strong but without any bitterness and not much acid. It's quick and easy to brew. The only thing I don't like is when you get the filter wet, it sinks into the little pouring lip on the jug and then something about the pressure bubbles and spits drops of hot coffee out the spout. Ouch! Other than that, I really like chemex coffee and I'll definitely be buying a bigger pot for when company comes over.",

I'm happy that I did, this produces the best-tasting coffee I've had in some time. Personally I don't like bitter-tasting coffee and prefer light roasts. Sipping my coffee in the mornings after it's been prepared with the Chemex is a joy. The coffee pot is well-balanced when you hold it to pour your coffee and I do like its aesthetics.",

The coffee is actually very good with low bitterness. 4. Cleanup is a snap. 5. Looks great and takes up very little space. All in all I really like this coffee maker and would highly recommend to anyone, just be sure to buy the Chemex filters and don't try to use generic ones. And for the price, it's a good bargain.",
