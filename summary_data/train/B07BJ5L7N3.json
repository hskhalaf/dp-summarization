I had so much fun doing the carry on luggage that I think I'm going to order more of these packs and do the medium size luggage next! If you have been eyeing up the different \"girly\" stickers on amazon, SKIP the \"planner\" options and instead buy 2 of these. The planner stickers are chintzy. cheap, dull and nowhere near the quality or cuteness of these!",

There are big stickers, small stickers, all colors and themes, and (at least for what I paid) cheaper than buying many packs of foreign knock-offs. Such a wonderful surprise to open it and see all that is included. In case anyone is confused, this is just a book of sheets of stickers. Again, growing up in the 80s, sticker books usually had pages of stickers, and then lots of blank pages to stick those stickers; this does not have the latter.",

Unfortunately it came slightly damaged on the corners, but it isn't bad enought to effect the stickers. However, after she had already started using some of the stickers, we noticed that the larger alphabet stickers are cut off a little bit on top, as the page was cut wrong. The edges of the book also have some glue residue, but this doesn't effect the stickers either, it just looks a little dirty. I still recommend this book, but check it before you peel any stickers to make sure none are cut off.",
