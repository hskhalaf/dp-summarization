The bed is stiff and hard, feels like cheap plastic, and the fit is loose. Workmanship has gone downhill and these are going back.",

All I can say is if you have problems with low back, leg and foot pain, try these. It might take you a couple days to get used to walking on them, but after that, they are so comfy, you will never by a regular pair of flip flops again.",

Nice looking and dressier than the usual flip flop, but it would be great to see an even dressier version. Slightly narrow at the widest part of my foot, so not the most flattering but better than the others I looked at.",
