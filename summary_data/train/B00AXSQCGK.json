Remember that the base coat and color coats will still be tacky after curing. This will deal with the top coat. And using some sort of cuticle oil will really help prevent damage and drying of your beds after you finish your gel session!",

I definitely would recommend that you cure your nails for longer than the recommended time. I chose to glass cure my thumb and pinky fingers as they seemed to need approval time top fully set. In addition you must make sure that your coats of polish are as thin as possible or the it will not cure and you may have rippling or bubbling. Other than that I'd say this was a great purchase and I would recommend it. Be sure to use an alcohol or another cleansing agent to wipe off your nails after they are cured as they will be tacky.",

ALSO VERY IMPORTANT to remember after you cure the last coat there will be a sticky film on the nail and it feels like it is still wet, just use a paper towel and rubbing alcohol to remove the film and they will be good to go! I thought the lamp wasn't working properly when I first started using it because I did not know about that last step!!!",

It makes more sense to me to dry four fingers at a time bcuz the gel self-levels. And the led light drys in half the time as the uv AND the uv bulbs blow (mine did after about two months). There are 4 time settings, 30 sec, 60 sec, 90 sec and 30 MINUTES (I actually might start using the 30 min to flash cure my free edges).",

A warning though: While I can fit all 5 fingers in here, the angle that my thumb is at can cause it to not cure as well despite the lights and mirrors. I just do my thumbs separately, as it is still a time saver over my old, non-LED light. This probably varies depending on your hand size and how well you can get your thumb in there flat instead of angled. I would at least try doing all 5 a couple of times, it might work for you.",

I think this is necessary because the dryer is a lower wattage (12W). Also, it's recommended that you do the thumbs separately. The polish tends to settle a bit on the sides of the thumbs when done with the rest of your fingers because they can't be placed flatly when drying the entire hand. Wet cotton ball with rubbing alcohol to remove sticky/tacky residue after top coat is cured. Standard Shipping was super fast. Dryer is lightweight and doesn't look like much, but does a great job.",

I do have to say, though...I don't like that the buttons to turn on the light beep every time you use them...which gets a little annoying. However, for its awesome performance, I can overlook a little annoyance.",

Most polishes and builder gel take a minute to cure, and they cure evenly as well. My only complaint is depending on the size of your hand you might not be able to fit your whole hand so thumbs have to be cured separately but honestly that doesn't really bother me. The size is also great for carrying around with you to clients or even if it's just on your desk, doesn't take up a lot of space. I definitely recommend this.",

It's light so you can move it around easy and it's super quiet too. My only complaint would be that while it says you can do a five-finger cure, the inside part of my thumbs didn't cure and I had to do it all over again. I now will cure them separately, so it's not a huge deal, just be prepared.",
