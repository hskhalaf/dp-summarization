Bought this based on reviews here as having good range (mimo), which it did, even with channel bonding turned off (so as not to clobber everything for my neighbors). Unfortunately, it had serious incompatibility problems. Would not maintain connection (WPA/WPA2 TKIP+AES) with PlayStation 3 or with my Cingular 8525 (HTC tytn), and had intermittent problems with my toshiba tecra M5 and dell m700, both with internal wireless mini-pci cards (not sure which chipsets).

You cannot change the subnet address which restricts remote access when using a VPN connection. Customer service kept me on hold for ever and then had my call dropped. Terrible waste of money. Avoid at all cost Now if only there is some way to change my initial 4 star rating to a 1 star ...",

Everything has worked as advertised - WPA encryption, wired, wireless, MAC filtering, etc. This is my first wireless router. There's just one gotcha. Do NOT access the router via a browser while you have active sessions. When I have an active VPN session and save a change, the VPN session dies and must be restarted. Restrict changes to periods when no one is accessing the internet or your home network. Otherwise, range and speed are quite adequate.",

It starts dropping connections probably 2 times a week, usually power off and power on will fix it, but some times that doesn't even work for an hour or so. I've tried upgrading to the latest firmware 1.00.17 and hard reseting, but it's still has problems. You can do a search on the web for similar issues. I don't know if it's Cisco buying them or if Linksys is going downhill permanently, but even though I was totally satisfied with a previous wireless and wired router I won't be purchasing from Linksys again.",

My wife's 2005 laptop [w/out SRX 400 card] is getting 54 Mbps upstairs pretty consistently -- it's dropped to 24 Mbps briefly but generally has been fine. Highly recommended, but do not expect to get auto-configure plug-n-play out of the box.",

They are poorly made and the firmware is poorly programmed. They constantly drop their IP address, constantly drop their wireless signal. In short, don't bother! Netgear is probably a better choice. But we'll see about that.",

    "title": "Cisco-Linksys WRT54GX4 Wireless-G Broadband Router with SRX400",
    "description": "Linksys Wireless-G Notebook Adapter with SRX 400 Wireless-G for your notebook with SRX technology provides up to 10 times faster wireless network throughput, reduces dead spots, and increases wireless range by up to 3 times. Also fully compatible with all public and private Wireless-G and Wireless-B networks. The Wireless-G Notebook Adapter with SRX400 is the simple way to add or upgrade wireless connectivity in your notebook computer. Just slide it into your notebook's PC Card slot and enjoy high-speed wireless network access while retaining true mobility.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe Wireless-G Broadband Router with SRX400 is really three devices in one box. First, there's the Wireless Access Point, which lets you connect to the network without wires. There's also a built-in 4-port full-duplex 10/100 Switch to connect your wired-Ethernet devices together. Finally, the Router function ties it all together and lets your whole network share a high-speed cable or DSL Internet connection. \n\n The Access Point built into the Router combines smart antenna technology with standards-based Wireless-G (802.11g) networking. By overlaying the signals of two Wireless-G compatible radios, the \"Multiple In, Multiple Out\" (MIMO) technology effectively doubles the data rate. Unlike ordinary wireless networking technologies that are confused by signal reflections, MIMO actually uses these reflections to increase the range and reduce \"dead spots\" in the wireless coverage area. The robust signal travels farther, maintaining wireless connections up to 3 times farther than standard Wireless-G. \n\n With SRX, the farther away you are, the more speed advantage you get, and SRX400 works great with standard Wireless-G and -B equipment, and other flavors of Linksys SRX. But when both ends of the wireless link are SRX400, the router can increase the throughput even more by using twice as much radio band, yielding speeds up to 10 times as fast as standard Wireless-G. But unlike other speed-enhanced technologies, SRX400 can dynamically enable this double-speed mode for SRX400 devices, while still connecting to non-SRX400 wireless devices at their respective fastest speeds. And SRX400 is a \"good neighbor\", always checking for other wireless devices in the area before gobbling up the radio band. \n\n To help protect your data and privacy, the Router can encode all wireless transmissions with industrial-strength WPA encryption. It can serve as your network's DHCP Server, has a powerful SPI firewall to protect your PCs against intruders and most known Internet attacks, and supports VPN pass-through. Configuration is a snap with the web browser-based configuration utility. \n\n With the Linksys Wireless-G Broadband Router with SRX400 at the center of your home or office network, you can share a high-speed Internet connection, files, printers, and multi-player games at faster than 10/100 wired network speeds, without the hassle of stringing wires!\n\nSee more",
