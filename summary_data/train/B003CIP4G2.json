I purchased this tool in order to mount the boards with the least amount of new holes and couldn't be happier. Not only does the decking look great, the tool made the job installing it just that much more simple to complete.",

I continued using their screws, but switched to a square head driver. If I hadn't bought a big box of their screws I would not have used them either. If I use this jig again. I would purchase Torx or Square or Phillips head screws.",

I have bad knees to begin with so spending the extra time was hard. Overall I think it is a worthwhile investment if you don't want the screws on the top of the boards. Gives a nice professional look. You definitely need to be careful that you don't overpower the jig. It is only plastic. I did also have trouble with the collar on the drill guide slipping until I cut a small notch in the driver so the set screw could sit in further.",

If using the 1/4 spacers (you will need MANY more than provided in the kit) the shaft of the driver will sometimes leave a dent in the neighboring board. Used the drill for about 4 boards then quit predrilling since I'm using Alaska yellow cedar, which is fairly soft, the 2X screws do a pretty good job of drilling their own hole, and the drill head just disappears into it's hole. Do NOT over penetrate the board, because you're coming in from the side if you overpenetrate you'll actually shove the board over a bit and mess up your spacing.",

The only problem I had is the collar that controls the depth of screws is held in place with a small set screw. This kept coming loose after several screws are set resulting in screws set too deep. The same problem occurred with the collar on the drill bit but less often. Kreg could easily solve this problem by milling a shoulder on the shaft to control depth rather than rely on a collar secured by a set screw. I used this on 2x6 redwood using the longer screws.",
