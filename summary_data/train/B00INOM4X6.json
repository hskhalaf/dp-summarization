My brother insisted I tried these and I am glad he did. They are amazing. They feel soft and they do not leave a residue or smell on your hands like regular wipes. You can tell they are pure wipes. They smell fresh as well. You can tell they have a drop of fruit in them as well. They are definitely a game changer!",

If my finger pokes through this thing while cleaning a poop then it is a definite no-go. In the end, these were not more gentle on a diaper rash bum than my Amazon wipes, and nowhere near as soft or durable.",

WaterWipes are unlike any other baby wipe on the market, and have been produced using cutting-edge new technology. When a baby is born, the outermost layer of their skin is inComplete, making their skin much thinner than adults. When it comes to ingredients, less is more. Conventional baby wipes use ingredients also found in bubble baths, shampoos, etc. WaterWipes are the baby wipe that parents and healthcare professionals have been waiting for. Cleaning a newborn baby's delicate skin requires the mildest, gentlest care possible, to avoid skin sensitization problems. Thanks to WaterWipes, parents have the convenience of baby wipes with the absolute purity. With a clean, fresh non-greasy feel, they leave no residue on the skin. Free of alcohol, perfume, chlorine, formaldehyde, phenols, phthalates, SLS and SLES, lanolin and unnecessary additives.",
