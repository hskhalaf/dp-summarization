This was very time consuming and it being very hot outside didn't help. The installation was a breeze and now I have this system on a timer so my flower beds are watered every morning for a few minutes. Very nice when you use this with the Orbit 56233D 3-Outlet Digital Watering Timer. This way you still have a way to use your hose without disconnecting the micro bubbler.",

The Orbit 69525 Micro Bubbler Drip Irrigation kit was incredibly easy to assemble (the directions were flawless). I had an entire raised flower bed up and running in less than an hour. The primary diver for the purchase though was the color of the spray heads. All of the other products I looked at had bright day-glow tips that would have detracted from the flowers my wife picked for the garden. As the photo shows the Orbit system is nearly invisible. For ease of installation and just great looks this system can't be beat.",

I've used drip systems for years, and the one downside is that the heads and tubing don't last that long, and they do require a fair amount of maintenance. (The worst is when earwigs get into the sprinkler heads, which happens quite frequently.) Anyway, it's a good set.",
