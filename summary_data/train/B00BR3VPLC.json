I have combo-dry skin weather depending. I do not find it makes my skin oily but maybe its not friendly to all skin types specifically oily. My foundation sets nicely over it (no sinking)and stays on for about 8 hours before needing a touch up. And of course my pores...barely visible!!!! Im happy",

Did it really dramatically reduce the pore size on my mid cheeks when make up is on? I'd say it helps a little, but not dramatically. I don't have really large pores so thought it would blur the few I have on my mid cheek area as I have high cheek bones.

I love putting this one after my regular moisturizer and just before applying makeup. It lasts all day and yet it's such a nice and light primer it doesnt feel thick or heavy at all, it just makes my skin so silky and smoothe and creates such a radiant look that I love using it on my face even on days I dont apply makeup!:) This stuff is perfect. It doesnt cause breakouts or irritate my skin or anything. Absolutely recommend!",

Just as well as it did for any other high end pore filling primer does for me, such as benefit or smash box! My friend tried it and she loved it though! It comes in a pretty glass bottle and the consistency is so smooth without being greasy. It\u2019s also great to get it here bc ulta/sephora was selling it for over 20 I think?? So definitely buy it here!",

It doesn't blur my pores; but I have yet to find a primer that can successfully do that. But, to all primers defense, my pores are like craters, so I probably never will.",

Again, can't even read the ingredients, so who knows what silicone science they've harnessed but this is a great product, especially for the price. WELL DONE y'all! Highly recommend this product who are looking for better coverage, with or without make up (I wear this under foundation, with only concealer, or with no makeup at all).",

It does seem to make pores that are usually not visible on my face visible, so I would recommend just using it in areas where your pores are more noticeable, and sticking to a regular primer for the rest of your face.
