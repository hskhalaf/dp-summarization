I will try to buy the other figures of the collection. pieces do not fall off with articulation. this is it. The figure is a nice size. Too many sellers on Amazon selling overpriced collectibles. Your child/big kid/adult collector will love this. I will update later after my son has played with it.",

He said \"don't worry mom, it will click back on.\" Then, when he realized that the piece to click the leg back onto had broken off, he started to cry. He is 9 yrs old and this was his Christmas present. This also happened to his Jiren action figure as well.......on the same left leg. This is a factory defect.",
