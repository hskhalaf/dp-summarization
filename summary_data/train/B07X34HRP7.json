Yes fellas size does matter. Will go 3 days with regular use before you need a charge. Comes with two screwdrivers so you can attach a clip on the back and to remove a cover to put in a SIM card or sd memory. You can even drop, throw and submerge (all tested involuntary LOL) I think the only thing that can break it is if I call my mother. (Don't show her this) (She's a lovely lady)",

I highly recommend if your sick of getting mediocre performance from top dollar brands. FYI they are all manufactured in China lol. Ulefone is doing well for sure.",

The battery is amazingly good. Charged it all the way 3 days ago, and it's still at 61% all phones should have batteries like this. The price is the best part.

However, due to the recent death spiral of that company, and the significantly degraded battery in my last HTC, I was looking for a new phone. I discovered the Ulefone Armor 3W. It was not overpriced, and based on other ratings, I decided to invest. I'm very happy that I did. This phone is anchored in Android 9.0 and performs well. It is highly configurable, and the extraordinary battery life has made me very satisfied. I'll continue to update this review as time passes, but as of almost 4 weeks in, I'm entirely happy with this purchase.",

There needs to be an external speaker/microphone and a case that allows a construction worker, doing delicate work requiring hands-on. The motion of reaching for your belt and holding a walkie-talkie in your hand is many times NOT practical or safe. It is best to have the walkie-talkie in a case (to protect it) on your belt and the external speaker/microphone clipped on the chest near the mouth so that simply keying the mic of the remote speaker/microphone will suffice for two-way communications.",

This does not have the head phone jack but you get an adapter that converts the C charger port to the 3.5mm jack to plug in to. It's not overloaded with apps you'll never use taking up needed storage space. I'm very happy with my purchase and that I didn't have to spend $800 or more.",
