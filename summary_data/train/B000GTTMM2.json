That said, with my solid posi rear in my old Honda 350 TRX you can not turn without digging up anything short of a paved road. Not something you would ride around in your yard unless you really hate grass and love that \"just roto-tilled\" look. I wanted to be able to skid firewood logs off my hillside in 8 inches of late winter settled crusty snow. I tried chains and wasn't happy with trying to keep them on when pawing and digging. Went to these tires and WOW. Get around now AWESOME. Happy-Happy-Happy.",

I have a rather steep driveway, and with the OEM tires I couldn't plow uphill -- no traction. Even to do that good I had to put cable chains on the front tires. With these tires I plow both ways (and no chains). It has cut down the time it takes me to plow my hundred yards of driveway by at least a third.",

They have an open design that makes it so the mud does not stick to the tires. I thought the price was really good compared to other tires out there.",

I love that the tread design also allows for a smooth ride on pavement without taking away from the offroad performance. Excellent tread design! We are going to the dunes later this year and I'm predicting that these will do great. The treads basically have paddle cups built into them. I will post an update with a sand report. In conclusion: excellent tire, great value.",
