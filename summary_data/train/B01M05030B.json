Roku 3, I miss you. Roku Ultra, wish we'd never met. Works great but occasionally a purple screen with \"DHCP unautherized\" will flash on screen for a second. Goes away fast but it's strange, amazing box aside from that. **Update** Taking away more stars as the purple screen happens more and sometimes there's a green bar on the left of the screen like it can't determine the correct screen size. Hate that this Roku is like this because I loved my roku3.",

They take you through the usual troubleshooting and then tell you that they'll research the problem. There's no offer of a return/warranty replacement...you're just stuck. There's a serious problem in their Q/A group and Customer Service department. Time to buy something else from a better manufacturer.",

Apparently there's nothing they can do. Nice. You'd think they might prioritize their most expensive units for the upgrade. Apparently not. So, five stars for the product and 2-3 for support. Maybe someday. Update: Finally the OS 7.5 update arrived (end of Jan '17). Device now works as advertised. I don't use the ROKU remote so I can't comment on that.",
