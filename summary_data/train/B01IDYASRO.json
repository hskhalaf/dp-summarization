It is creamy and does not cake or dry up after application. Well, I take that back. It did clump one time but I realized that it was my new moisturizer that unfortunately just sat on top of my skin and took forever to absorb. So if it ever happens to you, it's probably not this concealer but your moisturizer, esp those with sunblock. Hope they do not discontinue this line.",

Onee application is truly all you will need, even in the heat and humidity of summer. The price is a bit much but I think it is worth the extra dollars. My only complaint is it can feel a bit dry but waterproof concealers (if you can find them) have a tenancy to be a little dryer than a basic concealer.",
