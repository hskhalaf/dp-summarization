It secures surprisingly well to most home benches, and its heavy-weight construction holds up to punishing use. Depending on the workout, Ive had as much as 180 lbs in plates (225 lbs with bar) in it with no issues. Two quick words of warning - make sure to check the tensioner knob after each workout, and make sure sure to slide the barbell all the way in after each set. I failed to do so early on, and dinged my floor pretty bad when the weight pulled out.",

      "text": "This is a well-made piece of equipment, but I'm puzzled as to why the manufacturer didn't make a mechanism to hold onto the bar itself. I solved this issue by wrapping a piece of thin bubble wrap around the end of the bar and turning it as I pushed the bar into the holder. This way the bar doesn't rattle at all and it wont easily come out of the cup-type holder. I wouldn't want to drill into the floor where the device is currently being used so I bolted it to a piece of plywood about one foot by three foot and placed plate weights on the left and right side of the bar-holder.",

The pivot took me a while to get working. The trick is to make sure the bolt in the base of the pivot is tight enough. From the factory, mine was very loose. After you get the basic Row working with the single-ended barbell cradled by either a V-bar or T-bar, check out the Bus Driver Rotation, Drop Squat and Row, or Barbell Squat and One Arm Press.",

The unit can be used for T-Bar Rows, but it can be used for landmines and similar exercies as well. It's all set up to accept both diameter bars.",

Well, it does not fit, so I will either have to bolt it to the floor or send it back. Just disappointed and don't understand why it would not be made adjustable to ensure it fits power racks better, which was the whole idea of buying this in the first place. Don't get it.",
