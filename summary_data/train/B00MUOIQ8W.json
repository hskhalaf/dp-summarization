I used a brand new (and expensive) lithium batteries in the outdoor sensor and mounted it next to the window by the counter where display unit sets (7 feet apart... if even that much). After only 2 weeks the outdoor temp failed so all it is really good for now is indoor tems. Fortunately I am within the return period ($48 is lot to throw away after only 2 good weeks). I love the display enough that Im am considering trying again... probably a bad idea though. I sure wish they would invest even a tad more in quality.",

      "text": "I'm pretty disappointed. I wanted this clock because I want to keep track of the temperature inside and out without having to check the weather app or my thermometer. I loved all the features listed on this clock's description, but so far, the clock won't stay on unless I have it plugged in (what's the point of having a bunch of batteries inside if you can't use it without the power cord?), the outside temperature gauge doesn't work, despite having changed the batteries multiple times and placing it all over the place in case it was a location-to-clock problem. So basically I bought an expensive, bright alarm clock.",

Batteries required (not included.).Weather Station Factory Restart Explanation: The factory restart returns the weather station and outdoor sensor to an ?out-of-the-box? default state and often resolves an issue. Factory Restart: 1. Remove all power (batteries and AC) from outdoor sensor and weather station. 2. Press one of the buttons on the weather station at least 20 times to clear all memory. 3. Verify that the weather station is blank before proceeding (there may be lines painted on the screen that will show when there is no power). 4. Leave both units without power for 15 minutes (very important). 5. Insert the AC power cord into the wall outlet then into the weather station. 6. Insert fresh batteries into the outdoor sensor. 7. Press the TX button on the outdoor sensor to transmit RF signal. 8. Keep the outdoor sensor 5-10 feet from the weather station. 9.

Note: In Mounting/Positioning Remote sensor First: Place the remote sensor in the desired shaded location and the weather station in the home. Wait approximately 1 hour before permanently mounting the remote sensor to ensure that there is proper reception. POSITION Outdoor: \u2022 Protect the remote sensor from standing rain or snow and from the overhead sun, which can cause it to read incorrectly. \u2022 Mounting under an eave or deck rail works well. \u2022 If you choose, you can construct a small roof or box for the remote sensor. Be sure a box has vents. \u2022 Mount the remote sensor on the North side where to prevent sun from causing incorrect readings. \u2022 Mount at least 6 feet in the air for a strong RF (radio frequency) signal. \u2022 Do not mount the remote sensor on a metal fence. This significantly reduces the effective range. \u2022 Remote sensors are water resistant, not waterproof",
