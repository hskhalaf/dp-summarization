I figured out how to adjust the sternum strap...prior to that, it was very uncomfortable to wear. That's why I'd rated it with 4 Stars, but now it's a definite 5...after I figured it out.",

I did not need the waist belt clipped and wore it more like a book bag, I will say that it looked like there was plenty of room for adjustment on all straps, and didnt cause any discomfort for the 7 hours at the festival (never even switched carrier)",
