I've been having issues with switching from breastmilk to formula and one of my main issues with being out and about. Who wants to carry that big clunky canister with them wherever they go?! Not ME! This little guy is perfect... and three servings lasted us hours out and about at the zoo. No mess, no confusion. Nothing awkward. And it's pretty discrete, for someone like me who still feels a little judged when I feed my child formula.",

One huge pro for me was that it clicks into place between each section so it doesn\u2019t move when your shaking out all the formula. My other one you have to be careful because it just turns and in my half asleep state I poured when it was between the two sections and got way to much powder.",
