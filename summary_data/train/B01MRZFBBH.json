The battery life is the best I have ever seen, barely hitting 40% after a day of frequent use including Bluetooth audio and navigation. The processor is fast, no lag in apps. The fingerprint sensor works great. I really like the EMUI, much better notification system than the standard Android 6. Camera, reception, display - no regrets here either. Also worth mentioning: Unlike my previous Samsung, Motorola and LG phones, you can actually uninstall/remove all bloatware apps that come with the phone. Definitely recommend this thing!",

I've fiddled with the color correction and while I can get it to look light, in different lighting conditions or apps it looks washed out. Fantastic value on this phone otherwise and it's kind of a deal breaker for me. Probably done this to a family member.",

My wife has zero connectivity issues with her Nexus 6. I previously used Moto G3, Nokia phones, BLU phones (and even an Amazon Fire phone) without connectivity issues. T-Mobile can't find anything 'wrong' with their service. Other reviewers seem to have experienced similar issues with T-Mobile service (carrier/phone frequency incompatibility).

I haven\u2019t yet assessed other features, like the battery charge, speed of apps, etc. But for the price, it\u2019s a very good option. Only drawback is the older version of Android, thus 4 stars instead of 5.",

The battery will last me 2 days sometimes with lots of use.. Taking battery life out of your concerns when going on long day trips or traveling. The Huawei flavor of Android is nice and clean.. updated to the latest version of android, while many pricier phones are still working on older versions.. Split screen is great, as I can watch youtube, while surfing facebook or the internet... I use this now more than my tablet great buy !",

Verdict: The best mid range phone of 2017 so far despite it's design weaknesses. I bought this to replace a OnePlus One which has stopped receiving OS updates.

For the price you get pretty much a Samsung but without the Samsung price, actually think the Mates and Honor's might even be better? All in all we never really own a phone for more than a couple of years so why not try these fantastic Huawei phones.",

If there is any instance in which more than one app is running, the phone will completely freeze up. Regarding signal quality, the phone doe NOT support 5ghz band wifi. ONLY 2.4. With that being said, I can usually get decent download speeds, but the moment I turn on my bluetooth, my speeds slow down to almost 0kb/s. There was a time when I would recommend this device. Now I wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy. I feel very ripped off.",
