Firm\u201d, because of that we ordered a second one (2 weeks ago) and the mattress was \u201cPlush\u201d (soft). The second order as many reported did not inflate complete in the sides/corners, also is too soft for me and my wife, and because of that when both are sleeping we end up in the middle all the time. The problem for me is that the company does not have a standard product, each time you order you can get anything different.",

The enclosed pillow is great for me, but I am puzzled as to why they would only send one pillow with a king size mattress.",
