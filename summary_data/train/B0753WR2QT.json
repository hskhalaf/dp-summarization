      "text": "A question was asked, \"what is the size of the finished waffles cups\", and the seller, Smoking Daily Deal, replied \"they make a 4\" each\". I purchased this item based on that answer, and it was inaccurate. This waffle maker makes tiny little waffle bowls about an inch and a half big. Which is way too small for what I wanted it for, making scrambled eggs with meat and veggies and putting it inside waffle bowls for breakfasts. It would be great if you're looking for tiny waffle bowls, I cant think of a reason for them, but there probably is, lol. I am returning this.",
