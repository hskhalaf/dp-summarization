It's like 1/32\" of coverage on one end and 1/16\" on the other end. I think either the quality control is poor or they're a design clone and they didn't know how important lock alignment was when they cloned it. Another possibility is that they correctly designed the stand mouth BUT for a saddle bar that had wider teeth, not what was included. What I got is totally unacceptable from a safety standpoint. I'll be returning.",

Keep in mind these are for trucks and SUV's and will most likely not fit under most cars unless you jack them up way more than what is needed or even safe for basic maintenance work on a vehicle.",

      "text": "These jack stands are awesome! I own a Chevrolet Avalanche Z71 and I can fit most standard jack stands underneath the frame without even jacking up the truck, so I needed jack stands that give me the high lift ability while still remaining stable. The lift range on these jack stands is great, and the build quality is very high. I have complete confidence in these jack stands while working beneath the truck. Similar jack stands are well over $75. The additional safety lock is a great feature, especially if you have to work near the jack stand. It is a simple metal bar that slides in between the lift teeth, preventing the neck from lowering.",

The locking pins themselves work good and feel sturdy, but if the jack got bumped I would be afraid of one of the locking pins slipping out.",

They are stable enough to pull an engine out with and feel safe. The added safety of an additional ratcheting lock gives me a bit more confidence. As one person said, they are only welded on the inside so I wouldn't recommend taking them right to the 2 ton limit. They are great for normal home use and I can expect and predict I'll be using these just the same in 10 years easily. I'd recommend them for normal home use.",
