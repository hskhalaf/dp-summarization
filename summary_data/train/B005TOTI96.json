      "text": "Having suffered through Lync calls using a iPhone headset for years and having to hold the mic to my face perfectly and still hear complaints from the other end, this headset is a vast improvement. The dedicated mic which is easy to move up and down helps tons, and a digital interface (via USB) allows the software to do its job and remove background noises. I have not had one complaint from users on the other end of calls, and I hear them perfect. They are also super light and comfortable and you can wear them all day without pain or discomfort.",

I have a big head and it feets well. Corded is the best way when you need quality. It has control over volume, mute, answer/hangup on a little box attached to the cable in a convenient position. On the not so good side, I feel the headset is a little fragile but if you are careful you should be fine.",

My calls were relatively short, but I still want to say that I found the headset very comfortable and it did not trigger any nerve pain. It sits very lightly on the ears.",

I've had the wireless version of this headset and I like this one better because it has earphones on both sides which blocks out background noise.",

This will ONLY work on a PC, but the sound on it is perfect. For some reason, headphone jack headphones don't work well on Skype, at least in my experiences with many of them (sounds like the phone is in your pocket). Probably a Skype program or driver issue..... These however are great right out of the box.",
