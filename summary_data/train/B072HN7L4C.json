I\u2019ve always purchased a 7.5 to give room for thick socks but these fit like an 8-8.5. The shaft was several inches taller and cut right at my knee bend making them uncomfortable to wear, and the foot portion was tight across the top but loose in width and length. Overall a terrible fit. I returned them.",
