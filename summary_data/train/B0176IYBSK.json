My son brought his over for that class, and it was one that had those points. I had been thinking about buying one so after that class I looked and found this. We tried the same cocktail using this one, and I can see why this is preferable. May not matter for fruit, but if you use mint/basil for cocktails, this is better. It's also really pretty, and it comes with a bag that protects it. Very happy with this.",
