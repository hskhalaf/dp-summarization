First of all it is not what I expected! This is a tracker watch, if you look for a smart watch this not for you! The features of this watch are for fitness people! It's a good looking watch, but totally useless as I'm not working out! I'm not planning on returning it.",

The Garmin Connect with my phone is a great tool as it makes reading the information on my watch instantaneous and of course easier to see on a full sized Android phone. It is important to keep the software updates on both compatible or it will lose connection. Just hooking up your watch to your laptop and running Garmin Connect this is easy to do. This is my second watch by Garmin. My first was a Tactical which lasted 4 years of rough use. The software on this one is easier to navigate through and the Garmin Connect with the new Instinct is smooth.",

I have put this watch through hell with hard physical punishment and it still performs as advertised and not a single scratch on the screen. With no connectivity to phones or GPS I have gone around 28 days without charging it. The altimeter works great and is very accurate but has lag when quickly ascending or descending (flying in a helicopter). Garmin has exceeded my expectations in every way with this watch. Highly recommended.",

So I'm smashing fitness goals without actually doing any fitness! the same goes for the heart rate sensor. I dont honestly use much else and my old Samsung watch had these similar draw backs.",

I've sold cell phones for 10 years now, so I would believe that my knowledge would be enough to properly connect. After some research, it seems the only way you can connect to some phones if you go down a software patch. If this is the case, then that more than likely means Garmin isn't updating their watches to work across all OS software patches.",
