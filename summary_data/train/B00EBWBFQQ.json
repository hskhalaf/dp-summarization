I was able to cook a thin cut steak in three minutes, about a minute and a half on each side. It's awesome. The grill surface is a bit small at about 14 inches of usable diameter. But it's awesome for what it is. It's portable enough to carry around a deck with one person. One word of warning, buy a grill cover, the lower portion of the grill retains water even when closed while in the rain. Cover it to protect it.",

      "text": "It's been over 18 years since I smoked meat, but the price on this was marked down and I decided to give it a try. I got the pizza stone as well to cook with indirect heat, plus the stone helps stabilize the temperature. This little cooker worked great! I smoked a pork butt for 5 hours and it turned out very good. Although the temperature fluctuated a little due to its size (that's expected), it was still very controllable. It's very efficient too, because it didn't use as much lump charcoal as I thought it would. I like it because it's easy to pack up and take somewhere. Cleanup was easy. Very good purchase, and I'd do it again.",

      "text": "Neat little smoker and grill combo, super portable and very efficient. Ive grilled steaks, chicken, seafood and smoked pork butts, brisket, full chickens. I've taken it tailgating and on camping trips and have no problem muscling it in and out of the truck with the supplied handles. Get a drip tray or something to defray the smoke off to the sides. Also invest in a decent cover from day one. Mine went a week or two without use after a good rain and I found the ash pan was full of water that leaked through the vent, that is my only knock on this unit. Bought a cover the next day but have a little rust from this mistake!",

And when you shut it down after use, you can save your coals for the next time you fire it up! I recommend it!",

Takes a bit of getting used to, but it's not rocket science. thermometer is the only weak point, but easily compensates once you get familiar with it.

The only minor issue was that the parts were lacking a screw for the top vent, but it is secure enough with just the 2 screws. Best options to buy with this are 1) heat resistant gloves, a must. 2) Charcoal Chimney starter - 15 minutes and you're in business 3) Cover - keeps it nice looking 4) BBQ Tongs- essential 5) BBQ spatula - essential",
