This is my 5th system that I have installed in my house over the years,and this is the first time ever that I was not frustrated with leaks and connections that just did not fit properly. Because of where I have this installed it is rather difficult to get to, and therefore having no leaks at all when I turned it on was very much appreciated. As you can see from my photos this was a difficult location between two cabinets, no leaks hurray! The purified water has the best taste of any reverse osmosis system that I have tried. Great product, and I highly recommend this system for trouble free great water.",

      "text": "I purchased this filter in May 2018 and had it installed professionally after realizing upon arrival of the package that I lacked the required skills to install it on my own. The installer had no difficulty following the instructions and commented that the instructions were very clear and complete. Around July 2020, the filter faucet started dripping. This type of faucet cannot be repaired and the only solution is to replace it. I emailed Support at the iSpring company and received a free replacement faucet because the warranty covers the faucet for 3 years from the purchase date. Nick at iSpring was very helpful and mailed the replacement without delays.",

I have a 2 inch disposal line and it still fit, hopefully it won't snap in the long term. Company doesn't offer a 2 inch version, so they lose a star for that. 4. Water had a fishy taste for the first 3 tankfuls, then finally got better. I'm guessing the mineral filter was a factor, but don't know why.",

It took me 2 hours to install the whole system and even drilled a hole in my pipe. Now it's about to ruin my under sink cabinet and leaves a big hole in my pipe if I remove it. Super disappointed!",

I spoke with Don and Nick at ispring during the fridge kit installation ( I had a few minor questions) and both were super helpful and extremely polite.",

This one remineralizes the water in a 6th stage and it is worth the modest bump in price. Highly recommended.",

    "title": "iSpring RCC7AK 6-Stage Superb Taste High Capacity Under Sink Reverse Osmosis Drinking Water Filter System with Alkaline Remineralization-Natural pH, White",
    "description": "Style:Filter System\n\nAs America's favorite brand of reverse osmosis systems, and backed by iSpring\u2019s industry-leading customer support, the RCC7AK is unequaled in quality, performance, and durability. The system consists of 6-stage, layered filtration built around precision reverse osmosis (RO) technology that removes over 1000 different kinds of contaminants in order to provide the best home drinking water filtration available. Unlike some other systems, the combination of both GAC and CTO filters in the 2nd and 3rd stages provides extra layers of protection against harmful chemicals than CTO alone. It features a 75 gallon-per-day capacity RO membrane, which is larger than most in its class and provides the capacity to economically handle the drinking water needs of even a large family.\n\nAfter flowing through the initial 5 stages of the iSpring RCC7 line of Reverse Osmosis filtering products, the RCC7AK model adds another Alkaline Remineralization (AK) stage. This stage is designed to restore the natural alkalinity and mineral balance of the water. The RO process effectively generates pure water but it also removes a few helpful minerals in the process. The red mineral stone portion of the AK filter adds back healthy minerals including not just calcium, but also other beneficial minerals, like magnesium, that other systems don't. The calcite portion of the filter neutralizes the pH of the RO water. And the water tastes better too. Because RO water is so pure, some people may find it tastes unnatural. Many people prefer the more natural taste that comes from the presence of some minerals in the water. Remineralization restores just the right proportion of healthy minerals.\n\nDesigned for do-it-yourself installation by most users, the entire system fits nicely under a standard kitchen sink. Installation is straightforward and all parts necessary for installation are included. You are guided by clear, well organized written instructions, instructional videos and access to iSpring\u2019s unparalleled technical support. The system is quiet and low maintenance with no moving parts. Replacement filters are standard sized and sold at factory direct pricing. A lead-free, solid brass faucet with brushed nickel finish is included with the system and is usually mounted on the counter as the primary source of drinking water, but output lines can also be connected to your ice maker, coffee maker, etc. The whole system is backed by a 1-year money-back guarantee, a 1-year manufacturer warranty and iSpring's unique lifetime technical support provided right here in the USA in Alpharetta Georgia. With the iSpring RCC7AK, enjoy crisp-tasting, bottled quality water, every day, right in your home. \n\n\n\n * Incoming Water Pressure: 45 PSI - 70 PSI\n * Operating water temperature range: 40 \u2013 100 \u00b0F\n * Maximum TDS: 750 ppm\n\nInstall this RO system in a location where it is safe from hot/cold weather and direct sunlight. Avoid hitting, dropping, or dragging the system as this can cause cracks and leaks",
