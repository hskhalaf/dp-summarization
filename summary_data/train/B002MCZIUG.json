Unless Web connectivity and touch screens are a top priority, we recommend checking out HP's other multifunction printers, which still offer high performance but at a much lower cost.",

After contacting Amazon and the seller, we returned the printer as \"refused\" and were promptly refunded the full purchase price, including shipping. I might possibly consider buying from this seller again, as they were very responsive to my complaint and very prompt in completing my return.",

      "text": "Decided to give HP another shot after a couple of years away from their products. The C309N made it just 2 months past the 1 year warranty....and less than 1000 sheets of paper! The gears on the printer carriage fell apart. Up until this point, I was happy with the product. I guess HP hasn't changed the quality of the products they sell yet.",

      "text": "Upon seeing that Consumer Reports had a good rating on their C309's, I was excited to get this new printer. And guess what came with the computer--asheet that says it doesn't support Firefox. Huh???? I am forced to use IE??? I PREFER Firefox!! But to my surprise, it has printed anything I want to print in Firefox, so am confused what they are talking about. SO...I'm only giving this printer 3 stars out of fear...i.e. will I find out in a bad way what that really means and wish I had never gotten this printer??",

This printer is \"SLOW\" regardless of what the HP claims. It is unbelievable that they would go to market with something that is half finished. As a result I won't purchase another HP product and neither will my company. HP needs to TEST your stuff first, and not only in India.",
