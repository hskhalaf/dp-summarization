There is a learning curve but it seems all the bad reviews are just people who didn't relize how film cameras work and how sensitive they can be. It took me about one pack of film to get used to whats too much light and too little and adjusting exposure. This is my new favorite thing and i found a hobby I can stick with for a long time. (Lost a star because it did jam and I lost 3 frames from the jam and light leaks but havent had an issue since)",
