      "text": "I took the Apeman to the Florida Keys specifically to practice photography while SCUBA diving. These pictures are from a fairly shallow dive 40- 50 ft. I used an underwater diving rig to mount the camera and 2 LED lights. The clarity is good and in diving mode the color is not bad. I did enhance these photos after I got home but the originals weren't too far off. For the price it's a great little underwater camera. I got everything I needed to take these photos for $200. I think that was a good investment. It's also really easy to use. The instructions are simple and there are plenty of options in the menu.",

The worst drawback I noticed and confirmed is that the video quality is great at the start but becomes much poorer at the end of >15min long clips. Not sure the issue is due to overheat of the sensor or loosing focus overtime.",

First of all, it comes with a lot of attachment accessories that allow it to fit standard mounts etc. I took it out on a swim in the water (attached to my snorkeling mask) and it did its job just fine. Great picture quality and FPS. I'm very pleased with it for this kinda price!",

For example: the battery drains more if you shoot in 4k, but the battery life last much longer shooting in 720p. As for video quality, I haven't been able to test it outside, but it looks good when I play with it indoors. It's also a great web cam shooting at 1080pm at 30fps.",

Have tried 2 brand new cards. Same result. Missed the return window by 2 days. Customer support offered through Amazon, a joke. The link won't accept my phone number. Looks like i'm eating the cost of this crappy camera",

I have yet to try it as the dash cam but so far the biggest problem I can see with that is the vibrations from the roads here could make it jittery. Other than that the only other thing I can think of is vibrancy of colors.... But for crying out loud it is an action cam not a BlackMagicDesign Mini or anything like that!

I did not ding the camera on stars because of this, since it isn't an advertised capability/compatibility. Excellent video quality. Lots of fun and easy to use.",

The waterproof casing is very durable too, it took a direct hit from an airsoft gun right in the lens and not even a scratch. For low light situations it's not terrible, but not the best.
