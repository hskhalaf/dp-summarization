Even browning on toast, good at baking rolls, and reliably heats up to 450F with only minor temperature variation at the set temperature. The user interface isn't immediately intuitive, but once you know how it works, its easy. Adding more time requires a few button pushes, which I feel should have just been a knob turn when in operation, but not a big deal. The size is also nice - not too large on the counter top and sufficiently large inside to hold 4 slices of large bread. Would recommend.",

Luckily I checked it after 5 minutes before it burnt to a crisp! I took off one star for a somewhat confusing and not terribly intuitive cook setting and timer display.
