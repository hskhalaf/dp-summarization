Besides this everything else is great, oh and if you don't like the hole punch in the middle because of video watching there is like this semi full screen mode that just black bars the side and it's great, but 60hz on a $1200 phone hurts the soul.",

The phone seems to be new from everything I can tell, but that took some of my excitement away...not knowing for sure if someone had handled the phone prior to me. The sticker that is usually on the back of the phone was not present...you could see where it had been. The phone is quite nice, although not sure it's worth 1200 bucks. The camera is not really what the YouTube reviewers say it is...it does a lot of softening to faces...even with beauty mode turned off. Not sure if I'm keeping the phone after all of the above...still deciding.",

      "text": "Despite what we now know about the new Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra, I feel that this Note 10+ continues to be the best phone you can get. Setting aside the S-Pen and its features, this phone is just so beautifully refined and more than capable. The shape of the display is perfect. Square in the corners. Not cutting into things on the screen like rounded corners do. SO easy to hold in the hand. I can't believe how thin it is. Not that I want a thin phone. Phones today are thin enough. I'm sticking with this phone until it dies. Just can't be happier with it.",

I cannot rate face or fingerprint capabilities as I do not have fingerprints. And facial is not for me. Battery is amazing, I have been able to use the phone all day doing many functions and the lowest the battery ever got was 67%. Beautiful piece.",

      "text": "overall the phone is absolutely amazing with new things that I've discovered everyday. It has beautiful display with HDR plus quality(meaning that videos on streaming platforms look beautiful). The camara quality is amazing and this phone is capable of handling lots of usage from different apps. Although the battery life runs out somewhat quickly, it has multiple options over battery saving. (Keep in mind that the stronger and faster you want your phone, the more battery life it will consume)",

      "text": "I bought this Galaxy Note 10+ and I was a little bit concerned because it was sold by Amazon warehouse. The only difference from a brand new phone was that the box was open before. Then, everything else was brand new. It costed me about $500 less than a brand new just because the phone was return and the box was open. I can't imagine a better place from where I can get such a discount just for that reason. The phone had no scratches, no malfunctioning, absolutely no issues.",

Marques Brownlee had a good video detailing that.. ;) Review: Upgraded from my Galaxy S8. The battery life is MUCH better; impressively so. The stylus is a fun tool. Screen is absolutely gorgeous. The front facing camera is a tiny on the screen weirdly. But it has never been in the way when watching videos to me. Great phone and good quality.",

I still have the tab pro still working the only issue is it doesn't upgrade past Android 4.4 but even still a great product and to be as old as it is still great battery life. And the reason I didn't put any stars for face recognition is never used is so can't write a review for something I've never used.",
