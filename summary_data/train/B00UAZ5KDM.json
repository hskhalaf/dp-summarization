To get around this, I pair it with my phone anyway, and I can still plug in my laptop. I know that the purpose is to use bluetooth, but I just wish they designed it to work without pairing as well. I am still satisfied. I would buy it again if it breaks down. Totally worth it.",

Bought this wireless bluetooth \"splash proof\" speaker for my boyfriend for christmas. This speaker worked great UNTIL it was next to water... First nice day of the summer to swim and let me tell you, it was not splash proof. One kid jumped too close to it and all of a sudden it stopped working. I reassured my boyfriend it was splash proof and it just needed to be charged. After being charged over night it stopped working completely. Not happy at all....",
