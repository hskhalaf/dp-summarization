It did make it harder than I would have liked to set up, but that's not really an ongoing problem. 8 months later: The buttons gave out. Now if I try to change the time, the whole watch resets, making it virtually useless.",

Now the issue, the band is very CHEAP and will break, latch won't work either... I bought it in July, so that's been 3 months. The watch still runs... however what good is the watch without the matching band. I'll have to change my mind on this \"5\" stars to \"1\" star. What you buy is you decision, however I Do Not recommend this watch...",
