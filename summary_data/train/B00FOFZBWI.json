Have noticed a improve pc performance since installing and uninstalling a full Norton security suite which was bombarding my pc with daily updates and very time consuming in ending my internet sessions. Bullguard real time updates whilst surfing the net,works well with Windows7 firewall. Would recommend and now for the future no more Norton security suites to my Samsung pc netbook,windows7home premium. Another pointer to my pcs improved performance has been disabling the Google toolbar. I found Google was conflicting too much with my pc browser Internet explorer.",
