We even tried using the mosquito attractant that came with the zapper and even that was ineffective. Meanwhile it does kill other, non-nuisance bugs, which we don't want to kill.

I tried to move it over and got zapped. About the same power as a horse electric fence IMO. Surprisingly powerful just for bugs. Is quite loud when you get a big moth or big bug in it.

We bought a second unit to hang outside our house to try to minimize the mosquitoes that are terrible this year. The bug zapper in the garage only lasted about 1 year despite a 2 year warranty. Getting service on the warranty requires sending the entire unit at your cost to Flowtron. I will update you on whether Flowtron actually honors the warranty. Calling customer service is a waste of time since no live person answers.",
