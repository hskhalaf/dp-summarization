      "verdict": "The Adidas World Cup steals the show with its classic look and superb engineering. Players love its protective build that definitely doesn\u2019t come short on comfort. They also attest to the fine quality of its leather upper that hugs snugly around the foot. However, wearers did notice that sizing runs about half a size smaller than most cleats. Some also had issues with the cleat\u2019s durability. Overall, amidst its minor flaws, this release from Adidas proves to be one excellent cleat that performs well on the soft ground pitch.",
      "pros": [
        "Based on a good number of reviews, the Adidas World Cup is a protective and strong cleat",
        "A particular user said that the leather almost molds around the foot for an extremely comfortable fit",
        "Many users love the great look and classic design of this Adidas cleat",
        "These soft ground soccer cleats feel very comfortable on foot, according to several testers",
        "Some players who tried this soccer cleat appreciated the long laces, saying it gave added support for the feet",
        "The overall look of this soccer cleat is reminiscent of the Adidas Samba Classic"

      "cons": [
        "A significant number of users have observed that the Adidas World Cup has a smaller fit compared to other Adidas soccer cleats",
        "A particular wearer was dismayed when the plastic sole started to come away from the leather after a couple of uses",
        "According to some users, the insole of the Adidas World Cup \u00a0is very thin",
        "they can feel the studs sometimes"

      "text": "I have copa mondials in a 9.5 which have tonnes of room, if anything a bit big, so bought the same in these expecting SG boots to maybe come up a bit smaller. Even allowing for stretch, the boots were simply way too small. My toes was pushing at the very end, while sitting down, and with thin (not football) socks on. I don't even think a 10 would have fit. Am really surprised as this is the 3rd different pair of boots this has been the case with.",
