I bought an innofader and had it installed in this mixer to replace the crossfader and NOW this mixer is AMAZING. Its simple and its layout is great. However, if you are going to even MARKET this to scratch DJs you need to do something about that crossfader. Its pretty bad. ALSO no xlr in the back FYI.",

I just bought there latest version and still, the issue persists. They are always good about sending a replacement crossfader, but they leak the opposite channel as well. Other than this a great mixer. I reached out to them as said \" It would be great to see you make a version with a working crossfader and also considerably higher quality sound\" I'd pay for a premium version of this mixer.",

I do have to say that the cross-fader behavior threw me, but other than that, it's very nice. Both the sliders and pots move well, connections seem solid. I appreciate the XLR outs and the grounding lugs for my older turntables. I would definitely recommend this and would buy it again.",

You get all the basics for 4 channels plus XLR outputs (oh, and USB, which I haven't connected to yet). This is a fairly large unit, about the same size and general layout as the normal Pioneer DJM 4-channel mixers. It isn't light, so it's not a go-to for portability. If you just want the basics with extra channels, this is a solid deal for the money. I just hope the fader holds out for a while.",

In that case you have to use RCA cables with a groundwire, or you'll hear a nasty buzz. Make sure you have a turntable that has a ground wire hook up as well, or don't purchase this mixer. In general, this is a good practice. Going out from the mixer, my speakers didn't seem to mind not having a ground running to them, and in most cases the noise is going to come from your turntable anyway.",
