My hairdresser uses it and I had her order my first bottle, which came as a set with the conditioner, which I don't need to reorder yet - and thankfully have now found the shampoo at a good price on Amazon. Buyer beware however, the seller showed the 33.8 oz size coming with a pump and it is NOT included. Fortunately I had kept the old pump from first bottle.",

I have been using the Joico K-pak products for about 6 months and my hair is silky and completely transformed! I have continued using the non-ammonia hair color (Madison-Reed) and I could not be happier with the condition of my hair and how the color lasts and stays true with the K-pak products!
