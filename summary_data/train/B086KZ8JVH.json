I really appreciate that the numbers are faced for individual use. It makes it easy for patients to see their numbers and for me to educate them while taking their vitals. The numbers are large enough for my patients with bad eyes. Not one of my patients complained about the amount of pressure on their fingers. If you are in need of a pulse oximeter, I would definitely get this one. I will buy this one in the future when I have a need.",

A quick look at the Instruction Sheet enclosed revealed this is a very easy device to use. After putting the batteries in, I took my readings. The results were very fast and the display is easy to read. I highly recommend this to anyone that needs to monitor blood oxygen levels.",
