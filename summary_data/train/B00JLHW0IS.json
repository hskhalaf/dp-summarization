I'm sure she will love matching her daddy when she gets this gift",

Needs to be charged and set up via laptop and there doesn't appear to be any way of tracking the child's activity. The more active they are the more joules they collect, but my child has been collecting them by just pressing buttons anyway? There isn't much incentive for him to follow the instructions. It's now in a toy box. Glad I didn't pay more",

Sadly my son lost interest within a week, the battery life wasn't particularly good and needed charging quite often, the games weren't all that great, and the watch was really quite bulky on a childs wrist.
