It's a little bit more set up involved, switching from Samsung but a small free downloaded app got me right together. I've gotten a lot of compliments and have convinced friends that buying this phone is a worthwhile investment. The antenna on this phone is a bit rough,I notice I have more dead zones than with my other phone although I'm with the same carrier. But a beautiful screen display, loud speakers, and a camera fit for any picture lover makes this phone a winner in my book.",

I tried metropcs 4G service 1st and it is wonderful but I travel a lot and the coverage locally is great. Coverage on highways and interstates is awful. Now i'm on cricket 4G service which is slower in my area but the coverage is great. So you have both options they both can give you 4g service its the coverage in your area that should make the difference.",

The devices may be unlocked but they have carrier apps installed on them. The one we bought is Verizon branded, which was not indicated anywhere in the product description. That is unfortunate, since we use T-Mobile and the phone is not working correctly. The voice mail is not working and is apparently not fixable. It took quite a bit of work on my part to get incoming calls to work correctly. After many hours talking to T-Mobile customer care, the phone is not very useful.",

No stylus pen included but one can purchase separately and fetch it some place (no dedicated holder), The main issue is the overall weight - about 217 gr. and the screen size may not fit to everyone, depends on your hand shape and your ability to maneuver as most actions would require 2 hands use. Otherwise - this is simply the best for this year!",
