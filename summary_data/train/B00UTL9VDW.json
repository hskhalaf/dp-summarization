I paired this water bottle with the re-freezable ice cubes and we were like seasoned travelers. :)",

      "text": "I bought this for a summer trip to Orlando hoping for something to keep my water cold for a day in the Florida heat at a theme park, so I can't speak to long-term use. This bottle was perfect! I put several ice cubes in it with my water before I left in the morning and by the time I got back that night, most of the ice was still there! Plus there was barely any condensation. The only downside was the bottle was a bit hard to get open each time, but that's likely what's keeping the water cold and the bottle leak-proof. Totally worth it for ice cold water all day!",

Hot insulation is also good, though it doesn't hold heat as long as cold. I have an older vacuum insulated Kleen Kanteen, that appears to have thicker walls, and this one outperforms it. Like other Kleen Kanteens, I suppose the enamel will come off, but it hasn't started to happen yet. This doesn't fit in certain holders that would hold a regular, uninsulated Kleen Kanteen, but the size is similar.",

The price is surprisingly higher even in target or other retailers. Amazon is the ONLY place to have such a low pricing. This keeps water hot or cold for prolonged time as mentioned by the manufacturer. Best ever thermos to buy. I recommend doing hand washing.",

The only thing I would say is the paint scratches off and scuffs fairly easily. After a few weeks of use, there are already several scratches. I also love the color!!",
