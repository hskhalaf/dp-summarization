Solar charged then turned on switch on back and red \"beady eyes\" lights came on in varying flash patterns. Didn't have evidence of raccoons frequenting my back yard before my 12# chihuahua/rat Terrier charged after something in the back yard during a 3 a.m. potty break. Raccoon wrestling cost her stitches on her ear and face (not to mention trauma and pain of recovery) and us $400 in vet bills so figured this light deterrent is cheap in comparison. Hoping it lives up to it's predominantly good reviews.",
