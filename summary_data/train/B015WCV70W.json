      "text": "I love the sleek look and feel of these monitors, but they don't even have mounting holes in the back? i only see one hole and it's in a weird spot. Apparently, you need to buy an additional adapter to be able to attach a stand to it. A bit misleading, should be more clear about this in description and pictures. Anyway, the built in stand looks ok too. It's flat and placed in a way that still looks pretty sleek, and you can actually use the space too, so I'm not too bummed about the incompatibility with the stand.",

It's otherwise a fine little monitor, but dead transistors are horrifically distracting, and one expects that not to happen when the monitor is brand new out of the box, and handled with gentleness while being unpacked and set up. It's not enough to go through the bother of packing it back up and returning it, as it's such a big delicate product, but I'm having second thoughts about buying a second one for the other computer. If tiny black dots that you can't fix bother you, don't risk it by getting this monitor.",

While all my other monitors' brightness settings can be controlled using the software I'm using ClickMonitorDDC 3.5 this monitor ignores commands from the software and doesn't seem to work with it at all.

I called local companies and only one was willing to attempt to fix. They said the dianostic fee alone would cost half of what the monitor did originally. I bought it 1/24/2018 and today is 5/1/19. No signs of any damage. It' never been abused or even moved from the desk. Never dropped, and I know since Im the only one here. I'm highly frustrated that this wasnt' made well enough to last longer.",

They charge your credit card one dollar which is refunded when they receive your broken monitor. They also call after you receive the replacement to make sure everything is OK.

The 22cwa has buttons to press which allows me to set the brightness of the display way lower than the initial setting from the Chromebox which was way too bright. Worked right out of the box with no hassle. It is also relatively lightweight. I would recommend this monitor. Pressing the appropriate keys on the keyboard did not adjust the brightness, so being able to make the adjustment at the monitor is a big plus for me. The images are clean and sharp.",
