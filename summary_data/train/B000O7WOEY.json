The snug fit doesn't really bother me, as I assume the sheets will loosen slightly as my baby lays and moves around a bit in the crib. I am very happy with these Jersey sheets and I think they're a great value for the money.",

If I put the sheet on with three seams inside toward the mattress, one seam is backward making it look like I have the sheet inside out. Since I have already washed the product, I can't send it back. I won't buy this product again. Very poor manufacturing processes and the jersey material is not that soft.",
