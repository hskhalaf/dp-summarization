I really dreaded starting her on play doh because I\u2019m lazy and hate to clean it all up from the table and floor multiple times a day but this was a good choice. It is simple enough where she can use it on her own. She was very excited about growing the hair and being able to cut with scissors. She has since moved on to more in-depth sets but this one lasted and kept her attention for close to a year. It is easy to clean and doesn\u2019t have too many nooks and crannies where dry play doh gets stuck. High recommend!",

The princess poppy hair mold was frustrating for my youngest because you really need a bigger thing of Play-Doh to fill it. Also I don't like that the bottom of the feet have indentions where Play-Doh can get stuck. It's cool for the troll aspect, but I wish it was more like the normal hair growing molds.",
