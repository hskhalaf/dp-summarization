As I followed the directions I realized that some of the problems people complained about were probably caused from trying to skip or not following each step in detail. When I finished putting the bench together I also noticed that it needed to be on a perfectly flat floor. If not it, caused a slight twist to the box and the lid would not fit correctly. It's better on a deck or concrete patio. I also added two eye bolts to the lid on the the bench to tye the pad to.",

If this were $60 dollars Id consider buying it again. If you don't plan on putting much weight on it, or moving it often, it might last long enough to be worth the price to you. If you want to use it for children's toys, they will probably destroy the seat relatively quickly.",

We were hoping to show it off for our Fourth of July party tomorrow, but we can't. It was supposed to be a surprise for my husband and show him that I could buy a quality product on my own. It was expensive too, so now we're stuck with it. \ud83d\ude41",

It is now holding all my pool towels and has room to spare!! Very nice looking, sturdy bench. I recommend it!!",

That is holding up well and I don't expect any issues since there's no real stress on that connection and, other than that, this is a super unit.
