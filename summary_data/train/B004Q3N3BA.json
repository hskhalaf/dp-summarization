Globe has been able to keep that great style and quality that they've had from the beginning and that's why I keep buying them, so many companies let there quality go to shit after a while (DC) and it's so disappointing. I also love that the tongue is integrated into the ankle/heal support so you don't have to use laces of you don't want and these will still be one of the most sucure fitting shoes you'll ever wear...get some",

My primary criticism is with the design - the shoes have no traditional tongue, instead they are form fitting with no split. This makes putting the shoe on a foot tedious. Also, the shoe came with laces that were 2 feet (yes, feet) too long, so I had to cut them. Now the ends are frayed. Shoes should come with properly sized laces.",
