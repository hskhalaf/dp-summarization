If you're going to be the only one handling your luggage (ie it's not going to be thrown around), these should hold up fine.

I will never buy this product line again, and I urge anyone looking to purchase to check the manufacture site to see that they now include the \"overall\" dimensions on their luggage--which almost always pushes their products over the carry-on dimensions.",

Of course, like most luggage, this will probably wear out over time, but I can foresee many more trips with these bags until then.",

The wheels rolled nicely, the baggage lasted from Phoenix to Chicago and back without any damage, the largest bag has a very useful 2\" gusset that allows more baggage to fit quite easily. The bag had about 35lbs of stuff in it and protected it all very well. I recommend this set.",

My only gripe is the storage space and that you cannot maximize your intended storage weight for International travel. With most international travel allowing you two luggage at 50 lbs. each and one carry on at 15 lbs. The largest bag on this set will allow you to store at most 30 lbs. So I think I need to get another larger luggage and keep the largest of the three as my second. Use the smallest one as my handcarry and the bag as my personal item. Price is good so I cannot complain in that department.",

The only problem I had encountered was a balance issue when standing the luggage cases straight up but that was only due to my over packing them. They have a lot of space and had no problem packing a weeks(+) worth of clothes and other things along with it. Highly recommended by this Airman.",
