The bad thing about it is that the handle angles up toward the end which makes the blade sit tip-up in your hand. For me, at least, this is not a comfortable nor normal position for any use. It took a bit of getting used to and now I can use it safely, but this is the first knife I've used that when first using it, I accidentally stabbed my hand, requiring stitches.

We have much sharper knives that cut onions with a lot less tears. But, those very sharp knives will really hurt us if we slip and they cost a lot more.

There's no mistaking the edge for some of the fancy supersteel knives coming out of Japan, but it came with a nice edge; slicing onions was tear-free and fast.

There are some features that I like better than my Henckels 4*, especially the rounded edges on the top of the blade and the slightly taller blade.

Crafted with a comfortable handle, superior weight and balance, and a razor sharp edge that rarely requires re-sharpening, this knife is an essential tool for every kitchen.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n\n *  High-quality, lightweight European steel.\n *  Handle design reduces hand and wrist fatigue.\n *  Fit for dicing, mincing, chopping, slicing, and shredding. \n *  Long, sloping curved blade that \u201crocks\u201d for effortless mincing and chopping.\n *  Flat spine for extra power to slice through hard-skinned items.\n *  Non-slip patented Fibrox Pro handle for a secure and comfortable grip no matter the hand size. \n *  National Sanitary Foundation (NSF) approved and dishwasher safe. \n\nCARE AND USE\nBe good to your knives and they\u2019ll be good to you. Following these simple guidelines will ensure that you get the longest life out of your knife! \n\nCLEANING\nVictorinox Swiss Army recommends washing all knives by hand. For best results, hand wash your knives with a soapy cloth and dry immediately. \nWhile Fibrox Pro knives are dishwasher safe, we recommend hand washing as dishwashers are designed to spray water at a relatively high pressure, which can jostle the silverware and cause the knives to collide, dulling the edge.\n\nSHARPENING\nFor optimum performance, knives should be honed after every couple of uses. Proper and frequent use of a honing steel will keep your knives sharper and performing at their best. \n\nFORMERLY FORSCHNER\nIn 1937 Victorinox began selling cutlery in America through a Connecticut distributor called R.H. Forschner & Co. A well-known manufacturer of butcher scales, Forschner soon became the exclusive U.S. distributor for Victorinox knives, and was the name by which Victorinox knives were known.",
