They are actually made of wax even though they are battery operated and they look more realistic than the product photos do. They are water activated, which is pretty cool, and come with batteries. Overall, I wish they were bigger, but I'm content with my purchase.",

      "text": "I have only been using these a week but I see a problem worth mentioning. The lights lit up as soon as I put them in my patio pond which is what they are supposed to do. They turned off when I removed them from the water. If you leave them in the water 24/7 the little sensors on the bottoms start to corrode turning green. When I took them out of the water after a couple of days they would not turn off, probably due to the corrosion I mentioned. The lights are okay for what they are. Probably the type of thing I'll toss at the end of summer and buy new ones next summer.",
