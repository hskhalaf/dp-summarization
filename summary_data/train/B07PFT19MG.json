Be sure to not confuse this with the inferior offerings from AtGames, typically branded as \"Sega Genesis Classic Game Console\" or \"Sega Genesis Flashback\".

The Dpad on the controllers seem a bit sensitive, but I think you will get used to it. I would say $79 is a bit steep. $50 would be the sweet spot on the pricing.

I was looking for the ability to test old cartridges and didn't realize the slot was made for show. I felt duped! Aside from the lack of ability to play old cartridges you may own, or the lack of ability to add more games to its 40 loaded ones, it's a fantastic build and runs great.",

Absolutely love it.",

Buying the 6 button controllers is even better but the included ones work for the majority of the games included. The box is also very nicely done. Just like the original packaging although a bit shinier. Everything is packed tightly and I swear that SEGA has been making all of their official products at the same place all these years, because even the brand new plastic has the same smell. Beats out all other retro units, including Nintendo and Sony.",

The Japanese Sonic even has extra layers of scrolling!! Buy this if you love retro games!! This is 5 stars!!",
