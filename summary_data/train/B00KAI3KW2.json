Included in the box are: the console, power supply, controller, basic headset, and HDMI cable. My specific console came in a very beaten box, no HDMI cable, chat headset didn't work, plus the controller had controller drift. Once I purchased a new controller and headset and an HDMI cable I experienced no further problems and it was a joy to play.",

    "description": "Xbox One brings together the best exclusive games, the most advanced multiplayer, and entertainment experiences you won\u2019t find anywhere else.
