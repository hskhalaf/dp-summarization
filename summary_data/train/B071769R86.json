My other shoes are very comfortable for a full round riding in a cart, but not what I wanted for walking the whole course. These are very comfortable, supportive and traction is great. No issues with walking a full 18 holes or more in the same day. They are a bit tough to get on considering they don't have normal laces however, I expected this with my purchase. They look great and am very pleased with how they look and the comfort level I was expecting.",

After one game of golf my big toe is bruised from being to tight at the end of the shoe. I have never ever worn a size 11 and these are 10 1/2. I can't return them because I wore them once and have to toss them. Its my fault but these are way way smaller than a normal size. Great shoe though if you can get the fit right!!1",
