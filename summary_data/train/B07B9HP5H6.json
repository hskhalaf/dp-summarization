The worst thing about this problem is there is no warning signs, no rattle, no vibration, no noise. The pump just stops, the CPU heats up and the machine cuts out (if you are lucky) Avoid.",

The instructions on which screws to use where were unclear and as such, I pierced my radiator when attaching it. Again, a quick google search showed that I was not alone in this problem, this was frightingly common in fact. Though it doesn't affect performance in any noticable way, it's a terrible flaw in the instructions to not be clear on this.",

The screws for the rad/fans are domed however and make putting my case panel on somewhat difficult (Thermaltake Core V21). Other than that, brilliant AIO, that reduced my temps massively.

I wanted to get my temps down, so I thought about 2 things, buying the new i7 8000 series with a new mobo or try an AIO solution. After lot of research, I decided to get this one and I was amazed. My temps went below 50 degrees while playing the same games, that is around 25-30 degrees colder than it was before.",
