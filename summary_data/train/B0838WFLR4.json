Ive got a staffie dog who just loves to bark at everything and anything that he can so a friend recommended i give one of these a try and i wish id bought one sooner!!. Not only is it safe and no harm to your dog it does exactly what its meant to do. It has 4 different settings for the vibration intensity so you can find a happy medium of which vibration will work. My neighbours are also happy at this as well!! It comes in a nice little box which could be given as a gift (if you know of any other noisy dogs lol)",

I had even tried to hire a trainer but didn't get the results I needed. I decided to try this collar because it mentioned humane training method. It simply vibrates every time my dog starts to get excited and bark. The vibrations help him stay calm and on his first walk with this collar, it was like he was a different dog! The walk was so peaceful and manageable. I'm in love with this collar and the difference it's made for my dog!",

The vibrations are effective though, as it piques his curiosity and makes him look around. It would be handy if the vibration could be the main intervention because by the time it kicks in, the dog has already barked several times. I'm not really sure what use we can make of it like this so will probably return it. I'll give it a few more days.",

I have attached a thick foam around them , initially I used the collar inside out with the prongs facing out, it works this way. If the prongs were more 'studs' I would give the product a 5 *",
