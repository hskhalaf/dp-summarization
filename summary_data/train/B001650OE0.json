These can be euthanized pets or other animals with little regulation on how/where they are obtained from. Purina does address that this is \u201csafe\u201d, but seriously, why would you want to feed your pet bits of euthanized animals? We discussed with out vet, who theorized Purina puts in one bacteria to count as a \u201cprobiotic\u201d, but really this product is a way for them to profit off of waste products from their pet food. Save your money, go to a vet, and get a cheaper and better product.",

Packaging are small packets which are difficult to manage. There is probably more paper in 1 box than the fortiflora itself Way way too expensive for what you get. There are many other more suitable probiotics on the market with better pricing, multiple microorganisms, and 10 times the CFUs.

I hope it is also helping her guy flora, but we got it to make her new food more appealing, it worked!
