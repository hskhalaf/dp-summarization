I read other reviewers speak of the quality and wondered, \u201cwhat\u2019s so great about toy food?\u201d Seriously, I\u2019ll never buy another brand! This is much more sturdy than other play food. Firm and resilient enough that I don\u2019t have to worry about my toddler crushing or breaking it, and soft enough that I don\u2019t worry about him scratching his baby sister with it! We talk about what the food items are called, their colors, count them, and practice sharing. I can wait to buy the other sets! I\u2019m so glad I stumbled across such an awesome find",

There was no strange odor and so far none of the coloring has come off or faded. The baskets are also durable and my baby loves taking the food out and putting them back in the baskets. Great toy for teaching your little one names for fruits and vegetables. Some are harder than others, so my baby liked chewing on certain ones at different stages of teething.

Each piece is not only fairly realistic looking, but they have a nice weight to them and are made of a great rubbery material that is obviously sturdy. My only regret is not buying the bigger set that has 3 baskets with breakfast, lunch, and dinner! Had I known how great the quality was, I would totally have splurged.",

On the other hand, this Learning Resources set has great detail and quality. It turned out the be the perfect amount of food to go with a kitchen set we purchased for our toddler. He loves the little basket and bin that came with the set. Very pleased that we went this route.",

This is a very educational toy since we can name each of the food items and ask her to bring them to us or put them in the baskets. She also received a grocery cart for Christmas, and it happens to be a great place to store all of the food pieces. This fun toy set has great play value and we expect to use for several years to come.",

The toys are toddler/preschooler size and made of a durable rubber and the colors haven't faded on any of the sets we have. The sizes aren't accurate however, entirely that is some things are smaller or much larger than their counter parts. However they are a hit with both boys and girls!",
