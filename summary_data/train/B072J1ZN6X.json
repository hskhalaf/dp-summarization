I took less than half a second for the dog to start growling at my car. They had me pull to the side and they searched my car with the dog and they found my MMJ in the Discreet Smoker Smell Proof Bag. I had my MMJ card with me so they let me go but the kept the half OZ. I should have known that this was a crappy product when their logo is an image of a pot leaf as a necktie.",

Perfect size for every day use, and plenty of room to bring extra \"stuff\" and equipment to a kickback or bonfire. I'm super happy with this product, I also have the smaller bag that comes with an awesome hemp satchel, it works just as well! Great company for sure!",
