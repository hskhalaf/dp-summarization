My husband also, could not get it to lock. I also want to note, that after heating a long time., the steam was not warm enough to kill any germs.

After your ready to put more water in you have to let it sit a little bit after you make sure all the steam is out or you won\u2019t be able to get the cap off it will just keep turning I would say maybe wait 10 minutes. Other than those two things it works great and is a great price.",
