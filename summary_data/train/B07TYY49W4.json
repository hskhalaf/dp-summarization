The footwear is loved by many because of its traction and impeccable ground connection that makes it easy to run on trails. Although others have issues with its width, durability, and toe box, others still lauded its minimalistic design.

Not only are Merrell very comfortable, but they are also very suited to my lifestyle which involves walking my dog in parks, woods and beaches both on and off tracks and pathways. I walk a couple of hours on most days and these shoes last long enough to make it a worth while investment.",

Sole is (I think) 17mm so markedly thinner than the heel of most trainers but not the 3mm of barefoot shoes 'proper.' Might be a tiny bit uncomfortable to start with,especially if you are new to no-drop shoes (introduce yourself to them slowly) - but I think that is pretty normal. Looks quite nice if you don't mind a little splash of colour!",

I'm a massive fan of the Merrell brand, and I own a pair of Vapor Glove 4's. For me (as I'm not as biomechanically gifted as some of the barefoot fans out there), I quickly discovered that I benefit more from a touch more cushion and structure to my shoe. The Bare Access XTR has this; but maintains the barefoot feel. What you sacrifice in ground feel and flexibility, you gain in structure and comfort for longer miles. Great shoes. Thanks Merrell.",
