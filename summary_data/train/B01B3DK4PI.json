Let me tell you...I LOVE it! It is super comfortable to hold throughout a run. It's the perfect amount of water and is not too heavy at all to carry. Plus, the pouch easily fits my endurance chews/car keys in...ultimately eliminating my need to wear a belt while running! It is not uncomfortable at all to hold on the runs, to be honest, I barely notice it during my runs. Definitely recommend, especially for long distance runners.",

The pocket is large enough to hold my iPhone 7 (with no case), license and debit card which I love because most of my running pants/shorts have no pockets. Even with the leaking I would recommend this hydration pack because the pros definitely outweigh the cons!",

I thought that holding a bottle would be really annoying, but it's pretty comfortable, and I don't mind it with this bottle.

I also wish there was a spout cover option or lid, maybe silicone or some other material. Also, I don't recommend storing this water bottle in a bag while it's filled as it can leak everywhere if something pushes against it. This is why a water tight lid or cover would be great to manufacture, even as an accessory. Overall, great water bottle. Btw, the pouch on my water bottle does not carry my smartphone. I have a galaxy s7 edge. Not a problem for me, though, but thought shoppers should know.",

Why not use elastic?!? There is a ribbon that doesn't even stretch, making it so hard to get the bottle in and out. And the ribbon around the bottle top actually gets in the way of it closing correctly, which I suspect is part of the leaky top problem because it could be breaking the seal where the gasket is. Who knows. But I hate this and will not order any again until they change the holder design.",

In a matter of minutes on the phone, Nathan said they were sending out a replacement bottle for free because mine was defective. While I am not happy about the leaky bottle and the trouble in having to fix the issue, I am very happy with Nathan's response! Will update my review if the second bottle is defective too.

Another thing: the bottle top (where one drinks from) is great but...SUPER hard to wash and dry. If you have even mild mold allergies you might want to buy a new top monthly.",

Water will leak out of the nozzle while you are running because it doesn't take much pressure. The cap pretty much sucks. On a good note, it was comfortable to hold and it kept water cold longer because it's insulated. Good for short distances in the heat. If the cap was better this would be a great water bottle.",
