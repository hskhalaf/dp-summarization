I find it so confusing, and was reading a book, but cannot find the one I was reading, or which page I was on. The pages are full of book cover pictures, and if I tap the top or bottom of the page It starts a new book.Maybe I am too old to follow new devices, perhaps I should purchase the Kindle Touch again. At least I knew exactly what I was doing with it! Such a shame, as I read all the time. I have bought the Help Manual, so maybe I will be able to understand the device better.",

However I will not be sending it back as it is good for reading books it's only plus as far I am concerned.",

I should say that before the Kindle Paperwhite, I had a Kobo Touch which I was fairly happy despite the lack of lighting option... That is until it started freezing every 10 mins! My only qualm about buying a Kindle was the lack of options for book format, but then I got Calibre and everything was easy. I have since found that ebooks are much cheaper on amazon and there's more choice, including foreign language books. A happy happy customer.",

I don't think the screen quality is that great, the backlight is meh - and I certainly don't like reading with it in the dark. Also the touch screen is really annoying, I'd rather have the buttons. The navigation has gone from simple to needlessly complicated and I spend a lot of time looking for stuff. So I don't think it was worth the money for me.",
