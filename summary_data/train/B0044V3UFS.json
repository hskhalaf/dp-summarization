The back was against my wood sided house and they would climb the wall and then crawl inside the unit (with lots of nesting material).

I have thwarted them for now with some strips of wood glued into place inside the storage unit but I don't regard wood as permanent barricade for mice.",

Easy to install with no tools at all, extremely durable when being sat on and just overall a great purchase. Great match with espresso/brown furniture. I do not plan on putting this outside, it's a great different look for inside my home, I'm sure I will buy more in the future for outdoors.",

Every time I open it the lid falls off. The only positive thing is that the rest of it clicked together nicely.",
