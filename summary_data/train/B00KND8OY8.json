Over the years, the porous tiles had lost their gloss and had faded from the sun. When I applied this product to the porous tiles, the product was absorbed into the tile. This process caused a sealing effect of the faded tiles. The tiles now have a renewed gloss. Furthermore, the product has restored a major portion of the color that was previously visible in the tiles. Bottom line, I am very pleased with this product. It is not only for hardwood but also for restoring the appearance of faded porous porch tiles.",
