The calendars have nice big boxes with room to write a number of things for each of us and still be easy to read. Good magnetic sticking power. The markers are sub-par, but we have a decent supply of markers already, so that wasn't a big deal. Overall, very pleased with these!",

I've tried a wet cloth, windex, and of course erasers on the back of the pens...I can't find the cloth it came with, but I'll look for something like that. Any recommendations on how to get the marker off after a month (or two)? Thanks",
