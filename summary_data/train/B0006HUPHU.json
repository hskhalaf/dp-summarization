I wanted to have the capability of making 3 & 2 holes in the paper without having to own and have room for two separate pieces of equipment and this hole punch does that well. It is not quite as effortless as I would like though. I have to use a flathead screwdriver to move the hole punching prongs to make the adjustment from three to two holes but since I don't have to do that too often for my purposes this was a great buy.",

I can adjust it so it fits my mini binder or if I need to adjust to fit a binder that's just a little longer than regular hole punches. I really like that it catchs the little holes so I don't have to stand over a trash can. Easy bottom removal for quick paper clean up. Cons: with thicker papers it has a harder time punching through, but I feel like that's any hole punch, 10 regular papers is a little to thick and hard to punch through. Overall great hole punch and does the job. 4 stars becasue it has a hard time punchs through 10 pages.",

I had intended to use this to punch laminated recipe pages, but the lamination makes the page too big to fit (lamination pouches are about 11.5\" in length). Rather than hassle with returning something at this price point I think I'll just be using a rotary tool to cut a slot in one of the supports to allow the pages to pass through. There's plenty of \"meat\" in the supports that it shouldn't be an issue.",

The punch has a size limit of about 11.25\" long/wide. I wish it were a quarter inch longer! Unfortunately, the length limit is not changeable - it's part of the metal part of the punch.

I hole punch several sheets with this to get me school ready. It does the job i need it to do with great precision, all the pages come out uniform which i love. I haven't tried changing the levels but it seems easy enough. Clean up is a breeze! The bottom part slides out, have a trash can handy because sometimes the waste paper comes flying out. Happy Hole Punching!",

I wanted one that was overall not too \"bulky\" or large and this Swingline one is the perfect option. The shipping was very fast and I have no problem hole punching a semi thick stack of papers. You don't need to press too hard, like some other hole punchers. The item is simplistic and well made. Definitely will be buying it again, (if i ever need another one).",

I don't know if the last one I had was \"ugly,\" but I really like the way this one looks. I would buy this again and at the price have thought about buying a second one. I will never need a second one so it makes no sense, but that is how much I like it. In the stores you would pay upwards of $15 for this. You can't even buy cheaply made ones in the stores at this price. Highly recommended!!!",

I didn't anticipate this being an issue when I purchased the punch, but (Sherlock here) it turns out that laminated pages are slightly bigger than their unlaminated counterparts. Thus, I have had to send laminated pages off to the Great Hole Puncher in the Office, rendering the convenience of a home hole punch rather less convenient.",
