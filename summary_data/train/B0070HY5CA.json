The Wayne battery is expensive and I had seen in other forums that you just need a deep cycle marine battery. I found a Duracell SL127MDC at batteries plus that fit and works just fine - i think it was about $89.",

It is a large, heavy wall wart, and I think it would be easy for it to work its way out of the wall plug.

So I bought this, and it has failed 3 times in less than a year (bought 10/15). First it was something in the circuit board. A couple months later is was the darn transformer cable. Who ever heard of those going bad? Finally, it looks like the battery died in less than a year. Of course, each time, that alarm that can't be turned off without unbolting the battery goes off, always in the middle of the night. I hate this product.",

I was worried about the battery, but after 24 hours of pumping approximately every 2 minutes the charging indicator for battery was still on the green.

The plug connections are such that you don't need to worry about hooking anything up wrong as the wires can only can be connected one way due to the unique plugs. One thing wrong in the instructions is they say you need to install a check valve but according to their help line you do not and should not. I inquired because separate check valves are visible on both the battery backup and the 110 pump. Also they don't say in the instructions if you should use a conventional or a deep cycle battery. The help line verified it should be a deep cycle.",

Would be a blown away 5 star review if it weren't for a faulty heavy switch. My problem was solved with a 2 oz.counter weight to make the float heavier to actuate the switch to turn the pump off. Not exactly a major problem but a hassle and an extra worry for a brand new (not cheap) pump. Does Wayne have a better solution for this problem short of a replacement?",

This is the only reason I did not give it a 5 as this seems like something that could be a little better thought out. Very quiet operation and as another reviewer noted....about $500 with the battery but as anyone who has had water in their basement knows, that is a small price to pay.",
