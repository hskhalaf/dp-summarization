They don't feel cheap or flimsy at all, they actually have a little bit of heft to them for their size. And they haven't tarnished or rusted or started to get dull either. I got them for use with espresso cups and they're perfect, and another reviewer mentioned using them for baby food as well because they're not just the perfect size but also perfectly smooth. Whatever you use them for, I think you'll be pleased with them too.",

Be advised, they are longer than most \"iced tea spoons\" ( This product here has an extra long stem handle with a regular sized (almost smaller) spoon at the end. I was looking for regular-sized iced tea spoons, which are longer than regular teaspoons and soup spoons. For some reason, stores don't want to stock regular sized iced tea spoons. They only want to stock standard-sized table teaspoons (similar length as a soup spoon, for example). In general, longer spoons like iced tea spoons are really handy for serving things from regular sized jars without getting your fingers and hands all sticky.",

I got these for gummy bears, figuring if they were too small I would find another use for them. But there is no other use.

I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a great addition to their espresso cup and plate set. Or even for a little girls tea party. These would also make a perfect little spoon for baby feeding. The edges are not sharp, and the spoon would hold just the right amount for a baby's bite.",

      "text": "The ice cream spoons are just like the iced tea spoons, except the spoon is a little \"rounder\" than the iced tea spoon, which is more oblong. Pretty, sleek, useful. You might be surprised at how often you find yourself reaching (or looking for) long-handled spoons or utensils. Packaged well for shipping to protect from scratching, bending or crushing.",
