Accurate exposures, detailed images rich with natural color, all without any fussing at all has made taking pictures fun again. I'm sure the various scene choices and all the other automation do help the camera make appropriate exposure and focus decisions. But, I'd be hard pressed to prove it true or untrue. Everything simply looks great. I'm recommending the TX5 to anyone who asks, and I do get questions because of that large cyclops-like lens and the attractive black body. It's not your average looking camera.",

It would have been nice to add some features that allow you to change the aperture, for example (not a lot, just some). Otherwise, this camera is very intelligent and takes great pictures (in wide screen form too that allows you to view it on one's HD TV with no black bars on either side); the mini movie feature is excellent and pick up sound a long way off too. Recommend you to get a 16gb disc to go with it as the movie can take a lot of space! Highly recommended as a compact camera",

Buy it with a 16gb memory card, and you can shoot for weeks without having to offload images. I take this camera with me almost everywhere these days.",

Combining the zoom, high sensitivity mode, and image stabilization, I got an excellent picture which amazed my relatives! I particularly like having two customizable modes. I have one set up for indoors and the other set up for wide angle scenics and I'm ready for vacation travel. To get much better I'd have to get an SLR at four times the price, weight, and bulk.",

I think part of the problem is that the reording mic is at the left top side. And one may accidently cover the mic without knowing. - The other is the flash. It is on the right side. Your fingers may close part of it. Bottom line, just be aware, and you should be off taking nice pictures. Cheers.",

Video is okay, but don't expect digi-cam results if you need professional imagery. It's very tough to keep the camera stable when taking videos and sound is mono, but sensitive enough to record from a decent distance. So, a little pricey in my opinion but you have a well rounded, features packed camera with a world class Leica lens.",

The dial is great and there's a manual selection... incorporates a lot of the professional stuff I like in my DSLR in a smaller version with 4:3 - much cheaper than comparable cameras though no HD video.

    "title": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5S 9MP Digital Camera with 10x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Silver)",
    "description": "Color:SilverFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n The 9.1-megapixel Panasonic DMC-TZ5 packs a 28mm wide-angle, 10x optical zoom Leica DC lens in a compact design, ideal for the active photographer who needs a versatile camera. By combining a 28mm wide-angle lens, which lets you capture a wider-framed shot when compared to a traditional 35mm camera, with the TZ-Series 10x optical zoom, you're empowered to take expanded shots, both wide and far. Panasonic's Intelligent Auto technologies are also expanded, with new Intelligent Exposure and Digital Red-eye Correction. \n\nWith the addition of Intelligent Exposure and Digital Red-eye Correction, Panasonics Advanced Intelligent Auto mode consists of seven intuitive technologies, all which are specifically designed to help make photo-taking an enjoyable and seamless process unnoticed by the consumer -- helping them to take clear photos. When in Advanced Intelligent Auto mode, the following technologies all operate automatically; no settings need to be manually changed. \n\nAlso new to the TZ5 is the Venus Engine IV, Panasonics new high-performance image processing LSI. The Venus Engine IV produces higher-quality pictures than its predecessor, the Venus Engine III, by using a more advanced signal processing system. The new Venus Engine IV also improves noise reduction, elevates the detection accuracy and corrective effects in both Mega O.I.S. and Intelligent ISO and reduces the shutter release time lag. Both models also incorporate Intelligent LCD, which detects the lighting condition and controls the brightness level of the LCD in 11 fine steps, to offer optimal clarity in any situation, whether dark or light; indoors or outdoors. With a newly developed 460,000-dot high resolution in the TZ5s 3.0-inch LCD, photos can be easily viewed on the display, regardless of the shooting environment. \n\nThe TZ5 is also capable of recording 720p high-definition motion pictures, and because of its support of SD memory cards, is easily compatible with Panasonic Viera plasma HDTVs that have an integrated SD memory card slot, so viewing photos is simple. Also, with the newly added HD component output capability, users can also connect the TZ5 to an HDTV and watch a slideshow complete with mood-appropriate music, choosing from natural, slow, urban and swing. \n\nLumix DMC-TZ5A Highlights \n\nIntelligent Exposure With this new feature, photos will no longer be under- or over-exposed. Instead, the TZ5 instantly analyzes the framed image and adjusts the brightness in areas that are too dark because of dim lighting, backlighting or the use of the flash. The camera will automatically adjust the brightness accordingly. \n\nDigital Red-eye Correction This feature helps to eliminate the red-eye problem that sometimes results when taking flash shots at the night. Incorporated into the built-in flash, the camera emits a small preliminary flash before the main flash, detects red-eye and will digitally correct it. \n\nMega O.I.S. Gyrosensors detect hand-shake and the lens system shifts to compensate, helping to prevent hand-shake from creating a blurry image. \n\nIntelligent ISO With Intelligent ISO, the TZ5 can determine if the photo subject is moving and change the ISO setting and shutter speed accordingly, thus giving a blur-free photo. \n\nIntelligent Scene Selector Intelligent Scene Selector senses the ambient conditions, recognizes the shooting environment and will automatically select the appropriate scene mode from: Scenery, Portrait, Macro, Night Portrait or Night Scenery mode. This intuitive technology, helps you use the most common scene modes that are built into the camera, but often go unused, without making any manual adjustments. \n\nFace Detection Panasonics Face Detection detects faces anywhere in the frame and automatically chooses the optimal focus and exposure settings so portraits come out clear and crisp. Detecting up to 15 faces, Panasonics Face Detection can even track a face if the subject is moving. \n\nContinuous AF The Continuous AF (auto focus) system maintains focus on the subject even without pressing a shutter button halfway, thus minimizing the AF time.",
