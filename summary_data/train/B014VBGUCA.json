Having things be compartmentalized in my bag made it 100x easier to find things instead of my worst nightmare -having everything vomit out of my bag every time I opened it. I was able to fit 4 pants, 3 shorts, 3 rompers, a light sweater, and some other small items just in the large cube. I liked the variety pack so I could separate clothing items based on the size of the cube; I will probably use these every time I pack a bag from now on.",

My husbands shirts fit well in the larger ones and the smaller are great for underwear, socks, etc. I've actually been able to pack an entire weekends's worth of my own clothes (a few sundresses, shorts, tops, underwear and bras) in a single large one! Makes unpacking at a hotel so much easier! When not in use, they barely take up any space as I'm able to store 2 packs (8 total) within the smallest one.",
