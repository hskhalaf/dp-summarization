The day it arrived the kids were excited to try it out, but it was raining outside, so we decided to run up and down the hallway to see if we could inflate it that way. We were surprised that it actually worked! If we could do it running down our inside hallway, I can only imagine how easy it is to inflate outside with a nice wind. It seems really well made, it's super easy to inflate/deflate and pack away, and the colors are really nice. We're all very pleased and are looking forward to taking it on our next camping trip.",
