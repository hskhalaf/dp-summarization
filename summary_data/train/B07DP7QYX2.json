The band around the belly could be a little softer, the seam is a little prominent for my taste. I would call these thin sweat pants rather than yoga because they do zero \"shaping\". Overall, very good purchase for the price! I'll probably add more to this review after a month. We'll see what a month of wear and washes does to the quality.",

Super soft, stretchy, as people have noted this isn't see-through thin, but it is thinner cool material (not the thick workout elastic pants of say, an Athleta pants), this is a light, easy to breath and move in pants. I will be purchasing another!",
