It isn't big though so you may want to check dimensions. The mask was a nice bonus. My biggest complaint is not with the product, but inflatable pillows, which constantly shoot away from me in the night. Having a cover may increase friction and reduce that, but it is not required. For regular camping, I need a larger foam pillow personally, but if you need a small pillow for emergency use or if weight and space is a serious issue, this is perfect.",

Side sleeping it's a little low but still comfortable. On a side note, my partner tried the pillow out at home when we got it and quickly fell asleep on the pillow. Said it was very comfortable.

In the past, I have used rolled up clothes and much smaller pillows, but they didn't really work because I am predominantly a side sleeper. I used this in my hammock and on the ground, and it was warm, soft, adjustable, and comfortable. 2.9 grams is not a lot of weight for a good night's sleep. I was concerned about the seam where the two sides meet, but that turned out to not be an issue at all. I can recommend this.",

Throughout each night, they would slowly deflate and become useless. We would literally wake up and re-inflate them. Kind of disappointing in that they didn't last very long. Overall, good for a couple of nights and then just stop working.",

After talking to some fellow parents, I finally caved and purchased this inflatable pillow. It took seconds to inflate and it's awesome! It's nothing like my old inflatable pillow- somehow it manages to not \"feel\" like it's just full of air. Bonus- it packs down to practically nothing which is huge for backpacking!",

The fabric is nice and construction appears to be very sturdy. It deflates quickly when you want it too and folds up compactly to stow away in backpack or luggage. I'll be using it on a camping trip in lieu of rolling up my clothes for a pillow and experiencing neck muscle pull or strain. Hallelujah!",
