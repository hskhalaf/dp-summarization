If this laptop only had a back-lit keyboard I would have no choice but to insist it should have a 5 1/2 star rating. This was my first Samsung product and it impressed me greatly, enough to buy a Galaxy Note5 (have been very happy with it as well).",

The only issue I've had is that the touchpad is quite sensitive. However, I didn't use this with the installed Windows 10 at all, I installed Ubuntu immediately, and Ubuntu does typically require some settings tweaks when it comes to touchpads in general, so I can't really knock the laptop on this point. After tweaking it is fine, and the feel of the touchpad is excellent - very smooth. I'm a software developer, photographer, videographer, and night course teacher, so I use my laptops in a wide variety of ways, and am absolutely satisfied with this excellent laptop.",

Basically it dims and brightens the display automatically depending on what is being displayed is light coloured or dark coloured (note: it does not depend on ambient light level). After I disabled this feature, it just enables itself automatically after a few minutes. There is no way I can keep the setting disabled.",

I got the videos. Right-arrow key broke under normal use. Exterior casing started to break. I had a good battery life of 6 hours of light office use, then it dropped to 1.5 hours all of sudden around the 7th month. I still have plenty of battery life. This product is unreliable. I requested a repair but I'm afraid the entire electric board is exposed to electric shock and the integrity of the laptop is compromised.",

SO I wasted money on an external touchscreen mouse... But I got an external touchscreen mouse. Great laptop. I do programming and some data science and it holds up to all of my tasks. 10:10 would buy again.",
