At first I thought they were going to be too small as well but with some pulling and stretching, it fit. The material feels strange off the chair but once it\u2019s on, you don\u2019t notice a difference. My chairs look like they did the day we bought them. The only thing I noticed wrong was that the cover doesn\u2019t \u201cfold\u201d where the seat and back meet, leaving a curved look. This is going away though after a few uses.",

My only note is that they easily pop off the bottom while getting up and out of the chairs, which can reveal the damage of the actual chairs. Otherwise, great deal.",
