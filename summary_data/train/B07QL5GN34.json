I spoke to my mother in law (a licensed cosmetologist) and I buffed my nails too smooth for the base coat to grip to. The polish is a little thick but nothing you can't fix by shaking it for a while.

The bottles are glass, not plastic. They are a little small, but certainly not sample size. I have had mine on for a week and had no lifting, no smudging and no chipping.

      "text": "These polishes are really great for this price! The colors are beautiful and they are very easy to apply evenly. I\u2019m an esthetician so my hands are constantly enduring oils, cleansers, serums etc. and though these do lift slightly after a few days, that\u2019s to be expected with my line of work. I think if you\u2019re someone who isn\u2019t putting your hands through a lot these polishes would be an amazing value for you! The top coat is super shiny too. Honestly at this price I can\u2019t complain.",

I've noticed that the more coats I apply the faster they peel off but not with these and thats why I love them",
