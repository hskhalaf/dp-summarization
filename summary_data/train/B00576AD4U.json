      "text": "I have tried many lotions, including those recommended by my dermatologist. I was skeptical of this, because the \"Dead Sea\" aspect just seemed a little gimmicky. However, after one day of using this lotion (immediately post-shower), I fell in love with it. Noticeable improvement in my skin's softness, within the first day. I also love the scent. It's a very unique scent - can't describe it other than to say it's \"clean and fresh\" smelling. My husband thinks it's strongly scented. Like this so much I will be giving it for Christmas gifts. I'm a believer now! I also like that it's in a pump dispenser. Makes it very easy to use single handed.",

It has a very clean, mild fragrance, so it is not exactly 100% hypo-allergenic, but I have very sensitive skin and it still agrees with me. My husband has started using it now too & loves it, because it sinks in faster than Eucerin and Aveno.",

It moisturizes without being heavy and absorbs quickly. The scent is not overpowering, so I can apply my favorite French perfume right after the lotion. Love it!",
