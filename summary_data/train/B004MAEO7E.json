The pin used to rip up our threshold and we ended up replacing it. We used this product and cut out the top to fit perfectly into our threshold. It stays put and works beautifully, my son can go through the doorway with no problems!!",

      "text": "The easiest way to make your cuts is with a circular saw with a coarse tooth blade. I first tried a reciprocal saw and a multi-tool, but this was impossibly slow. I used a long screw on each far side of this item to secure it to the floor. Being as it is rubber it absorbs a lot of the shock of the wheels riding up on it, so it is a very smooth ride for the wheelchair.",

    "description": "Size:1.25\" H x 42\" W x 12.25\" DSafePath introduced EZEdge Transition/Threshold Ramps more than 20 years ago. They are used to remove vertical barriers in the path of travel...whether it's in the house to solve mobility issues or on the production floor to eliminate tripping hazards. EZEdge ramps are \"green\" and made from high density, reclaimed rubber from used car and truck tires. These products are both economical and good for the environment. These EZEdge ramps can be used indoors or out and will not fade, crack or deteriorate. They are perfect for wheel chair access through entry way doors, sliding glass doors, patio doors and showers. These ramps are Industrial Grade and can be used in both residential and commercial use. They are noiseless and visually pleasing. All EZEdge ramps are molded with mitered edges on 3 sides. This allows EZ access from any side. EZEdge ramps have no weight limit which means they can handle motorized scooters in the house and lift trucks on the shop floor. Both ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) and OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Act) have slip resistant specifications. EZEdge ramps exceed both of these specs and are significantly more slip resistant than ramps made from aluminum, treated lumber or semi-smooth concrete. They will not fade or deteriorate and are guaranteed to resist damage caused by the sun's UV (ultra-violet) rays. All EZEdge products have a 10 year warranty. You should note that EZEdge ramps come in a large variety of sizes. Heights vary from 1/2 inch to 2 inches with widths of 42 to 60 inches. Installation is quick and easy. The ramps can be cut for various heights and notched for door jams and stops using a jig saw, or a utility knife. They can be temporarily or permanently installed. SafePath has manufactured the EZEdge ramps from the highest quality materials available and designed them to exceed specifications for safety, slip resistance, easy access and code compliance. All EZEdge products are proudly made in the U.S.A. Enjoy!.",
