It is always gobbled up when offered. The seed is always fresh and clean smelling; almost like something I would want to eat myself. The 2lb bag is just enough for me to keep on hand for 3-4 months without worrying about spoilage. I have had no issues with bugs. Overall a great quality product at a fair price.",

I feed high quality pellets in addition to seed mix and it is hard to find seed mixes these days that do not have a bunch of filler in the form of cheap pellets and other junk my bird won't eat and therefor throws on the floor and wastes. There is very little waste with this product, my bird loves it. It could really do without the peanuts but other then that it's great.",
