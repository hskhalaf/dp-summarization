The stand was huge, so I ordered a cheap articulating wall mount off Amazon. I think it was a VideoSecu bracket. This eliminated the bulky stand, and I can now move it around with ease above my desk. I sit this monitor next to my 2013 Macbook Air, and use it as a second monitor. Would definitely buy this again, but hopefully I won't have to.",

Additionally, the screen is so bright to me (even at 0 brightness) that I have to use Windows Magnifier to invert colors in order to read text without going blind. I think, in hindsight, I probably should have gotten a monitor that offered paper viewing, but this'll do for a bit. I'm used to its flaws at this point and it's a gorgeous screen overall. :)",

Flat, non-reflective screen (ideal for me). I have a much older ViewSonic which is still working like a champ. Note that for older eyes, the native pixel resolution might be too small, so you might not need as many pixels (1900x1080 or 1200 might be okay). This monitor does a better than expected job at other lower resolutions as well. I'm driving with Intel integrated graphics controller. Adjustable, rotatable, variety of input options. Recommended. Able to view two documents side-by-side and legibly.",

Can't speak to color representation, etc. and I didn't really care about that. I just wanted a high quality monitor that had a higher pixel count and display port. Very nice for everything I use it for. Thanks ViewSonic!",

This monitor is VESA compatible, which is nice (eventually I'll hang it on a wall). Time will tell how it holds up but so far I'm really pleased and think the price point represents a good value.
