      "text": "I love these headphones! Normally skullcandy's are a middle of the road headphone. These are not. The sound is amazing with great highs and can even pump out some nice lows. Got these initially for a trip and now I use them for gaming on my ps4. I can no longer play with tv speakers. Changes the experience greatly. The memory foam on them is so comfortable. I can wear these for hours with no pain or annoyance. I gave 4 stars because occasionally when I'm chatting on the ps4 my mic cuts out and I have to unplug and replug which usually works. Other than that these are fantastic and at an awesome price!",

They do not bleed sound which is nice. They look nice to but feel flimsy and cheap where the earcups are. These are simply ok",

They do not cancel sound around you and the headphones and much comfortable after and hour. Yea they are very comfortable for a bit, but the cushion is a little too soft which makes the solid part of the headphone touch your ear and it starts to hurt after a while. Maybe this is just me but i do have a big head, so if you have a big head, i highly recommend you look for another pair of headphone which suits your needs.",

The sound quality is ok, but you are much off buying a set of similarly priced Sony's. Skullcandy the company seems to only care about celebrities when it comes to customer service, and have a company ethos built around ignoring any type of product criticism. The headphones are cheaply made, you are paying for the marketing hype, not solid electronics.",

With an optics-inspired design (see the custom styled drivers for yourself) and a focus on performance, the Aviator is the Porsche of the headphone arena. Take charge of the conversation, and the music, with in-line Mic3, while Attacking Bass, Natural Vocals, and Precision Highs deliver the purest experience in audio \u2013 no matter the genre. In function, form, and fit, the Aviator is Supreme Sound at its finest. \n\nSupreme Sound FEATURES AND HIGHLIGHTS\n * Supreme Sound delivers Attacking Bass, Natural Vocals and Precision Highs\n * Take or make calls, control volume, play/pause, or track/control with Mic3\n * Soft leather touch memory foam ear pillows provide ultimate comfort\n * Highest-grade materials ensure unmatched durability and style\n * Includes detachable cable for mobility and Aviator travel bag.\n\nSoft, comfortable ear pillows WHAT IS ATTACKING BASS?\nMost headphones' bass is either suppressed and muddy or exaggerated and boomy. Skullcandy's Supreme Sound \u201cAttacking Bass\u201d experience hits with punchy and powerful bass that's engineered for your music. \n\nHighest-grade materials NATURAL VOCALS\nYou have probably heard headphones with hollow or tinny vocals that sound like they're coming from an AM radio. Supreme Sound lets you hear warm and smooth vocals as if you were standing beside your favorite singer. \n\nPRECISION HIGHS\nSkullcandy engineers their headphones to produce clean and spacious highs, not piercing or muted highs like you've probably heard in other headphones. Supreme Sound delivers perfect highs for the final element of an amazing audio experience.",
