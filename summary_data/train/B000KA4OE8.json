But when these two blue in color balls arrived they had such an awful \"chemical smell\" that there is absolutely no way we will be using them. So, they ended up in the trash. I don't know if the plastics have changed but the chemical smell of these blue balls is unbearable. Literally eye watering if they are near you.",

Whether you plan to use it for lacrosse, massage, or a dog ball, an ungloved hand or dog mouth has to touch it at some point - I think the chemical fumes coming off these balls must be highly toxic. They also seem bouncier than a lacrosse ball should be. I would rate these at a negative 5 stars if I could.",

So much better than a tennis ball (harder, so they can pinpoint tight spots better as they don't collapse in when applying pressure, and the rubber exterior won't slip around on painted walls like tennis ball felt does). Also, as a side benefit, they are fun to bounce on the floor as they bounce back hard and fast (not recommended, I guess, if you live in an apartment and have downstairs neighbors as these boys will echo thru floors like a champ).

They're sturdy, and the pricing is better than balls listed under \"trigger point massage.\" I wrapped mine up in multiple layers of plastic wrap, side by side, again as recommended by the therapist.
