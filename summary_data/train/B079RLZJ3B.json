Altra Lone Peak are running boots with several design flaws, that make them get stuck between rocks often, also they make me trip over a lot when running in rocky areas.. a bit of a nightmare really. The rear end of the soles get caught by anything pretty much (roots, rocks, etc). The toes area should be more protective or have better and stronger protection.. it gets scratched easily, and make then start falling apart even after the first time of running with them. I don't recommend them unless Altra changes those important issues.",

This is not a waterproof mountaineering boot, but a fast, flexible, grippy, wide toe box shoe. Ultimate comfort, it is a living extension of your foot. I did notice a separation of the upper from the sole after about 100 miles on the trail. I contacted Altra, submitted a warranty claim, and they sent me a new pair, as asked for, even though the purchase was 3rd party through Amazon. I own several pairs of various boots and runners, but by far the 3.5 and 4.0 mids are my favorite.",

We were watching the AC 100 Race in the Angeles National Forest and we hiked up some steep hillsides to get good views. They performed wonderfully. The only reason I put no arch support is that these are zero drop shoes and are advertised to not have arch support.",
