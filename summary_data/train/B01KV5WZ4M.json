      "text": "Great solution where no electricity is available. Bought this unit (Daylight Color) for the back of my garage. Have it set to \"motion detect only\". Been walking up a staircase in the dark behind my garage for 15 years now. Wish this was available sooner. Great solution for a simple problem. Unit turns on when about 12-ft away from it. I have it mounted high up (about 10-ft). Light is plentiful and stays on for about a half a minute after motion stops. Light fades to full on and fades off. We'll see how it holds up with longevity. Update: Liked the unit so much bought the Warm-White output color a year later. Still great!",

Installed to use above our address number on the side of the house so it can be seen from the street at night, works perfect for this using the always on low light feature which lasts all night, this mode also changes to a bright light when detecting motion. The only issue we have had relates to sun exposure for charging, the solar panel is not angled very much, when installed it's almost 90 degrees to the wall it's mounted on, so its sun exposure is limited during the winter months when the sun isn't directly overhead as long.",

This causes them to not charge well while blinking most the day. Fix requires taking them apart to remove battery and then re-install to force them to turn off. Then charge them, then turn back on.
