    "description": "Philips Avent Double Electric Breast Pump helps you save time and lets your baby enjoy the benefits of breast milk. Our pump also has a unique, soft cushion with massaging petals that help gently stimulate milk flow by mimicking your baby's natural suckling patterns. For additional suction, just attach the Power Cushion included. Unlike breast pumps that only operate properly when you lean forward, this breast pump allows you to sit comfortably upright as you express because the pump's angled neck lets milk flow naturally from breast to bottle. The breast pump is simple to use, with only a few lightweight parts that are easily assembled. Parts are dishwasher safe. It includes the Natural bottle and nipple for easier latch-on and transition between breast and bottle feeding. The Philips Avent Double Electric Breast Pump is backed by a 2-year warranty. Replacement Massage Cushions are available in 19.5mm or 25mm and Power Cushions in 27.5mm.",
