UPDATE I'm afraid I am considerably reducing the rating as I am experiencing a thumping /crashing noise when walking so I returned them to b&o under warranty. That took 3 weeks to arrange and now they are saying that there isn't a problem and have returned them back to me. For a Premier company this just isn't good enough and after buying a couple of b&o products I won't be buying anymore. And these will be returned straight back to them. Avoid.",

Upon using the headphones the left ear cup produces a loud screeching sound that is potentially damaging to the ear. Extremely disappointed with the sound quality, as what is the point of owning stylish headphones if they are non-functional.",

The B&O's were reduced in price and the reviews were good. The H9i's sound superb, especially with classical and soft rock music. The headband is more comfortable, and they will pair with more than one system at a time, picking up whichever is playing sound at the time. Also features a removable battery but with no external charger, this is not a perfect solution vs the Senns. (One star deducted for this.) Highly recommended.",

The bass and sound quality are enhanced with the bass becoming tighter and 'punchier', a great improvement from the last generation H9's. The ANC is also significantly improved from the H9's. When using the H9's you would have some ambient noise still leak through but that's mostly been eliminated with the H9i's.

Comfortable for those not wearing glasses. I wear glasses and at times will feel the earpads pressing on the frame. Batt life: So far I have pushed it to 20hours before charging. Could last longer,just too lazy to push it. Touch control: No issue for me though it does takes a few minutes of practice. App: More customization preferred. In general this is an awesome cans. Sound really good and feels sturdy. The slight issues encountered can be easily ignored.",

I love the multi device support as well. The touch controls can be a little finicky until you get used to them, and AptX support is lacking which is a little bit of a bummer, but over USB the sound quality is great. Range could be a little bit better but is still pretty decent. I get maybe 50 feet out of it with a couple thin walls in between.",

I feel that the get better as they burn ing 10-30 hours of use like my H8's did. These sound great - give great response across the whole spectrum.
