Neato returns it with no improvement or fix to the problem. They will not tell us what they are finding wrong. I believe they cannot or will not fix their software problem and are anxious for our warranty period to end. No more Neato's for us.",

You are probably thinking this is an isolated incident but it's not. You see I've owned 2 other models I've bought over the years and the longest one has lasted is 2 years. The sad thing is when this unit works it does a great job but for the money it should probably have a little longer life in my opinion.

The R9250 gets lost, will repeatitively sweep confusing corners, or get stuck under chair legs. The neato D5 won't, it's tracking program is more robust. This is a reliable product, and as it is automated, it allows one to gain time back into one's life. The Wi-Fi programming works. Unsure why others are complaining. I have a combined 2.4 and 5GHz Wi-Fi network. It connects and stays connected on current software version. My only complaint is that the bin design is patterned on the plastic surface. This pattern when scratched enhances the scuff marks and cannot be wiped away.",

      "text": "This vacuum worked well for 3 months before having a hardware/software malfunction and becoming a brick. I worked through all levels of the service department trying all the resets and reboot until they determined it needed to be shipped in for repairs. I have worked with 4 different Neato service members over this time period and after trouble shooting for almost a month today, no one knows what's wrong with my robot or where it even is. Service department told me 2 days ago they'd have information within 24 hours... And after I called back today they still don't know what's going on. In a competitive market, you can find a cheaper company and hopefully better customer service.",

I\u2019ve done side by side comparisons now for about a week (bot battles),and the Neato wins hands down. My downstairs is about 1300sf, and Neato maps and reaches every sf. The Shark will take weeks to get every sf based on its random travels. Well worth the higher price.",

Having the Neato vacuum everyday keeps allergens from becoming rampant in my home. I literally feel the difference in every deep breath I can take more frequently now that Neato has integrated into the family housekeeping routine. Thank you, NeatoRobotics for this technology. The BotVac D5 Connected has genuinely improved my quality of life.",

      "text": "I had the Roomba 880 for pet hair and it filled up quickly, dropped hair all over my floor, and had many other issues. I have 3 dogs and a cat. This vacuum has a very large container for hair and debris. It works so much better than Roomba! It cleans much more efficiently, sends messages right to your phone, doesn't clog, and does exactly what it should. Also, the room/area barriers are MUCH better than Roomba's \"walls\" because they work without batteries and don't die after one use. The vacuum is a little noisy but no noisier than the Roomba. This vacuum is a life saver!",

Quieter with a larger dirt bin. I also have the filter for animal dander. Enjoy!!!",

We have a 3 bedroom, 2 bath house and only used the Neato two, maybe three times a month - so after no more than 40 cleanings, it would no longer connect. Because it is more than 9 months old, Neato has no solution other than to buy a new one. Buyer beware. UPDATE: Neato reached out to me after my review - and ultimately replaced our non-working unit. So far it's working/connecting great... and what amazing customer service!",
