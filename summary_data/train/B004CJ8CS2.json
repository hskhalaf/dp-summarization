Practice with it for a day or two and it becomes second nature. Freed from the constraints of a tripod, the Smoothee extends the iPhone video capabilities to use in nature, on the street, at festivals, etc. and it is FUN to use. Within a day or two, it felt completely comfortable to handle, lightweight enough to use for extended times, with great results. One of the best camera accessories I have ever purchased!",

When comparing to handheld shooting there is no doubt this is worth the money. My first try at this and the video looked semi-pro. The setup is super easy and it really only takes a few hours to get decent at it. The weight is substantial and the product doesn't feel cheap. I wish it came with some sort of case or even foam cutout to protect it, but overall no complaints.",

Final video quality is extremely professional. The only low point is that for every device that you have you need a different attachment, it should be a universal one included for those who has also a regular digital camera, no problem to have to get the one for iPhone 4, but it should include, as default, a universal attachment. Overall, an incredible product.",

Check out the how to videos on the steadycam site then go out and chase your pets, shoot 360s of your cars, whatever, you'll soon see improvements as you learn the best way for you to work the unit.",

However when we mounted the GoPro on the top camera mount, the tightening screw did not tighten & hold the camera firm on the steadicam. Thus the camera was loose & flopped forward. Figuring we had a badly made model, we sent it back & got a replacement. That was exactly the same so it must be a design fault with the tightening screw - it doesn't hold the camera tight on the steadicam. We did not order another one; instead we purchased a different model from another manufacturer. We were happy with our choice.",

    "title": "Steadicam Smoothee for iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S",
    "description": "Style:iPhone 4The Steadicam Smoothee is specifically designed and engineered to work with your iPhone 4/4s. Based on the same technology as the big $60,000 rigs used in Hollywood, it allows iPhone 4/4s owners to capture incredible video without the shakes normally associated with hand-held video shot on the go, right out of the box, the very first time. The Steadicam Smoothee is small and agile enough to take on vacations or follow the action at sporting events. The Smoothee lets you \"fly\" wherever the scene takes you--up and down steps, indoors and outside, through crowds--almost anywhere, with precise, elegant control and ease. Its quick release mount lets you instantly swap camera connections between your Smoothee and any tripod. While designed for the iPhone 4/4s the patented quick release removable mount also serves as a tabletop stand or can be mounted to any tripod with a standard \u00bc x20-Inch camera mount. The comfortable ergonomic hand-grip folds up securely when not in use. Also included with the Steadicam Smoothee is a quick guide DVD on how to get the best possible shots, along with a carrying strap. The lightweight, compact, agile, and easy to use Steadicam Smoothee features an innovative, patented design built around a durable mono-frame metal structure that requires no complicated instruction to use. With its &quot;go anywhere&quot; compact dimensions, the Steadicam Smoothee is approximately 8-Inch W x 14.5-Inch H x 2.5-Inch D (20.3 x 36.8 x 6.4cm) in operating configuration.",
