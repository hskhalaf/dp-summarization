Hopefully I'll win the replacement lottery and get a good unit sent to me. This looks like it could be a great product if they paid a little more attention to the quality. Update 11/1/19 My replacement was welded correctly and I've been using this workstation for a couple of years and loving it. Hopefully they have straightened out their production problems by now.",

It's a rock-solid stable platform for door trimming and I've also used it for cutting sheets of plywood as well as other lumber. I've also used it to cut down logs that are oversized for my woodburner. Overall, very pleased with this purchase.",

Only issue, recently it started to stick nearly completely extended AND when nearly fully closed. It will clamp but I need a rubber mallet to move it at the extremes. It is not been dropped or bent. Dropped to three stars for this issue. Will update back to 5 if a fix is available.",

Also, the vise is flat on one side and L-shaped on the other. This means your piece will sit higher on one side, but it's easy to deal with. I clamp a large level to plywood to use as a guide for my circular saw as this tool holds the material and it works out great.",
