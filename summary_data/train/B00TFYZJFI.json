As you can see from the photos, it makes for a more intimate and more memorable time around the campfire.At least I think so. The chair is sturdy and seems to be well made. I'll update if that changes. Recommended!",

      "text": "I use this a lot and am mostly happy with it. It mostly works as advertised, but the armrests frequently slide down in the back (notice in the photo how they're just attached by sliding rings that don't lock into any particular spot but just sort of grip the support rod). Also, it's uncomfortable to sit in the middle because of the support rod, so it's not quite ideal for three close friends wanting to huddle by the fire or something. But it's fine for two average size people. Also bear in mind that it's pretty heavy--you don't want to backpack with this thing. But it's nice for car camping.",
