Unlike most mid-top or high-top Timberland shoes with an outdoor-inspired, rugged look, this slip-on rendition of the Groveton silhouette radiates a casual and laidback vibe.\u00a0Because of its stylish flair and wide colorway selection, the Groveton Slip-On men's sneakers manage to catch the attention of buyers who are looking for a pair that blends comfort and style. It is an eco-friendly shoe, too, as it is made with recycled materials and plastic bottles.",

      "text": "Too a little bit of time to break in for a slip on loafer but being a Timberland, that was expected. I like the greenish-gray color. The sole was what needed breaking in and it got more pliable as it got worn. Now a comfy shoe after a day. Perfect sizing and Timbers are usually half a size bigger for me compared to the sneaker sizes (Adidas/Puma, etc). Expect these Timbers to last a while - the nylon/canvas part looks quite durable and yesm scuffs will show on the nubuck front.",
