The lighted head was cool, the lift off canister was cool. The performance was very disappointing. Get a refurbished Dyson for just a little more $ and it will bring you for satisfaction for YEARS. We learned our lesson with this and immediately bought another Dyson after this return, after our first refurbished Dyson finally lost suction after 13 years .",

My only gripes: - small container which increase the frequency of emptying - small and narrow brushroll which means smaller cleaning area. Not the size of your hoovers and bissel vacuums. - small length cord, wish it could have been longer. - if you use the wand with attachment, the handle provides for a unique holding position. not very ergonomic friendly and will start to wear your wrist out after some time. - the attachments are not \"on-board\" like your hoovers. if you can live with the above, then by all means, order.

It is very easy to switch from carpet to hard floor, easy to change from upright to long handled hose for high cobwebs, tops of curtains, etc.. As of yet I haven't used as a canister or used the mini attachments but expect the use will be as easy and user friendly as the rest of the vacuum. I would buy this Shark again and highly recommend it. (it is very simple to empty the the dust cup too).",
