I got exactly the quality product as they advertised. Secondly, its price is pretty reasonable compared with other companys\u2019 products. I was not that happy with previous pet beds which costed almost same or more because of their quality. Thirdly, I was impressed by their handwrited thank you letter. Most importantly, my dog loves it. They deserve 6 stars! Just minor feedback, I wish they had a single-colored lineup too, not a big deal though.",

I had to replace my dog's memory foam bed (very expensive!) because, even though it would spring back to normal shape when not in use, it would nearly bottom out when she was lying on it. So, her arthritic hips were actually very poorly cushioned. This bed is a great alternative, with a top layer of very cushioning latex, and a bottom layer of dense foam that supports without bottoming out. Additionally, the cover fabric is beautiful, so I won't have to hide this away when company comes.",

Also the large bed comes with two individual Cotten stuffed pieces which cause the bed to sag in the middle. Not the most efficient. Like other beds it should include one piece/box stitched and not two separate filling pieces.",
