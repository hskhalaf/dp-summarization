However I did make sure to fine tooth comb through hair to get all knots out before doing a new section so that might have helped. All and all it took me 15 mins to do whole head on the first try, which it can only get faster from there. I would recommend this curl secret to anyone who is new to curling hair or could never get the hang of the salon style curiling irons like me.",

That hurt a lot and I Do Not recommend this product to No One. If you do not want to be bald in the worse way. I threw away in thousands of pieces....",
