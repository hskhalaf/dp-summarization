That said, the grips are quality and the comfort is A+ so maybe my pair is a fluke?",

It doesn't bunch up or leave any feeling off discomfort at all. And with a shiny banging pedicure, you can definitely be the envy or better yet, role model to others. Definitely worth the price. Highly recommend! I will be buying two more colors.",

After a couple of wears, that goes away. I have never dried them, so they have kept their shape after washing. If your feet slide on your mat, try them.",

They don't feel extra hot or anything and are comfortable. The 4 stars is for the toe holes/stitching. Came apart a little and the toe holes are a little tough to work with.
