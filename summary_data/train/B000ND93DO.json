Beyond that, you just turn off the DVR, plug in the Free Agent and power it up, wait a minute or two, then turn the DVR back on. Note: the new drive replaces the internal, it does not supplement, so you will have to start from scratch with all programming of shows.",

      "text": "This unit failed my company in the field when needed most for an important project. The chassis failed to pull power from the cheap Chinese-made 12v power supply, and when the chassis is dead, the unit does not work. Cheap ingredients in this chassis made for a failure experience for our limited budget. I do not and cannot recommend Seagate any longer due to a bad experience with this product.",

    "title": "Seagate FreeAgent Pro 750 GB 3.5\" USB 2.0/eSATA External Hard Drive",
    "description": "Access your content from anywhere, share it with anyone and sync it to almost anything. The FreeAgent Pro data mover automatically duplicates and moves content you select to multiple locations like email and contacts to your IPod, photos to a Shutterfly account, your entire My Documents folder to FreeAgent, or move it to your own online space for 24/7 access from any browser. Also included is an innovative modular interface to future-proof technology, various models available, up to 750 glorious gigabytes of storage, and even a five year limited warranty.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nAmazon.com Product Description For the person who needs access to their digital content away from home, at work, or online, while also allowing that same content to be shared in a secure setting, look no further than the Seagate Free Agent Pro Portable Hard Drive. This powerful portable hard drive delivers high-speed transfers, while also giving you the ability to share content with others safely and securely from a remote location or even online.\n\n \n\n\n\nPowerful storage device with a sleek new design. \n\nThis hip-looking hard drive takes up less room on your desk than an ordinary stapler. \n\nShare your content with others safely and securely. With up to 1 Terabyte and an ultra-slim design for a clutter-free desktop, your FreeAgent Pro external hard drive helps keep you safe from goof-ups by automatically saving new versions of your content that you can easily access if need be. And should something happen to your PC, you can roll back your Windows operating system, settings, and applications to a point in time when they ran smoother, like before a virus attack. Even though the system settings are taken back in time, updates to photos, music and critical data files are kept current.  The Free Agent Pro is also ideal for those who want quick and painless transfers of their data from their computer to their drive, and from their drive to online accounts (such as Shutterfly or email). Simply plug it in to any power source and connect the USB cable to any computer, and you're ready to go. This hip-looking hard drive takes up less room on your desk than an ordinary stapler--1 x 3 x 5.2 inches (H x D x W)-- giving you more space for your other desktop items. Meanwhile, the hard drive only measures 7.5 x 1.4 x 6.3-inches (H x D x W) and it matches its small base.\n\n High Speed Synchronization and Sharing\nThe Free Agent Pro data mover automatically duplicates and moves selected content from your hard drive to multiple locations, such as copying your contact lists and emails to your iPod, or photos to a Shutterfly account. This feature also allows you to move your entire 'My Documents' folder to the Free Agent, or move it to your own online space where you (or others you choose) can access it from any browser 24/7. The Free Agent software also offers the feature of rolling back your system to better time if something should happen to your PC while automatic revisions of your content help keep you safe from goof-ups.\n\n Move files or other content with either USB 2.0 or eSATA allowing a maximum transfer rate of 480Mb/sec for USB, and 3Gb/sec for eSATA, while delivering a high performance spindle speed of 7,200 RPM. The unit also comes with a sophisticated touch point power on/off switch.\n\n The Free Agent Pro software and drive formatting works only with Windows, but the drive can easily be reformatted for a Mac with OS X's Disk Utility. This portable hard drive is also compatible with Windows Vista (as well as Windows XP and Windows 2000), allowing you to backup your content regardless of operating system upgrades. A five-year warranty is also included, giving you complete peace of mind. Now with the ability to take your data with you anywhere you go, your digital content finally has room to breathe.\n\n \nWhat's in the Box\nFreeAgent Pro data mover drive, Free Agent software (preloaded) and electronic documentation, USB2.0 and eSATA interfaces, USB 2.0 cable, AC power adapter, and a quick start guide.",
