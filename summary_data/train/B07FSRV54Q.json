Lorelai shoes are so incredibly comfy that your feet should be thanking you with every step you take.The shoes are stylish in a minimalist way, and the different hues these come in all look positively pleasing. The shoes are not supportive of the arches but are roomy enough to accommodate your custom orthotics should you want to wear them.",

        "Many users agree that Keen Lorelai sneakers are very comfortable, while one of them said that the shoes \u201cput a spring in every step.\u201d",

        "A good number of KEEN Lorelai reviews had people marveling at the adorable colors of the sneakers",
        "One person was happy about these kicks from Keen\u2019s casual sneakers collection contained removable insoles",

These are so thin on the sole that you can feel everything you step on. I put cushioned inserts in them and it helped, but these are not meant to walk much in. I thought about returning them, but they are a cute shoe. So I kept them to wear on short outings to dinner and such.",
