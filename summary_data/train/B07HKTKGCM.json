As far as sound I like the balanced bass/treble, especially on airplanes for they are more than adequate in noise canceling. I prefer the in-ear bud-style as opposed to the headphone style. Also, i like that these don't fall out during my runs. Regardless, $100+ for 18 months of use is entirely unacceptable. Will not purchase again.",

We also tried to \u201creboot\u201d them from what the internet said and NOTHING. We\u2019re so disappointed and I feel so bad because he was so excited for these. I usually read reviews first before buying anything and of course this is the one time I didn\u2019t. And I also never leave reviews on anything. Will be returning to get my money back.",

After all that they still will not turn on so now I am just stuck with $85.00 earbuds that I can't do anything with. I can't even return them because I am deployed overseas.

It worked okay for 6 months - battery life was short (need to charge daily after a couple hours of use), never fit my ears well so audio quality was weak. One day they started flashing red. I tried to reset per manufacturer instructions, but the headset was dead. I feel bad that I burned $100 to fill a landfill with this junk.",

It's not at all a good color for a dude like me so going to return and order the silver ones instead.
