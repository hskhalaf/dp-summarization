      "text": "I now have two of these. Of the several iterations of neck support pillows I have tried, this is the best one. (The ones that failed the test were either too stiff or bulky, causing my neck to hyper-extend, or too floppy and didn't provide enough support.) The memory foam is outstanding quality. After a year of daily use (because I have to sleep with it), the foam has held up and continues to give consistent, comfortable support. I wash the cover weekly, and it has also held up beautifully. I just purchased a second one, and I can't tell any difference between the brand-new and the year-old pillow. Worth the extra few dollars.",

I sustained injuries to my neck long ago and as a result, neck alignment is often stressed while napping flat on a bed - hence I wake up with pain or a headache. I inverted your pillow so the cushion supports my neck and the \"handles\" curve around my head creating a cradle-effect, allowing a slight elevation to the head. The result is my neck is properly-aligned and the muscles get relaxed. I wish I had had this pillow years ago. It is soft, very well made. I highly recommend it!",

Also to add on, since it has a sturdy shape and it is not deflate blessed or small, it does take up some room during traveling.",

It works, is a decent pillow, and you will probably get the same results with any other popular pillow.

      "text": "I used the pillow on a road trip to Dallas from Chicago on which I was very sick with stomach flu. Made my journey much more comfortable and helped elieviate back pain. Unfortunately the pillow has split at the inner neck seam. It's not even a month old :( *update* the company emailed me within a few hours of my review and sent me a new pillow. I agreed with them, it was probably just a faulty pillow. In a society where companies just don't care, it was refreshing for a company to care enough about their product and customer to reach out and make it right. I'm very happy with my pillow and extremely impressed with Crafty World",

I would still recommend it and like that the band that helps hold it in place if the headrest is down. The company's concern for my satisfaction raised my rating a notch to 5 STARS. Thank You!",

The only comfortable position is to hang your head forward, resting the chin on the pillow. Overall, definitely not for long air travel.",
