It does lag and it takes patients because it is very small. This would be an alternative for steaming for playing simple games instead of using your mouse. In addition, once you plug it in it is ready to go. I would also say its to pricey for what you get. You could get a keyboard with touchpad around the same price and blue tooth capability.

It's about half the size of the HP touchpad but I don't have any issues with that. Overall, for the price, I'm happy with it for general, day to day laptop use.",

I tried giving it a shot for several hours to see if I could get used to how I had to train myself to stop these unwanted inputs, but it was to no avail. I think my next option is to try a Wacom tablet instead.",

If you use a mouse to \"Drag Items\" frequently then a trackpad will not feel as natural a mouse however the positives outweigh the negatives for my application.
