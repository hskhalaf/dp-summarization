      "text": "I bought this set with rather low expectations, due to the very reasonable price. My set has lasted over seven years, for personal & professional use. The pump handle did crack, but it was easily replaced for a few dollars. I can\u2019t recommend this product enough. I tell all my patients & friends to buy a set. It\u2019s easy to use and the tune extension allows one to cup themself on any area that can be reached to scratch.",

    "title": "Premium Quality Cupping Set w/ 19 Cups ***BEST CUPPING SET IN KOREA***",
    "description": "Cupping is an ancient Chinese method of message for comfort. A partial vacuum is created in cups placed on the skin either by means of heat or suction. This draws up the underlying tissues. Cupping is the best deep tissue massage available. Cupping, the technique, is very useful and very safe and can be easily learned and incorporated into your family health practices. The new cups have done away with the traditional firing. This has made the application of the cups easy and safely. It has not only improved efficacy but also simplified the procedures of cupping therapy. The improved plastic cups for ancient Chinese cupping therapy are now available for supply. They are easier to be handled and safer to be used for massage at home. In China, the new cups are very popular for family cupping massage. CAUTION: Thoroughly clean skin and remove body hair before cupping. Excessive body hair will result in weak suction (not strong). Do not exert excessive force when attaching the extension tube to the cups to prevent the tube from cracking. Pressing down too firmly will cause the extension tube to crack. *Not recommended for slide cupping massage. Our company is NOT responsible for damage to cups, which may result from slide cupping technique or any massage techniques. **Please note that all the cupping cups are disposable** Due to customer's feedback, K.S. Choi Corp Premium Cupping Sets will not include the red plastic pointers any longer with our cupping sets. The red plastic pointers were deemed uneffective. So, we have removed them from our sets. We apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused.",
