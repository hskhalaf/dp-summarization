Has several pieces, easy to loose the filter cap if you don't keep it screwed on when not in use. Also very effective at making strong medicinal herbal teas. Echinacea, Pau d' Arco, Ginger, etc. You can steep the tea and then put in through the press to make a concentrated extract.",

It's easy to use, extremely easy to clean, and it takes up hardly any space. It may not be quite as convenient as a pod-type coffee maker, but it really does enable you to make THE BEST coffee/espresso.",

Cleanup is relatively easy, but keep in mind it's similar to a french press or anything else in that's it's still a good amount of work for each cup of coffee. Consider sticking with a regular coffee pot if you think you might be too lazy to do this every time...",

Anyway, the AeroPress produces coffee with a rich, bold flavor, but without the bitterness of other methods. It's also pretty much self cleaning! Since the rubber stopper on the plunger is sealed to the sides of the press, all the extra grounds get pushed into the \"puck\" of coffee grounds at the bottom. Just eject the push, give each part of the press a light rinse, and you're! Overall, best coffee maker I've used. Perfect for making coffee at work during the day.",
