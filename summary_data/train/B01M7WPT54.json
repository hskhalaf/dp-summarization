I haven't had the opportunity to wear them on a really sunny day as it's been overcast here for a few days. I'm hoping they aren't TOO dark. My eyes are sensitive to the light so I wear sunglasses even when overcast and these are a bit too dark for those conditions.",

Everybody that has seen them has asked me where I got all this money to buy such expensive sun glasses. Little do they know these are $20 Haha. Highly recommend. You wont regret.
