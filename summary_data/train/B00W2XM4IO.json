I had a feeling something was wrong when they started to not finish their food. After checking online i noticed that the bad is different and the formula changed. I cannot stand when companies pull this sneak attach on people. Cats are extremely finicky with food and sure enough they wont touch this stuff. 2 dang years and you not decide to pull this. Starting my journey again with a new company because this is not cool.",

I recommend it for a cat with stomach problems. Been using this brand for 2 and half years.",
