I am still unclear if I should use ATHLETE mode vs NORMAL mode though. Small issue. App-wise, can be improved: 1. Have a remarks box after the measurement to allow user remarks or comments. For example, if I just drank 500 ml of water before weighing, I could put that in the comments to explain my spike in weight. 2. Under the Trends > Month view, allow a rotating function on the phone so the graph does not look so compressed. See attached. Overall, great value for money. Definitely recommended!",

My boyfriend has a profile on my app as well so he can track his weight. I don't even have to have the app open for the information to sync. Truly a smart scale. Recommend!",

Otherwise- it seemed like a fine scale.

      "text": "Good scale for the price. It's behavior will degrade strangely with low battery -- you need to replace the cheap batteries it comes with. The other nit is that it strives for consistency with its recent reading -- so e.g. if you weigh yourself, and then remove clothing and weigh yourself again, it will \"lie\" to deliver a consistent reading (if you then wait a few minutes, it'll give you its true reading). This also means that if you step onto the scale too quickly (thus 'bouncing' onto the scale with extra weight), the reading will initially show as too high. You need to gingerly step onto it to get your correct weight.",

Seems pretty on-par with my gym scale, which is the \"more professional\" kind. I can't really speak to the body fat and other readings. I think it uses a combination of weak bioelectrical impedance and probably statistical height weight and BMI info. I know that more sophisticated BIA scales even have a margin of error so that doesn't really bother me. What I really love is that this scale and app syncs with my Noom app, which requires me to weigh in daily. Super convenient!",
