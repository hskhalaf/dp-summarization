The stamp pad that came with it was good for almost a year of pretty heavy use (close to 15,000 stamps before replacement). Each replacement pad has lasted less and less time. First one was about six months, second one about three months, last one about 2-3 weeks. At that rate, it is almost cheaper to buy a new stamper versus the replacement pads. The stamper itself does have some issues if it is not on a completely flat surface--even a few sheets of paper halfway under what you're stamping can give a partial stamp. For the price, it is worth the other minor issues.",

I absolutely do not believe it is worth $46.99 for 2. That is ridiculous.",
