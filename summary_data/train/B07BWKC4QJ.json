Major discomforts she experiences are hot flashes and a very itchy, sensitive scalp even after the hair loss. This product helps with both of those. I purchased the longer towel so that she could easily wrap it on her head as if it were a scarf. She loves it. And I am so happy it is bringing her the relief that she needs.",

Even if the cooling effect didn't work (but it does and its cool! *pun intended*) I'd still want to use this as a face towel because it feels so lovely. I got the longer one and I'm glad I did. I can have this cover half of my head by letting it loop over my pony tail, hang down the back of my neck, and still have enough of the ends left to tuck under the chest-strap of my backpack to keep in place. Will be taking this to an Orlando vacation in September so hopefully, that'll help with the heat and humidity!",

      "text": "This towel is everything that everything said! It cools you off and keeps you cool for hours. However, I would highly recommend getting a larger size if you are buying for a male that is 5'10\" or taller. I purchased the Large thinking that it would be long enough to wrap around your neck and head and unfortunately, it will only wrap around your neck. I just ordered the XL, as that should provide the ability to do both simultaneously.",

I won't say she stole it, but she won't give it back. At the extreme temps I work in it only seems to work for maybe an hour before the effectiveness/benefit wears off. Snapping it 3 times every hour doesn't cut it. After a while all they do is soak up sweat. But they do cool me off considerably at first and I am doing manual labor while I am wearing it so keep that in mind.",
