      "text": "This runs on 24V, not 48V as is standard for POE. It will not work with typical 48V switches/routers/etc. That being said, once I tried using the included 24V adapter, it worked fine. you need to download the software to configure and manage it, but after that it worked just as intended. I was able to set up a guest wifi separate from my private home wifi without issue. But again, it does not work at all with typical 48V equipment, you need to use the included POE injector. I was sort of bummed at that, but it's not a major issue.",

Once installed, setup is quite simple when using a PC; it's possible to setup via mobile device (ie your cell phone) but more cumbersome than using a laptop or desktop. It also broadcasts quite some distance. I don't recall how far the product description states it broadcasts the wireless signal, but I still pickup it's signal w/2 signal strength bars 300' away thru the sense woods in front of our house. When in the open I still have 1-2 bars of signal strength ~ 550'-600' from the device.",

However, the lan port of this device only supports a 100 MBPS, with that being the case, there is no way for it to support a 300 MBPS. You can't make wireless faster then the lan supplying it.
