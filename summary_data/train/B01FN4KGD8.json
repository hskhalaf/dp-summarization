Presto ! desk now level with the other table. Why did we still only give 3 stars?? because the risers are very light weight and the table would shift and slide when on them (even when right side up). Maybe a heavier table or desk would have held it all in place better? but I'm writing on our experience so others can take this into consideration.",

My couch left heavy grooves in them or I would return them as I had to by 2 sets (my couch has 5 legs). Don't waste your money.",

Only glitch was on my part -- forgot typical king size metal bed frames have the two additional supports in the middle, so had to order another set (of 4). I think I saw you could also order sets of 6, and probably could have saved a few dollars had I realized that is what I needed from the beginning. But otherwise, love the risers and would recommend them to others.",
