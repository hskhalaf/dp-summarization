I put it right on my hardwood floor with half of it on a rug and put my new mattress on top of it. It's virtually noiseless and a huge improvement over my noisy metal bed frame.

It's sturdy, attractive, and maneuverable with only one person. I have a basement room in an older house, and had no trouble fitting the collapsed mattress down the stairs and setting it up by myself. Basically, you simply unfold it and zip it up. The hardest part was probably getting it out of the box that it arrived in.",

This created a bed height that was too tall for my aging parents to get in and out of bed comfortably. This reduced the bed height by 5 inches.

I had looked at another wood version that had to be assembled but this was 100% the better choice. I believe it took maybe 7 minutes to get it into the bed and the box discarded.",

Perfect for carrying upstairs and round tight corners even in cal king size. The metal frame inside feels strong and sturdy and my mattress sits on it perfectly. I highly recommend this product.",

My husband and I can feel the rods and it makes our mattress feel like it slopes on both sides like a bell-shaped curve. By the way, just purchased our mattress so I know it's not that.",
