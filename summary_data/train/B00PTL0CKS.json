      "text": "We tried another seat that was made of a non-cusioned plastic and our daughter was sliding all over the place. We really like the Graco Swivi Seat because of the cushion that is 1) much more comfortable, and 2) no sliding around. It's basically similar to a comfortable car seat. Clipping the child in-and-out is very easy as well. Cleaning I gave a slightly lower score because the table cover is pretty big and it would be hard or not even worth putting in the dishwasher, and we haven't reached the point of washing the cushion but I'm assuming it would be more difficult than just having plastic (a trade- off we're more than willing to accept).",

      "text": "We are loving this high chair seat! My 7 month old has some developmental delays making it difficult for him to sit up on his own and the extra cushioning gives him the support that he needs to sit up in the chair. You can tell that he feels so cool and grown up and happy when he gets to sit in his big boy chair! I also like that the tray is nice and big. The seat is easy to recline and to swivel.",

My son fits securely in the seat and the tilting ability is nice.",
