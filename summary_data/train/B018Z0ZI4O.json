      "text": "I was a little nervous in purchasing this omelette maker because it was so inexpensive but boy, I really love it!! I have told many people about it. Very easy to use and quick. I wish they would have put better instructions in the box but I figured out by trial and error how long each omelette takes to cook. I just quickly chop up some green pepper, mushrooms, tomatoes, onions, throw in cheese and mix them with 3 eggs. That is perfect for making 2 nice size omelettes. Even though it states you don't have to use PAM each time, I do and just spray a little on each side. I am very impressed.",

But for less than six dollars, I figured it was worth a shot. I just made my first omelettes and they turned out great! I used egg beaters and used the measurements on the carton to put a little less than two eggs in each compartment. I also added in some milk, cheese, and mushrooms. I closed the lid and about seven minutes later I had perfectly cooked omelettes. Pretty good for a first try!",

Easy cleanup, they each got one for a Christmas gift, and I've kept one. Great for just me and my hubbie also. Good size omelet. Highly recommended",

We used it about every Sunday up until the beginning of April when we went to plug it in and it wouldn't turn on. Its a reasonable price but do not expect it last long or as an everyday use! We also bought a more expensive one before this one and it is still in great working order so if you are looking for something to last long term I would spend a little more to get a good one. If you are trying to save money then this one will work for you short term. I would not buy this again!",
