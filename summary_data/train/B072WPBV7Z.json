I learned along the way that the quality of my photos would be less using this Bolt. I downloaded my photos to my computer directly like I always have without the bolt. I would love to get my money back !",

This allows for the easy transfer or photos and videos from your Apple device.\niPhone and iPad Compatible - The Bolt is an easy way to extend storage space to your iPhone or iPad.
