Of my similar bouncers - this one is the easiest to use and attach, and average (or above) at doing the job. I think it's a great compromise - you can probably get a better diffuser (like those big white brand name plastic bulbous things) but you're going to pay many times more - it's up to you. I used this for tight spots, and stands/umbrellas when I have more room and time.",

      "text": "Fits securely on my Canon Speedlite 420EX. Allows me to use bounce flash lighting, rather than much harsher direct flash. I use only the white mat side. I'd be happier if the silver side, which I'll never use, was black just for general appearance. When not on the flash unit it's completely flat and slides easily into the side of my bag. The only reservation I have is that attaches to the flash with a wide elastic strap sewn onto the sides. If the strap stretches out I'll need to replace it. But it's cheap enough that won't be a problem unless it happens too soon.",
