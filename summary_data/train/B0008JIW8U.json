I kept my old Black & Decker though! And I'm glad I did because this Mr. Coffee stopped working the first week of August 2019. It hasn't ever been packed up & moved or otherwise jostled around either. Also now that I'm back to using my old model, which I'm really glad I stored in the basement, I'm like, \"Wow! The coffee is so much hotter!\" which of course equals better. Would not repurchase.",

Mr. Coffee suggests that you pour SLOWLY. Tried that! No joy! I had several old decanters so I used one of them and NO DRIP. There has to be a design or manufacturing flaw there.",

My preference was 3 heaping tablespoons for a 4-cup pot. Had this shipped to our vacation spot (along with the filters), bought local coffee, gave the pot away to one of the resident's in my Mother-in-Law's retirement home when we left. It was cheaper to go this route than to hit coffee shops for my 2-3 cups a day.",
