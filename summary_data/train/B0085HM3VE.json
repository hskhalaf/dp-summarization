The weight limit is 250 lbs and I tried it out when I needed to go down to the Quik Stop when my husband had the car. I weigh 280 lbs and the scooter hauls, I had to keep it at half speed lol. It charges faster than advertised but we also don't drain the battery completely. It's an awesome toy for teens and adults and I love the seat option, it's definitely a plus.",

This scooter only comes with a 90 day warranty, so you are on your own by the time the batteries fail. I am currently looking for a different brand of electric scooter to replace this one. I don't think I will by Razor brand again.",

Given the price point of these scooters, I would suggest avoiding them given our experience. The positive is that when they did/do work they are great fun for kids and adults alike, but their reliability is very poor. It would be nice if they had a smart charge, especially since the manual says they are only good for two hundred charges.",
