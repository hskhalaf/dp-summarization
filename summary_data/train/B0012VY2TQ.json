      "text": "Good quality so far, including double O-rings on fittings on each end of the hose, and good connection finishes. Everyone keeps calling these hoses either 1/4\" or 5/8\". Both are incorrect. The hose itself is 12 mm outside diameter (i.e. slightly larger than 7/16\"). But the fitting size is what's important - and on this hose the outer screw-on part of the fitting is 22 mm, and the inner \"nipple\" is 14 mm outside diameter. This is exactly what you want for most consumer pressure washers. For example, this fits my Briggs and Stratton Elite Series 675 (2.3 gpm, 2550 psi) pressure washer the same as the original hose.",
