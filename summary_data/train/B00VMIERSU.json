Cons: The wood isn't exactly the color I expected, the baskets are horrible to put together (the black stripped off the pins when sliding into place), the instructions were basically one picture of it put together leaving you to guess how to get to that point, and the price dropped $50 the day after I bought it. Even with so many cons I am happy with my purchase. All the cons have to do with putting it together, but once together, I love it.",

The second one was packed the same, and had a small bit of damage on one of the shelves, but we were able to put it on the bottom and in the back, so you can't see it at all. Overall, I'm very pleased with the color and construction, and it looks great in my dining room with my coffee stuff on it.",

What's not clear when you're ordering (and what was a surprise to me) is that the metal has red specks throughout. While not a deal breaker for me, it could certainly be somewhat of a deterrent to others.",

Wheels are wobbly but I\u2019m not driving it around. 2/3 of the baskets didn\u2019t latch fully due to poor workmanship of the wire; but baskets are expensive and these were included in the price. the black hardware is not completely opaque black which you can\u2019t even tell when it\u2019s built and set up.
