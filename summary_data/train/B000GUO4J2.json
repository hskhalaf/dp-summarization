It is easy to use and install. I have had some trouble with printing as the paper in the tray was not feeding properly. After working with it for a while I finally got it to work. I have not used it to print photos yet, but so far I am pleased.",

The photo's it's printed for me look fine to my non-professional eyes. So far, I'm very happy with this printer as opposed to the utter frustration I experienced very quickly with my prior HP all-in-one. I had received the HP for free when I'd purchased my Macbook, and I had nothing but problems. However, this Canon has so far not given me a single problem, and the cost of replacement cartridges seems very reasonable. I recommend this printer for anybody needing a simple photo printer for low volume use.",

    "description": "Want to print great photos, yet keep things simple? This is the perfect machine. Its patented print head technology and six ink colors produce beautiful, long-lasting photos with vivid color and detail. Plus, you can print photos directly from compatible memory cards and digital cameras - with automatic adjustments for face brightening and red-eye, as needed -- and even from Bluetooth devices using our optional adapter.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nAmazon.com Product Description The Canon PIXMA iP6310D Photo Inkjet Printer is an extremely user friendly, efficient printer designed to meet all your photo printing needs in one compact, stylish unit. This printer lets you print photos directly from compatible memory cards and digital cameras -- with automatic adjustments for face brightening and red-eye -- and even from Bluetooth devices using the optional adapter. \n\n\n\nThe PIXMA iP6310D Photo Inkjet Printer is an extremely user-friendly, efficient printer designed to meet all your printing needs in one compact, stylish unit. View larger. \n\nThis printer makes it easy to print and share digital photos at home. \n\nWhatever your needs, the single function iP6310D gives you more choices, more features and a better value. In addition, this printer features a unique cutting edge design that is very much in line with today's tastes and styles. It also fits comfortably on a desktop and adds a sleek and stylish element to any decor. There's no need to waste time and money finding somewhere to print your photos. With the iP6310D you can immediately print and enjoy images in the comfort of your own home. Convenience and Versatility\nThe iP6310D is a six-color photo printer that features Canon's ChromaLife100 ink system. Convenient and versatile, the iP31D supports a number of direct photo printing capabilities including select memory cards, digital cameras, DV camcorders, camera phones and other PictBridge ready devices. It also offers a maximum of 4800 by 1200 dots per inch (dpi) resolution with microscopic ink droplets as small as two picoliters. In fact, it can create a borderless 4 x 6 inch photo lab quality print in approximately a minute, as well as other popular sizes, from wallet to 8.5 x 11 inch size prints. The iP6310D also delivers fast print speeds of up to 60 seconds for 4 x 6 borderless photos and less than two minutes for 8 x 10 inch photos.\n\n ChromaLife100 Technology For Image Permanence\nThe iP6310D uses Canon's ChromaLife100 system, including FINE print head technology for great photo printing. When using select genuine Canon photo papers and inks, prints can resist fading for up to 100 years when stored in an archival quality photo album. The 100-year-lifespan rivals that of many traditional film based photos, long considered by consumers to be the benchmark for image permanence. Prints produced on Canon Photo Paper Pro with ChromaLife100 inks also have an up to 10-year gas fastness when exposed to open air. In addition, ChromaLife100 prints, when created using Canon Photo Paper Pro or Photo Paper Plus Glossy, have up to a 30-year light fastness when displayed under glass.\n\n Launched globally by Canon in 1999, the Canon Full-photolithography Inkjet Nozzle Engineering (FINE) advanced print head technology is one of the keys to the impressive speed and high photo quality in the iP6310D. FINE technology uses a ground-breaking high-performance, multi-nozzle print engine that ejects consistent and microscopic ink droplets. The results are high-resolution photos with great detail and clarity in less time. The iP6310D is the ideal printer when you want to print great photos, but still keep things simple.\n\n The iP6310D comes with a one-year limited warranty.\n\n \nWhat's in the Box\nPixma iP6310D photo printer, cartridges (CL-41 color, CL-52 photo), power cord, easy setup instructions, document kit (setup instructions and user's guide CD-ROM, quick start guide, registration card, and cross sell sheet).",
