Big hosannas, this is--assuming you are not looking to lay down a lot saturated ink--great for double sided printing. The results on quick print are good, also. It's a good value with a great result.",

Consequently, EVERY sheet I tried to print with it got jammed in my printer. I know it isn't the printer because I had a few sheets left from the previous pack and they printed just fine. Fortunately, Amazon was kind enough to do a refund. I ordered a ream of 24# paper, same HP brand and so far so good.",

However, if the paper is on a table or has a darker background behind it, this really isn't a big deal. I would use this paper mostly for things I want to print for myself or items that don't need to be double-sided. If I was going to print something to give to someone else, I'd probably just print one side per page.",

So far this paper doesn't do anything of those things - it provides nice clean prints and I have no reason to complain.",
