The fleece is soft, the stitching appears to be quality, and it is very roomy. My only disappointment was the overpowering chemical smell that came with the insert. I washed with free & clear detergent, baking soda, and vinegar in our washing machine for a normal length wash. It still had a very strong scent. I am going to keep washing it until I can get the scent out, as the insert itself and softness of the fleece is really nice.",

However this product when packaged for a backpacking trip was bigger than what my sleeping bag stuffed down to and was maybe a little less than twice the weight of my sleeping bag.",

A liner allows you to skip washing and thus extends the life of the sleeping bag. And this liner is well made, warm and soft, and it is totally worth buying it.",
