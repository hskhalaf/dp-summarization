She\u2019s like driving a Ferrari in a parade. Complete frustration. Anyway, I tried this out for the first time yesterday and she did great. Went a mile and half to get acclimated to it. She tried to pull one time when she wanted to chase geese but I barely felt it on the bike and she kept trucking. This product is the best thing I\u2019ve ever bought for my pup.

This leash holds the dog very close to the bike and it mounts under the seat, so the body weight of the rider adds more stability and control over the dog if they decide to see an animal and start chasing. Bike rides with my dog have now become a daily event and I tell all my friends and family who are interested in biking with their dog to buy this product. Amazing.",

You have to buy a harness to go with it, and unless you have a big dog, you need to buy something to make it lower.

Having the leash detach so easily from the bike is a very appreciated feature for me running both in tandem. Attaching and detaching is easy!!",

I've ran her on the bike before but she would pull and react at times. This beautiful little device let's her know where I expect her to run whereas the normal leash I feel like the boundaries aren't as defined. It's super sturdy and doesnt move when she does pull. I would highly recommend for people with high energy dogs who can't keep up with them on a run to invest in this.",

Installation was easy (just make sure to tighten the mounting point to your bike nice and snug or it can possibly move when your dog tugs or stops) and the leash has the option of 3 lengths so it accommodate various sized dogs. When not being used on the bike the leash can detach from the bicycle mount and doubles up as a short hand held leash which makes it convenient so that you don't have to carry a second leash around when you want to stop for a walk instead.",

I used it for the first time today and my dog is still getting used to it, but it is already worth every penny. its a super sturdy build and is really easy to use/ mount. my dog stays by my side and even when he tries to yank, the bike stays on the road with me on it. this is an excellent piece of equipment and will ensure that i can get some of that excess energy out of my woofer.",

I did have an issue with the lower attachment, but the company fixed it quickly and really made me happy I did buy this product from an American source.",
