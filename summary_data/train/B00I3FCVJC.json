      "text": "I am writing this after having used these jet ski covers for two months in coastal Delaware. They are even doing well during Tropical Storm Hermine. They have held up well in the wind and are doing a great job in protecting my two jet skis. The original jet ski covers finally bit the dust after 10 plus years and had not been waterproof for some time. The new covers are waterproof, but breathable and have kept the water out of the ski footwells. The elastic band at the bottom and the three cover straps have kept the covers firmly secured on the skis. I am very pleased.",

The last one by this brand we had for 6 years before it tore in the sun and rain and trailering. I expect this will do the same, but I went to wal mart and bought a pool noodle for 94 cents, and put the ends over the handlebars to keep them from stressing the cover. That's where the old one finally ripped.",

      "text": "I was buying covers at my local big box hardware store. $39 and I was lucky if they lasted one season. I ordered the Larger cover for a 3 place Sea Doo. My Jet ski is 130\" and this fit very nicely. It could over maybe another 6\". The materials seem much thicker and better constructed than the last cover. Nice that it has a 3 piece strap system as opposed to the 2 straps. Also, the straps are very long, which I like. I will update this after it has been thru one season.",

Leave my ski moored and so far -3mos- it does good job of protecting from sun and misc debris or bird droppings. The only issue for me is with straps provided to secure the cover for traveling. The 3 straps are stitched on at one end with a plastic buckle at the other which means you can't detach them. They are a pain when trying to put the cover on while moored and serve no purpose. Plastic buckles on BOTH ends would have been more practical. Would have given it 5 stars for value otherwise.",

The cover came apart on the seams near the straps and some of the material wore away. So I went back on the website to return the item but we are one day late for the 30 day return policy.

The straps are nice for the extra security, but are a real pain to get on an off while on a hoist. There is a decently tight bungee in the edges to help hold it secure, and the zip access at the front is great when you forget something in the dry box. Overall, great purchase.",
