      "text": "I love the large size for our family calendar. I also was frustrated with being unable to erase the dry erase a month later. Then, I discovered the solution - Soft Scrub! With it and a little water, everything comes completely off, and it's nice and clean and white for the next month's entries. (By the way, I use the all-purpose, bleach-free kind. I'm not sure how it would hold up to the bleach-containing kind. Who wants to breathe those fumes anyway?)",

It did not, howevet, come with tape or double sided tape to stick on the wall, I had to go buy Velcro strips to stick them on the wall.",

Every once in awhile we'll have a shadow after erasing a red or black that was there for a long time, but if we use a basic white board cleaner there's no shadowing left (can't remember what brand marker it was). We have mounted on the wall with Command's velcro mounting strips. Cannot comment on the markers that came with--gave them to the kids because I needed more colors.",
