      "text": "It is probably one of the best laptops you can get right now, but with this specific model, you need to take care to watch out for it overheating if you want it to last in the long run (when it is overheating the fan becomes quite loud). I assume this is because the surface pro 3 wasn't originally made with these types of specs but it still functions great even when it is overheating. Personally, if I could redo I would just buy the newest version so you won't have to worry about the overheat as much but otherwise, it works great.",

It ran for a few minutes then shut itself off again and I had to start the ritual all over again. It has worked incredibly for the past couple of weeks but beginning this past weekend it started acting crazy and has caused me to go crazy trying to get it to work again. Not sure this is what it's supposed to be like, but others tell me it's not and shouldn't be happening. Disappointed with the behavior of this tablet at this time.",

If your making a slow stroke the pen does jitter a little bit, but this is easily fixed by making longer stokes and erasing what isn't needed. And I still haven't figured out how to make pen sensitivity work in SAI, but it runs any program I put on it without difficulty or delay. I also found out Windows ink has a pretty great sketch mode that melds perfectly with this model, make sure sketching go by way faster.",

In that time, the user account has been corrupted three times, the computer has crashed several times, the browser cannot view certain websites (like google news, ABC<dot>com; basic stuff) without blowing up. Everything was updated and current. The computer has not been stable enough for me to bother installing any software (barring firefox and once OpenOffice) because it has been so unstable and erratic. The final kicker, this morning the operating system became fatally corrupted and is giving me a permanent BSOD, from looking up information with Microsoft's own browser, on their own cursed help page. I'm done with this nuisance and am sending it back.",

I thought that Microsoft would probably be a great brand to buy from when moving to PC, because I usually use a smooth Mac. However this experience has been the opposite of smooth. I got this thing out of the box and it won't even load my emails. Part of the left side of the touchscreen doesn't work and I can't seem to handle downloading my emails despite 8 GB of RAM. Don't buy this. Seriously just don't.",
