I have gone through many, many sunscreen, and the answer is this. Use this.",

I found myself trying to ration the sunscreen because we needed to apply so much due to all the time outdoors. Part way through the trip I broke down and bought a large bottle of titanium dioxide sunscreen that almost certainly had nano particles because I needed something I could slather in large quantities.",
