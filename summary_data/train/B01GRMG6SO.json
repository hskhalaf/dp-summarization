The shoe uses a semi elastic lacing system to allow for easy on and off, but still providing a secure fit. The lightweight mesh body of the shoe promotes proper air flow, but is durable enough to stand up to the wear and tear of regular runs. The sole offers an elastic response to impact to support the foot, but offers good traction to unsure sold footing. When you want a lightweight runner that moves with you, the Furylite II is the perfect choice.",
