Not only did it serve my stew nicely...it got into the corners/edges and cleaned the sides of the Dutch oven that I made it in.

      "OUR STRONG & STURDY LADLES ARE BUILT TO LAST - Flimsy nylon or plastic ladles can break or melt the first time you cook a large pot of thick soup for your family & can often be difficult to clean. What's the point of buying a ladle that will break or melt after a few months?",
      "OUR LADLES ARE ALMOST INDISTRUCTABLE UNDER NORMAL USE - Instead of weak nylon or plastic, our ladles are made of sturdy STAINLESS STEEL and food grade BPA FREE NON-STICK SILICONE.
