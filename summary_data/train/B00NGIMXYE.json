I also bought a Frigidaire cooktop from Amazon. Frigidaire refers you to the dealer and unfortunately the seller on Amazon will refer you to Frigidaire. So, you might think twice before purchasing through Amazon...great price but you will not have any product support.",

There are a few extra step for the timed bake, for instance if you want the oven to turn on and then off automatically you'll have to go through several steps to get it set up. But that wasn't enough for me to give it fewer than 5 stars. SUPER easy to clean!!",
