It\u2019s super gentle on my skin and it helped a lot with my rosacea! It doesn\u2019t dry the skin that other cleansers do. This is my second bottle. The only reason that I give 4 starts it\u2019s because the first bottle didn\u2019t last 1 month! I\u2019m trying to use the second one \u201cbetter\u201d to make it last longer. But it\u2019s priceless to me that my face isn\u2019t that red anymore :)",
