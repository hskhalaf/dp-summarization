He chose it because he wanted a Power Ranger toy and this one is a Megazord with all 5 Rangers. I guess he liked the way it looked compared the the other options. Batteries are included and it makes sounds and has a few phrases. The package arrived on time.",

I don't know if it is just ours or if it is awkwardly made or what, but we rarely get it open on the 1st, or 5th try. The little Power Rangers that come with it are cheaply made & are probably about 1 1/2 inches tall. Perfect size to fit in the compartments & perfect size to lose quickly or get eaten by a family pet, if left lying around because you can't get the daggum compartment open to put them back up!",
