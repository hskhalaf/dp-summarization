They have needed additional spices/seasons, or adjustments because the end result was too runny, etc. There is eating healthy and there is eating bland. Unfortunately, this is about as bland as one can get, which is too bad because living alone and working full-time I rely heavily on the crock-pot for cooking.",

It begins by explaining exactly what \u201cdash\u201d means, what to eat and what not to, to whom this diet is recommended and how it will help. I appreciate the fact the servings are clearly determined so you can understand how much of each ingredient to use. All the given recipes mention the calories, fats, fiber and protein intake in the end so you can easily know exactly what you\u2019re eating and control your diet.",

It has excellent recipe's with easy to follow instructions - but, it is also the only one that shows how much of each of the food groups you'll be using (daily allowance) with each recipe. Makes following the Dash Diet that much easier!! Love the book.",
