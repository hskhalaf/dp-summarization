However, the trimmer is definitely a trimmer rather than a shaver. In other words, it is unable to cleanly shave off hair completely, even when the guard is taken off the trimmer. If I want to be completely bare around the bikini, that\u2019s not possible with this trimmer. Also, the trimmer heats up easily, which doesn\u2019t bother me (it\u2019s just warm, it doesn\u2019t get unbearably hot), it\u2019s just something I noticed that was a little abnormal.",

Quiet, swiftly gets the job done, and absolutely won\u2019t cut the skin unlike the previous trimmer I had used. It also gets a wildly close shave if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for.

I feel it is a safety hazard.",

I get really low without actually pulling/touching the roots, hence NO IRRITATION or bumps or new scars, or redness, or ANYTHING. Just a really neat trim.
