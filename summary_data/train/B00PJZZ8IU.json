Not sure if it is possible to adjust that. I am probably the only person that will be able to see that. Easy to install. Seems like good visibility although I haven't pulled my camper with them yet. Came with no paperwork, just a well packed box with mirrors. Went to the DEDC web page to look into the position issue, the same mirrors sell for almost $400 !! No instructions though. Youtube has lots of instruction on install.",

Shipping was fast and they take the time to make sure nothing will happen to the product while in transit, I think it took me longer to get them out of the box then it did to install. The only down fall is the right side mirror location it seems to be a little to close to the truck and have to adjust the glass way out, but after reading other reviews it seems to be a known problem so no point in sending back if its not going to be right a second time.",
