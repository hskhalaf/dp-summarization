Liquid collects without spilling over the side (like it might with a perfectly flat coaster), and they dry easily within a few hours. I've owned them for about a year, and despite constant use, they look like they've only been lightly used.",

However, there will still be the chance of small leaks onto your furniture because the rim height is, I think, too short. Surface tension of the rubber lets large blobs of water build up near the rim and sometimes spill onto your furniture, either by hitting the blobs with your glass or any vibrations. Unfortunately, in my experience, the water, as it accumulates, doesn't actually flow out and fill up all the area of the coaster which might alleviate these problems.",

They also catch any drips and condensation nicely. They're a flexible rubber so you could take them and rinse them under the sink easily. The side shown has the round bumps, but if you prefer the other side has thin rings in-case your cup has a hard time with the bumps. I have yet to have that issue though and we had everything from Starbucks cups to plastic bottles.",

Also you can't really expect to take a sip from your drink without having water dangling from the bottom.",

The bumpy texture on the top ensures it doesn't cling to sweaty drinks like a flat surface does. 3. They'll last a long time. Durable. 4. They're black so they blend into the background & don't attract attention. The ultimate coaster would be make of cork to evaporate mositure quickly, but you'd lose durability.

They are soft so they don't damage the furniture, They have raises dimples to hold the glass and still allow the water to drain preventing the suction when you lift your glass. They have a large enough lip to catch the moisture. Plus they blend in with my end tables. I definitely recommend this product.",

The actual thickness of the coaster is thin but the dimensional grooves keep glasses raised and any condensation collects between the grooves. I have these on glass tables and they don't stick nor do they slip around the table tops. The holder is a cheap and could have been made better - hence the 4 starts.",
