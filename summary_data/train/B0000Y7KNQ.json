May have neglected it, cut a lime or two without cleaning it right away, maybe hacked at a chicken bone like a bad boy (don't do that), but never tossed it in the dishwasher or let it bang around the sink or cut on plates with it. Still pretty and sharp. Haven't sent it out to be sharpened just yet (Shun does it free!) so will update it that's a nightmare.",

The D-shaped handle fits my large hand well and the knife has an excellent balance point. The bevel on the bolster makes for a comfortable grip in your hand with little fatigue during long prep sessions. The Damascus steel looks phenomenal.

We had been using Chefmate and other strange knives we picked up during college and this made them look like I was trying to cut stuff with a stick. It actually looks like I know what I am doing now. Chopping and mincing onions is a breeze. Slicing tomatoes is way better and it doesn't smoosh it.",
