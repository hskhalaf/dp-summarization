I'm not a DEET fan for various reasons, and I prefer Picaridin-based products compared to DEET (Sawyer's picaridin options are great BTW), but there are some situations where DEET is very handy, and this is the lotion to get, so I have a bottle just in case. 5 stars for the best DEET lotion you can buy.

I went back real quick to grab this, and after applying it, the mosquitos were no longer interested in us. We could see them, but they didn't bite us. What a SUPER product!!",

Now I know how valuable it is and would never leave home without it. Nothing else I've tried was nearly as effective.",

    "title": "Sawyer Products Ultra 30% DEET Insect Repellent Lotion",
    "description": "The non-greasy, odorless Ultra 30 Insect Repellent Lotion from Sawyer combines 30 percent DEET with a comfortable liposome base for up to 11 hours of protection against mosquitoes, ticks, flies, chiggers, fleas, and no-see-ums. It's comfortable for use in the backcountry or in the backyard.\n\nSimilar to the earlier generation of polymer-based controlled release systems, the Liposome envelops the active ingredient, DEET, and slowly time-releases it as needed, thereby extending the effectiveness of the repellent. Unlike polymers, however, liposomes are a natural compound more often used in cosmetics, which allows this formula to be comfortable to the skin, easier to wear, and practically odorless. Sawyer Ultra 30 is also non-staining, compatible with sunscreens, and sweat proof. It's available in an airline-friendly 3-ounce bottle, as well as a 4-ounce bottle.\n\nSince 1984, Sawyer Products has offered the best, most technologically advanced solutions for protection against sun, bugs, water, and injuries -- everything from first aid kits developed for wilderness to point-of-use water filters that filter contaminated water to levels cleaner than U.S. bottled water.",
