The left ear has developed a buzz that does not go away. tl;dr : Would not buy again. Do not recommend. If you are going to spend this kind of money the product should last more than 3 months...",

Jabra's QC must be awful or just non-existent if this is an ongoing issue with their headphones. I don't see how anyone in QC would allow such terrible static in an earbud to pass off as okay.",

Similar to Bragi's Audio Transparency (allowing you to hear surroundings when not playing music), Jabra does well with the HearThrough functionality. Not overly sensitive, the earbuds pick up just enough to hear outside sounds without blasting your eardrums.",

It was an interesting Tuesday to say the least! The sound quality was not too good, it sounded like a cat meowing into a soda can. Overall would recommend to a friend or relative with larger ear holes and poor hearing.",

The audio for calls is good on the Jabra user side, but the person on the other end, oddly, hears themselves In echo. This was tested across many different calls and conference methods, always with the same result of person on the other end of line hearing themselves in echo. The battery life has averaged around 3 hours 45 minutes before you have to put back in the case . You get two charges per full case charge.",

I called Jabra support and they never answer the phone, their support it is total trash. It is a real shame because they made such a great product. Obviously, I will never purchase from this brand ever again. So if you want to buy this product I really suggest you go to the stores and test them out. Do not order these online.",

      "text": "My earbuds broke after a couple of months for no reason - there was no sound from one of them and I called their customer support. They asked me to send mine in (which I did) to receive a new replacement. I have sent mine, but have not received ANYTHING in return after WEEKS (almost 2 months now). They say there is NO definite date they can estimate I will receive them... this is a joke!!! stay away from Jabra because of their terrible customer support. I have heard Apple or Sony are much better.",

I sent an email to customer support and without hesitation they gave me a prepaid shipping label to send them back with. They sent me a brand new pair, and aside from that one issue, i haven't had a single issue. These have the best fit out of any wireless earbud i have tried. They will feel big at first, but after a few days, you stop noticing they exist. the noise cancellation is perfect and the pass through sounds great. Sound quality is amazing, especially compared to Airpods. 10/10 would buy again.",
