      "text": "I bought this to complement the SSCS5's that I love. The highs are replicated well but the mid and low range suffer from the smaller 4\" woofers. They really should of matched the SSCS5's 5.25 inch woofers. I was watching Captain America: Civil War and noticed how all the voices of the male actors sounded hollow - similar to the sound of a cell phone's speakers. I've done listening tests on music and can notice the difference between the two pretty easily. I'm at a loss whether or not to keep these. I expected the speaker set to coordinate better but then again, it's hard to get high quality at this price range.",

I now have a 5.1 set of these Sony speakers and I have to say that at the price point I am totally satisfied.
