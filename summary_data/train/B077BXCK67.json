The platform could be a trip hazard, whether stepping on it, or over it, to get in or out of the pool. Correctly assembled and tightened, the ladder still shakes and wobbles when climbing, as others have stated. The shorter Intex ladder that came with the pool, feels much safer, in my opinion. I would not recommend this one.",

Mine feels very solid, no wobbling when you're on the top rung. The little platform at the top is nice just for sitting. I'm very pleased with this little ladder.. I'd happily recommend.",
