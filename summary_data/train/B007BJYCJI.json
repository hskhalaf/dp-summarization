They claim the flow was too little, I turned it up, then the flow was too much I turned it down and got nothing but a $400. electric bill and a lot of false concern on how if they send me another pool heater, the same thing might happen. Tech support is useless. Explained how it heats slowly. This is for a hot tub. What heats a hot tub with cool water? Since it's seasonal and I bought it at the end of the season I doubt I'll get my $600 back. I'm furious.",

Make sure to use 1-1/4 conduit minimum since lines will give off some heat. i HAVE A 13,000 GALLON POOL and it took 2 days to get it from 68 to 83 degrees. the price is so inexpensive on the unit I installed unions so i can do an easy swap out in a few years since I have it outdoors. PROS: compact, inexpensive unit CONS: Internal plumbing a Bit noisy, adjustment knob is cheap plastic",
