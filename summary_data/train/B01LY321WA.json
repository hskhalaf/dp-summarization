Recently noticed one of the rubber leg fasteners had cracked and fell off as I moved the table. Called into customer support and within minutes someone answered and sent me out a replacement part.

The only thing that I'm not thrilled about is the lack of effort that Kreg put into having the table top flat when the two side leafs are put up into place. I had to shim the hinges to get it flat. Should have come complete and ready to use without having to fix it first.",
