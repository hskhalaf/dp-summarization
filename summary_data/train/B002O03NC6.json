Returned and not planning to get another turntable from Music Hall anymore. Overall, it is a solid turntable. But for the price you pay, they should be checking and sending the item as \"new\" and not a \"slightly used item\".",

    "description": "How you improve upon a Stereophile \"Recommended Component\" and The Absolute Sound \"Editors' Choice Award\" Winner? Ask Music Hall's Roy Hall. Roy quietly crafted an improved version of Music Hall's best-selling, brilliantly designed MMF-5 turntable. He spent many hours working out the fine details of the latest MMF-5.1 to offer an even a greater value for money than the MMF-5. Or, as he is fond of saying, \"a greater value for a little more money.\" Little energy was expended on the name, Roy admits. But, what's in a name, when the performance is this outstanding? The MMF-5.1 includes the advanced and ultra-rigid M7 tonearm, a dynamically balanced alloy platter, and a $ Goldring MM cartridge. Plus, lots of other extras, too. The MMF-5.1 boasts a unique proprietary two-plinth design with six rubber springs separating the bottom platform from the top. This extra level of isolation keeps motor and room vibration out of your music. The compliant feet, two-speed synchronous motor, switch, wiring, and electrical parts are located on the bottom plinth, while the critical sound reproducing components such as the bearing and arm, are mounted on the \"floating\" top platform. A new feature for the MMF-5.1 is a dynamically balanced alloy platter. The platter and felt mat sit on a high quality, stainless steel ball bearing sheathed in Teflon, providing extra damping control for fluid, noise-free operation. The bearing assembly comes pre-charged with lubricant. The effective length of the tonearm is 9 inches, which allows a very shallow tracking arc for reduced distortion. The net effect is transparent sound and excellent realism, especially on acoustic instruments.",
