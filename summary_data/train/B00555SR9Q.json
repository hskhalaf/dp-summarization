This is, by far, one of the top non-micro encapsulated products on the market. In fact, this is the chemical I choose to use on the exterior of my own homes. Sometimes I apply micro encapsulated products... but this is my \"go to\" product for a monthly application. Actually... you can get results far longer ham a month(depending on weather) with this product. For the price... this is a fantastic option! Just remember to change up you chemical active ingredients at times. You don't want your insects developing a resistance to any chemical.",

One of the best things about the container is the smaller dispenser off to the side, it's much better than purchasing a measuring cup for chemicals, or eyeballing it and hoping for the best.",
