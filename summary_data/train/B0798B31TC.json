Of course Customer Support was no help and tried blaming the problem on the State that I live in..... can you believe that! It's always hit or miss with Dyson products and for the money i'm not will to take that chance ever again so I'm done with all Dyson products. Buyer beware !!! updated 6/17/19 - new issues with this worthless thing. along with the filter light being on all the time, now it thinks it's clogged when app passages are completely clear. PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS JUNK !!!",

The vacuum stops working, forcing you to take the filter out and wash it, and I'm not talking about a mere rinse. If you don't clean it thoroughly for five minutes or so with a toothbrush it doesn't work. And, as an added bonus, it takes 24 hours \"in the sunlight\" to properly dry. Neither sunlight nor 24 hours is always available. I wish we'd invested in a more robust unit. It's like an expensive British sportscar. Fun for a while, but you have to constantly fix it, and it takes too much effort.",

Very easy to empty the dust container ... just one button to push. Also easy to remove the dust container and rotating sweeper brush for a deeper cleaning of the dust container and the sweeper brush. It was quick to charge. And the vacuum held its charge sufficiently long to clean the whole apartment ... about 1200 square feet of floor area. I would highly recommend this great Dyson product.",

Better than any car wash or industrial shop vac crap for factorys and such~ On maximum it's like a HURRICANE!

Unfortunately, the battery stopped charging after six months and I had to spend over $100 for a new one. Dyson said it wasn\u2019t covered under warranty even though I treated the vacuum like I was supposed to, cleaning the filter every month and storing it properly. The Dyson person I talked to told me that you\u2019re not supposed to leave the vacuum charging all the time, but I don\u2019t think that was in the manual. Overall, I\u2019m really disappointed and will definitely hesitate before spending this much money on another Dyson product again.",
