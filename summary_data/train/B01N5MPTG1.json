Their interfaces are dreadful, and more money has been spent on how they look than how they work. This unit has understated looks (nice, but not like a modern trainer), but the inside is what matters! Love this router! It's done everything it said it would, and more. I now have a great VPN back to my home NAS, it's fast, and the interface is seriously good. This unit is expensive, but buy well buy once! (It's cheaper than the many routers that don't work properly!)",

Use the media server with an external USB drive? Time for a factory reset. Configure parental controls in detail? Time for a factory reset.

Our site-to-site tunnels among three offices were completely unreliable, up one day, gone the next, and the SSL VPN service is similarly frustrating. I must have spent dozens of hours fiddling with settings to coax the thing to do its job, a total waste of time. We replaced these with PfSense routers, and the difference in reliability has been night and day. Find another option.",
