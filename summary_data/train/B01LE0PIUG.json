This burner takes forever just to boil water, Takes forever to heat up. I should have bought one for $20!!! this is not worth anything.. one of the worst products I have ever bought. I threw out the box assuming it would work and I would not need the box. This is DANGEROUS and not even effective. total waste. worst product i have ever bought.",

The loosely attached coil and its odd shape requires transporting it in its original box to protect it . That really increase the bulk. So I decided to get this ceramic infrared burner instead. It heats up much faster. They weight a little more but the flat hard surface means I can just put it in a plastic bag and tuck between clothing in my suitcase.",

This could be dangerous in the following example; 1) turn on to hi and leave it hi for a few minutes, 2) turn down to medium (power light turns off) and you finish cooking. 3) Forget to turn knob to off and walk away. In the previous scenario the burner is at the medium setting but the power light is off when you were done cooking. The light will eventually come on again and the burner will maintain medium heat but you might think it is off as you have already finished cooking and walked away.",

So, it\u2019s very versatile. The only area of improvement I could suggest would be in the area of temperature regulation. It takes a bit of experimentation and some experience with the unit to determine how best to achieve more subtle results. Say, for instance, you want to simmer something in a covered saucepan, and you don\u2019t want to it to boil over. It takes a while to find the exact correct setting to achieve that result. Overall, though, this unit is a great value.",
