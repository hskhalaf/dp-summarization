      "text": "Excellent line trimmer. Solidly built and the string lasts quite a while as it doesn't seem to break as often as my previous Flymo. Would recommend. However the line is a bit of an anomaly as it is difficult to find and buy online! It has to be sent for on a special order from Germany! A bit concerned about this but I did eventually find ONE seller online who had to order the string from Germany so bought several reels at one go just in case I could not find it again! Very odd that you can buy this item in this country but not the string!",

Removed it and then all was well as it dispatched all the long grass, weeds, nettles, thistles etc with ease.",

The reason it is unusable is line breakage. The longest I have used it for without a line break and having to reload the spool is c. 2 minutes. I have tried using a much thicker cord. No difference. Ditto removing the guard. Not good at all.",
