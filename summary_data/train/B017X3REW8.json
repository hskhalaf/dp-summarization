These babies are a tight fit, it took about a week of breaking them in in practice before my feet quit going numb. But even now they are a pain to get on. I normally wear a 13, but wish I would have tried the 14s. unfortunately I didn't have time to send these back. Other than that they are a decent shoe, they are no Rulon Gardners though, which is what I was replacing.",

He had the Cael 5.0 but the soles on these are better and he likes the traction on them. These shoes usually last 1-2 seasons, but Murphy's law always has them wear out mid season. My son went almost two seasons on his Cael 5.0 until they cracked and he almost wasn't allowed to wrestle. I recommend replacing shoes every year so they are broken in by the time season matches start.",

    "description": "When designing the new cael v7.0 wrestling shoe, ASICS opted for a little more revolution than an evolution. The newly designed upper offers a combination of ecsaine synthetic leather and air mesh for improved performance and breathability. In addition to the exceptional fit, the breathable single layer breathable tongue features a less bulky version of our integrated lace garage technology for ultimate comfort. The comfort story continues with the newly redesigned famous split sole outsole, providing fans of the shoe the comfort in knowing they can expect the same excellent wrestling-specific traction zones and flexibility that has made this series so popular. The signature shoe of undefeated four-time ncaa national champion and current penn state wrestling coach cael Sanderson.",
