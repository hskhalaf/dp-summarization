However, I decided to give it a fair chance, took the brush out and actually looked at it under a magnifying glass. When I saw how the bristles on the brush were arranged, I realized that it actually improved the functionality of the brush and assisted me in customizing the look I wanted for my lashes. Now I wouldn't want it any other way.",

It has two sections - one to apparently apply the primer, and the other, long bristles, to separate the lashes. But I am constantly poking myself in the eye, trying to get close enough to my lashes. And the plastic bristles do not hold enough primer to adequately brush onto my eyelashes. If I hadn't thrown out the box, I would definitely be returning it. Needless to say, I will not buy this product again.",

I don't have this problem with Smashbox primer. It took just one application of mascara to cover everything. It works very well for me.",
