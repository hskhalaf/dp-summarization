The added security is comforting while we travel with our 4'x6' trailer. Came with two keys, but without the keys would be hard to pick the lock. The price was right too. Just saying that it is difficult to find security products used to keep coupled trailer to car/truck secured. We considered heavy duty cable wrapped around the trailer axle and connected to the car axle, but that would require scrambling around on pavement. The Coocheer is much easier to install.",

      "text": "Easy to install, but has slop between holes. Would expect some but the locking holes need to be closer together. If your really concerned and have room in your rims, cut proof chain and cut proof lock are the best. Wrap chain on rear wheel over spring shackle, thru rim, lock behind tire. If vehicle is moved, will rip the entire rear end out of the vehicle. Much better this method on pick up trucks.",

They can definitely get it off with a sawzall or a sledge hammer, but that amount of noise will definitely get neighbors in the surrounding shops wondering what the hell is going on.",
