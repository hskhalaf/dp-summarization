To be fair, it does say how to train the \u201cbest dog ever\u201d and I think I\u2019d be happy with my dog just being moderately well trained. Some of the tips are a little bit tedious, and depending on how involved you are, may seem like overkill. Personally, I\u2019m not going to feed my dog by hand twice a day for weeks. But it generally gave us a good idea of how to get started when we adopted our rescue, and I think it\u2019s important to have an understanding of how your behavior and reactions will establish your dog\u2019s behavior.",
