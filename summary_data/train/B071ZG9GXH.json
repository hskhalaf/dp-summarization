      "text": "I wanted to create a small charge station on my dresser for all my i-things and sound devices. I stumbled onto the Cozoo headphone stand and thought I\u2019d give it a try. The design is simple; it has 3 USB ports and 2 power strip outlets. There is a large press button in the corner and a small light under the middle USB port that indicates off / on. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d use the 2 power outlets but I\u2019ve found myself connecting things there because it\u2019s convenient. The entire unit is pretty solid and won\u2019t tip over. Overall I\u2019m happy I found this. It works and looks great!",

In order to get it assembled you have to disassemble it further so that wires fit properly (especially if you're using it to charge an apple watch). The thing is that without instruction, you're literally guessing and hoping that parts your pull apart don't break and actually go back together. To the seller, include some instructions and your ratings would be higher. Once you figure it out and provide your own wires (again, seller, consider including some cables), the product works pretty nicely.",

Doesn't charge my phone very well, seems to send pulses of charge through when it's low on battery making it trigger the low battery notification over and over and over.
