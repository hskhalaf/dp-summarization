I treat them with no respect whatsoever, and can't really demand much from such an inexpensive option as a boat speaker, but so far they're earning a good reputation. Decent, not great, sound and apparently pretty robust construction!! A good value, they are. Update year three: Replaced original two speakers (not the Boss 3rd and 4th reviewed above) with the same Boss 6.5\" and everything's working out fine. Appreciate the fact that the mounting hardware is stainless steel for durability.",
