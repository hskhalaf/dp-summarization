      "text": "I have a box store bought bike, the schwinn trailway 700cc size,from a couple years ago. Whenever I went to adjust the brakes, the little screw that is supposed to adjust the springs tension did not seem to do anything at all. I finally gave up and bought this to replace it.... Works like a charm now! When I tighten/loosen the screws, they actually affect the springs! Took about 15 minutes to take the old off and put this one on, rear tire. Thinking about getting the front set next!",

Another review said it did not have an Allen screw on the adjuster. It's there, but for some reason it's threaded like a nut so it doesn't look like an Allen would fit, but it does.",

I would strongly advise using new brake cables if you're changing out what's on the bike to these. The braking action would probably be as smooth as silk that way. Proper adjustment is simple. There is one small screw on each brake arm. Tighten one and loosen the other (1/2 turn at a time) until they both pull and release equally. These V-brakes come with pads already installed so you don't have to order new ones. At the price, they can't be beat.",

The kit comes with everything you'll need (yes, it comes with the \"noodle\" and boot) and interfaced with my original brake cable and brake levers just fine. You will be happy with the quiet and strong braking after it's been installed!",

I hate to have to squeeze hand to brake and these are much more sensitive to pressure than most others. Shimano makes slightly better brakes for a little more money, e.g. the Deore v brakes. I have bought and installed more of these than any other. The super brakes of the recent past was the Avid serial 7 v brake, that you can still get on eBay for $60.00 a front and rear set!",

These Shimano brakes had better stopping power, are easier to fine tune (phillips screw for adjustments), and give proper clearance over my fenders. Down sides are that they don't look as cool as the low profile ones did and they also don't fit flush with my bike frame. Not certain if that's Shimano's fault or my frame-maker's, but doesn't seem to impact performance, purely aesthetic.",

The bike will be ridden by an adult on flat Florida improved trails, so I can't speak of its strength but it's more than enough for the intended purpose.
