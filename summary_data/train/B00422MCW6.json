Details: The right side has space for 4 cards, and the left side includes a removable leather ID/extra card holder that I comfortably have 5 cards inside of (seems like it could hold another 3 cards just fine). The cash slot is sturdy as well but does not have a zipper to close it. The biggest factor I chose this wallet for was the thickness as other $60 wallets I tried felt paper thin and as if they'd fall apart quickly over time.

For example, one internal pocket is at capacity with automobile owners and insurance paperwork. If you have a couple rewards cards or gift cards, there's not a lot of room for expansion. Also, be aware that, due to the construction of the wallet, if you fill all of the car pockets in the right sleeve, they will gradually fan out and put a little stress on the card closest to the front. Otherwise, this is an excellent wallet with a clean look and quality build.",
