      "text": "I was originally impressed with this stuffer on its first use. However, during the second use stuffing summer sausage into the casings with the largest stuffing tube provided, the threaded rod that provides the down pressure began to strip out. After half of the meat in the stuffing container was in the casing the stuffer seized up!! I had to stuff the rest of my batch by hand. Metal shavings from the rod were visible on the stuffing plate, and the threads are stripped half way to the top. It seems that the stuffer could not handle the down pressure even when using the largest stuffing tube....",

      "text": "Sounded like a good brand, however its far from it. It could just be that it cant handle the 17mm casing for snack sticks. It was VERY difficult to crank, the handle felt like it was gonna snap cause its just a cheap pop medal, medal shavings everywhere while cranking, and after about 7lbs of snack sticks the cheap welded bead that guides the screw shaft and keeps it from spinning broke off and will not screw downward now.(you can see in pic where there is no longer a guide in screw shaft) I wouldnt recommend this unless u just want a cheap machine for thicker casings.",

If they had made the base slightly wider or put suction cup feet on, it could be a great product. Cleaning is easy. crank mount wing screw is cheaply threaded with course threads, making it impossible to take wobble out of handle. Will be modifying with small motor. Bought this to make the job easier! Two people to stuff sausage is not what i had in mind!",

This stuffer is wonderful by comparison and requires very little physical effort. I've only stuffed maybe 40 lbs of sausage as yet, but it seems like it's going to be very durable over the years. There is only a very small amount of sausage left in the cannister when you've finished extruding, but enough to cook and taste test! Highly recommended!",

The problem is there is no way to lubricate the shaft that the crank turns. I tried to force silicon into the area to provide some lubrication. Eventually, it developed some slop and the gears began to jump. Then it all came apart and bent the frame. The small snack stick size casing is tough to push through. I think this would work fine for brat size casing for a long time. However - if you are trying to do smaller casing this unit will fail.",

Some may disagree but for the quality of this item it is a small price IMHO. BTW, there are complaints in the reviews about two things: no feet and the crank cannot be secured to the shaft and it falls off. Those were both addressed with mine. It has nice rubber feet and the crank has a thumb screw to secure it to the drive shaft. This is a nice unit and it appears that the manufacturer uses the reviews to better their product.",
