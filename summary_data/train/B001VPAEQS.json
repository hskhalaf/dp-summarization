I ordered this table and it went so much smoother. He was much calmer and I was able to take my time, causing less stress on both of us. It rotates so you aren\u2019t breaking your back trying to get at all of the angles. It is small and portable so it doesn\u2019t take up a lot of room and is easy to store away. I highly recommend it!",

He's a bit big for it, but still works fine. I got the table while visiting my Mom who has a Coton. He hates to be brushed, but when he saw my boy getting attention he willing let me put him on and get a test brush. It's been three days, and the both get excited when the table comes out. I've even been able to come out the Coton's gavmve - something he never let us do. Love this table!",

      "text": "Love to use it on my Maltese puppy. Only wished the arm was a little longer to be able to extent it higher. But I made it work. Took hook out, sawed a part off so it made it by 1\" to 1 1/2\" shorter and with the halter makes it just right for the puppy. It sure makes tasks much easier to blow dry and brush out the animal. Great object. Can only recommend it.",
