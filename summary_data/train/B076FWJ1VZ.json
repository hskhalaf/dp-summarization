Talk about durable, extremely well made, and the dark green is awesome for hiding stains better than light colored trays. Thing I give high praise for it the high back wall feature. It only makes sense to have it higher than the rest of the side walls to better support a weighted tablet. Lol, even my husband likes using it with his laptop for that feature. Look forward to this trip and surprising my boy !",

They took turns using it while the other was napping and it kept them both busy for the whole trip. Loved that it could hold snacks and sippy cup, crayons, and other craft supplies. Lots of pockets to hold all their stuff in place",
