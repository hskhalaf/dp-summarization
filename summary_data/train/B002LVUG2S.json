I like that a lot. Blades are EXTREMELY sharp so use great caution when cleaning. Oster makes good motors so I have a feeling it will stay in my kitchen for quite some time (occasionally buying a new cup for it)",

      "text": "I love my new Oster Mini food chopper! The reason for a 4 star rating: Use caution if blending liquids as they tend to foam up and flow out under the blade/whisk and into the motor housing. This happened to me. After letting it dry out for a few days, it's working fine. And the hot chocolate was delicious, although I will use a larger blender next time! So be careful! This could happen with any food processor, large or small. This is a pleasure to use! Chop an onion in seconds, make bread crumbs instantly, many other uses. I recommend it!",

    "description": "Make quick work of everyday food-prepping tasks in the kitchen with the help of this mini chopper. Equipped with a 150-watt motor, the efficient unit offers a 3-cup-capacity work bowl with a sharp S-shaped stainless-steel blade that chops, slices, dices, purees, and more. Two extra-large buttons make it easy to switch between low and high speed settings depending upon the consistency desired. Use the mini chopper for anything from chopping vegetables to layer onto a homemade pizza to pureeing garbanzo beans and garlic for a hummus spread. The Oster mini chopper's lid features a small opening that allows for safely adding water, olive oil, or other liquid while simultaneously processing for smooth results (no need to remove the lid). The unit also provides a handy whisk attachment for optimal whipping results, and a spatula that works well for scraping food off the sides of the work bowl. Housed in black with chromed accents, the mini chopper's cord tucks neatly away for compact storage, and dishwasher-safe parts make cleanup a snap.",
