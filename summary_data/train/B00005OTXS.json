I know it was set at the right setting so I can only assume that it developed stress fractures which finally caused it to fail. It sounded like a gun going off at close range and of course caused the marinade to spray all over the kitchen. If you're going to use this unit, and I do think it does a great job for its intended purpose, you should plan on replacing it every year or so.",

I simply re-sealed the container with remaining, (uncooked) drumsticks in the marinade and placed it back in the refrigerator. I think that vacuum marinating & sealing also reduces the rate at which marinated, refrigerated food gets spoiled ... although I don\u2019t have a way to measure this. Works well with my Foodsaver vacuum sealer with the \u201cAccessory/Marinate\u201d attachment. The bottom container is dishwasher-safe, hand-washing is recommended for the top-lid (probably because the gaskets could get damaged in a dishwasher).",

But that only allows you to put a minimum amount of food/marinade in at a time. I\u2019ve used it to marinade chicken and kalbi so far, and if I\u2019m trying to make enough for 2 people to have dinner and pack leftovers for lunch, it\u2019s safer to have to do two separate batches in the container.",

I like to use a tenderizer that pokes into the steak before adding the marinade. This seems to help draw in the flavor even more.

This really does work in a short time, although I still leave a full hour. The first time I used it, I wasn't sure if it was really vacuumed and sealed, thus I think I let some of the air out. The second time I knew better and the results were wonderful. I marinated chicken with salt brine, soy sauce, white wine vinegar, garlic, lemon pepper, thyme, rosemary and a couple fresh basil leaves. It was fabulous, meat juicy and so flavorful!",

      "text": "We just bought the latest Foodsaver model and I saw a port for this marinator and read that it cut marinating time down from hours to minutes. I've tried it twice and it does work. Many times I'm starting a recipe only to find the meat needs marinating for an hour to overnight. I think this works by creating a vacuum which pushes and circulates the marinade through the meat. I recommend buying it and using it with the Foodsaver.",
