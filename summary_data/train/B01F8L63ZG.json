I also like that it provides some mental stimulation. The only negative is that even with the little \u201cgrips\u201d on the bottom, it slides on the floor. I think we may put a rubber mat underneath to prevent that.",

Harvey now has plenty of time to eat his food in peace and then go lay on the couch even before Gus is half way through his meal. Highly recommended for very fast eaters.

My pupper has to tilt her head a certain ways to get into some spots even then she may need my assistance with the last few kernels.

Second advantage was that despite extensive training, he is wildly impatient while I fix his meals. Now his kibble is ready instantly and while he munches I can do the rest in a calm environment.
