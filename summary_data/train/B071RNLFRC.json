Granted, me and my mother in law were in the back seat with her, but she liked it for about 30m-1hr increments. Then she got bored and wanted to kick it off. I think as she gets a little older she'll appreciate it more. Note, you have to have a car seat that is not very reclined or it will not be level and crayons / whatnot will slide down next to your child, causing frustration. Especially if not back there with them. Overall great quality and adorable print!!! Love all the pockets.",

Tried it in wash on delicate cycle-the vinyl on front tore everywhere. So if you get one with the smell please dont try to clean it, now I cant even return. Everything else about product was perfect, now im looking for a similar one that will hopefully not have the smell.",

I like how now I don't have to pile toys, her snack cup, and worry about her sippy all falling while I'm driving. I also like the little bit of \"give\" it has in case of an accident. Easy to clean, too. Over all, out of all the products like this I definitely believe this was the best choice.",

      "text": "It fits well around my daughter's Safety First car seat and was easy to install. The only change I would make is instead of having the four small pockets on the sides, I would make them into two larger pockets. The way it's made now you can't really fit a lot into the side pockets. I was able to put a couple crayons in one and her sunglasses in another. Anything wider than a raisin box is a struggle to get in and out.",

It comes on all our car trips now. I can't recommend this product enough!",

They are a bit short but everything (crayons, markers, etc,) stay put. I got the pink one which is not obsessively pink but pleasant and cute. The strap that goes around the child is adjustable. This would make a good toddler gift.",
