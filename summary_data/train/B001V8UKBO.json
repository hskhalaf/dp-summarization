Right away I started looking for an easier solution, and purchased the Trailer-Aid based on the reviews. Lo and behold, we had a blowout on the second day of our trip home. The Trailer-Aid worked slicker than snot; it raised the flat tire enough to remove it and still had enough clearance to mount the inflated spare. Total time for the tire change was under 15 minutes. It definitely paid for itself already. Highly recommended!",
