So once I use the car lighter for connection, I really have a hard time inflating the boat. The nozzles have low quality and sometimes it slipes from the top of the air pump. Finally, note that even with the electric air pump, you still need to have the manual air pump. This does the 90% of the job and you have to use a manual pump for the last 10%. But I guess this is a common feature of all-electric air pump and not specific to this item.",

I had to hold the pump in my hand while inflating. Not the end of the world since the pump inflated my paddle board quickly... but would've been nice to have a longer car adapter cord.",
