Anyways, hopefully that\u2019s ok and doesn\u2019t mess up my watch, as it seems others have had the same problem. I will probably keep it for golf and stuff. The band is comfortable and secure and the size it adds is almost not noticeable surprisingly. I will update this review to 5 stars if I receive a replacement that doesn\u2019t have the same issue.",

My watch popped right in with no issues and I love the all black design with a little carbon fiber looking design on the sides.
