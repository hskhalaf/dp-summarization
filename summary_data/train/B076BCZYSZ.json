The deeper drawer is big enough to hold my iReliev TENS/EMS device and my small eyeglass cleaner bottle. The two smaller drawers are great for nail files, clippers, etc. The mail slot holders on both sides are great for holding notepads and the electrode pads for my TENS/EMS unit. It's sturdy and nice looking, would buy again.",

Rubber feet are a plus. Recommended.",

The area under the shelf is a bit of wasted space so I bought one of these organizers to fill it in a bit and add more utility. I loved it so much I bought two more of the same wood finish but different arrangement styles to fill out the entire space under the shelf. They turned that section into the look of one of those old desks with all those little cubbyholes and different-sized drawers. Great look and utility!!",

If you're thinking of buying this item, I'd say make sure you look thoroughly before tearing all the packaging apart. It does appear high quality and the drawers slide nicely.",

The top drawer and deep drawer I've been using to store smaller items like erasers, whiteout, and flashcards. The sides are great for storing mail. Overall, I'm very pleased with this product.",
