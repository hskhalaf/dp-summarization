      "text": "I wanted a pair of training shoes that were light but provide good support to foot and arches. These are just job. I'm really pleased with the quality and value but I found that they do come up about half a size too small. I originally bought a size 10.5 UK (which is my usual size) but had to return them and go up to 11.0 UK. This improved the length of the shoe slightly and gave me a wider toe box so much more comfortable - especially for those that need a wider fitting. Arrived quickly and with free returns!",
