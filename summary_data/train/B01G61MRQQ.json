      "text": "I came across these on the off chance on another site, but ordered them from here since they were on sale. They are very comfortable sneakers from Sweden (check their site out) . I like the design and I like that you get a pair a leather laces to match the logo's color of you want to change the laces. Very nice sneakers and another alternative to wearing those overpriced Nikes (ugh!) I have a feeling that these will catch on just like the palladium boots did.",

I definitely love how they look and feel and the only negative remark is not with the shoes but with the fact it took me 15 years to buy more... Thanks!",
