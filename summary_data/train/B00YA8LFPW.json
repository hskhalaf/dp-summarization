It must be within the same foot or so of height, or else struggles to stay connected.

      "text": "I bought these after my Samsung U-Flex headset died. The Level has good quality sound, both mic and earbuds. They are comfortable and the battery life is good. I talk basically all day and these will last a good 8 hours uninterrupted. My main complaint is that, unlike the U-Flex, these do not automatically reconnect to my phone when I get back in range, and I have issues when trying to manually force a bluetooth reconnection. This makes these so frustrating that I do not recommend these at all.",

Now for the bad: This morning, as I was taking them off, the left leg broke off the headset. I'm so very disappointed. I've tried gluing the leg back on. It might work, but it doesn't feel very secure. Other than that, my only issue was the set slides back if I walk too fast.",

Overall was super displeased I gave them away to someone else and bought a different pair...I would not recommend buying these.",
