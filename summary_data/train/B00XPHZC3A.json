Only replaced it because he got sick and threw up all over it. This is the same exact model tent as that one but for some reason this version is more plastic-y material, to the touch and sound wise. Our original one was more tent like canvas material. Same pricing so not sure why. I will update my review once it gets good heavy use.",

I thought the high entrance would stop most of the litter from getting tracked through my house, and I was right! Not only has using this tent around the box solved that problem for me, the cats love to play through the screen window sides and dive at each other through them. Getting this was maybe my best idea of the year for cat innovation.",

We put all a lot of his toys in with all the balls so that the house stays neater and he has somewhere to \"hang out\" and play. The balls have been our entertainment for the past few months and my son is about to be one. I used 200 balls and that filled it enough for my little guy. I would recommend more to make it more like a ball pit. You have to buy the balls separately though. But I would definitely recommend this product for months, maybe years, of fun!",
