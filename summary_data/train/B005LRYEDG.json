The handle is hard to grip especially with wet hands. The four inch blade is just a little too long for my taste...you might like it. OVERALL: Good paring knife for the price. Like the blade geometry better than my Wusthof paring knives and much, much cheaper though the handle needs improvement,",

I realized how dull my other knife was even with my regular sharpening. Has a nice feel to the handle, not slippery; it is lightweight in your hand, and I do love it, my go-to knife for kitchen use. I had previously purchased a large butcher's knife by Victorinox and the sharpness has held up well. I would not hesitate to buy more of these.",

The handle is made of thin and rather slippery plastic, and while the description claims it to be \"Fibrox Inspired\", as an owner of a Victorinox knife with a Fibrox handle, I can safely say that they're taking some creative liberties with that one. If ergonomics are right up there in importance with blade quality, this isn't the knife for you, but if all you're looking for is a quality blade at a budget price, it's a great option.",

But try one of these and realize THIS is what an EXCELLENT knife SHOULD do! If you do a lot of food prep work like I do, you HAVE to try Victorinox. One word of warning: these are incredibly sharp and will slice right through a fingernail; luckily, it was a longer fingernail which resulted in a manicure rather than stitches. I bought a \"slicer holder\" right away.",

But once I used it I was sold. I j used it to bone the better part of a pork shoulder roast because my big go-to knife couldn't handle it. Why just tonight it sliced right through my thumb with hardly any resistance at all. The only thing it doesn't do as well is slice through tomato or pepper skin, because the blade is smooth, not serrated, so it can't grip the skin. But once I get it started, it's great.",

This one issue keeps the overall at a 4 and the maneuverability to a 3. But I will probably still purchase again when needed.",

These are perfectly priced to use for 1-1.5 years and when they dull, simply replace them. (Goes for every Victorinox knife I've had). And over the 12-18 months I use my knives a lot - cutting fruits, assisting in butchering, small knife work around the kitchen. This is amazing bang for your buck.",
