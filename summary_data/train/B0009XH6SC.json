Anyone who borrows it loves it as well and I honestly can\u2019t believe it\u2019s lasted me this long. I\u2019m ordering my second one now that this one has started to get just a little loose and doesn\u2019t clamp evenly when I\u2019m curling my hair, but that only started a month ago. Amazing price for a great quality. In fact I think I bought it for $20 before haha. Super recommend this straightener!",

This product is amazing and it works as well as a Chi. It doesn't pull your hair and it's so smooth and heats up fast! I also have always loved the auto shut off because I'm a ditz and Forget too often to turn it off! If I could give it 100 stars i would!!!",

However, with my sister's hair, her's is very thick and wavy and medium length. I straightened it and it was perfect. Next day, it wasn't as wavy anymore, which we were both very surprised about.

I don't even need to turn it very high for great results. I am very pleased! I have shoulder length fine hair, it works great. I was especially pleased with how well it worked on my bangs. Would buy again!",
