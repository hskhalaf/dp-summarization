For example if you step on it and it reads 182.5 - then you get off, wait a few seconds, get back on - it will \"load\" and hit the same exact number. So if you think you stepped on it wrong or something and you want a \"re-reading\" - you have to wait a few minutes so it doesn't remember the last reading. All else is top notch though - nice screen, quick read, no need to wait for anything, the weight comes on right away.",

I really like the simplicity to use it. Tap with your foot. When the zeros appear just step on the scale. Tge led numbers are big,bright and easy to read. A big plus for me. The base is stable and plenty of room to plant both feet firmly. I also liked there was already a battery installed. So far so good. Would recommend to potential buyer and a great price to.",
