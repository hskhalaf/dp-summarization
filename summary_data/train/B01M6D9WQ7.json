I gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried all sorts to no avail (including updating firmware); after a few days of extreme irritation I sent it back and replaced with a TP-Link Archer AX6000 which cost a little more but performs far better. Based on the reviews it clearly works very well for some but it didn't for me I'm afraid.",
