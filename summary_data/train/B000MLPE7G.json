One staple would blow clear through the plywood, while the very next one would stick 1/2\" above the surface. This happened over and over again. My compressor held constant PSI. I tried adjusting the staple gun depth setting and the compressor regulator with no luck. Returned this POS for a refund.",

The only one I ever used that I honestly liked better was a Grex, but this weighs half that and seems to drive as well. Longevity is the only remaining question now, and I am optimistic. Pros: Lightweight Remaining fasteners clearly visible (no cute window) Durable (survived a few drop tests already) Cons: None, really.",
