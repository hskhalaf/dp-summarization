      "text": "Really great quality hooks! The finish matches our other Moen fixtures and \"oil rubbed\" accessories perfectly. Plus, we were able to use these as towel hooks in tight corners of our walk-in shower where a normal towel rod was impractical, thanks to the secure mounting, and they've been working out great! Highly recommended!",

      "text": "These Moen Gilcrest Double Door hangers are excellent. They are heavy duty, mount easily, & look rich and old. (The Amazon seller limits each buyer's account to 4 maximum - not enough for a new house, but Home Depot's online store has them for the same price with free shipping to one of their stores.) Bottom line these are heavy metal, great oil rubbed bronze coloring, well made & easy to install - excellent quality, good price.",
