I've owned multiple Ecco shoes, but this is my first athletic type, and although it is listed as a sneaker, I can't see playing playing basketball in it because it does not have the cushy sole support like a Nike. This is more for causal wearing; however, that is up to the wearer. Overall, I like and would recommend it.",

I feel like these run about a half size (maybe a bit more) big but most Ecco buyers know that is the case, especially with the men's sneaks. The leather is more resistant than the comfort 7 and this doesn't have the ankle notch of the 7, which I prefer. Easier to lace and put on than the 7. Slightly stiffer leather but still ridiculously comfortable.",

After a couple weeks of active, daily use walking and cycling (on and off the job), I am deeply pleased with the versatile style, build quality and comfort. I have since recommended this brand and exact model to others. One caution in choosing this shoe is that they are sized unusually large, at least in translation to US sizing (where I range from men's 7 to 8), in the Ecco the EU size 39 I have is translated inside the shoe to a US 5.",
