So Ziwi Peak lamb is what the eat when I'm away. They don't love it, but they do eat it when they're hungry. The poops are a bit stinkier than with raw food but it's not soft and super stinky like kibble will cause. And best of all, I weigh them when I return and they don't lose or gain weight while they eat it. Expensive yes, but I already spend stupid money on these cuties so it doesn't bother me lol",

And 2 female cats eat Ziwi Air-Dried food, currently it's Mackerel-Lamb & Beef. I had a hard time switching one of them from Orijen, she is finicky. But all you have to do is to not give up. Just try offering them nothing but this food within 30-40 hrs. Trust me, they'll give up and soon they will not be able to get enough of this.
