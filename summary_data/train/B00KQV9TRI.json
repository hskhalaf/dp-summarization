Even \"be a pro\", one of the simplest mode, is rendered useless: no minor leagues, you start as the number one center on the team on your recruit year, the camera angles are limited, you can't skip when you're not playing.

EASHL was what I played about 90% of the time and had no idea it was not included in the game. Other standard features of the game are missing and will be released as an update in several months. Not cool. Wish I could return this but it was opened before I noticed everything missing.",
