I am motivated by data analysis and tracking to reach better understanding and transformation, but this is not for everyone.

Terrible first run experience and I returned it right away. The last thing I want to do when I first try a product is contact support just to get it to work.",

      "text": "The Withings Aura does not track sleep consistently. The sleep data I get from it is usually incorrect and I have no idea when or how to sync it with my phone (to actually get the data in a timely manner). As a result of the poor sleep tracking, it doesn't work as a smart alarm well (the Jawbone UP24 works much better at this sort of thing). Lastly, the Aura doesn't have all of the advertised functions available at launch and the Withings iPhone app is atrocious.",
