I have a soft baby blanket to use as a filler in the meantime but it was not what I was expecting. Major heads up! I do, though, love the contoured sides.",

The bottom not having adhesion isn\u2019t a problem for us because we just threw a piece of the rubbery drawer liner underneath it and it never moves unless we love it. Honestly, no need to spend $$$ on those expensive changing pads this does the same thing for much, much less.",

Needless to say it gets stuck in the little breathing holes and smells awful. It needs to be soaked in vinegar and scrub down to clean. So it doesn't get on the inside material just under the little breathing holes. WILL NOT buy again.",

I put the pad in the floor to give some cushion when I am changing my kiddo. I will have to say they tend to absorb diarrhea. I usually keep the pad covered with an old towel or baby blanket. Recently my guy had a nasty stomach bug. A few times the stool got onto the actual pad. It looked like it was adsorbed, so I chucked the pad and ordered a new one. Keeping a water proof pad under the cover is ideal.",

So the changing pad thing is good, at least for now, because he isn't able to roll while he is in it. We put one of those huge diaper pad / doggie sort of pad things over it for extra absorption.

I added small Velcro pads to the bottom of the changing pad to keep it from sliding around on the changing table. The Velcro doesn't interfere with changing the covers as needed. Some reviewers complained that it wasn't 100 per cent moisture proof. I use a small waterproof changing pad on top of the little cover that I made...no worries about staining the changing pad. I use a waterproof pad on his waterproof crib mattress as well. I'd rather wash the little pads than wash sheets or staining the changing pad or mattress.",

I wouldn't trust it to secure a wiggly child, but the sides definitely do help to keep small ones in place as diaper changes are in progress.

And \"IF\" (meaning WHEN--think of the purpose of the product) poop gets on the pad, it immediately gets into the holes, and won't come out. I wanted to just be able to wipe it off with a wipe, and call it good, but it doesn't work. The poop gets in the holes and stays there, even after fairly rough scrubbing. EW!",

Pros: Super inexpensive Plastic cover so it's easy to clean Lightweight Cons: The belt ripped off, because the plastic covering tears easily. Because the belt tore off, I was able to see the base is cardboard, and not heavy duty cardboard.",

      "text": "First time mom here and love this changing pad! We don\u2019t put a changing cover on the top because it\u2019s annoying to change when a speck of something gets on the fabric. It\u2019s firm yet soft enough to keep my baby safe yet comfortable. When my baby pees, the pad doesn\u2019t absorb the pee a lot. I do take a burp cloth and press into the pad to pick more liquid up though. My only con is that it\u2019s a bit tricky to screw into the wall if you don\u2019t one of those securing things for the top of the dresser. Once we got it screwed into the wall, it works great!",

This does not come with any cover- those you will need to buy- but is standard sizing and will fit on most changing tables and accommodate most covers. I found that it is stiff enough for the baby to stay in place, but comfy enough that it doesn't feel like they are laying on a bunch of rocks or just a board. Overall very happy with this! There is no need to spend a ton of money when this is available",

The fabric is kinda plastic-y feeling, so it doesn't absorb any grossness that might occur during diaper changes and it wipes clean. I like the safety strap feature for extra peace of mind when dealing with a wiggly baby. Mine didn't have a weird chemical smell at all, so not sure what the other reviewers are talking about there....maybe I just got lucky or they changed materials since then. Overall, I think it's a great value.",
