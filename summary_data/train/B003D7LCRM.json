The difference from out-of-package thickness and a month of use is quite dramatic and can be seen in the attached photos. My dog slept on the left side of the bed, and the right side remained dog-free due to the divider. There's a really noticable difference in thickness.",

That seems like a lot of hassle, so I'll probably be buying a new bed with a removable cover.",

This bed doesn't collect hair in that way. I'm a fan. It's also easier to vacuum as it doesn't get sucked into the machine.",

This pet bed is ideal for small dog breeds and cats weighing between 11-25 pounds. In neutral gray, these dog / cat beds will complement any home d\u00e9cor and provide your pet a cozy place to rest. All Ombr\u00e9 Swirl pet beds feature a \u201cno-slip\u201d surface on the bottom that\u2019s perfect for hardwood or tile floors. They are machine washable and dryer safe, and they are sized to fit inside most standard dog crates creating a comfortable and desired location for your dog or cat to relax. For best results, machine wash, reshape, and lie flat to dry. Please note that the Quiet Time Ombre Swirl pet bed is not ideal for excessive \u201cchewers\u201d or dogs with high separation anxiety. If your dog is an excessive chewer, we suggest keeping a chew toy with your pet when in the crate in hopes your dog will chew the toy and not the pet bed.
