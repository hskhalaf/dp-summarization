The installation kit sent with the cable was self explanatory and effective. My NE facing valley and gutter, which sees no sun for months, is now free and clear of ice and snow. Maybe the unhappy consumers forgot to power the cable or were expecting instant results. It is possible that they don't understand how the product is supposed to work.",

It isn't real hot so it takes a while to melt through thick snow in which it keeps the ice build up to a minimum. But all in all it's doing it's job. I will buy a longer cable next time. It doesn't reach as far as you think it will due to the wavy pattern that it must be laid.",

I average over 15 years in a cable installed on my home in Minnesota, but probably only run the cables less than 10 times a season when my roof and valleys have a concentration of wet, heavy snow and the potential of ice dams increases.",
