Every page has one full size coloring picture. There are 2 full pages of stickers too. The book is quite thick...I didn\u2019t realize it was going to have so many pages but that is definitely not a bad thing! I also love that the coloring pages are fairly gender neutral for the most part...nothing overly \u201cgirly\u201d or \u201cboyish\u201d. I would definitely recommend this product!",
