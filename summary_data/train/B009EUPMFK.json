A few days ago the on/off/tare button started to fail, and now it has failed completely, and the return window is only 30 days. I would have been better off buying a scale for 1/3 the cost of this one, and I recommend that you, dear reader, consider doing the same.",

Readings seemed stable, but were not tested with a calibrated weight. The majority of reviews were good, so I am still hopeful and ordered a second one - will see if it works.",

This scale eliminates the fuss and bother...put on a plate, hit the button to tare the scale to zero, add the meat portion to the weight I need. Remove that plate, put on a second, hit the button to tare, weigh, eat. Simple as that. And I can use it to weigh letters and my big old cat.",

Some of the other scales i looked into, their biggest problem was not big enough for mixing bowls and whatnot, this scale will hold the entire 2lb bread pan from the baking machine so that's great.

I will be doing more baking and I am sure it will prove its worth then as well. I would recommend this to every serious cook and/or dieter.",

The large based allows an easy scale reading even when the bowl or package weighed is large. I've been using the first one almost daily for over a year and there's no sign the batteries are weakening.",

Second the platform is the perfect size, can put a full size dinner plate on the scale and still easily read the weight. So far, I have not found a single thing I dislike about this scale.",

I used a large dinner plate to weigh some food and the display was not obstructed at all -- easy to set up (unwrap, insert the batteries that come with the scale, and you are ready to go) and easy to use. I would recommend this product and EatSmart -- great product and great service! The EatSmart Precision Elite Digital Kitchen Scale and MyFitnessPal.com are a great pair!",
