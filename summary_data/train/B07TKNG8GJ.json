The shoes are so well-constructed that there\u2019s no rubbing from inner seams and no stiff parts that don\u2019t flex with the feet.The leather is supple and so soft that you can wear the shoes without socks.\u00a0The sneakers have a modish look that doesn\u2019t look too casual, and the fit is just right. The footbeds are arch supportive and cushioned.",

        "A handful of individuals liked how easy it was to put the shoes on and take them off",
        "For a lot of testers, the width of the shoes is just right",

I bought my regular size 9 with my fingers crossed. The length is great and matches the length of my 9.5 star sneakers. I do wish these had more padding as midway through a day of shopping I was feeling the edge of every brick I walked on. Of course with the removable footbed I may try substituting something with more cushion. The side zipper makes these easy on and off. Overall they are stylish and I\u2019m pleased with my purchase.",

The side zipper also makes the shoe easier to put on and take off, compared to other high tops. I've received many compliments on them. The size was just right. I normally wear a size 7, and it fit like a dream in thinner merino socks.",

The zipper makes it possible to put on quickly and comfortably. I have 7 pair. Every color ever made! Taos is one of the BEST orthopedic shoes ever made.. they never need to be \u201cbroken in\u201d. They are a little pricey but the comfort is so worth it. True to size every time",
