The back is easily adjusted to fit his head comfortably. It\u2019s also very breathable with the netting around the head. It\u2019s perfect for hot days he just dunks the hat into the pool and wears it. The brim is a great size not to big but big enough it provides full face protection.",

I wish it had a bit of a wider brim, I still have to look downward to get the sun glare off my eyes. The chin strap is a lifesaver for windy days.",

Now, I have a huge dome (Last I remember hat size was about a 7 3/4 or so) and I am so surprised that the hat fits. Hell, I can even tighten it a bit more for a tighter fit! Definitely recommend this hat although it will get really tested next weekend.",

I may order another one in gray for hiking.",
