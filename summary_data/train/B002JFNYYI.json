All was well until the eejit I bought it for used it in an Alabama downpour and it got a thorough soaking. So, yeah, you'll be very happy with it unless you plan on trying to use it in a rainstorm - it won't come back from that. I'll probably buy one again, eventually, I'll just be wary of who gets to use it.",

You must use the detachable mic at all times. Other than that, I have been very satisfied with this product.",
