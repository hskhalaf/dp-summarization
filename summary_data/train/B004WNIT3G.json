The picture screen is tiny, which might be okay if the picture quality was at all decent. It is not. Grainy to the point of being unrecognizable. Super slow response time. The kids don't even really look at the pictures, they just like the idea of going around and snapping pictures while making the fun picture-taking noises. I could have purchased a much less expensive fake camera toy.",

The picture quality isn't the greatest, but the kids have a blast using the camera. The camera is super durable the entire casing is rubber, so it can hold up to being dropped on the ground many times. I would recommend this camera for kids 2-7! It makes a great gift!",

Unfortunately, she discovered how to delete them just as quickly--the erase button is bright red! I put a piece of tape over it, which stopped her from deleting all of her pictures. I don't like that a cord (not included) is necessary for transfer, and wish there were a less complicated way to transfer pictures. Alas, my daughter eventually dropped this and the images became blurry. Not quite kid-tough enough, I suppose.",

Almost every picture he has taken are a blurry swirl because he snaps the picture and moves along to take a picture of the next thing and ends up getting a picture seconds later. That doesn't seem like a long time, but it is. And try explaining to a little kid/toddler that he needs to WAIT before moving. I gave it three stars because he really does love playing with it and he'll eventually learn to stay still (hopefully).",

This is including photos taken by adults; I did take that into consideration before passing judgment. I haven't seen what the photos may look like once they've been downloaded/printed, but I was disappointed initially. The ease of use, though, was spot on for my budding photographers. They definitely had fun taking their pictures with it and the sound effects when turning it on/off, retrieving the photos, etc. were kid-friendly.",

So far so good with it as he hasn't dropped it yet but the rubber around it will definatley protect it from any damage. You can upload the photos to a computer but have to buy the cord seperatley as it don't come with it.",

He is an active kid who is constantly underfoot and everywhere he goes his camera comes along. Just watch out...most kids like my nephew lack judgment and whatever they encounter, including a sibling's diaper, are fair game for the camera!",

Needless to say he photographed everything he could lay his eyes on e first day that he got it :). You should bear in mind though that this is a real 'toy' camera. It actually takes photos which can be uploaded to a computer, but it is not the Canon Rebel - the quality photos are not crisp and clear but if you want a great camera for a child to enjoy that can be dropped without breaking, then this one would fit the bill.",
