I had no burning or tingling sensation like a lot of people mention. I woke up this morning with all of my little bumps reduced by almost 90%! I was shocked! My entire skin texture changed overnight! This will definitely be a holy grail product for me.",

However, one day after my evening shower I applied it and instantly felt a slight tingle, burning sensation. The next morning my face was a lot smoother and brighter. I was also using Palmer's Fade Cream and it seems as though it ( after about 2 weeks) allowed the blemishes to fade a whole lot faster than the usual period (6-8 weeks). I highly recommend this product if your skin is not very sensitive and you're able to handle mild discomfort to achieve better results. I'm on my third bottle so it's definitely worth it on my end.",
