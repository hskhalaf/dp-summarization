Also worked well for keeping croissants warm but not drying them out. You will need to get a short extension cord...I used large bright masking tape to attach the extension cord to the floor...because the appliance cord is impossibly short. (Thank you so much, OSHA, sarcastically.) A very good addition to party planning, and easy cleanup. I doubt you could run a catering business with it, but for home use it's wonderful.",
