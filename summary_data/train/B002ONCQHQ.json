When you buy these overshoes you need to put the toe part on first and really pull as much as you can to try and stretch it out so that it will cover the heel part of your shoe. My shoes have thick soles and did not fit. However, if the soles of the shoe were relatively thin, then it might have fit.",

Now that I've found a good fit, I like the overshoes very much. They seem sturdy and designed to provide very good protection.I definitely give them five stars for that! And I don't think that the size issue is peculiar to this brand, because I had some others that were a different brand, and had the same problem. Maybe it's me??",

Its not a deal breaker, but I would prefer the shoe to be 100% covered than have those little areas getting soaked. But for the price it's hard to beat.",

Given the lousy winter, and very wet Spring we experienced inChicago, it was the perfect way to save by dress shoes from rain, sleet and salt, and not have to deal with big bulky boots. I went with the 2XL size, to avoid having to squeeze into the overshoe, and make taking them off less of a chore. I generally wear a size 11.5, and they are a tad large, but still manage to stay on,without much slippage. If you wear a size 12, these would be perfect, otherwise i might recommend getting the XLs",
