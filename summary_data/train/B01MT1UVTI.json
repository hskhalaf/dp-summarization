I received 2x wedding, 4x welcome baby (which I think is different than a baby shower card but that's just me haha), 3x sympathy, 7x congratulations (6 general, 1 specifically for a graduate), 6x blank, 8x thank you, 16 birthday cards. So my set was missing two cards. Overall this was still a decent value for having cards ready to go when I need them.",

My feelings are the same, so I'm copying my review from the other pack: These are wonderful! I love the size of these cards; not too big and not too small! :) Also, the designs are nice, too. There are plenty to choose from and varying colors of similar designs; perfect for my taste! :) These were just a big hit with me all the way around! I have such a large family that this pack is saving me a LOT of money! Thank you so much!!",
