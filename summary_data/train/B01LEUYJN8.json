With two people camping, we only bought one, because the male camper insisted he was tough enough to not need one. However, while camping he kept the female camper up half the night moaning and groaning about being uncomfortable. The female camper gave the pad to him, and he promptly fell asleep. The female camper was uncomfortable and secretly plotted her partner's demise, but at least he was quiet, blissfully sleeping on her pad. They will invest in another one for the next go around. The first few times we unrolled it, we had to manually blow air into it, but it self inflates now.",

Deflating is easy and a lot less controversial than a football. This also comes with a carrying case that stores everything.

It definitely is built to last though with its silky, vinyl covering which is easy to clean and will not absorb water. It was very comfortable to sleep on all night in a tent in 40 degree weather. I highly recommend this sleeping pad if you're looking for one with a little more padding and comfort compared to others.",

Like 20 liters probably! It does self-inflate pretty good but geeze you can get way smaller pads that only take a minute or two to blow up. I lend this one out to my friends now but I'll stick with my lame thermarest, thanks!",

I bought a summer, super lightweight sleeping back, so I knew I needed a good pad to put under it. This pad was exactly what I needed. Open the air valve & unroll, and the padding inside inflates it. Then close the valve & you're ready to sleep on a half padding, half air bed. Collapsing is easy as well, even when you're on uneven ground. I'm really glad I bought this. It made the world of difference on my weekend trip and I highly recommend it.",

This was such a great Idea I wondered why I hadn't thought of it before. I'm ording som more straps for my tent, other sleeping pads, ground cloths, etc..",
