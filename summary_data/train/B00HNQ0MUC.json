Just don't let the words Antique White fool you into thinking this is an off white or vanilla type of color. The word Antique must refer to the style because it's a bright white. Not really what I wanted but it's now on the lamp and staying there, hopefully it will darken a little over time.",

This is the perfect shade to do just that. Had to use the old harp because my arthritis hands could not squeeze the strong, new one, but the fit is perfect, so no problem. The next owner of the older lampshade will have a nice, shiny new harp and we both will be happy. Will gladly do business with these sellers again.",
