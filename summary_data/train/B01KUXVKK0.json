The amplifier actually caused a couple of the stronger channel signals not to work. Additionally, a coax splitter can degrade the signal a bit. It is best to first test the antenna directly connected to one TV without any amplifier/splitter. Then start adding the additional components one at a time testing for best results. In my case, no amplifier was necessary even with a 3-way splitter. The amplifier actually disrupted the Fox channel signals. I ended up with 51 HD channels, including all main local/national broadcast channels...good luck!",

My internet/ cable company associate at their payment center had offered me complimentary cable wire before. So I asked. They gave me a little piece. WOW! I scanned for channels and now have a whole bunch! The signal is always strong and clear! I hope whoever stole my old one goes completely nuts trying to watch T>V> like I used to! Thx!",

It finally stopped working altogether, but I think because of a lightning hit -- can't blame the manufacturer for that.",
