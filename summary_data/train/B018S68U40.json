The head is really hard to move, and trying to do a balancing act while standing on the cutter itself in the grass and pulling up on the handle is a real trick. Secondly, the wire guide is pretty useless and will not remain in place, no matter where you put it. Still, overall this is a good product for the majority of the work I require.",

      "text": "The trimer unit itself is very good for light duty. The trimmer would get 5 stars on its now. The problem is the trimmer line spools are so small you run out of line very quickly. I only have about 8-10 minutes of trimming to do per mowing and I will sometimes run out of a full spool of line in 10 minutes (and I rarely press the feed button). Frustrating to have to re-spool line almost every time I use it. I went with electric over gas for the perceived low maintenance of the electric, but re-spooling every time is more frustrating than the difficulties posed by my gas trimmer.",

      "text": "It is a fine string trimmer, battery lasts long and there are two so one is always ready. The biggest drawback is that the little 2\" spool empties constantly, which means stopping work and sitting for 20 minutes to re-wind string onto it. The auto-feed button seems to have stopped working during the first use of the trimmer. Also, the wheels were not included in the box,so I emailed Worx and they are sending me a new wheel assembly, though its been a week and they're not here yet. My advice, find one with a full-sized spool that only needs to be changed every few weeks instead of every hour or so.",

      "text": "I am very pleased with the 20v version - it has plenty of power for my suburban needs. Having used weed whackers in the past to clear brush/heavy weeds on a country lot, I have an appreciation for why more power is a plus. After considering my current need (1/3 acre suburban lot), and the price difference for replacement batteries...I took a gamble that the 20v would be all I need. I just gave it a trip around the yard and I am very pleased, I took it through a couple of overgrown spots and it didn't have any trouble whacking everything down. Happy, happy, happy! No more extension cord!!",

Apparently, this is a common problem with the Toro so it found its' way into the bulk trash. If this edger continues to perform as it has thus far, I will be thrilled. I needed a light weight efficient edger for front and back lawn. I found it! I love this tool!",
