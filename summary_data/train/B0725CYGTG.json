Obviously I can't say if they'll keep my feet warm as there isn't any snow yet, but they are fur lined and they are BareTraps after all, so they most likely are very warm!",

However, the small amount of snow that had been on the toe of the boot changed the fabric slightly and the color ( on the black). Would recommend a water repellant spray.",
