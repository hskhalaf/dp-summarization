So many others' reviews mentioned issues with the fingerprint scanners, but the Verifi S6000 works perfect every time. This is what you want when you need to access your firearm(s) quickly. If you need your weapon immediately for whatever reason, you need a quality safe that opens every time without delay. It has plenty of room and is secure. With an eight year old child in the home i feel certain this product will definitely keep any curiosity at bay.",
