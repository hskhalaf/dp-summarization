I will never buy another one, as I write this sitting in a hot house waiting for an AC man to replace this junk. Is it worth the money, not a chance.

Love how they all sync up, are accessible from your smart phone, and remember your preferences. These are so easy to program. The only down side is that if you give others access to your account to see your nest cam, they now have access over the temperature of your entire home. This isn't so bad unless you have an older brother who enjoys messing with you.",

The problem is simple and devastating. The device only recognizes short WiFi passwords. Amazingly Tech Support has no idea how many characters is the max, but it's quite short given today's world of hacking. To be clear, if you have a long and complex WiFi password protecting your network, YOU ARE FORCED TO CHANGE IT to something short and relatively insecure to get this product to connect. You literally have to compromise the security of your entire WiFi network and everything attached to it. It's staggering.",
