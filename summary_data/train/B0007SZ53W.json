The old pair was still in good shape, aside from the sole tread which had, understandably, worn down so was a bit slippery in ice and snow. I was thrilled to be able to order an identical replacement! They fit well, a bit more snugly than old one, as they'd been slipped off an on for years. Great quality product, good warmth, arch support and keep feet dry. Perfect for days with rain or snow on hat doesn't pass the ankle.",

They also work functionally well as light hiking shoes for easy-moderate trail hiking or just going on a walk around town. They look great with almost anything, with their simple clean lines and yet are sturdy enough to offer the utility you need for everything from yard work to walking the track at a local gym. Give them a go. Best investment your feet will ever love you for.",

I wonder if they put the wrong label on them, saying it's a size 8 M and it's probably a 7. Although the problem was really that they were too tight, couldn't fit my foot in to tell how the length fit. Very disappointed since I always loved these shoes.",

So much so that it gave me an abrasion on my instep and swelling there from the tightness and the rubbing. I sent them back for a full refund and repurchased the shoes at a local store- and now I have a normal pair again. Beware buying them here!!",

So I returned them for a 7, which fits width-wise just as well, but the length is still just a bit too long and so my heel still slips a bit. I don't have narrow feet that I know of. Still, I like how they feel and the color is as shown, so I'm not going to return these pair.",
