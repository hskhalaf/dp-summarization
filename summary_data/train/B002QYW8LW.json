All other teething toys were too big to fit in her mouth (necklace beads, giraffe, Kiki the elephant, etc) the only thing that worked previously was a small rubber tipped spoon we got from the hospital at discharge. But the banana is perfect! Cornelius is slightly larger and will probably be good for when she is 6 months old (works now also but she likes the banana better). She's currently 5 months old and about 17-18 pounds. Banana and corn photos both attached for size comparison.",

I used this toothbrush before he even had teeth, on his gums to get him used to brushing and things being used inside his mouth. Now that he has one tooth coming in, I use a small baby toothbrush with bristles and he smiles and laughs anytime he sees the toothbrush coming and when I brush. Definitely recommend for early introduction to brushing, and for baby to play with. Once baby gets a tooth you will want to get a brush with actual bristles to get the plaque off the teeth.",

Great for soothing babies with initial teething discomfort-not recommended for babies to chew on if they have already popped teeth as the little rubber nubs could break off and pose a choking hazard.

Simply loop the pacifier end of the pacifier clip around the banana peel and you're good to go! My only dislike is that it easily attracts dirt, hair, fuzz...pretty much anything. Wash frequently with soap and water and let air dry.",

This is totally right one for teething babies!!!! So easy to hold and easy to put in mouth! If your little one is suffering from their teething, go for this one to ease their pain ;)",

Which, in all honesty doesn\u2019t really matter because you\u2019ll end up brushing their teeth for them anyways. But, it can help alleviate those pesky teething issues plaguing toddlers across the land. We picked it up \u2018cause it had totally radical reviews, and we wanted something for the little ones to bite on. After we\u2019ve had it for a few years, some of the bristles have come off. Or I should say have been bitten off by curious little ones. The other (non-bristly) end also has some little nubs on it. Presumably for additional gum stimulation.",
