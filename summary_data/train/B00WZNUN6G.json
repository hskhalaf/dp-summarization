Also having the possibility to use 8 trays at the same time makes it very unique. I am highly recommending this item over all the other options",

The cord is short so you'll need an extension cord if your table isn't close to the outlet. Love the color coded little pans so you don't eat off someone else. The cheese cooks perfectly in those pans and easily slides out! Overall, this was a great purchase, just wish the wooden spatulas were better quality.",

This can, I discovered when I received it. My only complaint, and it's minor, is the reversible grill is very lightweight. But it works great and cleans up nicely.
