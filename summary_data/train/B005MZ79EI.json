Follow the directions when you get it. The battery really does need to be charged when not in use for a while. The biggest con is that its a bit clumsy to lift ... but its not too bad. Overall, I highly recommend this machine.",

    "description": "The elite two tennis ball machine is one of Lobster Sports\u2019 best-selling products. The outstanding feature of the elite two is its triple oscillation function, which simulates match play by combining vertical and horizontal oscillation to throw balls throughout the entire court \u2013 left, right, short, and deep. The horizontal \"sweep\" allows for random ball throws to the forehand, backhand, and center positions in a random pattern. Vertical oscillation allows for balls to be thrown at random depths throughout the court. You can use either oscillation feature individually or both in combination. The elite two challenges tennis players of all levels and experience, helping to improve reaction time, overall fitness, foot speed and agility. This battery-operated tennis ball machine is a reliable hitting partner that launches all kinds of throws, including sky-high lobs, blistering speeds of 80 mph, both top and backspin, to take your training to new levels. The many features included on the elite two will help develop all strokes, taking practice beyond backhands and forehands. The elite\u2019s sleek hopper holds 150 balls and the long-lasting, high-capacity, rechargeable battery will supply 4 to 8 hours of court time. Included with the machine is Lobster\u2019s standard dual-voltage charger (100-240v) which has built-in trickle technology to ensure your battery will never overcharge. The charge time ranges from 12 - 24 hours depending on battery level. Additional power supply options including ac/dc are available from Lobster Sports. Built with 8 inch, all-terrain wheels, the elite can easily travel over any surface and onto the court. At 44 pounds, the compact design with inverting hopper and folding metal handle makes it easy to transport the machine in any vehicle as well as easy to store when not in use. Upright, the elite measures 29 x 43 x 15.5 inches. When folded down, it is 29 x 21 x 15.5 inches. Optional accessories including standard and smartphone remote control options, premium fast charger, external battery pack for extended playtime and storage cover are available. Lobster Sports has been making tennis ball machines since 1970 and stands by their products, which are protected by a two-year warranty. Engineered to last for many years and to withstand frequent use, Lobster ball machines, just like a car, can last for decades if properly maintained. The Lobster Sports elite two ball machine can be a tennis players life-long training partner that can significantly improve their game - which makes it an exceptional value.",
