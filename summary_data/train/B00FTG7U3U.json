Really appreciate the large backlit numbers and display screen, and my husband and I get a kick out of the talking caller ID announcing every call. March 2018- editing my previous review because the phone suddenly has so much static-y noise on the line I can't use it anymore. Base unit and both accessory handsets. Thought at first it was the phone line and even called out a tech, but when we plugged in a corded phone the line was clear as day. Very disappointed! Owned a V-tech that was much cheaper that lasted over 10 years- guess I'm going back to another brand.",

These are solid, have big clear buttons, sound quality is both adjustable and clear, even the digital answering machine has good clarity compared to many others I've owned.

It sounds like something a 2 year old might record. It's very robotic. The voice on the E5965C was very clear and much louder.

My only complaint is that the message feature is extremely sensitive compared to the previous model I had and records just about every single hang up.",

All considered, this was an ill-advised purchase. I miss my old phone but am now stuck with this inferior product.",

It is better at the mid-range but still not great We have trouble making calls, often we dial the number but the phone won't place the call. Sometimes we have to try 3 or 4 times and then place the phone back on the base and try again. I'm sorry I ever purchased these phones and have just replaced them with Panasonic phones",
