      "text": "Our dog recently became \"deaf\", probably due to old age. She doesn't hear what anyone is saying. I take her for a walk on a dirt road (i.e. not heavily traveled) without a leash everyday, and was concerned that if a car did come, she wouldn't hear it. So I tried this dog whistle at a high pitched frequency, and she can hear it! She has now learned when she hears the whistle to come. So, she really isn't totally deaf.",

While you can actually turn the screw, it doesn't stop anything. Its just a screw that you can turn. The user turns the adjustable sleeve to change pitch or frequency. Contrary to their instructions provided with the model 535. You can't lock the position of the sleeve. Unless someone can show or explain to me otherwise, I will be returning this back. Does anyone out there have experience with this that can help?",

    "description": "They say every dog will respond to this whistle with adjustable frequency to enable teaching of a variety of commands. Invented by Acme in 1935. The Modern, improved whistle is the perfect dog training whistle for Town or Country, close or distance work. Adjustable frequency range Tuned to your dog's hearing.|n||n|Many animals react differently to different whistles, each has different hearing abilities, but most animals hear quite clearly frequencies that defeat the human ear. The Acme Silent Dog Whistle produces ultra high frequencies in the range of 5800Hz. to 12400Hz. Used for training dolphins and killer whales at Sea World it is also famous for its effects on cats, horses, mice and even bats! Place your pet within the vicinity of your computer speakers and click on the small maroon button(on the top of this text). Yes, you can't hear very much, but how is your pet responding?|n||n|The whistle is effective up to two miles (3 Km) subject to weather|n|conditions, and the abilities of the dog and the trainer. \n\n HISTORY Up until the 1930s, dog whistles had been non-specialist whistles - almost anything that made a sound was used. But in 1935 the invention of the Acme Silent Dog Whistle, another world first, with it's highly tuned and adjustable frequency range (from 5400Hz. to 12800Hz) armed the world's dog trainers with what still remains their most effective way of communicating with their dogs.|n||n|Medium sized.
