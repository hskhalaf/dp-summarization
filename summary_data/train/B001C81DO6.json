It's fun to climb, but they really love sitting inside it. It was so effective that my kids that they have built a huge \"fort\" around it! Success!",

Have at least 2 people to put it together, more makes it easier. We had 3 people helping and it wasn't too bad but when tightening the bolts we did have to switch off a few times as to not get too wore out. As for the Dome itself, it is very well made, very tough product that will hold plenty of weight. I would recommend this Space Dome to anyone.",
