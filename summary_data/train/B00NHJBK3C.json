My old 10 watch case didn't have slots as widely spaced as this one and the watches would rub against each other no matter how you staggered them. This case allows you to put large watches next to each other if you stagger the cases at the top of the slot on one and the next one at the bottom of the slot. The drawer is good for cuff links, tie clips and pocket knives. I would buy another if I ran out of storage between this case and my 8 slot auto winder that has additional slots for 9 more quarts watches.",

Everything is as described. The bottom drawer had more room that I thought. I fit my wallet, keys, business cards, extra watch bands etc in the bigger boxes, and there is still room for more. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a fairly inexpensive way to store/display your watches. I cannot speak to the longevity of the item, as I just barely received mine today, but it appears that under normal use it will hold up just fine!",

The lock seems durable, though I'm not sure how secure the locking mechanism is. Seems relatively easy to break into, but I haven't tried and let's be honest - if you have a really expensive watch, you won't be storing it in something like this. The watch pads are very nice and soft. Pretty standard but they seem to be made well. The extra storage is fantastic for storing rings, earrings, cuff links, tie bars, you name it. The lining is super soft and the separators are a nice addition.",

The hinge on the side doesn't seem to stand up as tightly as I'd like but the top does not close on its own. It could also be a loose screw I haven't checked. The lock only locks the top portion but the cushions are high quality to hold watches. The bottom drawer has removal separators as shown in the picture. My bf loves it and has already put a watch in it along with some cufflinks and collar stays.",

      "text": "Looks great and is well constructed. The lid stays up by itself too which some of the other watch boxs I have had did not. One thing I didnt like, although not a huge deal, is that the watch spaces are a little thin. So if you have several large watches (approx 50mm and up) they may not go into slots next to each other without touching. Overall very happy with it and when I fill this one up I will be buying another one.",

It is larger that I actually needed, but would rather get larger than too small.The only reason I gave it 4 stars was that the base was bowed in making it hard to close the drawer. Since I bought it for the watch portion and that portion was what I needed and it does what I bought it for, would by again if needed.",

The only down fall is the little bottom compartment, it comes out completely and doesn\u2019t have anything to be attached to like a clothes drawer does . But overall very satisfied",
