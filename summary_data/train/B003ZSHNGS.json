After all these years, it is still a great little camera! It's light, convenient to carry, and takes great pictures. Over the years, I've used my camera phone more often just because I always have my phone. But the phone pictures quality pales in comparison to the Canon S95. I've actually forgotten just how good this camera is! Anyway, at the time of purchase, I paid around $230. One of the best investments ever.",

I traveled all over Europe with this and it handled the trip like a pro. Don't get sucked in by the other cameras with their \"400X ZOOM!!!\" Generally, it's just digital zoom which is the same as taking the picture and zooming in on it in paint. Plus, after a certain zoom, the picture distorts slightly. This one is made for function, not just to attract window shoppers.",

The camera was struck head-on with flying debris from the explosion. The debris was about a 30-40 pound item that became a flying projectile from several hundred feet away. The camera initially gave me the classic 'lens error.' When I got it home and attached it via HDMI to my TV, it powered down and has worked fine since then. I have to say, I truly didn't expect a camera like this to survive that kind of abuse. Didn't even scratch it.",

The S95 produces images of wonderful quality with good noise control (for a 1/1.7 sensor camera) all the way to ISO 2000. Operation of the menus and controls is very fast with little to no delay in selecting menu options. The customizable front control ring allows you to quickly change frequently used settings. Battery life could be better, but I'm getting a little more than the advertised 200 shots per charge, and the battery is small and light enough that it's easy to carry a couple of spares.",

Love the control ring and wealth of manual controls. Image quality is good. Biggest negative is that it is hard to hold - no natural place to put your hand. It's easy to leave my finger on top of the flash and block it from coming up. Control ring on the back does still move a little too easily since it tends to be under my thumb when holding the camera. And flash pictures are not the greatest. But I can live with the problems to get the low light capabilities.",

I like that the camera's texture makes it easy to hold, but also easy to pocket. There is not rubber or other material to catch on fabric. Glides in/out easily, but has a good grip. To quickly come up to speed on the camera's functionality, check out Alexander White's excellent S95 book.",

The low light and very low light images are EXCEPTIONAL. Pretty pleased. The only concern I have, about the camera in general, is that I believe the flash will have issues in the future (same comment about 230HS). I believe the reason for my worry is the design of the flash in the camera. Other than that, I am extremely pleased with S95.",

I thought the GPS would be useful for geotagging photos when I upload them to facebook, but I can rarely get a GPS signal, and when I have the GPS on the battery drains really fast.

We switched to the P mode and have made some adjustments to get the quality of pictures that we prefer. We also did some research to understand how to adjust the ISO. It has been a learning experience but overall we like this camera.",

I found this feature is extremely helpful with photographer like me because I used to combine them with photoshop and thats really time consuming. This camera's low light performance is also the best in its class. I have taken shots without flash and it comes out very clear and sharp with minimal noise.",

    "description": "One look at Canon's new PowerShot S95 will have you moving \"upgrade my digital camera\" to the top of your to-do list. The ultra-slim, ultra-intelligent S95 is loaded with all a serious photographer's must-haves, including a bright f/2.0 wide-angle lens and professional-style control ring for intuitive manual control.

If photography's your passion, now is the perfect time to step up to PowerShot S95.1-Year Canon U.S.A. Warranty.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nOne look at Canon's new PowerShot S95 will have you moving \"upgrade my digital camera\" to the top of your to-do list. The ultra-slim, ultra-intelligent S95 is loaded with all a serious photographer's must-haves, including a bright f/2.0 wide-angle lens and professional-style control ring for intuitive manual control. Canon's HS System is on board for spectacular performance and image quality in low light. \n\n\n\nAnd, new for a compact, the S95 incorporates Canon's Hybrid IS for blur-free shooting even close-up. You'll shoot stunning 720p HD video with stereo sound, then watch it immediately on your HDTV with the simple HDMI connection. If photography's your passion, now is the perfect time to step up to PowerShot S95. \n\nCanon PowerShot S95 Highlights \n\nCanon's HS System for improved low light performance and better image quality\nThe PowerShot S95 employs the Canon HS System by combining a powerful 10.0-megapixel CCD sensor and Canon's DIGIC 4 Image Processor. Thanks to this technological advancement, the S95 is dramatically more sensitive than cameras with identical megapixel counts, and delivers spectacular images with minimal noise. Increased sensitivity demands a higher ISO speed, and the PowerShot S95 delivers with a new maximum setting of ISO 12,800. Blur and camera shake are notably reduced for the ultimate in sharpness and clarity. \n\n\nShoot beautiful 720p HD video in stereo sound\nThe PowerShot S95 lets you record video in beautiful high definition (1280 x 720 pixels). The camera also makes it easy to enjoy HD videos (and still photos) on your HDTV with a mini-HDMI connector for direct connection to a high-definition TV monitor. You'll enjoy the HD experience with no degradation of image or audio in the signal, plus the ability to display up to 130 still images at once. \n\nControl ring for intuitive manual control\nFocus, Exposure, ISO, Step Zoom, or White Balance can now be adjusted more precisely than ever with the S95's control ring. It's even more intuitive and quicker than the usual 2-button control and the S95 lets you decide which function the ring will adjust. \n\nBright f/2.0 lens\nThe S95 sports an f/2.0 aperture, perfect for creating enticing portraits, by drawing attention to the face and blurring the background with its impressively shallow depth-of-field. The Macro setting lets you get even closer. The large aperture also does more. It lets you capture more nuances in low light shooting by using more of the available light. You'll be ready for anything with a lens aperture larger than even many professional sizes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanon's Hybrid IS to compensate for angular and shift camera shake during close-up shooting\n\n\nThe PowerShot S95 is one of the first compact cameras to be equipped with Canon's highly advanced Hybrid IS function, which corrects camera shake from two sources to deliver sharp, blur-free images even when you zoom in close to your subject. \n\n\n\nHybrid IS employs both an angular sensor and an accelerometer, enabling it to suppress both the blur caused by the angle of the camera and the \"shift blur\" that happens when your subject moves parallel to the camera, a problem that is especially noticeable at large zoom factors. \n\nWith the ability to produce clear, steady images in most situations and at any zoom length, the PowerShot S95 is the camera you'll want to take everywhere. \n\nFull range of shooting and recording modes\nThe PowerShot S95's RAW mode lets you shoot images without JPEG compression. It gives you clearer images and complete creative control in editing. RAW images are transferred directly to the computer where they can then be edited using image adjustment software or a processing application to adjust your images as you please. The camera can also be set to allow the simultaneous recording of both RAW and JPEG images while shooting. \n\nAlso, with 26 Shooting Modes including 18 Special Scene Modes, you're ready for whatever shot comes your way. \n\n3.8x optical zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer, plus a 28mm wide-angle lens\nThe PowerShot S95 features Canon's precision 28mm wide-angle 3.8x optical zoom lens that allows you to shoot most scenes from wide-angle to telephoto. It lets you capture more in every frame, so everyone fits in a family gathering shot. When it's time to take a closer look, the Canon Optical Image Stabilizer helps minimize camera shake and reveal almost every detail. \n\n\n\n\nWhat's in the Box\n\n * PowerShot S95 Camera body \n * Lithium-ion Battery Pack NB-6L \n * Battery Charger CB-2LY \n * Wrist Strap WS-DC9 \n * AV Cable AVC-DC400ST \n * USB Interface Cable IFC-400PCU \n * Digital Camera Solution CD-ROM",
