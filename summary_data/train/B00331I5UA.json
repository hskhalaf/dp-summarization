Make sure you take good care of them, because they will see you through some intense training! I'm usually a size 9.5 in regular shoes, but I got 9 here. They feel a bit tight around the ankles at first, but it's because you have to break them in. Believe me, it's better for them to be snug. Just make sure your toes aren't touching the front!",

THEY WILL NEED TO BE SHARPENED. The factory sharpening isn't very deep and I was sliding around with no grip. Upon first sharpening I suddenly found myself with edges and have been learning them since. Would recommend to anyone wanting to get into figure skating!",
