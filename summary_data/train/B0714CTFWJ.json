He is large, extremely slow rising, and smells like strawberries (albeit fake, sugary strawberries, but it's awesome nonetheless). As an anxious fidgeter it has been so helpful and stress relieving in so many situations. Yes, over time he is going to fade, crack, not rise as smoothly, etc., but that's to be expected with any product that takes repeated physical battery. My friends and family members mocked me relentlessly when I continued to show up with a fat, squishy panda in my purse every day. Now I have to hide him from them.",
