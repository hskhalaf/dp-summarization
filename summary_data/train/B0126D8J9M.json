At first i thought it would be hard to figure out but then I looked up videos on youtube and it was so simple to figure out. My son is only 2 weeks old and he seems to enjoy it. It keeps him calm and close to mom. I can't really compare it to other wraps since I've never used any but there is a huge price difference with the top brands and this one seems to do the trick just fine even though its a lot cheaper.",
