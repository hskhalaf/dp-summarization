      "text": "I was familiar with push mowers from many years ago so decided I would purchase this one. It seems to be well-made. It requires a minimal amount of time to put together. The grass catcher is not helpful. It just clips on the back of the mower and if it bumps on the ground, while mowing, it pops off. Eventually I just removed it. The only other issue to remember is this is a rotary blade and every twig will cause it to stop. This can be mitigated by raking the lawn before cutting it to remove the sticks and twigs.",

Also didn't come with any hardware to put together. So I found some bolts in my garage, that would work. Leaf blower works fine. Its ok to cut tall fescue grass, but definitely have to go over spots a couple times. But at least I don't have to deal with gas!",

Only think I would say is don't let your grass get too long. It will cut tall grass with no problems, but then you'll have to rake up the tall grass so it doesn't smother your yard. If you stay on top of it, no need to do that. Great mower!",

It's so quiet you can mow the grass at 10 PM without waking the neighbor. It's dirt cheap, provides a slight workout and it's kinda fun to use. Cons: The grass bag fills really fast so I stopped using it. I just blow most of the leaves or leave the clippings as \"fertilizer\". Your neighbors might be jealous.",

I just took it off and either rake or blow the cut grass. it cuts really well if you stay on top of it. if you let it grow a little too much, it does become more difficult, but overall it works great. just be careful of sticks in your yard if you have nearby trees or bushes. they get stuck easily and then you have to precariously get them out from the blades.",

The bag attaches extremely easy and the same way detaches itself at will.

I found the solution for it to be to manually rotate the blades in the other direction and that would fix the problem.",

It will take some practice learning to use the proper push pressure and push angle. The grass catcher can become detached when moving over an uneven surface or tall grass. Also, the blade will spin grass clippings over or past the catch net when pushed too fast, or during a breeze.
