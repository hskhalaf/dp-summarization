The bottom and steamer insert are well designed and impressive in appearance with sturdy handles. The top cover is a safety hazard. The top cover handle is to small and to close to the top for a person to get a good sturdy grip on the handle for removing the 10-inch diameter stainless steel top. During the seaming of vegetables, steam escapes horizontally around the top cover perimeter. The bottom of the Steamer Cookware is an excellent soup kettle.",

    "description": "Fill your kitchen with the delicious aroma of soups, stews, pasta and countless other delicious and healthy recipes when you cook with the Culina 5-Quart Steamer Pot. With an included stainless-steel perforated steamer insert, you can easily steam a variety of garden-fresh vegetables to make healthy, nutrient-rich meals for the entire family. A large 5-Quart capacity pot makes it easy to cook for the entire family, with handy measurement markings on the inside to ensure correct water levels. The encapsulated aluminum base allows for superior conductivity and even heat distribution, eliminating those annoying hotspots that are common with other cookware. The perforated, stainless-steel steamer basket has a large handle, making it easy to lift and remove from the pot. The lid (which is heavier than most brands) sits snug and secure, sealing in flavors, nutrients and moisture. Constructed from durable 18/10 stainless steel, the Steamer Pot includes cast loop handles that are securely riveted and stay cool to the touch, allowing you to safely carry. All edges are curved to safely pour hot liquids without spilling. All parts are dishwasher-safe, but you will probably prefer hand-washing (and immediate drying) to preserve the beautiful finish. With elegant design and superior construction, the Culina 5-Quart Steamer Cookware offers the same high quality as the other leading brands without paying extra for their logo. This sleek, versatile cookware is so durable that, with the proper care, it will give you years of dedicated use. This set makes a wonderful gift for the amateur and professional chef alike and comes with a lifetime warranty. We're so sure that you will love this cookware set that we offer a 100% Culina Satisfaction Guarantee.",
