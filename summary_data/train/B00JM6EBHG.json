The only annoying feature, and this, I believe, is more Amazon than Qardio, is that they either despatched the unit with flat batteries or its OLD stock",

Having this electronic unit provides daily assurance that your BP and intake of prescribed tablets is OK. The Qardio unit is easy to use and as it has a built in history of readings is very useful.",

Soon, the QARDIO batteries expired, annoying but I persevered. However, the QARDIO \u2018eats batteries\u2019, requiring 4 AAAs every 7 to 10 days. At that rate they will cost more than \u00a3100 a year! Soon the QARDIO was cutting out more often than not, needing resetting each time, (presumably as batteries expire).
