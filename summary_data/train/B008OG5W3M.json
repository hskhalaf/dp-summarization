I called Brother's tech support and three times, after much time spent on hold, I was told there was nothing wrong with the fax machine, that the problem was with my phone line. I knew this was bs, but I had finally had enough of getting the run around so went out and bought a different fax machine. Low and behold it worked, nothing wrong with the phone line or the connection. Don't waste your time with a Brother product!!! Oh brother, do they ever suck!",

The paper drawer is one of the features I like because of the capacity and the type of feed that is probably less likely to wear out as with our old machine. I highly recommend this device by Brother!",
