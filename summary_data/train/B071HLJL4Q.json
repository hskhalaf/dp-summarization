Check the pictures to see where I did that. I think it works pretty well if you have a similar situation.",

I may end up securing it better with longer screws and a washer. Overall, I recommend the product.",

The first one stood up for months so far to our boys' use with their nintendo switch goihng in and out of the dock without any sign of movement or long-term wear.
