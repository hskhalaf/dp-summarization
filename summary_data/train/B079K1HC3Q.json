It\u2019s easy to use, handset doesn\u2019t get lost and best of all, she can hear us. The large numbers are great. Mom has severe short term memory loss, so she won\u2019t be dialing out. Someone with better memory could use them easily. We had to get a longer cord to plug the phone into the jack. I highly recommend this phone.",

I bought this Home Intuition phone for $44.95 and an FC-1507 phone for $28.28 at the same time. I had them shipped to my mothers home and my brother installed them. I went out to her home today and i find both phones are identical and both labeled FC-1507. I knew they looked similar but I would have never guessed they were the same by reading the descriptions. Also my mother says she cant hear much better even with her hearing aids in.",

Maintenance director at her assisted living community took a look for me and said the problem was that a button on the phone was permanently smashed down and wouldn't release--i.e., he didn't see any way it would be fixable. To confirm his perception, he plugged in a different landline phone and it worked just fine. Am returning this phone and searching elsewhere. Maybe a replacement would work, but for this steep a price I expect quality control the first time out.",

The ringer is extremely loud even on low, but if you place a towel under the phone that will buffer the ring. The buttons are huge, but this was purchased for an elderly person so will wait to see if this works out. It would be better if the key pad was lit but it works and the red flashing light when there is an incoming call is a great bonus.",
