    "title": "Dramamine Motion Sickness Relief for Kids | Chewable Grape | 8 Count",
    "description": "Dramamine for Kids is the only medicated motion sickness relief product formulated just for children ages 2 12 from the #1 Pharmacist Recommended brand. It treats symptoms on the spot, preventing nausea, dizziness and vomiting. Dramamine for Kids has a safe, precise dose in a fun, chewable grape flavor and it comes in a convenient, portable travel case ideal for car rides, boat rides, and airplane trips! Always bring Dramamine with you! You don't want to be caught in the air, on the water, or on the road without Dramamine. Thirty three percent of all kids ages 2 12 suffer from motion sickness. Dramamine is the only leading brand to have developed a solution formulated specifically for children 2 years and older, not only preventing nausea, vomiting and dizziness but also treating symptoms on the spot. Here are some tips: 1. If your child is prone to motion sickness or if he/she unexpectedly begins to feel motion sick during a trip, tell him or her to look out at the horizon and focus on a non moving object. An older child might feel better sitting in the front seat, too. 2. Get fresh air. Sit outdoors with your child (on a boat), or open a window (in a car or bus) when possible. The fresh air helps distract from those oogly booglies. 3. The last thing a parent wants to hear from a child is, \u201cI\u2019m gonna be sick!\u201d This is why one of the most important items to pack when traveling with children is a bag or bucket. Be sure to keep it close at hand, too. It won\u2019t do you any good buried beneath a pile of suitcases in the trunk. 4. Ginger is a spice renowned for its ability to soothe an upset tummy. Pack a few ginger infused, low sugar candies in your day pack as a sweet distraction for your little one during your journey. 5. Use a distraction. Take your child\u2019s mind off the motion sickness by playing music (on headphones on a plane). Anything that requires too much thinking, like playing a game or reading books, probably will just make things worse. 6. Pack some protein. Avoid giving your child too many sugary treats, which can make them shaky. Don\u2019t overeat either. Instead, stick to small, protein packed snacks like a handful of nuts, a protein bar, or peanut butter crackers. Not only is Dramamine the most trusted over the counter treatment for motion sickness, it is the #1 Pharmacist Recommended brand to both prevent and treat the condition.",
