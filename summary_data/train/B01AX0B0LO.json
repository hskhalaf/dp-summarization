I would like the manufacturer to replace the shoes with new ones. I will reply with better feedback if I hear back from Amazon or the manufacturer. Seems pretty cheap this would occur when my footjoys are 12 years old and have held up wonderfully. Needed a new show and so far - no good. that's a lot of money for 2 rounds and see failure in the product.",

This is my first set of pumas and probably won't be my last. They run the same size as my dress shoes but fit big compared to my Mizuno running shoes. I am unsure how they work in really wet conditions. I am debating on buying a second pair just for backup purposes.",

I own Footjoy DNA\u2019s and a couple pairs of Adidas they were much more expensive and these were these were without a doubt the most comfortable pair I have ever worn. Very stable and surprisingly light for as sturdy as they are. Of course they look sleek much like my FJ DNA\u2019s but about $50 less. Will be getting another pair!",

I got these without trying them on at a local store based off of brand loyalty, and I struck a home run. They fit great, albeit just a tad wide. They have great thickness and good arch support (as someone who is flat footed, this is always a good thing!), and the front of the foot has a nice feature where there is plastic covering the toe for extra protection. Having traditional spikes, these shoes will require constant cleaning on the shoe cleaners around the course if you are playing after a rainfall.",
