It looks hand made. I am pretty sure it is made here in the US. I\u2019m thinking it was probably designed by a master carpenter/cabinet builder. They designed it so that when you assemble it, it will fit together tightly with mostly machine screws that go into threaded openings. It requires only a screwdriver and an Allen wrench. Highly recommended. Just make sure the long narrow dimensions are right for your purposes. 5-stars.",
