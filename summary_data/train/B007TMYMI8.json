      "verdict": "It is always a refreshing twist to trade canvas for an all-leather upper. It not only changes the aesthetics of the shoe, but it also makes it durable and easy to maintain. Much like the design of the Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Core Leather Hi, these sneakers are guaranteed to be versatile and timeless. With the signature elements of the retro version retained, it didn't shy away from the sneaker that we know is a classic.",
      "pros": [
        "Most of the commenters prefer the leather version of the Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Core Hi because it is much easier to maintain and clean",
        "Although a bit more expensive than the canvas version, several users feel that it is worth it as they last longer",
        "Numerous buyers prefer the stitched All-Star patch on this model as opposed to the printed logo on the classic Chucks",
        "According to many testers, these sneakers are versatile and can match different outfits and occasions- casual or formal",
        "Several claims that these instantly became their favorite pair",
        "Fans of the Chuck Taylor All Star Core Leather Hi keep on ordering replacement pairs as a reserve",
        "A high number of reviewers rave about the leather material as it is of good quality, genuine, and breaks in well",
        "A couple of users love the protection provided by the leather upper"

      "cons": [
        "Feedback among users of the Chuck Taylor All Star Core Leather Hi includes the sidewalls coming off and separating from the upper after a period of usage",
        "For people needing arch support, these sneakers are not recommended by several commenters",
        "Some of the owners are bothered that the tongue slips to the side"

Have brought this to Amazon's attention and a replacement is in the works. Will update with what is received. All in all, looks to be the same narrow shoe I remember from youth. My son will definitely need the half size larger than usual, per the mfg. website.",
