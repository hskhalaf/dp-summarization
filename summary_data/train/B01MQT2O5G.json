      "text": "This is a very nice looking monitor and on paper the specs are great for the price. There is also a lot to like, the brightness and constrast are very nice, the bezels are very thin and FreeSync 2 support is great. Unfortunately the panel seems to be too slow for 144 Hz which results in very noticeable ghosting/black smearing issues. Sometimes this manifests as a distracting flicker during abrupt quick movements such as scrolling a web page or moving the camera in a game. There is also a bit of backlight bleeding. It's noticeable when the room is dark, but it's not too bad and it wouldn't be a problem for me on its own.",
