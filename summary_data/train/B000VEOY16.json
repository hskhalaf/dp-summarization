It leaves your hair flexible and reworkable. You can use a little to add a bit of shine and tame down flyaways, or more for a bedhead look. Use sparingly at first, it's a finishing product, kind of like a pomade but thicker. Experiment to determine what's right for your look. It's my go-to product for my pixie cut. I've never been able to find anything else like it, so I hope they never stop making it!",

The scent is not intense and is not noticeable after grooming into the hair. My hair is quite grey and with a business cut, but this product does the trick in holding it in place and giving it a luster without a glossy look. Very nice product, which I've been using for a few years now. Buy it, you will like it.",
