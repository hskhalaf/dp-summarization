Sprayed a set of silver Land Rover wheels with three cans of color and one can of primer. Had about a half a can left over. Cleaned wheels with degreaser and lightly scuffed them. Lightly coat each wheel with VHT primer, two light coats of color and one final heavy coat to flow it all together. Now need new lugs nuts. Wheels turned out excellent for a half effort job. Best rattle can paint I ever used.",

The finish and durability of this paint cannot be matched. The best finish I have found with a rattle can. Always spray the most visible portion of the wheel last and if you can work fast enough to keep the entire surface wet you won\u2019t have any over spray issues to deal with. Claying the portions with over spray after drying will fix most if not all of any imperfections you find. I will buy again.",

      "text": "I purchased VHT sp148, sp183, and sp184 to paint the rims of my car flat black. I was a little bit hesitant because I didn't see as many reviews for VHT, which is why I'm writing this review- they came out great A couple hours and about 2 cans of each mentioned, and my rims came out just like I wanted. I have no experience with spray paint, but it was really easy to get a nice even shade. It's been about 2 months so far and I haven't noticed any chipping after all of the ice, mud, salt, and snow we've had. So, If you're thinking about painting your rims black I would definitely recommend the products I mentioned",

This unique product resists chipping, cracking and fading, while protecting the wheel surface from oxidation. Careful preparation is essential to insure proper adhesion. VHT wheel paint is part of a multi high performance coating system. The coating system products consist of primer, paint, and clear coat. VHT wheel paint dries to the touch in 30 minutes and completely over night. Complete application and instructions are also printed on each can.",
