Three waffles and I'm full. I would suggest to cook the waffles well where the middle isn't soggy is to wait until the light comes and put your batter in, then wait until 3 light cycles and viola tasty waffles.",

I would recommend it for a single or couple or someone with limited storage space, but if you have a family, you'd probably want a standard-size waffle maker that makes large waffles or several pull-apart waffles at once.",

My chaffles come out perfect and make the best buns for sandwiches! They're just the right size. It's great for making one or two sandwiches, but when I decided to make McGriddle-type chaffles for the whole family, it took a lot longer. I've heard there's a bigger version of the mini waffle maker that makes more than one, so I may be looking into getting one of those if I decide the whole family needs more chaffles! This waffle maker is definitely worth the money! I love it!!",

They take a little longer to cook since there is no temp setting but, that being said, once you figure out the right amount of batter to put in, RARELY does it make odd shaped waffles. The waffles are thicker than what you would normally get frozen, so if you are making waffles to freeze, I would suggest letting them cook for the exact amount of time when the light turns off. That way when you toast them, they won't be over cooked. It even has recipes in the back of the booklet. Def. worth the add-on price I paid. Super happy.",

      "text": "This thing is a game changer in the keto world. We make sweet and savory chaffles on a daily basis now because it's so easy. We will also make a batch ahead of time and freeze them (not really good with fruit ones). We make bacon, egg and cheese chaffles and throw an egg and some canadian bacon on them for breakfast sandwiches. It's super easy to clean with a non abrasive brush and wet paper towel. There is a hole on the bottom that if you use it daily you will need to clean with a toothpick or qtip because oil comes out of that. We have two of these because there are two of us in our household.",

Well, since we're all in quarantine, I've been doing some cleaning and I stumbled across my little waffle iron. I decided to finally give it a try and made a half dozen waffles, and I have to say, this thing worked great and cleaning wasn't difficult at all! Obvious tip: use the slightest bit of cooking oil spray (PAM) and the waffles come out perfectly every time!",

I made 4 waffles but was only able to eat two before I got full. Would highly recommend, it works great and it a great value.",

With a little spray of oil, the waffles come out without any issues. For those looking to purchase, make sure to clean it similar to a cast iron skillet. Just wipe with a little water for clean up. Avoid any abrasives as that will break down the teflon coating. Highly recommend this for anyone looking for a fun little gadget to make mini waffles.",

Literally, plug it in and wait for the light. Super easy to use. No way to tell when something is ready other than the light turning off but i let it stay on for a bit and my food was fine, better actually, a little crispier which i like.

Not difficult to clean due to the small size. The best feature is the waffles are small and if I get an urge for waffles I can make two small ones and call it a day without busting my daily caloric bank. Small and compact for storage as well.
