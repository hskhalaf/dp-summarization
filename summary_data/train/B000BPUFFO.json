Well, the problem is if you splash gas on your fancy race gloves, now a) you smell like gas and b) there's gas held against your skin, causing a rash or worse. We bought these in XXL so that we can jam our hands in them *while still wearing race gloves*. Our hands are now doubley-protected, these are far more grippy than race gloves (making it less likely to fumble with a gas can). When done filling, you can just shake these off and get back out on the track.",

I bought two pairs and haven't used them for very long, so I can't comment on longevity but they feel nice and thick and fairly sturdy.
