I received the replacement headphones and microphone less than a week. The second set work great, it didn't have as much statics as the first one.

They've held up great, and unlike every single other set of earbuds I've owned they continue to work to their full capacity, usually after a long time one of the earbuds would stop working but they havent given up yet! (I purchased these easily over a year ago) They have even survived a cycle in the washing machine and dryer. 5 stars, would recommend to any and all my friends.",
