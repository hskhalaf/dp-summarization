      "text": "I took this backpack on the river kayaking with me.. unfortunately I didn't realize that it fell off the kayak and floated down the river a couple miles. The impressive thing is that I had multiple items inside. Including a Bose Bluetooth speaker, a rechargable battery pack, cell phone, wallet and knife. All combined was an efficient amount of weight to sink the backpack. Fortunately the next day a good samaritan had found my backpack and returned. There was NO DAMAGE to any items inside. With the exception of cancelling my credit cards.. I couldn't have asked for a better outcome. Would highly recommend this backpack even before my kayaking incident.",
