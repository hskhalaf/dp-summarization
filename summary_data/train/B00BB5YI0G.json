I've been using it for a month now and love it! I really only use the main attachment and the small spot trimmer to get my bikini line trimmed down as close to the skin as possible. I charged the device once right when I got it and it still is doing great after using 1-2 times a week since then. I've just been using it on dry skin, though I'm sure I could also use it in the shower if I wanted.",

Just a few seconds and you're done. It's not going to be as close a shave as a razor of course. However since it only trims above the skin you're not going to get razor burn or in-grown hairs like you can get with a razor. It's not meant for legs since you can see some stubble, but otherwise it's a great trimmer. It doesn't prick or pull the skin and the battery charge lasts a long time.",

However, the larger clipper is okay for everyday grooming, and the foil attachment is okay. Not great. I would look around if you want closer grooming (of course you'll never get ultra-smooth from a shaver- you have to wax for that).",
