      "text": "I purchased this tarp on 5-28-2018 to cover a boat (which is also covered by a factory boat cover). This product is sold as \u201cUV resistant\u201d but after barely two months, it tore in three places from simply removing it as a result of sun exposure (we have received almost no rain in the last two months). After a quick look over I found that the tarp had deteriorated to being paper thin. I attempted to e-mail the manufacturer and their e-mail address isn\u2019t even valid. Steer clear if you are looking for something that lasts. Honestly, I have spent less for tarps that have lasted nearly two years!",
