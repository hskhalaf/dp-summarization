      "text": "FAKE FAKE FAKE. These are not genuine beats headphones. I bought these under the impression they were authentic. I started having problems with them so I opened a service request with Apple to have them repaired under warranty. When I went to check the status of my service I found the nice little photo of my headphones labeled as a fake unit. I called Apple to ask how they determined they were fake, and I was told it was because of how they were constructed and materials used. So unless you want a fake product do not buy.",

The negatives: Gives me a brutal headache after an hour or so of listening, ridiculously overpriced, and glitches occasionally (buttons don't work, etc.) way overpriced and too much bass sound. I cannot workout or run in them because they will fall off my head. The positives: color and appearance is really nice looking. Blocks out sound and background noise, so great if you're studying in a noisy place or a coffee shop (this was the number one thing I was looking for). I like the wireless feature so I can clean and walk around without carrying my phone.",

Other than that they were great they fit right and the colors are exactly as the picture shows. The battery life on these does not last long so you must charge everyday if you expect to use them the next day",

The headphones pair easily with other devices. No complaints so far. Pros- Beautiful color finish - Excellent sound quality - Pairs easily with other devices - Very comfortable - Arrived sooner than expected Cons- Very expensive but worth the investment. This is a quality set of headphones",

I wear these for at least a couple of hours every day, and I don't want to look like a moron. They're every bit as good as the previous generation, and a little bit better for the smaller ear piece and easier adjustment. They were great for working out as well, I regularly run 3+ miles with them. The only thing I would say makes the studio wireless superior is the earpiece is slightly softer, but I'm sure these will break-in in time.",

I got the gold colored beats and I have received lots of compliments on them. The price was nice and I would absolutely buy again",

The fit is excellent with a tight seal on the ears without being forced. The overall feel of the headphones is solid and high quality. Highly recommended.",

I use the V-Modas mainly for classical, rock, and punk music, while I use the Beats for music with a strong drop and base line.

He even tried to widen them by putting them on a styrofoam mannequin head to no avail. Worst part is I have missed the return window! Call me sad and disappointed!",

Also the battery charger cord tip was broken after one year use, but fortunately since other charger cords work this was not a problem. I wouldn't recommend and would buy a mini earphone instead in the future.",

They broke again yet there isn't any information where I can replace them a second time. I thought they had a 2 year warranty but looks like it was only a year. I won't be buying beats again or at least not through Amazon as the return and the amount of time it takes to get the problem resolved isn't worth the hassle.",

The wireless functionality is great and I rarely have to charge them. Sound quality is great and they're comfortable without falling off your head when you turn. Only thing is for people with long hair, might get caught on the sides so be aware of that. Otherwise, would recommend and buy as a gift for friends (if you're willing to spend that much).",

However, the headphones have difficulty discriminating between a double and single tap and always pause the music when I really just want to skip to the next song.",

This can be a good thing because it will stop me from mindlessly sitting on my laptop for hours. They overall feel great, and have great sound quality. They also look so clean and symmetrical. I love that they are wireless and I can leave my phone somewhere and still listen to my music. I can also control them from my Apple Watch. So the only reason for four stars is because they make my ears hurt, but that may not be for everybody.",
