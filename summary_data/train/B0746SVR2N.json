      "text": "I had a squeak coming from the back tire of the cart. A friend suggested it might be caused by a worn tire so I ordered this new set of 4 with the tires already mounted on new wheels. They came in a large box which I cut open and then installed the wheels and tires. The squeak went away and the new tires probably cost me less than a dealer diagnosis. They look top quality with sharp white wheels and a very nice tread pattern. I am delighted with the ordering process (they reached me in the 6 or 7 days that the seller promised), the price was incredible, the quality is excellent.",
