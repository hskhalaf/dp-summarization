When the watch arrived I loved it even more in person as I did online. It looks like a MUCH more expensive watch and has so many nice details including a large face and substantial weight. The rubber watch band is thick and high quality. I was worried it would have a \"fitbit\" feel to it, but to the contrary, it makes this watch the perfect combination dressy/casual. My husband loved it as well and it looks great on him. I couldn't be happier with this purchase. A great deal!",

Also it is on the heavier side of watches, but it will definitely not become a deterring factor in wearing it. If you're on the fence about buying it, I would do it. Thank you",

The case and face are very handsome, and look to be far more expensive than the actual cost. Easily can were with blacks or browns. An awesome purchase!",

Since the watch hadn't been delivered yet I decided to call Amazon and see if they would credit the difference. My customer service rep didn't hesitate to do so. No hassle, just a simple \"you bet we can!\" Def made my day. We shop here often and will keep doing so in the future!",

(09/02/14), I showed the sells person and her eyebrows went up she said the lowest she can do for me after signing up with their credit card was 303.00! So I saved almost 100.00!, this purchase is a no brainer! 04/13/2015 Watch is still awsome and lots of compliments on daily basis the only thing I have done to it was changing the glass cover witch was expensive $52.00 because I use it everyday at work and it was all scratched, definitely not scratch resistant lol overall worth every penny",
