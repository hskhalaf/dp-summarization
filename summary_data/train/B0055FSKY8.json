The 45 degree support arms are offset toward the back so folks knees are less likely to hit the arms. Relatively light - one reasonably fit person can handle the setup. The shipping box arrived somewhat beat up but the table was ok. The table is in the back up against the wall in the photo.",

      "text": "I recently ordered 5 ft conference tables from another mfg. Then I realized two things: These OTHER tables don't allow for seating on the end (when necessary) and while they were OK, they are definitely NOT sturdy like these 6 ft LIFETIME tables. Seeing these two products side by side really shows the difference in the construction of the entire table. I'm not complaining about the cheaper tables, but I know that LIFETIME is the way to go! (Who knows why I tried the other brand when all the tables I already have are LIFETIME!)",
