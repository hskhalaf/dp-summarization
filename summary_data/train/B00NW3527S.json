      "pros": [
        "The Sony MDR-1A is a relatively lightweight, very comfortable full-size headphone that offers sound  that's improved over the MDR-1R's, with better definition from the bass through the midrange to the treble",
        "The headphones now sit on your neck correctly (the earcups rotate the proper direction) and you get two cables, one of which has an in-line remote for smartphones, along with a nice carrying pouch"

      "cons": [
        "Somewhat pricey",

      "title": "Great base, well-balanced",
      "text": "I was totally crushed when my sony MDR-700v cans were discontinued. I bought four different pairs of headphones (these, a used pair of 700v, pioneer HDJs and a slightly less expensive version of the MDR-1a) to replace my broken pair. This one was the clear winner...no sound leakage when over the ears. You're in the room. Great base, well-balanced, deep tones. Super comfortable and the light blue steel metal with chocolate brown leather is stunning. They weigh as much as a feather. Couldn't be happier. Highly recommend for aficionados and film/sound editors (like me).",

      "text": "The headphones sound amazing and have terrific bass. Everything was as advertised sound wise, but the cables both broke within 10 months of having them (the first broke within a month). I took very good care of them by doing things like winding them in a ring and putting them in the protective case, but still had to buy a $20 replacement in order to use the headphones. Other than the cable, these are fantastic and I would recommend them to anyone who loves listening to music!",

      "text": "Too much bass. I don't know it is just of this one I bought and returned, or the traits of this product. But I can take so much bass, especially when it is not clear. The drum keeps booming even after it should stop, and make me hardly be able to focus on the music itself. Maybe I am not a fan of bass, but I know how a good bass should sound like. This one is not acceptable. The quality and packaging are fine as Sony products always did. So not one star.",

I did some research on good sound quality AND comfortable headphones in the $200-300 range. I decided to try these Sony MDR-1A's and I'm really glad that I did. These headphones are extremely comfortable on my head. I almost forget that they're on my head sometimes. In my opinion the sound quality is great too. I listen mostly to video game soundtracks, classic rock, and classical music. These headphones sound absolutely great for those genres. I would definitely recommend these headphones",

Cable is awkwardly ribbed and short, also has a proprietary connector which is annoying. The sound is.. okay. The bass is bloated, the highs are rolled off and the mids are far too recessed. Fan of female vocal EDM? These may cut it, just don't expect to be amazed by much else. If you can handle some sound leak, the Philips SHP9500's beat the sound on these in every way and are only $73. Personally I am returning my pair and spending an extra $100 on the far superior Senheisser HD600's.",
