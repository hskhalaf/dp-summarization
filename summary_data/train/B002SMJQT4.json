NO other sound machine sold on Amazon matches the beautiful sounds this made when it worked correctly. I am frustrated. I NEED a sound machine. I have tired MANY others. I feel so lost...

I really like being able to try the different sound fields that are available. Different ones work better with the different sources of noise. Although the adaptive sound system works well, I've found that adjusting it myself works best for me. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good sound generator to help drown out annoying noises (including tinitus).",

It's incredibly calming. The buttons are placed well, the display lights can be turned off, and the sound is clear and crisp. I would definitely recommend this product.",

      "text": "The machine was purchased to improve sleep. The machine has 10 different sound options. Within each option there are additional options to add richness to the sound. There is a volume control. There is a continuous play and timer option. The machine can be set to requlate the volume with respect to background sound or the sound level can be set to a set volume. The sound seems natural and continuous without the feeling that it is repeating. Most importantly my sleep has improved measurably since using this machine.",
