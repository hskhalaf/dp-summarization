We tried various fixes, and none worked. We started giving her these probiotics, and within a week, her problems disappeared. One note: None of our three cats will eat these probiotics straight. They walk away after sniffing them. My solution was to break the chew into small pieces and feed them to the cat with a little tuna.",

So...anyone who has cats knows that scoots and rouge poops outside the box can be an issue. Our oldest female cat was doing this more frequently so I decided to see if a probiotic would help. I must say that after about 3 weeks, I haven't see any scoots or rouge poops - yay!!! She seems to love the flavor and hangs out near the bag as if to want more. She even seems to have a bit more energy now too. I would definitely recommend giving this a try for older cats and/or those with tummy issues.",
