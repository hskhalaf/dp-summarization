      "text": "I've tried 2 keyboards before this, and this Belkin case simply annihilates them! It's really a clever design in that the cover snaps open magnetically at 3 different angles. The keyboard is also high quality with a strong bluetooth connection that connects instantaneously. The closest competing case I've used was Logitech, which broke in 2 days so I only had the keyboard. That Logitech keyboard with a stand slot would frequently lose bluetooth connection no matter how much I charged it. Overall this just feels like a more quality product, and it's far better looking in person than in the advertisements. I wouldn't hesistate to get this at all. You get what you pay for!",

I do not use the keyboard every day, but keep it on my device as it's permanent case. I charge the keyboard about every 6 months, and without fail it has been ready for me to use whenever I need it.

Maybe they will use better quality magnets on future versions. But this by no means will deter me from buying another one if anything happens to the current one. The keyboard battery life is great. I can go weeks without bothering to recharge it. I recommend this item.",

Great tactile feel to the keys, and no shut down button near the delete key which is a really annoying key placement found on several other similar cases.

The price is a little high but its totally worth it! The case itself is durable and the keyboard is super easy to use! (I am using this case to write this review now lol) I purchased the white one and I got it on sale! The only down fall about it is that its a little heavy, but it no problem for me. I would definitely recommend this case!",

The only \"negative\" wold be the rubberized magnet covers came off within the first few months, but that has not diminished the functionality of the product in one way. Would I purchase again...YES!!!!",
