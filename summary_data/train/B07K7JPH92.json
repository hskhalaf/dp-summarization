      "verdict": "The Nike Epic React Flyknit seemed to be a successful release, but not quite. Although many runners praised the shoe\u2019s comfort level, durability, and weight, there were some who were dissatisfied with the fit and support. In terms of performance, the shoe received both raves and rants. Thus, it could be said that the Epic React Flyknit is an average running shoe; not perfect, but worth a try and worth the investment.",
      "pros": [
        "The Nike Epic React Flyknit was a comfortable shoe right out of the box, several users exclaimed",
        "Other runners expressed how comfortable the shoe is: some compared it to running on pillows and clouds, while another voiced comfort even on the knees",
        "The outsole was surprisingly durable, wrote a commenter",
        "The lightweight disposition helped increase running speed, a couple of reviewers observed",
        "A lot of wearers said that the Epic React Flyknit was a good-looking shoe",
        "Some runners were pleased with how responsive the midsole was",
        "One tester liked that the Flyknit upper was snug and structured",
        "There was just the right amount of cushioning: not too soft and not too firm, explained a reviewer",
        "The shoe allowed natural movement, even during fast-paced activities, commended a buyer",
        "The Epic React Flyknit was an excellent shoe for up-tempo days and speedy runs, a reviewer claimed"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "The shoe had a narrow fit, according to a couple of purchasers",
        "Several customers experienced a weird popping noise from the shoe that was quite bothersome",
        "Not much support for midfoot strikers, a disappointed user stated",
        "Although lightweight, the shoe\u2019s structure made it look bulky, a reviewer thought",
        "Some users disliked that the shoe required a break-in period",
        "A bit tight around the forefoot, according to numerous customers",
        "The Epic React Flyknit did not have a lot of grip on indoor surfaces, said a runner",
        "The heel counter was too rigid, especially during the first few wears, a wearer mentioned"
