I\u2019m 5'6\" with slim build, so it's not like the product has been overly stressed. Most likely the foam is either too thin, or doesn't keep its form due to poor quality. On the outside they look great and the exterior materials appear of good quality, but it\u2019s the stuff inside that matters for a slipper to be comfortable.",

I\u2019m keeping them for lounging when I don\u2019t need to be active in any other way, but if the wearer plans to be active around the house in any way, I would not recommend this slipper to them.",

It's far too easy to trip or fall wearing these slippers, especially if you are helping someone to stand or sit on a wheel chair at home.
