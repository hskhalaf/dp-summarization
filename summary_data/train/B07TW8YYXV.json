Dig a hole as mentioned sink the PVC base and allow quick cement to set and done, within a few hours I was once again displaying \"Old Glory!\" If seeking a simple and elegant flag pole , this is the one ! I do recommend purchase !",

A breeze in the area we live is 15 mph. So when we have windy days of 25 mph the pole continues to slip. The rings do hold better than the first pole but with the shaking in the wind they still come loose. If you live in a less windy area you will love this pole. Thank you to the company for the exchange. Husband had modified the pole and it is staying up",

I dug out a 6\" wide ring for the cement and used the earth for the form. If I could have located a 24\" dia cylinder, I would have just dug out a 30\" dia hole & used that. The sand filled base hole allows the pole some flexibility for windy day & should work to prevent the pole from snapping. I reccomend this product.",

So we let it down one section and we like it. lastly the flag that comes with it looks more like a hankie. very thin. So I would recommend getting your own flag. The other question I saw was will it take a larger flag and it will. This takes 2 flags, so flying at half staff is possible just move the flag down to the second flagg position.",

My pole is mounted in the shipped sleeve that\u2019s buried 18 inches in the ground, with about 180lbs of concrete pour around it. So the base is sturdy. Unfortunately the pole flops all over the place like a dying fish in low winds due to the thinness of the metal... So in time I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll come home and find the pole has snapped.
