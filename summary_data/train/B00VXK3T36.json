The Badass cover is nice, appears to be a quality product, covers the bike more than the Dowco, but I have to dry my bike after every rain. Not sure why it leaks, since it has taped seams, but it does. Buyer's remorse after buying this cover since the Dowco never leaked and I got nearly 4 years out of it.",
