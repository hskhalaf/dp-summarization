I like some of the direction Blue Hole is taking but I think it doesn't really have the potential to keep getting better and better over long periods of time. Gameplay is still buggy and feels a little clunky, and the devs took back a promise to not have microtransactions in the game until full release. I don't think it's a huge deal, but the change of attitude is a little worrying. TL;DR I'd buy it for hardcore FPS fans, but not worth it for people who aren't into the competitive format.",
