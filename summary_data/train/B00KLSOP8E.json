It's sort of hilarious in that it makes you feel like a waiter in a fancy restaurant, but we use it to quickly clean off the crumbs and coffee grounds before wiping down the counters with something wet. The quality rubber in the pan and the curve of the real wood handle really give this a high-quality, right-tool-for-the-job feel. When the bristles get too gross someday, I'm sure we'll buy another one.",
