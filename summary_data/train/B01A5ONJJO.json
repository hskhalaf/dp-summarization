However I've never found a Philosophy lotion that is adaquate for me. I can apply this at night and feel moisturized during the day. I no longer need a day time lotion. It's the perfect amount of moisture. A pat or two of my fingers is enough for my entire face therefore making the container last forever. It does have a perfume smell but it's tolerable and fades fast.",

I don't like fragranced things in general though. If I didn't mind the smell, I'd give it 4 stars. I'll try it for tonight and see if it the smell drives me bonkers. Given that I want to cut my hands off from my body right now to escape the smell, I'm not optimistic.",
