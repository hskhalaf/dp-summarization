After only one oversees trip and the wheels drag a bit, they are not as solid as expected, The zippers appear to be holding up fine......as I thought these would be the first to go..... I believe these to be good for one.....possibly two more trips and we will be luggage shopping again. I would have rated them a (1); however, there was no mistaking these bags on the baggage claim carousel......Not may orange cases out there! That was a factor in our purchase!",

Was a bit disappointed that the 25\" suitcase was slightly damaged with scratches and scuff marks but too much of a hassle to return and after a trip or two it will probably be scratched even more. That will likely be the one I use most. The largest will be good for an extended road trip and the small one will work for overnights. I ordered it on Sunday afternoon and had it by Tuesday! Happy with the purchase.",
