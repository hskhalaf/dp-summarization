First of all, after applying, your face feels clean and fresh with a cooling/firming sensation. After two weeks of use I have noticed fine lines disappearing along with a firmer/moist tone to my skin. Now that I have discovered this product, there is no need for other products. Furthermore, during shipment, the cap came off one of the two 16 oz containers, spilling most of the contents of one container. After I notified Pure Valley of the issue, they apologized and were prompt in sending me a new replacement. Great company!",
