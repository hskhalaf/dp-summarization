There is one issue, if you have the glass up and burn the candle for longer than 30 minutes to 1 hour the candle will drip down into the body of the lantern. I have no issues if I raise the steel completely and lower the glass down into the lantern. Doing this helps keep the aluminum candle holder cool, preventing the wax melting below the rim of the metal shroud. In my opinion completely lowering the glass does not significantly raise the danger of causing a fire.",

They are so good you really don't need to trim them much if you use them multiple times (rather than one long burn). They also burn very evenly which is a must! They are shipped directly from UCO and and are well made. Can't say one bad thing about them.",
