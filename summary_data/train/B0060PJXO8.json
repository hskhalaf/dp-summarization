      "text": "Purchased this for my 12 yr old son who had a hard time keeping up with us on the road with his mountain bike. Now he fly's and loves it. He can climb hills better too. He's crashed it three times getting used to it and the bike came out fine each time. We both wish it had the added brake handles at the bar, which I could add on. The bike was easy to build, shifts very well, even months later.",

So i needed a bike that was fit for a small woman and decided after much research (measuring my limbs/height, etc) decided to settle on this bike. It is perfect for my body habitus and my short legs fit perfectly with each rotation of the foot pedal, which was a concern of mine on the larger woman frame bikes. I like to cruise around this bike for a couple a miles and it's comfortable and very easy to put together! Also the white/pink design is very cute! I may change out the seat later as after a few miles it becomes a bit uncomfortable.",

The breaks could be a little better and I just wish that the handle bars could be adjusted upward a little. But other than that, the bike was worth the money. Good buy.",

It's a pretty bike and she loves the pink! My husband took approx 30 -45 min to get out and put together",
