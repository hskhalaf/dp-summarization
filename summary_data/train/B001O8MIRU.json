It's really not that great but I don't know what else to use for swimming.",

The size small did match the weight unlike the pampers brand of little swimmers, they held up for the whole day and helped not make accident leak out into the pool. The size will also fit her next summer. I didn't have to get another size even when she went up a diaper size. Definitely worth the price I only had to buy one pack for the whole summer and even shared a few with some friends! Still have some left over and we went swimming alot! I was also able to let them sit out and dry and reuse them! For times she was only in our pool for a few minutes \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01",

She peed and the stupid swimmer could e even hold in one bathroom use. I was mortified. We had to cover her in a beach towel and change her poolside. Thank goodness we were just about done at breakfast. For the rest of the trip, I didn't put the swimmers on until she was ready to go in the pool.",
