For such a low price I wasn't expecting top of the line. It is well made and finished nicely although a bit thinner than the Craftsman. I've used it to break loose door hinge bolts and engine bracket bolts and it performed well. After viewing all the pics of the tool broken it clearly was not used for its intended purpose. My 1/2\" air impact wrench with 500+ lbs of torque will struggle with a stubborn lug nut at times so I wouldn't ever use this breaker for that purpose.",
