I'm not sure if they will work at the distance I need, but I'm happy to report that they have an amazing range and work flawlessly. I like that you can add more sensors to get readings in different areas, ie outdoor and storage rooms. The display is very vivid in color, easy to read, and gives you a lot of information.

I am fortunate to have one though and it works fine, the range isn\u2019t the best but it\u2019s decent for small houses..

I couldn't connect the thermometer at first, but there are detailed step-by-step instructions in the manual. I completed all the operations in 10 minutes and can easily read the temperature.

If you only use battery power, you must press a button to see the display. Since I have a convenient power outlet, I prefer this kind of monitor, but if you have no power outlet. Everything is there, and the unit is working fine and setting up is not difficult.",

During battery operation, the display does not light continuously, but the AC power mode allows continuous lighting. The wall mounting can be done by a rear-mounted recess, screws are not included, as well as no AA batteries. It is my second weather station in the house and its far better than the last one I recommend the purchase.",
