After sitting outdoor on the ceiling for at least 2 years, my old one is still noticeably whiter. Next issue is it was rather slow to connect to the network.

But also if it is detecting motion then I assumed it would follow the motion. Instead it \u201cmight\u201d detect and then turns 90 in the other direction. Set up instructions are extremely easy but the actual set up is annoying when the camera doesn\u2019t read the bar info... just keep very still and it will work. Night detection is good enough. I wouldn\u2019t really buy another one but this is ok for my purpose.",

This one (apparently) records motion until it stops and sends an alert but prevents you from watching the full recording. What's the point of a motion detector if it won't show me what happens? Total garbage, returned it and have to find something else now.",

The first one would not connect to my WiFi anymore so they reluctantly sent me a new one. Worked great for a while... and now it randomly freezes the image on a black and white blurry smudge and won't work unless I manually reset the power on it. Ah! and again it's having problems connecting to the WiFi. This could've been a great product, but the constant problems and very, very poor support, makes this product a real missed opportunity for Yi.",

On thing I dislike, it seems all the other brands are capitable with Blue Iris software that is a big plus. For the YI Techs, can you come up with something between YI and Blue Iris and allow the two to guard our homes. Recommend this Camera for the cellphone, but I think we can do better. Robt.",
