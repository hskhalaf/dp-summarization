So I had to turn down heat, open lid and reset on pot holding it down very tightly with all my weight and turning handle to lock. That worked for a few months. Now I cannot get it up to pressure at all. It just keeps spewing Steam and never locks in. I am going to try to get a replacement or my money refunded through the Fagor company.

The 3.3 quart is useful for everyday supper cooking. I used the 8 quart this morning to cook up a pile of marrow bones to make rich broth for my famous borscht. Magefesa makes a quality cooker. It is not necessary to pay more. These cookers have two pressure levels, which means these cookers cook really fast, unlike the electric pressure cookers. The lower level isn't as low as the old pressure cookers used to go, but is still good. Stainless makes cleanup fast and easy.",

We replaced it with another brand thinking that we would like it even better-- but we were disappointed. The Magafesa is far superior to the other cooker (which was twice the price.) We returned the other cooker and purchased another Magefesa and we are still delighted with it. Highly recommend trying pressure cooking AND this brand of cooker.",

That's over 2x what the part costs...so needless to say I'm buying another pressure cooker. My Advice - do not waste your time on this Spanish piece of **** !!

I've had absolutely no problems with it; it only requires about half a cup of liquid to cook and there is a marking for max fill which is helpful. Also, easy to tell when pressure has been reached.

Bought this to replace an old four quart Aluminum model, decided that having a 6 quart pot as well as 4 quart might come in handy. Very glad I did, as I am using the 6 quart pot much more than the 4 quart one. Once the correct pressure is reached I turn the gas down to just above simmer, saving energy and not heating up the kitchen. Very silent, only a slight hiss while operating. Beats the old rocker type pressure cookers hands down. You won't be sorry buying this one.",
