My emergencies don't come about all that often, and even on frozen mornings i have found these cables supple enough.",

I am sick of owning wimpy 4 or 8 gauge cables, and usually just barely long enough. These cables are very heavy duty, and at 25', you don't have to be as creative routing them from the 2 vehicles. This is really the only way to go, especially for the price. I fortunately have only used them once since I bought them a year ago, but it was a privilege and I feel I will own this one set of cables for the rest of my life. Very good investment.",

The aluminum (copper coated) wire diameter was larger in diameter than 2 ga. I needed to trim it down before I could soldered in place. The insulating plastic was so \"INEXPENSIVE\" that by simply heating the copper connector, the heat transfer to the wire caused the plastic to swell. Again my fault. In the future, I will spend more time and carefully read the description(s) AND the on-line reviews. Regards. I recommend solid copper wire for cold weather applications. Bob",
