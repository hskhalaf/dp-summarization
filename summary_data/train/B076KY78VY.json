They come individually wrapped in a cute net-like pack. there are several felt inserts and they are color coded for you to match it with your preferred essence. The entire diffuser is made out of metal. Don't worry, the clips, which is also made of metal, has a coating that will prevent scratching your air vent. the closure is precise and it will not drop the felt piece. My only problem is that I have not found a good oil that would smell good and last more than half a day, but this is not a problem with this product itself.",

If you close the vent, you still get the smell and for a longer time. The one in my office is very subtle since I don't have air blowing through it. It lasts longer than on the car vent and I still smell it as I come in the office or the door closes and moves the air around. I love them!",

      "text": "I think these aromatherapy air fresheners are adorable. I tried one in a car and couldn't smell anything, so perhaps the quality of the essential oil (EO) was the reason. I'm trying a second one, and used a very good quality EO. It seems more fragrant, but haven't put it in the car yet. I'd rather inhale something healthy like a nice EO versus chemicals like so many traditional air fresheners. I don't know how often the EO has to be refreshed, but if it isn't often, I'll be glad to improve my rating.",
