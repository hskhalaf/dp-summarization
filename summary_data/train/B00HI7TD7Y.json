It started on the edges of those stupid white fins. Keeps messing with my feet b/c you feel like you're stepping on stuff as the sole folds under itself. I am very disappointed with this shoe from a manufacturing perspective. I got them because they were blue and Adidas. Clearly and unfortunately these were put together by small children in the back of pickup with a (cheap) hot glue gun. Will follow up with a photo.",

In less than 30 minutes of wear, on smooth surfaces, at low-intensity running, with zero cutting or quick changes in direction.... Majority of the tred are already coming off... which will require me to epoxy them back on. Awesome. A great quality purchase (slight sarcasm).

Extremely comfortable, and they look real sharp too. I ordered a size 12 in mens. Most brands I wear between 11-12, and these fit perfectly at the 12. Perfect width, lots of support, and I could wear them all day without a problem. So far they seem pretty durable and will last me sometime. Not a single complaint!",
