      "text": "The unicycle seems to be well made. It came initially without the hardware for assembly. It took a while to be able to receive the needed hardware, but once it's all together, it feels solid. I wish the clamp for holding the seat post were a bit easier to lock down solidly, or maybe quick release so it could be adjusted up or down more easily, but overall, it's a good quality unicycle for the low price",

My brother in law is shorter and we just used a hacksaw and cut seat post down to fit him. I believe with this simple mod you could easily adapt to someone much, much shorter. Definitely way better looking than a lot of other unicycles in its price range too. Pedals and seat clamp are worst things about it....no reason not to buy though. Not the best for long rides, I stay within a couple miles or this thing will wear you out.",
