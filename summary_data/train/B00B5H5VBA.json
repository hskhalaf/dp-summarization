      "text": "Love it! I ended up doing some DIY. Instead of using the hooks that come with it, I went with wall anchors so it cal hold up to 100 pounds instead of the 30 recommended. I painted the front part (pictured) because it was just like machine cuts before, hard to explain. I just used white paint to fill in the lines & wiped it away! Holds so much! Will be purchasing another for my other bathrooms. I paid $30 for it. I see the price keeps fluctuating. If it goes any higher I might opt for something else but $30-$40 so worth it!",

The black \"shelf\" below the cabinet doors threw me for a loop (and I didn't notice it on the photo before I bought it). Not sure why the manufacturer would take a pristine white cabinet and add a black shelf. Makes no sense, and I don't like the way it looks at all. I'd return it but this piece went into a rental unit and I don't have time to switch it out! Oh well, maybe I'm the only one who would notice.",

My unit came well packaged and had no damage, but since all of the pieces are some type of MDF, some units are bound to be damaged during shipping. Don't expect premium craftsmanship if you aren't paying for it. That being said, I got mine built and mounted in about two hours. Could've done it faster but I wasn't aiming to set any records.",

      "text": "The cabinet is a $20 cabinet that costs $40+. As others have pointed out, it is made of fiberboard, which at this price point is expected. The bad part is that it is assembled with screws that install from the outside of the cabinet instead of cam locks from the inside. These screws are then covered with white caps which do not fit properly into the screw heads. If you are expecting a clean exterior finish, this cabinet will not provide that. In addition the cabinet is poorly packed so the pieces can rub together. Thankfully on mine it was on the inside of the door, however it easily could have happened to the outside.",

The center door panel is more on the cardboard side; but, if you're not a rough handling sort, this could last indefinitely.",
