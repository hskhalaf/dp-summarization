I literally used this like 10 times. I use a whetstone sharpener and my other victorinox knives sharpen back to how I got them when new. This one didn't do that. I have sharpened it 3 times now and it's just not the same. I guess for the price, I shouldn't be disappointed since it was cheap compared to dalstrong which is the one I want but it's over $100. Easy to use, good grip and sharp at first, yes. But again, the type of metal used doesn't sharpen well over time.",

If you hold back, even a little, it will take 2 or 3 tries. After finding this out, it went through the drummettes easily and flawlessly. Separating the joints was like going through paper.",

Upon opening it, I felt that the cleaver did not seem to have the weight one would expect to need for cutting through meat, especially cartilage etc. But it is too heavy for normal use, so let's see if this gets used or just takes up space in the drawer.",

It would have been nice if the cleaver came with a sleeve, to protect it in the drawer, but I easily made one for that purpose. Overall, I'd say this is a great cleaver for the price. I'm sure you can spend more and find better, but this is a great option for someone looking for a durable, sharp, & functional cleaver on a budget.",
