Like the larger nostril openings, especially on hot/humid days. We use a fly mask over it to keep her from pulling it off or springing clip. Much better than the heavier weight ones and like that it doesn't have to be used with a halter. Opening is large though so you may need to consider a model with a smaller opening to eat through if you have a really lush pasture. We keep another on hand for those times of year when she needs more restriction.",

I bought the horse size and it fits my Morgan perfectly. He uses pony cheekpieces and a cob noseband, so an average horse might fit better in a large horse size. It is keeping him from grazing down the pasture too fast and of course reducing his waistline. :)",

      "text": "I purchased this for my daughters performance horse. He likes his grass and even though she rides him on a daily bases he would still be over weight. We used the grazing muzzles last year and it worked well. A family member ordered this one and loved it. I liked the easy breathe holes so I ordered one. This muzzle works great it is a little bigger then the tough 1 I purchased at the local tack store and the Velcro is much longer. When buying a muzzle make sure to have plenty of adjustment to lengthen. I really think the horse is comfortable in this one too.",
