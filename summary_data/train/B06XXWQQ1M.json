Alfalfa can cause urinary problems with Chinchillas. I would like to see the cost come down but will pay for quality and what is nutritionally beneficial as opposed to rabbit food with a Chinchilla photo on the bag. Good work Oxbow, you have proven your company once again to be a trustworthy brand for our pets. Thank you",

She was on the original Oxbow diet for Chins prior to this. The pellet size in this diet is larger than the original chin diet which isn't a bad thing. I like this food, just wish it was a little cheaper but if you want a healthy food then you need to spend more money.",

They smelled kind of funny, and my boys didn't touch them. They picked the old pellets out of their bowl instead. Appears healthier but likely not a good buy.",

Oxbow Essentials Chinchilla Food is actually 1 of the 2 best pellets for your chinchilla in the U.S.!
