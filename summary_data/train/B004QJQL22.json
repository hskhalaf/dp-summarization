The North American P-51 Mustang was probably the best all-around single-seat piston engine fighter to be used in World War 2. The first U.S.A.A.F. combat group arrived in Britain in November 1943 and from then until the end of the war, the P-51 earned an enviable reputation as a long-range fighter-escort for the B-17 and B-24 bombers raiding deep in the heart of the German homeland. \u2022 Precision laser cut balsa parts, scale WWI plastic wheels, full set of decals, vacuum formed plastic parts and all accessories needed \u2022 Perfect for rubber power, U-Control and free flight as well as for display \u2022 Complete instructions for building either to fly or for static display\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nGuillow's is the recognized leader in quality scale balsa model airplane kits. Our model construction kits are the last word in scale realism for the super detail fan and light weight for those who build and fly. Each model is a small but faithful replica of an airplane widely known for deeds in wartime or present day popularity. Series 400 features 3/4\" scale models of iconic military aircraft from World War II, with precision laser-cut parts for easier assembly.",
