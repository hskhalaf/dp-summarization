      "text": "It works well to control the GoPro while I'm on the bike and the camera is mounted out of reach. I especially like the fact that you can connect your phone and see the video while you change settings or mount the camera. N.B. the \"streaming\" video is delayed by 3-7 seconds, so it's not useful for shooting, but is great for setup. Negatives: the chargers don't crossover. I.e., even if the BacPac is plugged into the HERO, charging one won't charge the other. And both use USB-mini chargers (instead of the more prevalent and smaller USB-micro).",

Pro's Price $21.99 Free shipping Works with iPhone 5 app (free app) App interface is easier to use than the GoPro menu method Cons Not at this time.",

Apparently the iPhone app can't connect to the original Hero, so I basically just got screwed out of $70 bucks for a remote (that I didn't want in the first place). Don't buy this package unless you have a Hero 2. 3 stars because, as far as I see on the website, it doesn't mention that. How convenient.",
