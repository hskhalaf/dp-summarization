The wrist wrap is very comfortable to her and there's plenty of length to wear wrist bands under these and still have ample room to close and have a secure fit. The palms are soft and easy to break in and she was able to use them the day she got them. You can adjust the finger holes a bit if you need to do so - just cut around the hole that's already in the grip to make it larger or rounder as needed.",
