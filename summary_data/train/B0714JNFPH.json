It would have gotten six stars if the the unit was a little taller allowing more storage on the top shelf. Again, as described, this is an entryway rack to hold coats and shoes.",

Built with hooks facing in on both sides is 27.25 inches. Built with hooks facing in and without the levelers, 26.75 inches.

Not advisable however I was pleased it did not wobble a bit. I like the shape of the Z base as we can put baskets and shoes. It is about 5 ft high without the wheels. Wheels will add 4 more inches or so. I want to order another for my garage for coats and ski gear. Definitely recommend!",
