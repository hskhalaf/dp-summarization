      "text": "I have really pale skin and it's been extremely hard for me to find a natural looking gradual tanning lotion that doesn't turn me orange. Fake Bake looks almost purple based and I come out looking naturally sun-kissed every time! It's not streaky and it hasn't stained my clothes or bed sheets. It takes me MAYBE 10 minutes to apply once every 4-5 days. My only complaint is that it doesn't last quite as long as other products I've used. Still love it though, and would recommend to anyone!",

Helpful hints: I put oil free lotion on my hands, feet, elbows, knees and face. Then did a light swipe over those areas and didn\u2019t end up with any streaks or spots. Also, make sure you don\u2019t have any deodorant on when you use it, because the tanner will cling to it and you\u2019ll have spots, so before bed is optimal. Would definitely recommend!",

Half the color washes off after the first shower but you're left with a decent base color. I keep layering on every couple of days and have achieved fantastic results. Just be careful because before washing the product off, it does stain sheets, loathes, pillowcases, etc. Not streaky either! Dry natural looking :-)",

I've tried probably about 30 different faux tanners over the years and this is my favorite because it's so convenient and you can see the oroductvas it goes on. This helps to prevent streaks and blotchiness. I even use it on my face and it doesnt make my skin look dull. The only thing I would recommend is to use an exfoliator for the entire body before application and make sure to moisturize the days following application.",
