I'm taking a star away because of cost. After using this mix I bought the ingredients. Hershey cocoa, powdered sugar, imitation vanilla, and made my own powdered mix for alot less. Then I added half and half and heavy cream for a firm texture. It tasted great. I like their product for convenience but it's too expensive for simple ingredients. They should lower their price to at least $9.99",

I'm a purist but I was persuaded to add chocolate chunks to the mix before hardening in the freezer. I also had to reduce the mix by half because of the size of my Lello ice cream maker's small freezing compartment of less than a quart. Great ice cream!",
