      "text": "I loooooove this curling iron. I purchased the 19mm curling iron a year or so before I bought this one and I love it but wanted one that gave me more wavy, loose curls. This does an excellent job! My hair is very long (almost to my belly button), very slick, and won't hold a curl even with product. But with this curling iron (and the 19mm one), I can curl my hair, not use any product at all and it's still curled the next day and sometimes the day after if my hair doesn't get too greasy. I recommend this curling iron to any friends who complain about their hair not staying curled. It's the best!",

      "text": "The best curling iron EVER! It doesn't have a clip so you wrap as much around the barrel as you would like. It gets hot rather quickly, and comes with a cute glove to place on the hand that is holding the hair in place on the barrel. Just remember to wrap your hair up and around the barrel. This makes for a better curl! When you curl it, it will initially look perfectly curled, but if you would like a more natural look, just shake you hair a few times. Enjoy\ud83d\ude09",

I've had a hard time with my hair keeping curl lately (could be the time of year and climate), but they've held nicely. The wand heated up quickly and was a great temperature. I was a little concerned about not having the option to adjust the temperature, but it hasn't been a problem.",

It's much hotter than a traditional curling iron. I think that's why these curls stay in so good. Just simply hold your hair on it for a couple seconds instead of how long you would with a regular curling iron. It's a little pricey but I would definitely recommend this product and am never goin back to the clip curling irons!",
