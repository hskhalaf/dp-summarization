I decided to try this Breath exerciser to expand my lungs. I was shocked to find how bad my lung power was. i had a hard time getting one ball up. But after using this twice a day for a few weeks, has really changed my lung power. I still can't get all three balls up, but i am doing great. And it is fun! I can just sit in my easy chair and play with this and improve my lung volume. Soon, i am gonna get the third ball up. Maybe i'll go dancing!",
