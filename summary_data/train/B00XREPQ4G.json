I don't know a ton about tuning up bows so I took it to a certified dealer and they were astounded that the bow was shipped to me as it was. I had already done some practice draws as I was pretty pumped to finally have the bow in hand but since the bow was set incorrectly out of the box I very easily could have bent or snapped a limb when drawing it back. This is a very dangerous way to ship so please get it checked out before making any practice draws as to prevent serious injury.",

Great reviews and highly recommended for sub 500 dollar compounds. Though after a few weeks of very consistent shooting, the bottom cam broke. The knob that held the string look just snapped off. I didn't dry fire it at all. It's costing me 160 to get the parts and bow repaired, which at that point I feel like I should have just shelled up more cash up front and went for the powermax",

      "text": "I don't like to jump into a new hobby and spend a lot of money without being certain I'll enjoy it. At the same time, I don't like cheaping out and missing out on some important features and good quality. I like that the draw weight can go from 15-70lbs, the length is fine since I only need 28\", and the added stabilizer, rest, quiver and peep sight are great for the price. Would recommend to any beginner who wants enjoy archery and not feel like they are missing anything really important when it comes to the more expensive bows.",
