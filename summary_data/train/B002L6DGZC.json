I did not have a lathe to put these on to check for true, but I did use a caliper around the outer edge and these are extremely flat. Installed on a Ford Fusion with 55,000 miles. Complete brake job as its faster, easier and an upgrade to just pad replacement and/or turning the factory rotors. A Ford tech I spoke with said at 55,000 miles I could probably get them turned and get another 30,000 if I was lucky...so to the scrapyard went the OEMs. I'll try to update in 3 years on how they're wearing.",
