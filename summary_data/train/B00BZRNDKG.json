It has small bumps and ridges like it was not sanded or planed properly. I contacted the company and basically said was normal. It plays okay but the pucks sometimes stop or turn when hitting a spot. I would have returned it except long wait and paid movers to put in our upstairs game room (they also took all the packaging). I went to a local bar that has shuffleboard tables and theirs are much smoother than this one.",

The split in the MDF cross brace is rare but can occur. It shouldn't affect the play of the table or its lifespan.
