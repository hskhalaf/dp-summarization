The nubbins along the filter allow ease of grip even when your hands are wet. Clarity of the glass is superb, with no distortion or flaring. The CPL doesn't vignette along the edges even on the 95mm, and the price isn't bad either.",

It\u2019s impossible to put the filter on once you put the hood on... The little grippy bits are just too large. I\u2019ll give it a 4 because I think it probably does it\u2019s job well if you don\u2019t need the hood.",

But, I give 4 stars because I can't use the hoods lens together, becase the border have a little bit protusion that don't allow you to put the hood lens. I know that some photographers that use CPL filters in general they don't use the hoods lens together, but I like to use it together, for me it's more pratical and help with some ghosts of sun too.

Their biggest asset lies in the true colour rendition, i.e. there isn't a greenish colour cast which most other polarising filters produce when used on a digital camera sensor, which means less post-production editing to remove the cast. Image sharpness and resolution are maintained with no perceivable loss of contrast. Colour saturation is enhanced, as expected. Build quality and usability: 10/10, this will last a lifetime",

      "WORLDS MOST COLOR NEUTRAL POLARIZER, GUARANTEED: A perfectly flat transmission curve would yield a perfectly color neutral result, and while there is no such thing as a perfectly neutral CPL filter (contrary to what other filter makers may claim) the X4 CPL is the most color neutral any CPL filter, guaranteed.",
      "WORLDS MOST ADVANCED POLARIZER: All commercially available CPL filters exhibit a yellow cast due to a gradual transmission increase starting around 600nm and then spiking at 650nm onward into IR. With our X4 CPL film we achieved a gradual transmission decrease from 600nm onward, and instead of spiking uncontrollably near 650nm and far into infrared, the X4 CPL sees very controlled transmission into IR, without the curve spike. Result: Warm and lively images without the apparent colorcast.",
