I had to contact TP-Link's customer service once a few years ago, and I had a good experience. This is my second TP-Link modem-router because the first one malfunctioned after an electrical storm.

Setup was very easy and connected to my new, lighting fast CenturyLink internet in about 5 minutes including unpackaging. The DirectTV technician connected the new Genie HD DVR to the TP-Link in seconds allowing for internet access on our TV. Our TV is a Samsung Smart TV but the DirectTV - TP-Link interface is MUCH easier to use. All of the install directions and owners manual are contained on a mini-CD which is very convenient. The owners manual is very well written and comprehensive. The capabilities of the TP-Link are state-of-the-art. Very highly recommended!!",

Besides bigger bandwidth, this wireless router also come with \"modem\" capability which help me reduced my two boxes (my old modem and WIFI router are separate boxes) down to one. Moreover, this modem does not only support ADSL2+ (I originally thought that is what it was for, as I have ADSL). It can also be used for cable modem. This makes the Archer D9 future proof should I ever move or change my Telco/Internet provider.",

If you are having a problem with the wireless using this router i would definitely recommend updating the firmware..it has made a world of difference in this modems stability and functionality.",

It was great within spitting distance in the same room, but a few yards of air and a wood wall and pffft. To be fair, it was an Amazon Warehouse \"packing will be damaged\" so maybe someone returned it for the same reason I did, in which case I am slamming an Archer product for Amazon's return policy - but it is supposed to be in working order, correct?

Really though, no parameter was locked, no reasonable option unchangeable, it even let me throttle the network usage of each device connected individually and give network priority to any devices which pretty much eleminated any lag I had playing games online while others were on my wifi.",

Just make sure you know which router you are buying before purchasing. I almost got the just plain wireless one. Before disconnecting your old router ensure you know all the gateway info.
