My dog has been eating Merrick Back Country Raw Infused dog food for quite some time, but he wouldn't touch the food from this new bag. The dried pieces of meat in the bag looked super dry and crumbly. I bought another bag from my usual vendor, and he immediately ate it. I'm having to mail this back to Amazon and it should be thrown in the trash. Maybe it's old? I don't know, but it's a pain to have to ship back when if it was the usual quality, there would be no need.",

      "text": "First off, I need to clarify we make our own dog food, have been for years. But we do believe in adding a very small amount of well made dry kibble to our food. That being said, this dog food is a very good choice. Ingredients are rather straight-up compared to some of the other products out there that should not be fed to any dog, period. Highly recommend this product.",

The fact that this is a high-quality food, there's no chicken, high in protein, and its grain-free makes this a HUGE win for bulldogs (and other breeds). I've used MANY of the other \"top-priced\" brands and this is my favorite by far.",

And, because of that, I have had the same bag for a few months and that has caused the delicious freeze dried pieces to change texture. But...I am assuming that this is because it has been in tupperware container for too long. Merrick products are excellent and haven't had problems in the past.
