My mistake was not reading the reviews and looking at customer photos. I looked at star score and bought bc I was in a rush and needed something quickly. They will be returned for blatant false advertising. Blackout curtains literally blackout a room bc it does not allow any light to enter thru the material of the curtains. The curtains usually have a special lining in order to do this. The lining also helps w heat/cooling. These curtains have no lining, do not block out light, do not stop heat from coming thru.",

I absolutely do not feel any sound reduction with it at all (or perhaps I had had high expectation after reading some positive review about its noise feature). The fabric is thick and smooth. It does an acceptable job at blocking out the light. Some light could pass through even with the blind closed ( I bough a turquoise color). 2x up the curtains can totally block out the light ( I do this hoping it would be better with noise reduction, but....) The blind is good with heat insulation ( keep in mind I double up the curtain)",

I live in Barstow, CA, We have high temp of 100\u00b0+, I bought these for a wesr facing window that gets beat by the sun 5+ hours in afternoon. These curtains have blocked out sun & light 100%. The heat radiating fro this window has been blocked by at least 80%. These are amazing curtains and I will be purchasing more for 2 other windows. They are so soft and light weight. Not the old school heavy draperies! I hope they hold up thru the Summer months.",

Make sure the curtain isn't spread flat against your window. The flatter it is, the easier it will be for light to come through. Make sure they're pleated like in the pictures for the best results.",

Also these are legitimately soft and deceptive when you first feel them you would'nt imagine they would function well as blackout curtains but they are quite amazing. As with anything wash and dry before you hang up the first time, mine came out smooth as eggs. I'm planning on buying some more to be a matching set for my bedroom now.",

That's why we have irons. Will purchase again if I need a matching set.",

I haven\u2019t noticed any difference in noise but for the price these are the nicest curtains I\u2019ve ever owned. Also a tip, whenever you measure your window width make sure you at least double the inches and order enough panels to cover that so you get the pretty bunched up effect like the photo !",
