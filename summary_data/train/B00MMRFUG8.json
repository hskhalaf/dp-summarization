I have used very good dryers and dryers that are not as expensive like this one and never had one as bad as this. I cannot recommend this dryer it as really reminds me of the ones that are in the hotels that are left unused because of The unkept way it leaves your hair looking.",

I\u2019m loving this product and the price, say what?! I\u2019m tempted to order another for our RV!",
