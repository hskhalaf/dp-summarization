Absolutely Love Cannon cameras and products. This little camera is excellant and so lightweight easy to use and automatically adjusts for the scene itself. Highly recommend this camera, it is hands down the best camera and so easy to use. I think I will also get me a second one as a back up, as items are always being updated or changed and I just Love this one!! Great purchase don't miss out! Photos are outstanding!",

Note: When I took my old one to the camera shop to be fixed, they couldn't do it because there aren't many parts on the market for it any more. The owner of the camera store said \"It's a shame I can't fix it because you just can't find quality like this in any of the newer models.\" I immediately came to Amazon where you can pretty much always find what you need and sure enough, they had one available. I'm glad I got it! Thanks Amazon!",

The cameras image quality is very good and has good low light performance with the added bonus of the Image Stabilization. The startup time is fast, and time from shot to shot is fast as well. The camera is easy to use, but the smaller buttons take some getting used to. In addition, I find myself holding the camera a little awkwardly because of my big hands and the cameras small size- but I chose a small camera! Overall, great!",

Very disappointing after only 10 months of use for this to happen. After googling a bit, I found out that a lot of Canon point and shoot cameras frequently get Lens errors. It's something that Canon refuses to address, apparently. This camera's functionality is good enough, but I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's great. The lens is also highly delicate and easily susceptible to damage.",

Has the extra of being able to highlight only one hue, or to exchange a colour for another. Sadly, after 8 years of use the exposimeter stopped working when the zoomed was used, so bought the same model as a replacement. I like it that much.",

I Have a class 6 8 GB card it and runs smooth and it has about an hour of vid in HD to record. I Also like the zoom its pretty clear, my gf has a kodak 14. mp camera and we compared video and picture quality and the canon dominated it. The video is standard definition is pretty good but its even clearer in hd. I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone who wants a small but powerful device.",

When taking a picture, the preview screen looks correctly exposed, but then when the shutter is half-pressed the camera focuses and the preview goes very dark. Happens in \"P\" and \"Auto\" modes. I've only used the camera for a couple of weeks, and hopefully I can work around this by adjusting the E/V compensation, but for a point-and-shoot I shouldn't have to. Expected better from Canon.",

I had a Nikon Coolpix L100 before, but it was stolen out of my suitcase at the airport, so I decided I needed something smaller that could go in my purse, but a good level of clarity. This one is clear, easy to operate, and easy to load onto the computer. A very good camera in every way, and perfect for me, a grandma who forgets to take pictures unless the camera is close at hand.",

The moral of the story: be careful what you buy and read the small print. Adorama Camera have a very poor return policy and Amazon won't help you. Go to a real \"big box\" store ie; Best Buy.

It does fit right in my pocket.I like the button size, but my husband has trouble because he has big fingers.You definately have to make sure that you hold the button half way down so that the camera has time to focus before pushing it all the way down, or your pictures will come out blurry.

    "description": "Color:SilverFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n Shy and modest is so yesterday. Get ready for brilliance that's the center of attention once the PowerShot SD1400 IS Digital ELPH camera is in your hands. First glance says it all: nothing moves you like the impact of sleek sculpture, especially when it's drenched in the purest, ripest colors. Inside, Canon engineers defy micro-space with big, brilliant innovation. \n\nPowerShot SD1400IS Highlights \n\n14.1-megapixel resolution and large, 2.7-inch PureColor System LCD\n\n\nCanon's commitment to innovation defines the excitement of the PowerShot SD1400 IS Digital ELPH. 14.1-megapixel resolution is more than a number, it's your cutting-edge link to the outstanding clarity and quality you've always wanted in your images. Think bold and big, because razor-sharp oversized prints are a breeze. Get the picture? It's absolutely brilliant. \n\nThe PowerShot SD1400 IS Digital ELPH gives you a large 2.7-inch LCD screen for excellent control when framing your shots. The Canon PureColor System LCD offers spectacular color, resolution and contrast even when viewed at an angle. The screen is highly durable and easy to see in any light with a scratch-resistant, anti-reflective coating. It also features Night Display for easy viewing in low light--a perfect feature for gathering friends and family around to see your images. \n\nSleek, slim, sophisticated\nIt takes meticulous engineering to create a camera so slim and stylish and yet so impressively equipped with the most advanced Canon camera features. Cool, assured and ready to hit the road with loads of fashion impact. The PowerShot SD1400 IS Digital ELPH will be your fave fashion accessory. Sleek enough to tuck anywhere. Bold enough to be the center of attention. \n\n28mm wide-angle lens, 4x optical zoom and Optical Image Stabilizer\nThe PowerShot SD1400 IS Digital ELPH has a 28mm wide-angle lens with 4x optical zoom lens that makes it easy to get not only breathtaking panoramas, but also the inspiring, emotive close-ups that will make your images lasting keepsakes. This magnificent lens gives you the power to shoot distant subjects with razor-sharp precision and stunning lifelike color. So you can brilliantly capture a closer shot of a landscape, or a child's big smile. \n\n\n\nThe PowerShot SD1400 IS Digital ELPH is equipped with the acclaimed Canon Optical Image Stabilizer, which automatically detects and corrects camera shake--one of the leading causes of fuzzy or blurred shots. Even when zoomed in, you can get the steady, crisp, brilliant images you'll be proud to shoot and share. And the Canon Optical Image Stabilizer technology is so convenient to use. It functions perfectly with or without a flash. \n\n\n720p HD movie shooting capability plus HDMI output\nThe PowerShot SD1400 IS Digital ELPH lets you record video in beautiful 720p high definition (1280 x 720 pixels). The camera also makes it easy to enjoy HD movies (and still photos) on your HDTV with a mini-HDMI connector for direct connection to a high definition TV monitor. You'll enjoy the HD experience with no degradation of image or audio in the signal, plus the ability to display up to 130 still images at once. \n\nLet Smart AUTO do the work for you by intelligently selecting from 22 settings\nJust set the Canon PowerShot SD1400 IS Digital ELPH to Smart AUTO and you're ready for maximum enjoyment from your picture-taking every time. It's a relaxing and satisfying way to shoot because you can completely concentrate on your subject knowing that the camera has the technical details covered. Advanced Canon technology intelligently analyzes your situation and shooting conditions. Then it automatically selects an appropriate setting from 22 specially defined settings. So whether you're photographing flowers, a captivating sunset, or your friends at the park, you can be confident that you're getting dramatic, memorable images. \n\nShooting Modes\nAdvanced presets for the best possible photos under certain conditions. With 22 Shooting Modes, you're ready for whatever shot comes your way. \n\nBring creativity to your photos with new scene modes such as Miniature Effect and Fisheye Effect\n\nThe Canon PowerShot SD1400 IS Digital ELPH offers creative effects similar to those found in certain professional lenses. Miniature Effect creates an illusion where very large objects appear in miniature proportions. Turn soaring cityscapes into a scene in seemingly dollhouse-like proportions. \n\n\nFisheye Effect uses barrel distortion to warp the image around the center, giving a distinctive curvature effect to the photo. The curvilinear images produced by Fisheye Effect can suggest the curve of the Earth, the inside of a dome, or the image you see through the peephole of a door. \n\nISO of 400-6400 in Low Light mode\nNow even scenes notorious for having insufficient light, such as those lit by candles, fire, or street lamp, come through in fantastic color and clarity, with less noise. You can keep the feel of the scene intact without adding additional light, so the result will be scenes with the visual accuracy, depth and clarity you expect from a Canon camera. \n\n\nNew Smart Shutter technology\nSmart Shutter, which includes Smile Self-Timer, Wink Self-timer and Face Self-timer, detects faces in the scene and releases the shutter automatically in response to the appearance of an additional face, or when a smile or sassy wink occurs. These technologies take the guesswork out of your photography, allowing you to focus solely on your subject and get the perfect shot. \n\nWhat's in the Box  * PowerShot SD1400 IS Digital ELPH Body \n * Lithium-ion Battery Pack NB-4L \n * Battery Charger CB-2LV \n * Wrist Strap WS-DC7 \n * Digital Camera Solution CD-ROM \n * USB Interface Cable IFC-400PCU \n * AV Cable AVC-DC400",
