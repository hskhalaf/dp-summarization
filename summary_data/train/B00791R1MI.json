Bottom line is in order to see whether it is covered or not, I will have to potentially pay shipping both ways and probably the repair cost if they decide it is not covered. Apparently, their local retailers in Cincinnati will not provide this service. Good watch, but lousy warranty & customer service.",

If it doesn't, just set the digital time to the correct time, and the analog hands will auto-set, simple! Highly recommended!",

Two years ago I moved from Michigan to South Texas, and the sweat and the heat have not had any deleterious effects.

      "text": "Great watch for the price! I bought it for use in law enforcement as I don't like to spend a lot of money on things like watches that might get torn up. It has everything I need: analog and digital times, date, alarms, stop watch, date, etc. Easy to use and read. The only warning I have is since this is a solar powered watch, it needs regular access to sunlight. The instruction suggests about 10-minutes a day. If you don't work in the daylight, just make sure it gets the recommended exposure. The watch will shut off features as the battery approaches discharge, but the analog time will work until the battery dies.",

Upper right \"light\" button will dig into the back of your hand, especially if you put your hand into a \"push-up\" position. This is very annoying. The \"light\" button doesn't light up the dial, only the the very tiny digital display. Want to know what time it is in the dark, well you are out of luck.",

About the only really important thing is to follow the directions for setting up the watch exactly. I inadvertently skipped a step and messed up my day/date function.
