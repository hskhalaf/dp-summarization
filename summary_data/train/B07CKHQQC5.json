      "text": "I purchased these ECCO Men's Soft 7 Slip in my size 43. These shoes fit up to one size too large. In addition the lining was not leather as in description. These ECCO shoes were incorrectly designed by incompetent shoe designers. Unlike the lace up shoes, slip on shoes don't have a tongue or laces and need to compensate for that, only then they will fit properly. When I buy ECCO lace up shoes I always use Pedag insoles for a much better fitting and greater comfort. Unfortunately even with Pedag insoles these shoes were too large and would not fit right. Will be returning them!",

Sole is kind of an amber color. Kind of bummed I didn't get the black/black but a great price and very comfortable.",
