Yes, Fujifilm game up on supporting the product almost as soon as it hit the shelves, leaving early adopters like me adrift. But it's such a cool concept, and while it's not perfect, it actually does work. Dead format and all, I'm still glad I bought it. Maybe Techmoan will do an episode on it one day.",

I like 3d, and unfortunately most people could not afford to get the TVs and cameras and camcorders which provided that. This is or was an affordable camera that gave nice 3d stills.",

      "text": "While I can only watch my 3D pictures on this camera at this time, I enjoy taking these photos, knowing someday I will also look at these photos on a future 3D device. The only issue I have is that the selector dial that allows you to choose the style of photo you wish to take can spin as you put it in and out of your pocket. The result is that you can accidentally take a non-3D photo, or a \"night-time\" photo, before you realize it. Also, many of the photos are blurry, not sure why. However, if this is not going to be your only camera, I think it is a good purchase.",

The only real problems with it are: it's *very* delicate. it does not handle bumps well. And of course - it's really hard to show your pictures to anyone. It does come with a glasses-less 3D viewfinder (it's amazing to look at 3D photos on it) but unless you have a 3D TV or computer monitor - or you're one of the new gen getting VR headsets, it'll be difficult to enjoy your photos on anything but the camera's viewfinder.",

Scene composition is much more important, and you really have to mess around with Autofocus to get some scenes to focus properly. You also need to practice staying the correct distance from your subject. Most importantly, you have to pay attention to objects at the edges of the scene. Once you master these issues, you can take really impressive pictures with this camera. Just be prepared to burn through a lot of pictures before you get it right.",

As I gather these are no longer in production, with this large price drop I bought this as a spare and a backup, as it may be a few years or more until some other company makes a two-lens digital 3-D camera. If you have a 3-D TV and want to take and view your own 3-D pictures on it, this makes it almost as easy as using a 2-D digital camera. There is free software online called StereoPhoto Maker (search for it) that allows viewing in multiple formats on your PC, or with 3-D computer monitors.",

The 3D pictures, taken with the FinePix W3 were absolutely stunning. So stunning in fact, that I'm not going to bother bringing my DSLR with me on future trips. I did purchase a 60inch LG 60LA6200 SmartTv that is capable of viewing the Fujifilm OMG 3D files using passive 3D glasses. Extremely happy with the FinePix W3 so much so, that I just ordered a 2nd one. Just make sure your fingers aren't covering the camera lens when you take the shot.",

    "title": "Fujifilm FinePix Real 3D W3 Digital Camera with 3.5-Inch LCD (Discontinued by Manufacturer)",
    "description": "The 10.0 megapixel ccd; 720p 3d high-definition video; 3x zoom lens; 3.5\" wide lcd screen; 2d & 3d high-definition shooting modes.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nCapture 3D HD movies and still photos. Shoot high-resolution 3D photos and movies effortlessly with 3D Auto. The FinePix REAL 3D W3 digital camera comes complete with two 10-megapixel sensors and two Fujinon 3x optical zoom lenses. This set-up allows you to capture high-definition, high-resolution images and movies in 3D effortlessly, just by selecting 3D Auto. What's more, your memories will be captured with stereo audio sound in movie mode. \n\n\n\nTwo sets of lens that work in the same way as human eyes. Our ability to perceive depth comes from viewing an object along two different lines of sight. This phenomenon is called parallax. The FinePix REAL 3D W3 is fitted with two lenses to capture realistic images that are unchanged from how human eyes see them. Both optical 3x zoom lenses capture subjects beautifully, even from a distance. The camera's newly developed stainless steel frame maintains the optical axis with high precision. \n\nAll these features are combined in a light, compact, stylish body. With its two 10 megapixel sensors, the FinePix REAL 3D W3 captures even the finest of details. The synchronized control of the two sensors and lenses prevents any inaccuracy between the two images and produces a perfectly matched pair of images which, when combined, produce a single image with a very natural sense of depth. Image data captured by the twin lens-CCD system is processed by the newly developed RP (REAL PHOTO) Processor 3D HD. The technology merges the left and right images into a single image. This processor is also the power behind 3D Auto--the function that lets even first-time users take stunning HD-quality images effortlessly. And not only can it shoot in spectacular 3D, but you can also switch to standard 2D mode and use it as a normal camera. There are even special features that allow you to use the fact that the camera has two lenses and two sensors and take two different photos at once. Super Intelligent Flash and Scene Position are featured to automatically make the optical settings to match your scene. \n\nPlus, you can see your 3D movies and photos with the naked eye. The large 3.5-inch LCD screen displays high-resolution, high-contrast 3D images and movies without the need for glasses. See it in all its glory with your own eyes. High Luminosity Mode displays images 1.5x brighter and reproduces color 1.8 x deeper, allowing you to enjoy clear, distinct and vivid images. Simply connect your W3 camera to a 3DTV using a HDMI cable and sit back and enjoy all your photos and home movies in amazing high definition 3D. Try out Fujifilm's 3D printing system which prints 3D images directly on to special lenticular sheets. The result is photos with spectacular depth, and memories preserved in beautiful 3D. \n\nFinePix REAL 3D Technology pioneers a new dimension in imaging \n\nFujinon Lens - Two Sets of Lens that Work in the Same Way as Human Eyes\nOur ability to perceive depth comes from viewing an object along two different lines of sight. This phenomenon is called parallax. The FinePix REAL 3D W3 is fitted with dual lenses to capture realistic images that are unchanged from how human eyes see them. Both optical 3x zoom lenses capture subjects beautifully, even from a distance. The camera's newly developed stainless steel frame maintains the optical axis with high precision. All these features are combined in a light, compact, stylish body. \n\n3D CCD System - Natural Sense of Depth with Synchronized Control of Two CCDs\nWith its two 10 megapixel sensors, the FinePix Real 3D W3 captures even the finest of details. The synchronized control of the two sensors and lenses prevents any inaccuracy between the two images and produces a perfectly matched pair of images which, when combined, produce a single image with a very natural sense of depth. \n\nRP (REAL PHOTO) Processor - New REAL PHOTO Processor 3DHD\nImage data captured by the dual lens-CCD system is processed by the newly developed RP (REAL PHOTO) processor 3DHD. The technology merges the left and right images into a single image. This processor is also the power behind 3D Auto - the function that lets even first-time users take stunning HD-quality images effortlessly. \n\nAdvanced 2D Mode \n\nWith two lenses and two sensors, the W3 camera is effectively two cameras in one. These advanced 2D modes allow you to benefit from the two cameras independently with Dual Shooting modes taking two shots at the same time and capturing the same scene in different colors, at different zoom lengths and at different sensitivities. \n\nTele/Wide Simultaneous Shooting\nZoom in on your subject and also take a wide-angle shot of the same scene at the same time. The twin-lens system lets you freely set the zoom magnification for one lens while the other is set to wide angle, letting you capture the exact same instant with totally different angles of view.\n* With Tele/Wide Simultaneous Shooting, the left lens can zoom while the right lens is fixed in a wide angle setting. \n\n2-Color Simultaneous Shooting\nChange the settings and with one press of the shutter, you can take two photos of the same scene with a different color tonality. Set one lens system to Standard and the other to the vivid colors of Chrome. You can also capture the scene in both Standard and vintage Black & White or shoot simultaneously with Chrome and Black & White. Fujifilm doubles your enjoyment of every moment. \n\n2-Sensitivity Simultaneous Shooting\nTake two photos of the same instant - one at high sensitivity and one at low sensitivity. For example, you can take panned shots of a moving subject at the exact same instant with different degrees of background motion blur. In dark scenes, you can prioritize blur reduction for one shot, and image quality for the other. For times when you are not sure which sensitivity setting is best, you can shoot the moment at two settings and later pick the image to keep during playback. \n\nIntuitive Interface & Operation \n\nIntroducing easy to navigate interface and smooth operation for a better 3D / 2D shooting experience. \n\nDesign & Interface\nOne-hand grip slim design; featuring grip parts, this body delivers you the utmost grip comfort when shooting and opening the barrier with one hand. \n\nSliding Barrier\nWith a sliding barrier protecting the lenses, the camera is designed for ease of operation. \n\nOne-touch 3D/2D Switch\nControl button for one-touch switching between 3D and 2D shooting and playback \n\nMode Dial\nSmooth mode dial control can easily be done when choosing for the right shooting mode. \n\nSlim Body\nDesigned with the smart look, this compact slim body allows mobility and convenience. \n\nPlayback Function\nFeaturing an innovative 3D viewing LCD monitor, you can playback the results both in 3D and 2D right on the spot. \n\nMicro Thumbnail View\nUp to 100 pictures can be viewed at a time in a 10x10 array of micro thumbnails. Convenient for smooth and comfortable playback. \n\nSlideshow\nBring your photos to life! Close-ups of detected faces are shown in slideshow style. \n\n3D File Format\nFor 3D image recording, the FinePix REAL 3D system adopts the MP format for stills and 3D-AVI format for movies. MP format is the \"multi-picture format\" standardized by CIPA. FinePix REAL 3D W3 can also simultaneously record still images in both MP format (3D) and JPEG (2D). 3D-AVI adopts the widely used AVI multimedia container format. Adoption of these formats enables 2D playback of recorded images on the user's current personal computer. \n\nSD/SDHC Memory Card Slot\nThe versatile card slot is compatible with SD and high-capacity Secure Digital (SDHC) memory cards. \n\nExpanded World of \"View 3D\" \n\n3D excitement begins the moment you see the stunning form and builds as you experience the innovative interface. \n\n3.5-inch Widescreen 3D LCD Monitor\nSee your 3D movies and photos with the naked eye The large 3.5-inch LCD screen displays high-resolution, high-contrast 3D images and movies without the need for glasses. See it in all its glory with your own eyes! \n\nLenticular Lens System\nFujifilm's unique 3D monitor enables you to enjoy 3D images just with your naked eyes. The Finepix REAL 3D W3 uses an array of microscopic concave lenses to produce binocular disparity. This technology prevents on-screen flickering and crosstalk. \n\nImages come to life on the bright LCD display\nHigh Luminosity Mode displays images 1.5x* brighter and reproduces color 1.8x* deeper allowing you to enjoy clear, distinct and vivid images.\n* Compared to previous models. \n\nHigh-resolution 1.15 million dot LCD\n3D images are shown on a high resolution 1.15 million dot LCD. The LCD ensures perfect portrayal of fine detail and color. \n\nCrisp 3D Shots with Low Crosstalk\nEnjoy natural, effective 3D images with reduced \"crosstalk\" (or double exposure) which is typically present in 3D images. \n\nSimply connect with HDMI cable to enjoy HDTV-quality images\nSimply connect your W3 camera to a 3DTV using a HDMI cable* and sit back and enjoy all your photos and home movies in amazing high definition 3D!\n\n* Commercially available HDMI cable (high speed type) required. \n\nHigh Resolution 3D Print System\nTry out Fujifilm's 3D printing system which prints 3D images directly on to special lenticular sheets. The result is photos with spectacular depth, and memories preserved in beautiful 3D. \n\nEdit your 3D Images on MyFinePix Studio\nEdit your 3D images using the MyFinePix Studio software* included.
