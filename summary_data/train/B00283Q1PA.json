      "text": "Wanted a case with a snug fit and figured getting one that was specifically for ESP F series would work well. Wrong. The case arrived missing a latch. It wasn't in the box so it's not even like it came off in transit. Even if the latch wasn't missing, the case seems pretty flimsy especially for the price. I would think the case should have been at least flush when latched but the whole thing seemed pretty shoddy. And to top it off, my bass didn't even fit in the case. So much nope that I should have just sucked it up and went to guitar center for a generic case.",

Good thing the other 3 work well. Disappointing for the price. Bought 2 other cheaper cases for other guitars and they are much better overall quality. Feel bad saying that. At least ESP makes awesome instruments.",

You have to force the bass guitar into the case to get it to fit but once you get it squeezed in there, the bass is protected well. I like the large storage compartment as it's big enough to fit extra string packs, tools, etc... Overall, the quality is good. Although it's not perfect, it will be road worthy enough to do what it's intended for.",
