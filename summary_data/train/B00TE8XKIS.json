It will not take clear crisp pictures so in return you get tiny pics with lots of pink backgrounds. Another Christmas present down the tubes. Disappointed to say the least.",

The pictures are small- the size of an ID or credit card. I had no problems with lighting, and that is even with the lights turned down for the dance. Overall, they made perfect little keepsakes.

The software has this capability, but it doesn't work. Some idiot at Polaroid and his department manager should be fired for ruining this experience and not having it fixed by now. I would not buy it until the software is fixed.",

Kids in particular have never seen instant photos so its like magic. I've been back several times since and it's still magic. One tip: the printer does print darker than the photo appears on screen at full screen brightness. Bump up the photo brightness about 10 to 15% in the app before printing and you'll be golden.",

Color calibration has to be done after each pack (10 photos) and after the 7th or 8th print it starts to get a little dark. This can be corrected by keeping the calibration card and doing it more often. Otherwise, it's awesome little photo printer and definitely worth the money.",

      "text": "Although is printer isn\u2019t horrible. I do not think it was worth the price listed. The film is even expensive for no reason. It\u2019s very cheap film. The quality of the pictures is not good at all. Most would come out with white streaks and cartoonishly looking. I wanted something I could print pictures I already had so it does that just fine. But again, it\u2019s very poor quality. The editing app doesn\u2019t give u a lot of options either. The tools they have are dramatic to. All in all , this does what it says. But I\u2019d price this around 40-50$ not the listed price.",

I had to take out 6 tiny screws to get to the roller and it was jammed so bad ill be returning it. I couldnt pull it out. Only way to get it out would be taking apart the roller components. My guess is the sticky paper backing came off and its literally stuck on the inside. Printed out a total of 13 before the jam. Bad design...id avoid because it will jam...just a matter of time and when it does you better hope its within your returning period.",
