If I was a geek, I'd get one of the programmable routers that can eliminate some problems and optimize speed and reliability. I did some research at the time and this seemed to be the best balance of price/performance. I typically get downloads/uploads at 10MB/S (100Mb/s). That limit is from my ISP, this unit can go faster. UPDATE 190713: There is a software update available for this unit. I've been trying to install it for two years but the update is defective and won't install. Down to 4 stars until fixed.",

And it doesn't take up much space and looks pretty good sitting on a table in the family room. Would recommend to someone looking for a decent high-speed dual-band mid-range router.
