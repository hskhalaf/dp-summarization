They have a great foot bed & arch support. I usually buy 2 pair each year. Some for every day & others for dressy. The best part when they start looking grimy or worn you can send them in to be refurbished at a nominal price. Mephisto even pays shipping. I love them!!!!!!",

(I also suggest softening the nubuck with an appropriate leather cleaner too) Overall very happy with my new purchase though (and their shoes-if taken care of-last a LONG time...i am still wearing a comfy pair that i got over 7 years ago!)",

I just received this pair and will be in the market for another (brown or black).

Note, I'm a true 5.5 in all brands of shoes, from inexpensive to high end, but I wear a size 5 in Mephistos, and they always fit perfectly.",

It has arch support, is comfortable, and is stylish as well. It comes in many colors. My favorite is black. The only thing I would change about it is the color of the footbed. I would prefer a black footbed with black sandals instead of gray. But, this is a small concession when evaluating the shoe's comfort, support, and versatility. I recommend this sandal to anyone.",
