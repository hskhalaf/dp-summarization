Im not sure if i should get in contact with them for a replacement or not. I 'm not sure if i want a dual caliper again after this experience. Nor if it would be covered.",

The weird thing is the metric rule on top reads as expected. The inch slider on bottom sometimes trip me up. Is the slider BEFORE the line? AFTER the line? ON the line? I can't always tell. Funny - I don't have the same problem with the metric slider even though they're on the same piece of metal. Fortunately, this device has both inches and millimeters. Whenever I'm in doubt, I read them both and convert them. Its a good way to check if you've read it correctly.",

Some other calipers have this kind of a dial. But I've noticed that most specs that require caliper level measurements use decimal point measurements of inches (like .460 inches). I guess if you want to know if something is 3/8\", you use a tape measure or do the calculation from decimal to fraction.",

Also included a (hinged) black plastic case with nice foam insert for the tool.",

The killer is that you can buy digital ones from Harbor Freight for 1/3 of the cost of this item but if you are old-school like me and want to see the measurement then these are the ticket for you.
