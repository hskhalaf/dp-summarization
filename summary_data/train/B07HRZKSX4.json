Not sure what that's all about but it was a nice surprise. if you want to get into the real technical details of this board watch buildzoid's videos on youtube. all in all, gigabyte has the best VRM of the generation of boards, and the worst bios (not a big deal).",

Have since straightened the the whole thing out and am very pleased with the performance of the MB.

The computer posted immediately at the profile 2 speed (4000MHz) and is gaming (so far) stable. I didn't try profile 1 (4133 MHz). I'm very satisfied with the MB to date. If you want 16GB of ram, which is all that's needed for gaming, I recommend you go with 4X4GB with this MB.",

What I do love is that I put an M.2 SSD to run as my primary drive, and it found it immediately, and the OS install was flawless. Thank you for a great product!!!",

It's also the only MB I found with this many USB ports. The only drawback I've found so far is that the included documentation only shows how to overclock for i9 processors and it sort of implies that overclocking with i7s is not going to work out. It's doesn't EXPLICITLY say that, but the fact that the instructions are specifically for i9s, gives me cause for concern. I also had a hard time finding anything online for OCing anything other than i9 with this MB.",

A freeze during a trade would be a very bad event for me. Make sure to use an external video-card if possible. On the first startup the motherboard would power up and then power down multiple times before starting up fully leaving me pretty worried. After getting past those issues, it's a pretty solid motherboard.",
