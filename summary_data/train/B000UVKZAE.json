      "text": "I hate to throw away old tools. It seems the older the tool, the better the steel. I had an old ball pein hammer head that only needed a new handle. So many of the big box hardware stores no longer sell replacement handles. Glad to see Amazon offers these items. The wood on the replacement handle is tight grained and sealed with a clear coating. I had to trim the new handle to fit into the hammer head and used a bench grinder to profile the shape for a tight fit. The handle seems to be of good quality and should last for as long as I need.",

Of the 3 I bought, 2 had the grain in the wrong orientation and the 3rd had a 15 degree bend in the neck of the handle. Guess that works if you are right handed. finish is fine and no defects in the hickory itself. It will work for a ball pein, but I'd be much more selective if replacing a maul or sledge handle.",

I am a contractor, not a machinist, so this handle worked fine for my 16oz estwing ball-peen head. The grain was pretty close to parallel with the swing, and the slot cut in the top was off center. And i had to file it down quite a bit in order for it to fit, But im happy with it because you get what you pay for, and for 8$ it met my needs.",

Hickory hammer handles are available in Australia, but the grain seems very plain compared to the beautiful grain in the handles I just bought through this web site. Hickory I believe is the best anti-shock / vibration hammer handle there is. I will be handing down to my daughter two show piece hammers. Thank you, guys, because there are many US sites that don't post to Australia and you do. :-)",
