However, after a few months the camera has started to display some serious issues: sometimes when recording, the screen will be overlaid with flashing pink static lines (an example has been attached); after pressing the button to stop a recording, the camera takes an additional 5-10 seconds to actually stop recording before freezing, and another 5-10 seconds to unfreeze and become useable again. The camera has never been dropped, and is always transported in a camera bag. I'm not sure if the product I received is defective, because I've read nothing but rave reviews about the G7, but all in all I'm extremely disappointed with the camera I received.",

Also the wheel for the shutter speed was a bit misplaced and it was too easy to accidentally move while simply holding the camera. Eventually I returned this for the G85 which resolved all my complaints. Again I don't hate this camera, it just wasn't right for me. But it is far from being a bad camera.",
