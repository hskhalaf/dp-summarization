If purchased, the 30mm should be a bit flatter as it does not have the Fn button. This lens take a 43mm filter, the OEM 20-50mm lens takes a 40.5mm filter. This can be confusing as my previous experience with several SLR/D-SLR cameras filters have generally been of the same size, except for speciality lenses.",

      "text": "This is the 3rd lens I bought for NX10 (first one being the kit zoom, second one the 30mm \"wide normal\" pancake), and I have a feeling it will be a permanent fixture on my NX10. For street photography, this is a greatly welcomed focal length (equivalent to 30mm in 35mm-photography). 28mm-equivalent would be a little too wide, and my other \"wide normal\" pancake with 45mm-equivalency is too narrow. There are some pincushion-effect distortions, which is something I do like in a wide lens, but not drastic. The picture resolution is great - pretty sharp. Since I bought this lens, the other two lenses have been collecting dust.",

Extremely satisfied with quality, easy of use, and value for the money. I recommend it.",
