They will NOT honor the warranty and the repair with shipping is $110.00. Keep in mind the Camera only cost $159.00 new. I own 4 other Digital Camera's (All Kodak) had one problem which they handled promptly and professionally. I was WRONG to assume I would get the same treatment from Nikon",

I went shopping and after about 2 hours, I finally picked this camera.

I have read other reviews and it appears this is a common problem for this make and model. I take very good care of my cameras and I usually replace them after 3+ years because of technology, not because they stop working. DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!",

However, it's the first Coolpix to use the VR designation that uses \"digital\" VR instead of the proven and preferable lens shift and CCD shift VR. On the positive side, it uses a reliable lithium-ion battery system, and Nikon is much more reasonable than many brands on accessories such as batteries. The SD card choice makes it a bit easier to find cards at reasonalbe prices and in remote locations than some of its competitors. A solid camera, but nothing you can't get for less in other brands.",

In some cases I was able to compensate by reducing resolution of the final picture, but if I tried to do any cropping or enlargement, the results were disappointing. This 7 MP camera is far worse than my previous 3 MP Kodak model. I thought that buying Nikon would guarantee decent quality, but I was mistaken.",

Bought it new from J&R in August 2007 for $199, and now it sells for $129. I think they had to drop the price since the manufacturing quality is poor. As others have commented the picture quality is poor, so I'm going to try Canon or HP as the replacement.",

    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\nAs one of the smaller digital cameras on the market, the Coolpix S200 combines a high-quality optical zoom lens with a range of automatic and preset shooting modes that will satisfy the most discerning of point-and-shoot photographers. Featuring a 7.1-megapixel CCD, a high quality 3x optical Zoom-Nikkor 38-114mm glass lens, plus a 3x digital zoom, the Coolpix S200 delivers stunning prints up to 16 x 20 inches simply and easily. \n\n The Coolpix S200 also features 15 specially-programmed modes to automatically handle focus, exposure, white balance and other adjustments that help you take great pictures easily. \n\n Nikon Coolpix S200 Highlights \n\n 3x Optical Zoom-Nikkor glass lens High-quality lenses deliver high-quality pictures. The Zoom-Nikkor lens gives you the power of 3x optical zoom lens (38-114mm for 35mm equivalent), while Macro capability lets you get as close as 3.9 inches. This combination is supported by Nikons world-renowned optical technology to deliver crisp, clear images. \n\n Electronic VR image stabilization Stability advanced... images enhanced. You can shoot sharper, clearer and without blur with Nikons ingenious Vibration Reduction. VR Image Stabilization detects and corrects for camera movement to give you rock-steady results time after time in lower light. So effective, it even lets you shoot in lower light. \n\n ISO 1000 capability The Coolpix S200 can be manually set as high as 1000 ISO, for better pictures in lower light. \n\n Incredible, bright 2.5-inch LCD Makes shooting and sharing pictures easier. The Coolpix S200 is equipped with an incredible 2.5-inch LCD great for viewing images anywhere, anytime. Anti-reflective coating makes it easier for everyone to see and enjoy images. The larger LCD lets you make the most of smooth, sharp movies, and greatlooking stills. \n\n \n\n The Coolpix L12 One-Touch Portrait button Its easier than ever before to get great-looking results. Your shortcut to three unique innovations, the one-touch portrait feature offers instant access to Face-Priority AF and In-Camera Red-Eye Fix for optimized image capture, and lets you transform exposure after the fact with Nikons powerful D-Lighting. \n\n D-Lighting In playback mode, D-Lighting will compensate for underexposed images or insufficient flash by adding light and detail to selected shots where needed, without affecting properly exposed areas. \n\n Face-Priority AF To ensure superb portraits with crisp focus, select Face-Priority AF (in Portrait Scene mode). This feature automatically finds the subjects face and focuses on it. \n\n In-camera color options & QuickTime movie with sound Shoot a QuickTime movie with sound at 30 frames per second, and choose from five color shooting options (standard, vivid color, black and white, sepia, cyanotype). \n\n Transfer Directly to Printer, TV or Web \n\n Print directly from your camera You can transfer images directly to print, without the need of a PC, when using PictBridge and USB Direct Print compatible printers. \n\n Connect directly to your TV Show friends and family the results on a grand scale with the supplied video cable. \n\n \n\nBlur warning alerts you to a burry image. Auto image rotation detects pictures that have been taken with the camera held vertically and automatically rotates the image for in-camera LCD playback. Noise Reduction mode minimizes digital artifacts in long exposures. In-camera cropping allows you to crop out the part of the image you dont want and keep the part you do. Color options allows you to make pictures more vivid or record monotones. Best Shot selector enables the camera to take a series of photos and automatically select the one with the sharpest focus. Date and time imprinting is available to document the exact time and date that your photo is taken. Voice Memo function records up to 20 seconds of sound that can be then attached to an image.",
