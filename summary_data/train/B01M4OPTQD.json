      "text": "I have a purebred German Shepherd and she's about a year and a half. She's always gone wild when I'm away, (tearing the couch up, cords, etc.) she has severe separation anxiety. We purchased the thunder shirt itself as well as the thunder essence. All you have to do is put the jacket on (replicates a hug, not too warm for the dog either) and spray 2-3 spritz of the spray. Together they work wonders!!! I leave it in her while I'm away and she quit shredding all my things! The spray smells like fresh lavender and she immediately calms to the smell. It's not too overwhelming! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND for any dog parents out there, 100% worth the money.",

Thunderstorms totally freak him out & he can sense them coming several hours prior. He has a thunder shirt which is helpful. I saw this product & decided to try it as a supplement. WOW! The results were amazing. 2 small sprays onto his bandanna calmed him down & he was completely relaxed. I no longer have to watch my dog shake & whine with no real way to help him.
