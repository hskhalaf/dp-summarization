We love the toys and buttons on the front, super simple but so far keeps our baby entertained. The pieces easily came together in under a minute & for this low of a price it\u2019s definitely a quality toy. The wheels turn great and I love that you can lock the back wheels for a slower pace! Doesn\u2019t have a lot of weight to it, but doesn\u2019t seem to be a big issue. Here\u2019s a clip of our son playing with it the first day.",

She really seems to like it and has spent a lot of time playing and pushing it. Has lots of little toys to push and pull on. I appreciate the volume control so the sounds don't drive you absolutely nuts. Our pediatrician told us that this was a good toy for her to have since it will help build core strength as she learns to walk. Assembly wasn't bad, but I was attempting to put it together on the bed and it works much better to have a hard surface to snap the legs down.",

The songs are annoying as with many of these toys with sounds but it was worth it to see how much fun she had with this. There are more things to do on this than on the cheaper walkers but both entertained her. In my mind, the big advantages of the VTech are (1) the slower speed setting for the wheels, which is nice on hard flooring for kids just learning to walk and (2) the phone, which is a lot of fun for kids.",

Key words, such as 'off, on, piano keys, telephone, wheels, walk, spin, say hello (when picking up the telephone). It has been very helpful as a walker with the two different walking settings located in the rear wheels. Especially, when your little one is just learning how to walk, the walker moves along with your child's pace without having them slip forward with the correct wheel setting. My son is ready to make a VTech commercial anytime :)",
