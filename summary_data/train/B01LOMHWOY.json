I also got it with the intention to fit my hamster in it for pictures and the size was perfect. I have the huge floaty so the tiny cup holder seemed great to add to the collection. I wish it were cheaper though and that they come in a pack option to share with friends on a pool day. Is an exact mini version of the huge floaty and it comes with a patch and instructions in case it gets damaged. Super fast to inflate and deflate.",
