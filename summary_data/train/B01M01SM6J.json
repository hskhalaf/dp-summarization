      "text": "I only had this cooker for a week and I've used it at least 5 times already for hot pot. I've very satisfied with my purchase. The design is simple and it heats up quickly. My only complaint is that I wish once we put it on the lock setting it won't turn off when you accidentally push the power button. I kept turning the cooker off because I would wipe it down whenever I would spill broth on it when I'm making hot pot and it would turn off. The pot could be better but it was an added bonus since most cooktops are around the same price but doesn't include a pot.",

Foam protected the heater and the pot pretty well. I still have the box and I easily put it back when I move.",

But, having the cooktop separated from the control by the plastic base is a really bad idea since spills that go into that crevice are extremely hard to clean (Eg, you accidentally let your pot boil over, and the fluids flow towards the controls and into said crevice). Would have totally kept this unit if the cooktop was completely flush and integrated with the controls (like most other induction cooktops)",

Main issue with this is - it overheats very quickly. By the time I make a few omelettes, it starts with E error codes ranging from overheating to incompatible cookware- the same one I had used last 15 minutes. Setting auto shutoff is also very tedious and it lacks preprogrammed settings which I found very useful. Definitely returning this item. I had previously owned Roswell, won't mind giving them another try with a different model",

Ridges in the bottom make it unusable for browning as the food does not come into complete contact with the cooking surface. I used it for bacon and ended up with stripped bacon. Should be ok for soups, spaghetti sauce, etc. I think I will be happy with this cooker because of the size. If size is not an issue another option might be better.",

Other desavantage is to set a tempeture you have press temp bottom too many time. Default time on screen is 30 min. If you want to sei it up at 29 min yo have to press temp bttom 59 times.",

Unfortunately it does not give you a lot of control of the cooking process. When you switch to temperature control you have only 50 degree increments which, especially at the lower levels ends up with either charred veggies or steamed. You cannot braise. I use the NuWave with I need precision and finesse. I use this if I just want to pan fry meat or deep fray with oil or boil water.",
