Where the foam thigh connects to the plastic leg just ripped right off. Definitely not the quality you would expect from a reputable company and the price I paid for the target. I will update again if the company makes it right. Also, in December the product was $145. Now it's listed for $115. I'm sure I'm not the only one having issues with their Glendel buck.",

Ended up removing field tips, spraying bolt with WD40, then with a hammer and a block of wood, freed the bolt a little bit from the back side until i could pull the bolt out using all my strength.

Also the connection from the plastic legs to the foam is slowly failing. On the positive side the target block is great material and I can easily see it lasting many years.

    "description": "GlenDel 3-D targets use PolyFusion Technology which results in longer target life. Because the layers are fused in place, they hold their position. Arrows find their way between layers. Fusing the internal layers to the inner target wall results in more uniform layer compression, which, in turn, means easier arrow removal. And, easier arrow removal means less shooter fatigue, which means you\u2019ll get more and better practice!",
