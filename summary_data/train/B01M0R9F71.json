Here's the breakdown: Pros: Very bright Long cord Easy and very sturdy switch Cons: The clamp is either weak or not sticky enough and can tend to slide from exactly where you want it Bottom Line: For the price of this, I can get over the weak clamp and if I really wanted to, I'm sure there is probably an easy fix for it. At the end of the day, if the clamp slips, just adjust the aim point of the light and you're good to go. If I need another clamp light I would buy this again.",

Totally adjustable you can aim the light in any direction, the clip held securely. So glad I got them.",

      "text": "Always looking around for another clamp light for the next long term project. I like the smaller 5.5 inch reflectors, as they do not get in your way like the 8.5\" or larger reflectors. The reflector screws on to the plastic fixture snugly, and without any wobble that makes you think it will fall off like others I have used. I have learned to use the new LED lights in these; they use far less power, with much more light, and they run cool which is important when dealing with a plastic fixture. One more feature of LED's, is that they can take a hit and not break which happens all the time with these work lights.",

I'd give them 4.5 stars as the price was acceptable as well.",
