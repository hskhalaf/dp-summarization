I have an eleven year old shepherd who is an excellent swimmer because of his age I wanted backup. I highly recommend this jacket and will be ordering two more for my other dogs. I got XL for 90 pound shepherd.",

Therefore if you have a fairly large dog get the XL. I ordered this because we will take her to see the Pacific Ocean this summer for the first time and since she loves, loves water I was concerned she'd be swept out.

My complaint is, because he is on the upper end of the sizing, the velcro strap that covers his belly is exposed (leaving the \"hook\" side of the velcro strap uncovered), and this becomes really uncomfortable for me when he sits in my lap for a long time, like he does on our boat. The exposed velcro is very scratchy, and I probably should have ordered a size up, if I'd known this. Just an FYI, not a deal breaker.

We will likely have to cut part of it off and sew the fabric together - however, this is my only complaint! Great quality, affordable price! My little dog doesn\u2019t seem to mind it much. Love having a life jacket for her in case she happens to fall in the water. Please consider making a smaller size for our little nuggets! :)",
