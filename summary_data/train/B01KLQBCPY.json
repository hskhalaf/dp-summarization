Having switched off the motor and rotating the turn table by hand there was no squeaking noise. I detached the drive belt from the platter and when I switched on the motor the squeaking was evident. Can the seller please advise on how to resolve this please. Or is this a defect that needs to be attended to.",

It\u2019s a perfect fit with my vintage Yamaha amp and speakers and the fitted Carbon cartridge and stylus is only \u00a327 when it needs replacing. Unless you are raging audiophile with a system costing \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u2018a, the Rega Planar 1 is all you need for your records to sound great.",

Simple to set up and play, no messing around setting up anti skate or balancing the tone arm , it\u2019s already done for you. Simply slide the tone arm weight on all the way to the stop , attach the dust cover and away you go. There are two schools of thought on the dustcover up/ down when playing or off. I personally didn\u2019t attach the cover so it\u2019s lift on/off and prefer it this way (no vibrations off the cover when playing) . At this price it\u2019s a steal and seriously worth the investment if you want maximum bang for your buck.",

Now finding myself buying new vinyl instead of CD's as the audio sounds so much more dynamic. This turntable provides levels of audio depth, clarity and subtlety which are simply amazing. Using with a Marantz PM4000 amp and B&W DM602 speakers and now feeling no desire to upgrade.. A small scratch on the Perspex lid was immediately rectified by Amazon by sending me a new lid (...showing excellent customer service as per usual).

Great response over the full frequency range and no audible motor noise. Very happy! Update: 3 months in and it still sounds superb. Vinyl collection has now grown considerably. Sounds amazing with brand new vinyl and records from 40years ago. Tempted now to go for the performance pack as the reviews are good.",

    "title": "Rega Planar 1 Turntable Gloss Black",
    "description": "The Planar 1 is pretty much a completely new turntable compared to the RP1, the only things kept the same are the drive belt, sub platter and dust cover. It features a brand new RB110 tonearm (which has its bias force preset so it can be set up in seconds) and is fitted with Rega designed bespoke zero play bearings. It's got a 24v low noise synchronous motor which reduces vibration transfer and it is the first entry level turntable Rega has ever made that includes a motor of that kind. The Planar 1 comes with a factory fitted Rega Carbon cartridge which is a high quality moving magnet pick-up cartridge designed to be simple to set up, easy to install, and above all accurately reproduce music.",
