It did not hold air. It's a shame, because, when fully inflated, it's fairly comfortable. I am returning it. When returning, it's a pain to get the mattress back in the original box.",

I think some folks are pulling this out of the box and blowing up minutes before flopping on it for the night. Stretch it out before sleeping on it. Don't go in dry rookies",

I use this camping in a smallish \"4-person\" 9' X 7' tent, so it's the perfect size. I bring a car jump-start battery unit with built-in AC power inverter to power the inflator, though it is possible to manually inflate with other smaller inflators when away from household AC outlets.

The first one only lasted a few months of use and the second one was used only 8 nights before it started to deflate during the night to the point that the sleeper's butt would be on the floor by morning!! It was only used intermittently and with normal use and care. We are in the middle of an extended trip and will need the use of an inflatable air mattress before the trip is over, so we will now have to find a store to buy one!! These are not well made at all!!",

The cord stores in the mattress/charging compartment and you get a great drawstring bag with it for proper storage. (If you prefer it softer the simply release some air from air nozzle, firmer....power it up and add more air.)",

When it arrived, it was easy to set up and that first night was the first night of a good night's sleep and was very comfortable. After approximately 1 1/2- 2 weeks, the mattress started loosing air in the middle of the night until it was deflated by the morning. This never got better until a friend offered him to borrow an extra mattress of his [a different brand] . It is reportedly not as comfortable as the Intex recreation mattress BUT it does not predictably deflate. Is this a freak occurrence or is this typical ? I would like Intex to make this right.",

When our company left it was easy to deflate by reversing the air pump that is built in. I folded it up and store it in the cloth bag that it came in.",

Just be careful not to puncture the bottom of the mattress when folding it up. We punctured ours this way, the motor actually poked a hole in the bottom of the mattress when we folded it up. However the patch kit provided made for an easy fix.",

    "title": "Intex Comfort Plush Mid Rise Dura-Beam Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump, Bed Height 13\", Full",
    "description": "The Comfort Plush Full Airbed is a part of the Dura-Beam series of airbeds that are providing amazing durability for years of lasting comfort. The secret is in the Fiber-Tech beam construction, which is comprised of thousands of high-strength polyester fibers that provide enhanced comfort, stability and support. Each bed is covered in plush flocking that is soft to the touch, and the horizontal air chambers provide added stability and support around the entire bed. The mattress is also equipped with a quality-tested, 20.8-gauge waterproof flocked top with 15-gauge vinyl beams and 16-gauge sides and bottom for durability. And best of all, the Comfort Plush mattress is remarkably easy to inflate thanks to the built-in, high-powered electric pump, which does its job in a mere 3 minutes. No more fussing with tiring hand or foot pumps or rummaging through the garage for your detached electric pump. And should the mattress feel a little too soft or firm, you can customize the comfort level with the touch of a button. The Comfort Plush is raised 13 inches from the floor, making it taller than most inflatable mattresses. And at 54 by 13 by 75 inches (W x H x L), the mattress is an official full size, making it a good fit for fitted sheets. The Comfort Plush Full bed--which offers a capacity of 600 pounds--is a terrific choice whether you're sleeping at the in-law's overcrowded house or setting up a guest bed in the basement. The mattress comes with an AC power cord and a duffel bag (for storage). Regarding Inflation: Measurements will vary based on the manner in which it is inflated and packaging disclaims \u201capproximate size\u201d. Airbeds are measured from the widest point including the beams (bulges) on the side and off the tallest point from the floor including built-in pillows if applicable. Location, temperature, and humidity will affect the airbed\u2019s firmness. Airbeds will need to be occasionally re-inflated (topped off) to maintain desired firmness when used for more than a few days as vinyl tends to relax over time.If electrical power is not available then a separately operated pump can be connected to the control valve for inflation: simply turn the control dial to the inflation symbol, insert the air pump nozzle into the valve at the center of the control dial, and inflate the airbed. Do not use flammable substances (like aerosol tire repair products) with your airbed. The mattress may ignite or explode.",
