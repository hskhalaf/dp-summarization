If you adjust the pillow to make it smaller then you have a lopsided pillow and the baby\u2019s head isn\u2019t stable. I wish it worked bc it\u2019s very soft but it\u2019s a large lump with one side higher than the other under my baby\u2019s neck just wasn\u2019t conducive to her sleeping well.

We now use it as much as possible when laying her on her back - carseat, swing, bassinet, play mat, changing table. Great for peace of mind & we think it really helps! Also love that it's very soft & that it'll be a neck support for when she's older! Definitely recommend!",
