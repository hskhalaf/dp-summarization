They\u2019re a good size for adult and dog-paw use, and I\u2019ve never had issues with them tearing in either situation.

Hes been using these for 4 months and no rash or allergic reaction:) my only complaint is that I wish these were weter. The baby wipes we use are so wet I refer to them as juicy, but these flushable wipes are dry and I end up adding some filtered water directly into the pack to get them more moisturerized.",
