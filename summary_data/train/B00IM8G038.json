Needless to say the size works better for them than a standard sized crib. When my older daughter would come visit she would like that she could get into the crib with the baby since it actually sat on the ground. She didn't have to worry about breaking the bottom. The only possible negative is that when the baby is small some people have a hard time leaning down and picking up the baby. Overall it is a great travel crib.",

Lightweight, great travel case (size of a large briefcase), easy to set up and break down, thicker mattress than most, shape that doesn't encourage baby to climb the walls, and finally -- the most important -- it is made entirely of mesh, so the risk of suffocation during sleeping is much reduced. We had a BabyBjorn cradle, and this is just like that in terms of the mesh wall materials. Baby squashes her face against the side to sleep and is just fine. Absolutely worth the price.",

You can still do it, but it makes the sheet bunch up a little which obviously is not what you want.

It's clearly a superior pack and play, I just think they are taking advantage of consumers as a result. I think $200 would be an adequate market, but I understand the current price reflect the economic reality of supply and demand. This is [probably] hands down the pack and play to buy.",

But why I think this is worth the extra money is the simplicity and quality of the product. I am not that great at building things, so being able to build and break this down in under 2 minutes is amazing. It\u2019s also super light weight and really anyone can carry it. Would HIGHLY recommend for any new parent that is looking for convenience and quality.",

My only complaint is that for a shorter person like myself, leaning over to lay down an infant is difficult because of the height of the crib. I startled my son awake a few times when trying to lay him down because I couldn\u2019t reach all the way. A zipper down the middle would be a good addition. The Guava crib might be a better option in this case.",

Only complaint is that the mattress sits on the floor so the baby is very low to pick up or lay down but that means there is no real weight limit. No biggie for me, but if back issues keep you from leaning low then it may pose a problem.",

We were also able to use it in the airports as a small play yard. It is very light and we carried it on each flight. Reccomend also buying a sheet to go with it from an Amazon retailer. Not the same size as traditional play yards so you won't find one in stores. Very easy set up as well.",

      "text": "I love, love, love this travel crib. It is ridiculously light and easy to set up. My only complaint (and it is small) is that, the first time I used it, I had a little difficulty figuring out how to fold the legs just so to put it back together. All you have to do is pull and bend, though, it's easy. We use this as a pack n' play and as the extra crib for our nanny share. I look forward to using this crib on the go! If all you want is a travel crib, without all the bells and whistles, this is what you need to get. It does not come with the crib sheet.",

Our daughter is now 2.5 and still sleeps in it with travels. After staying at hotels with questionable cribs this was our solution. We always check it through on flights and it has never been damaged. The sides are higher than the Graco cribs and the design has really dissuaded our daughter from wanting to get out! I also love that the mesh is washable!!!",
