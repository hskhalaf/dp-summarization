I took three stars off because I can\u2019t use it anymore. I\u2019ll be ordering something different. I recommend getting a hard plastic that won\u2019t deteriorate. AUGUST 2017: love this! It fits really well and has a strap with Velcro that goes underneath the screen to securely hold the screen in place. It works well with or without the keyboard attachment. It also looks really nice. It's super easy to slip in your bag and travel.",

I can't think of any other way to remedy this, design flaw on Microsoft's part really, since all other ports are external, and I highly doubt any other case has a \"better design to fix this problem\". It's not at all difficult to remove Surface Pro from the case, so regardless, 5 stars for good looks and durability!",
