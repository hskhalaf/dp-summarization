Yes, the bag's interior dimensions are just within the 62\" total size (L+H+W) limitation required by international air carriers. However, the dimension advertised is deceptive; it does not include the additional length and width caused by the handles and wheels. That makes this bag over-sized for international travel. In other words, it's too big.",

Now that airlines are charging for over weight bags it makes sense to have the lightest weight base possible. Polycarbonate is the way to go. Rugged and light weight. Love it.",
