The first is that you have to make sure the plastic tab engages when you rotate the coffee basket into place. Otherwise the coffee does not flow to the carafe. The second is that it takes FOREVER to brew a pot of coffee. The workaround for that is to pre-heat the water in a regular coffee pot container. Once you learn these tricks you get good coffee!

It makes wonderful coffee and when you order the case to put it in, super convenient to pack.

Had to hold coffee basket lid on . Then had to manually open drip pause button open wider . After about 30 min of this did finally get coffee ! Not worth the headache and burns!

Not sure if this is a product flaw or I got a lemon. Not a big deal though, I just make sure the little release valve is engaged.

      "text": "If you are like me and NEED your morning coffee, this is the camping coffee pot for you. Works just like a normal drip machine. Camp Coffee without the grounds in your teeth. One comment is that it is very slow to run a full pot full. I have not timed it, but it takes more than 30 minutes on my campers cook stove. One nice thing is that you can have the grounds and water ready on the burner, roll out of bed to turn on the burner. by the time the coffee is ready your camper is nice and warm.",

We go group camping several times a year and have at times kept 20 or more people supplied with their morning coffee by using two of these at a time. Makes up to 12 cups of drip coffee in 15 minutes. We have found these Coleman coffee makers reliable and easy to use. Sure they wear out as will anything but having to replace one every 3-4 years is no hardship and is commendable under their conditions of heavy use.",

It's a little slow, but I suppose you shouldn't be in a rush while camping anyway. Also be sure that the carafe is pushed all the way in, we had a little mishap the first time using it because it wasn't in all the way and water ended up over flowing out of the top.",

It worked beautifully! It heated the water up quickly, so it was just as fast as the plug-in drip coffee maker. It's lightweight and easy to store. I would recommend this to anyone who really enjoys their coffee when they're camping but hates percolators.",

    "description": "Easily make drip-brewed coffee while enjoying the outdoors with the Coleman Camping Coffee Maker. Designed with a steel base that fits over most 2- and 3-burner camp stoves, this camping coffee maker features a large reservoir that enables you to brew up to 10 cups of hot coffee at once. Making coffee with this outdoor coffee maker is easy. Simply spoon grounds into the removable swing-out filter basket, fill the reservoir with water, and place the coffee maker over your stove burner. Within minutes, the 10-cup glass carafe will be filled with freshly brewed coffee ready to be enjoyed in the great outdoors. A Pause 'N Serve feature lets you grab a cup before the brew cycle is finished. The Coleman Camping Coffee Maker measures 8.5 x 11 x 14 inches.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nAbout Coleman More than 100 years ago, a young man with an entrepreneurial spirit and a better idea began manufacturing lanterns in Wichita, Kansas. His name was W.C. Coleman, and the company he founded would change life in America. A man plagued with such poor vision he sometimes had to ask classmates to read aloud to him, Coleman saw a brilliant light in 1900 in a drugstore window that stopped him in his tracks. He inquired about the light inside and discovered he was able to read even the small print on a medicine bottle by the illumination. The lamps had mantles, not wicks, and were fueled by gasoline under pressure instead of coal oil. Soon afterward, Coleman started a lighting service that offered a \"no light, no pay\" clause--a big step forward for merchants who were burned by inferior products that rarely worked--and drew substantial interest from businesses that wanted to keep their lights on after dark. In the ensuing years, Coleman expanded its product line well beyond lanterns. The company's current catalog is thick with products that make spending time outdoors a pleasure. There are coolers that keep food and drinks cold for days on end, comfortable airbeds that won't deflate during the night, a complete line of LED lights that last for years, powerful portable grills that cook with an authentic open-grill flame, and much, much more. Coleman has truly fashioned much of our outdoor camping experience, and expects to do so for generations to come. END",
