This shoe is true to size, BUT if you have a wide foot don't buy this shoe, especially those who have a too wide foot because it's tight in the middle area before the toe. BUT if you want I recommend you to go 1/2 size up. I will put an illustration in one of the pictures to refer to the area that causes the tightness",

They come out of the box with a lot of grip on the bottom which I really liked, especially for my gym pair. They do have some cheap laces in my opinion, I might switch them out for something a little more high quality. They fit snug which I actually like but some people may not like a snug shoe, so take that for what it is worth.",
