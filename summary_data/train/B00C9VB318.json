You can use the setup Wizard for a simple config or do it yourself manually. Other reviewers were mostly positive about the wireless coverage and I would agree. Range is a little better with the 1750 as far as signal strength to rooms farther away. Has an on/off switch which is handier than not having one. I like the look of the thing - no antennas sticking out. Not using the usb feature so can't speak to that. Haven't had any issues or problems. All in all pretty pleased so far and got in under my $120 budget.",

At that point, I can guarantee you it will connect to the internet. Then, set up WiFi. Then, make it yours.

The video would stutter, run okay for a little bit and die down. I got rid of that old router, use my new D-Link wireless and BAM. no issues and watching 720p+ with ease :) Thank you PC E-sports gaming (Starcraft 2) for mentioning this so I can research it. it is exactly what I've been looking for!",
