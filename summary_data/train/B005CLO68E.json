The warping is annoying, but at this time doesn't interfere with the food setup. If this gets worse I will update this review.",

      "text": "Great complement to the chairs I bought, but a little concerned about the integrity of the center fold section hinge over the long haul. Lots of \"play\" (twist) that might end up compromising the entire table. Just pushing the table out of the closet and into the dining room indicated the joint did not hold the two halves stable against one another and I suspect this might lead to a shorter overall useful life. I think the smaller version of the table wouldn't suffer the same. Kind of wish it was just a solid table.",

I was unable to find anyway to review this until now. I am not impressed with the damaged table. And this is sold by Amazon. I checked online but there is no where on the site someone can complain...so I am doing it here. My suggestion is to go to a physical location to purchase the table...Lifetime has a great reputation for quality...unfortunately if you order this online you may shocked at what you get...
