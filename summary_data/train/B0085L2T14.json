You can't even see Litas thong! Also a few notable wrestlers were missing to include but not limited to: Hardy Boyz, Kurt Angle, Chyna, Val Venis among a few others. They got most of it right. Oh yeah, why do they censor Stone Colds middle fingers? WTF? Anyways, get this game if you consider yourself a true N64/Gamecube pro wrestling fan. You will not be disappointed.",

It's game play is better than 2k17 and 2k18 in my opinion, because the pin system is easy and and no submission miny game just straight tapping. It's universe mode is awesome you can make wcw nitro or ecw as there own show. Create a wrestler is simple and you can youtube formulas or download characters. In my opinion this game is way funner than 2k18. Go for it",

My son and my husband love to play this and choose from the real life wrestlers. Doesn't seem too tricky, but has enough complexity to hold their attention. They aren't serious gamers, so I can't speak to that perspective, but for casual players who like wrestling and its real life characters, I think this is a good choice.",

Now I went back and purchased WWF No Mercy, WWF Warzone, and WWF Smackdown 2 Know Your Role. This game may have some hit detection issues and may not be the best looking game out there, but damn, it has spirit.",

The unlocks are great too, as you go through Attitude Era mode.",
