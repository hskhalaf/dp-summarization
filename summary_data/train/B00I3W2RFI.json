This has worked like a charm for me and has preserved wine well for ~4 days before there's a noticeable change in taste (though the wine remains drinkable for a couple days more). The pump is smaller than I expected, which is also nice for storage. The overall look and functionality of it are definitely 5 star.",

    "description": "Style Name:Wine SaverThe OXO Steel Vacuum Wine Pump keeps your wine fresh longer than a traditional cork. The Pump easily extracts air from the bottle, slowing down the oxidation process that can flatten the taste of wine. The easy-to-hold, contoured neck prevents pinching while you're pumping and the soft, comfortable grips are non-slip. With just a few easy pumps, the Stoppers form a vacuum seal that preserves wine's flavors and aromas until you're ready for another glass.\n\nBRAND STORY\nBy",
