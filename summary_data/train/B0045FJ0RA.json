It was a bit hard to get connected (just not much room to get your hands in to make the connections). However, it was do-able, and the result is great. We had a vanity and went to this pedestal, so we had our plumbing raised to hide the plumbing better. (You can't see the plumbing at all unless you look hard for it.) We went with the biscuit color, which is quite versatile. Would definitely buy this again. No defects at all.",

In person this particular sink is very attractive. Obviously is matches in design and color the cimarron line of products, but it is also classic enough to really match any of your other fixtures. It has ver clean lines that could be modern or traditional.",

I failed to find mine with a stud finder, cut open the drywall and then found the beam, lots of wasted work (totally my fault, sink is great).",

This serves as a vanity without taking up too much space. Don't buy the 50 dollar pedistal sink! Ours cracked when something dropped on it. Be sure to get a quality one hole faucet (at least 60+ bucks) and a drain.",

We ended up ordering 2 of these and they are very modern and sleek yet a perfect height and width! Love them!",
