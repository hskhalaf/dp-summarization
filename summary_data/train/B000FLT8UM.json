I took it to Cartier to see if the problem was a dead battery. It was not the battery; the battery was fine, it was the watch itself. It cost over 400 dollars for repairs.",

Glad I bought it here and saved the cash. BTW, I bought from AMAZON LLC, not one of the other amazon merchants as AMAZON will give you the 2 year guarantee.",

It took 6 weeks to get back from Swinford Jewelers (Amazon's partner for warranty) and we thought everything was fine. then ~2 months later it stopped working again. Now Amazon wants me to ship it back again and wait another 6 weeks to get the watch back. This will be a repeatable process and Amazon will not accept that an item is a lemon and just replace it Poor customer service from the house that Bezos built. Stick to cheap items through this channel",
