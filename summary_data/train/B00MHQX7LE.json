In trying to make the repair ourselves we noticed more shoddy stitching that had to be tightened up. I shouldn't have to re-sew football gloves that are described as \"tough.\" Make sure you check them thoroughly before using so you can return them if need be, because we didn't note the problem until them came completely undone.",

Very tough have lasted through several games and even been thrown in the washing machine (pull them out and air dry). These are great the only down side is he does sweat in them a lot during the warmer games. I think he will be happy to have them come November!",

My 11 year old son (plays center and nose) used them 3 practices and one game, and the stitching is coming out of the seams. He liked them, and said they worked well, but are really low quality gloves with a cost that suggest the opposite. No $45 gloves should fall apart after 8 hours use. Not happy with the lineman glove selection, the cost, or the reviews they're getting. Save your money and your time on these ones.",
