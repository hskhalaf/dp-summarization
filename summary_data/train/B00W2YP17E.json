I used this tea for a HORRIBLE hangover, and it made me feel much better after vomiting! Although for hangovers, it doesn\u2019t beat Drinkade (all natural btw) but I could use both even to really kick a bad hangover\u2019s a$$. Great for digestion, soothing stomach (especially after vomiting) and a decent flavor, thanks to the hibiscus. Highly recommend",

      "text": "Update: the companies Customer Service contacted me several times to help correct any problems. They were more than helpful. Original review: Be careful when tearing open the tea packet. Each packet has the notches of where to tear BUT you will tear the teabag too. I learned this after tearing 3 teabags & made a mess in my counter. Tea? Ok, I guess. Will try another brand next time.",

It's only been a few days, and overall the taste is fine but it's too soon to notice any health improvements. People complained of the teabags falling apart, so I make sure to open them carefully and out of 11 so far, only one ripped open. It's not a big deal just open them with care. Overall, I do like it. I just add honey to make it taste better lol.",

The tea particles go all over my counter & floor or throughout the water that I'm trying to make tea in. I make large batches of tea at a time with a pitcher that holds 10+ cups of tea so it ruins the whole batch.",

I'm going to see if I can send it back because at this point I have just wasted money because I'm not drinking it.",
