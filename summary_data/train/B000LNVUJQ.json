In summary, I am disappointed with the quality of the product that was made in the USA.",

Since purchasing this new unit I have used it several time with 4 additional trays to allow for an 8 tray capacity. It dehydrates just as expected and without needing to rotate the trays until I add more than 8 trays total. I would recommend this unit for small capacity, home use.",

The machine is light-weight and easy to move around, but a bit noisy while running (quieter than my dishwasher though). The white plastic trays do stain from tomatoes and red peppers, but the exterior has stayed white so far, and cleans easily. All in all, I'm very happy with it, and I think it's a good value.",

    "description": "The NESCO FD-60 Snackmaster Express Dehydrator has the drying power that generates maximum speed and quality for dehydrating your favorite fruits, vegetables, herbs and jerky. The quiet, powerful Converga-Flow fan forces heated air down the exterior pressurized chamber, then horizontally across each individual tray. The air flow then converges in the center for quick, consistent drying that is four times faster than other dehydrators. This dehydrator comes with four (13 1/2\u2033 diameter) trays and expands up to 12 trays so you can dry large quantities at once, with no tray rotation needed. Additional Add-A-Trays sold separately. The adjustable temperature control (95\u00b0F -160\u00b0F) gives you the flexibility to achieve the best results when drying different foods that need varying temperature settings. The NESCO FD-60 Snackmaster Express provides an easy and economical way to make delicious jerky, nutritious veggie chips, and all-natural fruit snacks at home.",
