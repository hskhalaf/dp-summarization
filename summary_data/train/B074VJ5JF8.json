      "verdict": "This soccer cleat has earned a good feedback for its accurate sizing. Most of its users love its fit, which at the same time has also provided them excellent comfort. These two factors are very important when handing the ball. However, there are a few who were not satisfied with the material used more specifically on the outsole of the cleat. The red metallic paint that easily chips off has disappointed these users. Overall, many players are still with this soccer cleat, most specially those with wide feet.",

        "A good number of reviewers expressed how they love the fit and accurate sizing of these soccer cleats",

        "Many users attested to the comfortable fit of these New Balance cleats",

Some others have been too narrow at the toe end; so far, I haven't heard that complaint from him. He loves the red bottoms, although the color has begun to come off as he walks on my tile floor (I tell him not to but, he is only 9- it's going to happen). So far, no complaints (other than the red marks on the tile). I would buy them again.",
