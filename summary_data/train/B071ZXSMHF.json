Easy cleanup, predictable temperatures, it is an amazing cooking utensil! We are down to a household of 2 most days, and it is fairly large. It would have served us well while our kids were still home, but it works for two, as well. The heating is so even and dependable that even i, a \"so-so\" cook cannot mess up! Expensive? Maybe. But I bet had I had it several years .. or decades... ago, it would still be earning its keep!",
