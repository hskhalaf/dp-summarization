The cart assembles so solid, however, that it hasn't been a problem. In fact, the printer shakes less now than it did on a sturdy table I was using previously.",

Most carts are very attention-getting, and that's the opposite of what I wanted. Something simple, blends in with the oak in my bar. It had to be sturdy because I'm not keen on a microwave oven going \"whump thump whump thump\" because the stand is too rickety to hold it. Not a problem. Five minutes to set up, everything in place and everyone in the family is using this. So, total winner.",

I have my IntantPot pressure cooker on the top, my airfryer and some cookbooks on the middle shelf and the bottom shelf holds more cookbooks and my crock pot. Being on wheels is very helpful too, should I want to move it around. Just a good looking, practical cart. Happy I purchased it.",

This has 3 shelves but there are two shelves set very close together so the bottom shelf will only hold a shallow box. The only deep shelf I can use is the second shelf. I'll keep it to use for corner storage but will keep looking for something else.",

I wanted something strong that would not fall apart under the weight of my microwave and anything else stored on it. Many of the wooden carts are made of softwood that do not tighten well when you put them together. The storage cart is easy to put together and the direction are very good. I highly recommend the Mr. Ironstoin 3-Tier Storage Cart.",
