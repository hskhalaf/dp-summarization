The cut off mode that you can't turn off makes it impossible to fly, you take off and then try to go forward it freaks out and shuts off and falls to the ground.

Forget about taking pictures. And good luck finding good enough instructions for troubleshooting.",

After less than a minute the drone stopped responding to down and land commands though I could still move it around a bit. Unfortunately it continued going higher and higher even after the connection was lost. After a minute or two we lost the sight of it and never saw it again. I'd have thought the drone would attempt landing once connection was lost but sadly that was not the case. So similar story to galit. Really not worth it. Avoid.",
