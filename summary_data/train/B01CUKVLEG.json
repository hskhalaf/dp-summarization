I also had noticed that we had to slightly squeeze the can before putting it into crush first. It seems to not be a good piece of equipment. It literally has one job. Although, it stayed on the wall, now we have holes in our wall. :(",

When attempting to reinsert the can, about 1/3 of the time, it won't fit back in as the top and bottom become severely misaligned . To avoid this, you have to GENTLY hold the can in place with one finger (or perhaps use a short wood dowel) to keep the can between the crush plate and the crusher base. DO NOT use firm pressure when using your finger to keep the can in place as it is possible for the side of the can to burst, thus exposing sharp edges.",

Overall though, I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a can crusher. Props to the manufacturer as well for communication; apparently they had some instances where customer's were sent the wrong color, so they sent a message to ensure I received what I ordered. 4/5 Stars and would purchase again!",

All 120z. cans are not the same height. For instance, 12 oz. Coors Light cans are taller than 12 oz. Bud Light cans. Michelobe Ultra cans are even taller than either of the other two. In that I drink Coors Light and my wife drinks Ultra, I should have ordered a 16 oz. can crusher. I had already screwed it to a post on our deck when I realized it. Other than that, the product works great!!!",

You have to pre-dent the cans and many of the cans shoot out at you half crushed. In addition, it doesn't fully crush the cans. The can is crushed to about 1-1/2\" tall. For some reason, most of the cans tear, creating very sharp edges that you don't get when you crush the can with your foot. Extremely disappointed with this design. Tossing it in the trash and going back to stomping.",

It's designed to not crush as flat as others but it seems this is one way to lessen the stress on the light gauge metal that it's made from. If you pinch the can when mounting it, it takes some stress off the machine and should add to its life. Without the prior exposure to a more substantial version, I imagine I wouldn't have the durability concerns.",

These were regular 12 oz. aluminum cans, and after about a dozen the metal warped and bent out of shape. I am able to bend them back into shape but it feels like all this could have been avoided if they hadn't cheaped out on the arm pieces. I would be happy to pay a bit extra for one that wouldn't fall apart, but given I was able to get only a handful of uses out of this, I don't think it's worth spending money on.",
