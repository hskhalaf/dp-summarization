I position the dolly right under the seat area, strap it down with two 3' bungee cords, and pull it to the shoreline. It rolls over rocks, sand, and whatever with ease. Have not used the included strap. And to think last year I carried that kayak everywhere. Duh.",

We didn't use our kayaks as often as we wanted because it was such a pain to carry them from the house to the lake. Now we put them on the dollys, strap them down and go.

I noted the reviews regarding the smell from the tires. It is true but this issue should not deter you from purchasing this trolley. I put my wheels outside on the deck to air out. I also read another review where the buyer washed the tires with soap. If you frequent bike shops the smell from the bike tires is similar to the trolley wheels expect much, much, stronger. This trolley should last years.",

I put it in my garage and I am going to take the wheels off and put them outside. Other than that this is a great product with a good price.",

I think you really need 2 straps, so will need to figure out what works for your kayak and adapt the straps and/or add another. I did need to pump up the tires with my bike pump. Overall, the cart seems to be nearly identical to those costing up to twice as much. I'm satisfied, as long as it holds up well.",

The 5 star rating is for the value - this trailer works just like it should, and like others I have used in the past, but it was less expensive than many of the other brands. I take it down a road and onto a beach, so the terrain is flat. I recommend using a strap with a metal buckle, so you can secure the kayak tightly.",
