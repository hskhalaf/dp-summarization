The part that isn't quite adding up for me is the 18 year lifespan. I have to buy a new pack every 4 months or so. Let's see I bought one today. I bought a pack in May. I bought a pack in Feb. I bought a pack in Sep before that. These burn out pretty much the same as any incandescent, maybe faster. Either that or I'm careening through spacetime at relativistic speeds and these light bulbs are aging normally. That makes a lot sense, glad you agree.",

The soft light ones are better for dining rooms etc.",
