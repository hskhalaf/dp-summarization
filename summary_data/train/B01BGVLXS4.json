About 11 months after we purchased it the the release lever broke away from the seat. We contacted Graco and they agreed to send a new seat because it was within 1 year of purchase. This was great except the seat had to be returned first and we had thrown away the box. They sent the same seat very quickly and costumer service was excellent. However 4 months later the same thing happened on the new seat, and this happened while we were away on vacation.",

I drive a 2010 Chevy Camaro (a two door sports car) and this seat actually fits better than my son's infant seat. My son is 6mo 18lbs and fits in this seat perfectly. The only issue I have is that I have to put my son in the seat by climbing in the backseat but it's really not that bad.

The Graco brand is a trusted brand that we have known for years and this seat appears to be well made There are numerous features that I like about it, including the ease of connection to the vehicle LATCH system, the comfortable padding, the ease of loosening/tightening the seat belt once the child is in, and of course the cup holder. It's a good seat for a fair price",

I have it in my 2012 Subaru Outback rear facing, and there is still some room for the passenger in the front seat. Overall amazing product, Graco never dissapoints!",

Also the seat is like so it will be easy to transfer to another vehicle if needed. By the way I put this in my mom's hyundai Elantra which is a very small car and it fit just fine behind the passenger seat giving the passenger side plenty of room up front. Very pleased!",

It fits snugly behind the driver's seat of my blazer, so there's room for other car seats if necessary down the road. We haven't found anything we don't like about this seat!!",
