As a result of the injury I could no longer do hair professionally. I could only style a few people at a time friends and family. Prior to the injury I was a very busy stylist with the need and want of the best implements of my profession. I had spent a $100 and more on blow dryers how wish this blow dryer at this price would've been available to me at that time.",

The outside material is also really nice - it feels almost like rubber - a nice grip versus cheap plastic. It is heavier than I would have liked for travel or gym bag - but compact. I purchased a second one I loved it so much. Highly recommend for anyone sensitive to the loud, painful noise from hairdryers.",

The low setting is better but takes longer to dry. The speed and temperature settings on the handle are not in the best place. My hand kept turning the buttons on and off while trying to dry. The weight is heavy and it isn't as quiet as I hoped unless you only dry on low. The diffuser is very difficult to put on and take off. I am returning the dryer.",

Quite let down, but for the price I can't complain that much. I'll definitely still be using it, just wish it was actually quieter.",

The concentrator attachment will NOT stay on the hair dryer. The slightest bump, or often even just normal hair dryer movement, will cause the attachment to fall off. Each time that happens, I have to turn off the hair dryer, find the attachment, and put it back on the hair dryer. Repeat until great annoyance ensues. Very very disappointing .",

I like that it had a head...which is rare in an international usable blowdryer thats why it got two stars.",
