The product is supposed to have a 12 month warranty - however I am having a very hard time gaining assistance in resolving the issue or non-working merchandise. IT did work very well for 6 months. At the 6th month mark it stopped clean autonomously and can only be operated manually using the remote. I cannot recommend a robotic vacuum that fails after just six months of use; or a company that doesn't respond to customer inquiries, echange or refund requests.",

Likes to be around the action. For some reason its demand for human attention is starting to increase. I clean him out daily and go through everything with an air nozzle.That seems to be keeping his morale up. Couldnt live with out him. Just keep the bathroom door closed when your in there.

I did extensive research before buying this vacuum and bought because it rated high and was very affordable compared to the Roomba. I'm amazed at how long it will go before needing to be recharged, approx 2 hours and how much dirt and dust it picks up everyday. I use it on hardwood floors so I can't say how well it works on carpet. You do need to move rugs, cords or curtains on the ground or use the virtual wall. I can't speak to the longevity of the vacuum since I've only had it about 1 month.",

Largely I believe because it eventually vacuums every nook, corner, and baseboard, and inconvenient to access place in the house. It also seems to be less expensive than similar devices. So it's an excellent value, IMO. Caveats: I've only owned this contraption for a couple of weeks. So I can't speak to long term reliability. And this is my first robotic vacuum, so I'm not comparing to competitors.",

The model with the rubber brush is great because no hair gets stuck. I like you can take it all apart and clean out any stuck hair or other things. Highly recommend. And no I didn't get anything for free for this review. I think it performs well and worthy of a review.",

As it runs automatically every day it easily handles the floor dirt from two small dogs. I still love the Roomba, but at 1/3 the price both ILIFE robots are fantastic. As I have 3 levels to my house I have all three levels with a robot vacuum. The only downside is the A6 does not handle fringes on throw rugs as well as the A4 due to the rubber (instead of brush) sweeper. Otherwise, both are excellent.",

If you only have hard floors, I highly recommend this nicely priced robovac, but if you have significant carpet, get one with a brush roller.",

It does a great job keeping our house clean and free of dust and pet hair. Every room! When it gets tired, it goes back to its docking station and recharges for its next tour. It must be maintained, but that is easy too. After more than 100 runs I had a problem and sent it back to ILIFE. 5 days later I received a brand-new robot. Their promise is good and service fast. I would recommend the ILIFE products to anyone and everyone.",

We were drowning in dog hair from our Dalmatian puppy and his little white wirey hairs were covering our house from top to bottom.

Our floors are free of dog hair and all the other debris that comes with two kids and two dogs. Great purchase.",
