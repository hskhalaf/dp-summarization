So you have to press Time and then 20 and then start. This works more instinctively. You start typing in the time you want and then hit start. Don't know why that's so hard to find these days.",

On this one you press 6-0-START to set it for one minute or 1-0-0-START if you like to push buttons. The beverage button is 1:10 and very hot. You would press BEVERAGE-1 (for number of cups)-Start. The number of cups is kinda confusing at first but this microwave can heat up 2 or more cups really quick so its great once you get use to it! Same for potatoes and pizza. Its a great microwave and loud. :-)",
