The overall quality feels high, the faucet tee is solid cast metal includes all of the needed gaskets. We installed the system in a house with *rural* Texas well water. The system works great and takes the 450 TDS+ down to ~19 TDS. It also does a great job removing the sulfur/egg smell which creeps in during the height of summer. The only con is the non-standard and expensive Brondell filters. ~$60 USD every 6 months, $80 every 2 years (RO) I'd highly recommend to anyone. Worth the cost, and the quality is pretty high.",

I like that it is one, self-contained unit that does not have to be mounted under the sink. It does however, take up a large portion of the space under the sink. Double check the dimensions you can use.",

Had two failed attempts (cuckoo, frizzlife) at buying a water purifier prior to ordering the brondell. This unit was easy to install, had a very thorough manual, looks great, and most importantly produces great tasting water. Also a main factor was that the company had a long history of delivering quality products. - TDS reduction from 260 -> 18. - Runs silently - Installation was easy. - Expect a bigger unit than what it looks in the pictures.",

The directions are easy to follow, installed the system in under 30 minutes. I see a few reviews complaining about the flow, we are not experiencing anything with this. I don't if they are having water pressure issues or if we just aren't as picky but we have no issues with the water flow. No complaints at all with the operation of the unit. Replacement filters are a little more expensive than other but for me its worth it mainly because of how simple the system is.",
