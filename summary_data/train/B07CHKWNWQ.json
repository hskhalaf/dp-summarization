I use it for my more heavier lures as in football jigs and Texas rigs. The rod itself is designed perfect, the handle fits great in your hand. The line guides are strong and perfect for using leaders. I caught a largemouth bass on my first trip and this rod handled it with ease. This is an amazing price for a high-end rod series.
