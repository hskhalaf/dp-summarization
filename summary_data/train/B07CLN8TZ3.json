I noticed that if you smell the fabric, it has a very mild at best scent as you wear the clothing. If you rub the fabric, the scent of the detergent comes to life and it smells really good. This could be days/weeks after it has come out of the wash. Not sure if it is the heat generated from rubbing the fabric or just the movement. Neat stuff.",
