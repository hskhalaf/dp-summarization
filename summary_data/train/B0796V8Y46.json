This apron is exactly what I was looking for. Great quality denim, great craftsmanship, great stitching. It\u2019s a bit stiff, but with a little wear it will break right in. As an artist, I had to make this apron 1 of a kind. So I added my own touch, but this doesn\u2019t take away from the quality of this apron. I\u2019m sure once my customers see this I\u2019ll be buying plenty more!! Thanks!! -Clr Blnd Design",

I love that it\u2019s a racer back design which keeps the strap off the neck and is way more comfortable. It wasn\u2019t too stiff straight out of the box, but one of the pockets, on the inside came unsewn after the first washing. It only affects the functionality of one pocket. Not a huge deal, just slightly annoying. *Edited* customer service is stellar. They asked for feedback about their product. I said how much I love my apron but also about the pocket. They\u2019re sending a new one. Not necessary, but greatly appreciated!",
