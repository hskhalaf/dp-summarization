The seller was very responsive to my request for extra links and immidiately sent them. If you follow the instructions exactly the link install goes very well with the includded tool. There have been a few reviews that said the link process was faulty HOWEVER they must not have read and understood the instructions. The pins when installed as explained DO NOT fall out and are strong. This is a HIGH QUALITY bracelet that is also very durable. I highly reccomend this product.

Kind of defeats the purpose of the bracelet. The product itself is quite attractive, seems well made and comes in a nice box. Turns out it's better as a gag gift than a medical bracelet since DNR wishes would not be followed simply because someone has the bracelet on.",

It was much too large for my wrist but was very easy to resize and came with a kit to do it. I have been wearing it for 2 months straight, never taking it off and it looks just as good as the day I put it on. I couldn't be happier.",

I'm very satisfied with the quality of product. It took a while to adjust the length but it was easy to find the way due to instruction paper. The seller was so kind and helpful to send email checking whether it works well. Thank you for selling fine goods. :)",

      "text": "I specifically wanted a bracelet that was durable, and was deeply engraved. Custom engraved bracelets tend to rub smooth over time, and the engraving is lost. I do not have that worry with this one. The engraving is deep, and so far, the enameling has been durable. It also has substantial weight to it, which I like. There is nothing flimsy about it. The tool that comes with it to adjust the length works perfectly, and made removing links simple. The clasp is also strong, and won't catch on anything. Highly recommended.",

The tool to remove links will be useful at some point but I prefer to wear it loose as I would any other bracelet. Good quality and workmanship; I would certainly recommend.",
