Second, the flat nail shapers are difficult to use without contacting skin. I guess it just takes practice. Overall, this is a good value for the price.",

      "text": "This home-use electric manicure & pedicure set was easy to use to thin down my 89 year old mother's thickened toe nails. The professional nail salon she used to go to no longer wanted to work on her pedicure so I researched online on YouTube and medical websites on the proper procedures for at-home pedicures. I used a toe nail clipper for thickened toe nails first, manually filed the thickened toe nails, then finished with this electric manicure/pedicure drill set. My mother didn't complain of any pain at all, and her toe nails were neatly trimmed. A good investment for senior pedicures.",

The unit seems well made and has the power required to file and shape my nails far more quickly and easily than hand filing. Add in the light, multiple speeds, and enough tools to handle almost any nail problem and I am a happy camper. My toenails no longer scare away small children at the beach! Recommended.",

In fact I may do away with cutting and just keep them well trimmed with this. Looked at lots of manicure/pedicure sets and this seemed the best value for the money. Plan on using it for my 97 year old father's toenails after a refreshing foot soak. I am new at this and would have appreciated a little more information. on using each bit. Is there a tutorial online I missed perhaps?",
