In this case I went with the xtra wide because it just felt better. If it ends up stretching much I might be outta luck but the material looks as if it will not too much. I read where one reviewer said to buy wider than you usually need to. In my case this is true. Don\u2019t usually where extra wide but it was the best fit this time. Probably one of the most comfortable shoes I\u2019ve owned. Literally like walking on pillows. Love it.",

I exchanged these (which was easy due to Amazon Prime) for the 8 2E size and now they fit much better. Traction is good. Laces stay tied. Comfort after going up one notch in width is much better.",
