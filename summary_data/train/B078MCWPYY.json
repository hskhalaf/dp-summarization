      "text": "This item seemed to be exactly what we needed, but the quality is substandard. For the front, in one photo, the leather used was not completely finished on the inside and worse, before even beginning to use, a spot or two is almost through the leather itself. The sleeve was similar for unfinished, but usable. Rather difficult to get through to Amazon at this time of year, we have pondered exchanging, if even possible and may just have to return. BTW, these do run a bit small, or at least this one did.... I normally wear an XL shirt and this one is snug; doable, but snug.",
