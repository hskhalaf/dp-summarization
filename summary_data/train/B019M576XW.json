There is no muffled, distorted mess that you're likely to get with most foam earplugs, and there is no discomfort that you might get with other noise filters. And being transparent, they're not conspicuous at all. I'm planning to get each of my band members a pair to save what little hearing they have left. I highly recommend Eargasms.",

The concerts are still loud, but never overwhelmingly loud. Taking them out momentarily during a concert is startling.",

They help reduce just enough noise that loud music doesnt hurt your ears but will let the music come through. I also work at a nightclub as a bartender and these probably saved my hearing since I have to be in an area where music is blasting all night long! I would recommend wearing them anywhere that has loud music for a prolonged amount of time. I can also see them working at a construction site with a lot of drilling and other noises happening.",

The only complaint I have is they look a little silly, as there's a long piece of plastic that sticks out of your ears (so they're easy to remove), and it makes me think of Frankenstein's monster whenever I put them in; but that's cool in its own weird way, I suppose.

I have the Dreamcatcher in L.A. concert coming up and will be testing them fully there so hopefully these help. Went to a Twice concert with just my ears and was near death afterwards... worth it. UPDATE! These are now on my must bring list to any event or concert. The sound management and intake they produced while at the concert was superb! It was really comfortable having them for a prolonged period and none of the music felted dampened at all. On a side note Dreamcatcher was AMAZING! The girls where really amazing to see live!",

They reduced all the damaging wind noise and engine noise db, while allowing me to hear cars and even other riders, while wearing the earplugs.

What made matters worse, is that not only was it difficult to hear conversation, the sound I really wanted to block was the high-pitched treble. Instead, it felt like it channeled the high pitch like an arrow into my ear, causing pain. It was better to hear the music full blast than to wear these. I'm very disappointed to say the least since these were more expensive than most. Total waste of money. Oh well.",

Its amazing and the one of them noticed a difference in my playing being right in sync. The only knock to these is that they stick to your ear canal so they can be difficult to get in place.
