I've also upgraded and gave this one to a buddy and he still uses it as well, we both ride mountain bikes and motocross as well and the camera has held up flawlessly. I have also gotten it wet skiing several times and still works great. Keep up the good work Contour!!!",

Other cameras on the market have no problem taking the vibration of a kart, but none of them have the resolution of the VholdR.",

The glue on the stick on mounts were unusable in my packet and when the company was called they offered for me to purchase another mount on line. Too bad not a lot of thinking went into the \"whole\" package because the picture it delivers is quite good.",

Even wearing gloves turning the unit on and starting recording is possible. I've used other helmet/bullet cameras while skydiving and this product surpasses anything else I've used.

    "title": "ContourHD 720p HD Helmet Camera",
    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\nFrom the Manufacturer\n\nContourHD is the world\u2019s first High Definition wearable camcorder that combines amazing video clarity (choose between High Definition or High Action), a wide-angle lens (135 degrees), single-button simplicity, and a click to share online experience. \n\nPerfected for outdoor use, ContourHD can switch between crisp HD quality video (captured at 30 frames per second) or SD quality video (captured at 60 frames per second). This camera is the ideal complement to your outdoor gear with its all-in-one design ContourHD has no wires or separate recorder. Instead it records up to 8 hours of HD video to its own internal memory card (compatible with up to a 16 GB microSD card). Its light (4 ounces) but armored aluminum body enables you to capture video in any weather conditions. ContourHD's TRail Mounts seamlessly attach the camera to your body, helmet, goggles, or vehicle for hands-free recording. \n\n\n\nAmazing Video Clarity \n\n2 Video Settings\nHigh Definition: Fill your screen with vivid, widescreen (16;9) action video. With a full 1280x720 (pixels) window and 30 frames per second, your videos will be just how you remember them, big and awesome! \n\nHigh Action: Ideal for making the fastest adventure sports appear as smooth as butter. Recording standard definition video at 60 frames per second (twice as many frames as TV quality video) you won\u2019t miss any of the action. \n\nBeautiful Outdoor Colors\nThe image sensor and video processor in this tiny camera were fine-tuned for the changing colors and lighting conditions you\u2019ll experience when recording outdoors. The snow will have definition, the lighting will transition when you go through the trees, and the color clarity has been adjusted so that colors will appear as rich as you remember them. \n\nCapture the Whole Scene\nThe wider the angle of your lens the more of the scene you capture. At 135 degrees, the new ContourHD lens strikes the perfect balance in capturing the entire scene without over-distorting the video. \n\nRecord over 8 Hours of Action Video\nAs an all-in-one wearable camcorder, ContourHD records to an internal MicroSD memory card to capture up to 8 hours of HD quality video (compatible up to a 16 GB Memory Card). Powered by a removable, rechargeable lithium-ion battery, this robust camera recharges through a USB cable connected directly to your computer. Now you can throw away your camcorder tapes, wires, and AA batteries. \n\nWith Full Audio\nCapturing the sounds you hear (other than the wind) is a difficult proposition, which is why we upgraded the microphone from the previous VholdR model. We\u2019ve done our best to help you cut out the wind noise and record the sounds of the action. \n\nEasy to Use \n\nOne Button Record\nContourHD\u2019s operation couldn\u2019t be simpler, as it features a single oversized record switch that you can use even when you\u2019re wearing a pair of gloves. Slide the switch forward to record and slide it back to stop--congratulations, you just made a video! Now you can capture the best scenes right before they happen. \n\nEasy to Align\nHave you ever seen a camera with lasers? ContourHD uses two of them and a 192o rotating lens to ensure you line up the shot every time. Turn on the lasers and rotate the front lens until the two laser points are horizontally aligned. Congratulations, you just lined up your video. \n\nWearable Anywhere\nAs the most versatile wearable camcorder we take \"wearable\" seriously. ContourHD uses our patent-pending TRailTM Mounts to \"slide and lock\" onto a series of different mounts for your goggles, helmet, handlebars, vehicle, or anywhere else you want to mount it. Wear HD video on more than just your head. \n\nArmored Body\nA water-resistant camera for all seasons, its light (4 ounces/116 grams) anodized aluminum body withstands dust, dirt, mud, and snow--elements that destroy most electronic gear. It\u2019s also shock, vibration and impact resistant. \n\nClick to Share Online with a Mac and a PC\nAs simple as we made recording with ContourHD, we made it even easier to share your HD videos online. Our Easy Edit software (Mac and PC compatible) makes it automatic to import your videos from the camera, clip out the best parts, and post them to VholdR.com. Join the community of thousands of adventure-sports enthusiasts sharing their videos on VholdR.com. \n\nNew Firmware Available\nVholdR has introduced optional new firmware to enable you to configure your ContourHD Wearable Camcorder as well as to improve camera performance in really cold conditions. By making ContourHD configurable, you can use the provided Easy Edit software to adjust the video, audio, and lighting configurations of the camera. The new firmware will also improve camera performance in under -5 degrees celsius conditions. Available to be downloaded only, this new firmware does not come stock on the camera.
