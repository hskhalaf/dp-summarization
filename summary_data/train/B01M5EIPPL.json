These candles smell so great that guests were commenting how good the house smelled. I needed them because we have two old stinky dogs and I needed something that smelled stronger than they do! I have been a loyal Mrs. Meyers fan for years. I like that they burn cleanly, have a super long burn time (lots of bang for your buck!), do not smoke, and don't bother my asthma. I will always remember my happy wedding day when I smell this scent!",

Removing 1 star because as others mentioned there\u2019s still quite a bit of wax left once the wick burns out. However I just melt it down and use it in my wax warmer. It\u2019s a great way to extend the life of the candle. For what it\u2019s worth, I am replacing my expensive yankee candle habit with these. They have a lower burn time dollar for dollar but make it up for in the pleasantly powerful scent throwing. I find I burn these for less hours overall, so worth the investment.",
