Most iPads have protective covers on them to protect them from drops, and scratches, and cracked screens. So do mine. And unfortunately, the mount for the iPad, does not protrude far enough to go around my iPad cover and secure it in place. And I will not pull the cover off every time I have to put it in the truck. So I will be looking for a better mounting bracket that fits around my iPad case",

You can secure it to any cup holder with just a couple of twists on the adjustment handle. The single downside is the actual stand (the pole) isn't sturdy enough to hold the weight of the iPad without swaying back and forth while braking and accelerating. Fix that problem, and it's a keeper and a 5 star product.",

I wish I would have found this product a long time ago because its is used every day in my car and/or truck. I don't have to look down anymore since it is up at eye level and can take a quick glance at the gps or weather map on my device. Made very well and very sturdy. I would buy this for a gift for a friend....I love, love, love, mine!",

This can be remedied by wedging some paper or cardboard around the bottom of the cupholder mount. It is of no fault of the mount but simply the many differences in cars. The mount is plastic but seems quite sturdy. I am using it to hold the ipad vertically.",

There is enough room between the clamp fingers for the charging cord to plug in. The only problem is that if the cup holders are close to the dash, the tablet is going to obscure the dash. Probably the climate controls and the center vents. And there may be some noise from the tablet bouncing off of the dash unless the device is adjusted to avoid it.

      "text": "I notice that some describe it as sturdy and others as flexible but I say it is a nice combination of both that makes this device dependable. I noticed that a bump with an elbow or tricep will cause the device to flex slightly along the shaft and at the built in flex point at the bottom of the shaft where it rotates. All of this flexing allows the device to survive minor bumps without bruising or heaven forbid snapping. The unit also provides plenty of flexibility of positioning my Nexus 7 so it is easily viewable and chargeable. I will follow up with my experiences for the longevity of the product in a few months.",
