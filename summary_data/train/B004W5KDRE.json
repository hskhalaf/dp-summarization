I was skeptical of such a small dripper having 3 holes in the bottom, but using the Kalita spec filters the flow rate was okay and the finished cup pretty good. I would prefer it to be a bit slower and that the brew filter capacity were a bit larger to allow for more bloom.",

The design of the dripper and filter together help create a pool of water on top of the coffee bed that can help control agitation, helping maintain a uniform extraction without too much agitation (which could lead to over-extraction).",
      "PERFECT FOR BEGINNERS AND PROFESSIONALS: You'll find Kalita pour-over products in the world's top specialty cafes and professional coffee-making competitions. But our products are also great for pour-over beginners. Cone drippers and filters require perfect grinds and pouring technique in order to prevent stalling and over-extraction. The wave's flat bottom design, on the other hand, maintains a wide and even coffee bed, allowing water to permeate and leave the dripper evenly through three holes."
