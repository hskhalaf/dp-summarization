The barrel part is made of a heavy thick rubber/plastic! The bars are made of a metal & steel! You can fill it with sand or water, I would recommend water in case you have to load it up and take it somewhere - it whole lot easier to get water out then sand!",

Assembly was easy but for people not knowing any better, it could be difficult. I recall reading one review where the guy complained that the axle shaft wasn't drilled for the keepers, guess what, it's not supposed to be. I would recommend putting grease on the washers and bushings for the axle during assembly but other than that. It appears to be a good buy. I think that with care and occasional greasing and tightening of fasteners, it should provide many years of use.",

When the roller arrived, the scraper bar had a crack in one of the bends. I contacted Agri-Fab and spoke to Cindy. With zero hassle she had a new bar sent out and it arrived in two business days. Thanks to all. Highly recommend the product and the company.",

This roller is not heaver in terms of psi than the weight of the surface area of my lawn mower tires. My mower weighs at least 500 pounds and this roller is 500 pounds but the surface area in contact with the ground is not 3 feet wide, therefore my lawnmower tires compact the ground more that the lawn roller does. I may put a couple of weights on the frame to make it heaver. It is well constructed though.",

This one was a no brainer to assemble and what's not to like. Very Reasonable price and works like it's suppose to. If you consider renting a lawn roller every time you really should compact/level you would have paid the purchase price off in no time. Even Made in the USA. I like the Agri-Fab Roller would recommend.",

    "description": "Agri-Fab Poly Tow Lawn Rollers are perfect for flattening your yard from the effects of moles, gophers, other yard pests and frost heave in northern climates. The 18 inch by 36 inch roller is constructed of durable, rustproof poly. Fill the drum with water through the easy to operate fill/drain plug to get the force of 400 pounds to flatten the high spots on your lawn. The easy to hook up hitch fits any lawn and garden tractor. The tow tongue incorporates a steel scraper bar to prevent clumps of soil from sticking to the drum.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nRestore a lawn\u2019s smooth appearance after flooding or eliminate frost heaves with this heavyweight lawn roller from Agri-Fab. Users fill the roller\u2019s drum with up to 400 pounds of water or sand and hook it up behind a tractor. The tractor tows the roller over lawns and fields, flattening uneven grass or leveling new soil in 36-inch wide swathes. Rolling may also help plant new seeds for uniform growth and eliminate mole holes. \n\n The roller\u2019s drum is crafted in a sturdy polyethylene, which resists dents, rust, and weather damage. Powder-baked paint provides further protection. Agri-Fab welded the seams on the drum with rounded edges to prevent any uneven grooves while also providing a leak-proof seal. A brass plug closes the 1-inch filling hole. To remove debris, the roller includes a poly scraper bar. A center baffler provides additional stability to ensure the polyethylene drum does not flex and loose its shape. A hitch pin accompanies the roller to accommodate a trouble-free hook up. The roller is shipped without fill for easy transportation. Users who fill the roller drum with water should drain the drum before winter to ensure the water does not freeze and crack the polyethylene. For user who prefer to fill with sand, Agri-Fab recommends filling the drum only halfway full. To tow the filled roller, a vehicle with a 12 HP engine or greater is required. Towing on hills is highly unadvisable. The roller was manufactured in the USA. A limited one-year warranty may be available for this item. The roller drum spans 36 inches wide with an 18-inch diameter.",
