MSI cooling solution for a 2070 Super is not great and they did a poor job with mounting the cooler to the board (RAM chips have very thick and small thermal pads and thermal compound used on the die is closer to toothpaste that a decent compound). And since this card doesn't offer any official power overhead, overclocking it is very difficult. To sum it all up, don't buy this card, there are better options, that are cooler and quieter at the same time.",

Cheaper and totally unreliable as a web search will find you many many others having lots of very bad problems with this and other AMD cards. Returned the same to Amazon who issued a direct refund. Got this card with free Call of Duty codes and it just simply works very very well and reliably. Card runs everything well at 1440 and runs fairly cool even with non aggressive fan curve. Would not hesitate to say this card is GREAT. It also delivered at least 15-25% better benchmark scores than the 5700XT. So for me Nvidia all the way",

You can see it from the side, no need to disassemble it. I am guessing if proper ones applied it will perform even better. Minus 1 star for that.

Temperatures were usually in the 85C range which is fine but I prefer to sit a bit lower than that. The card I also received had bad coil whine which was very audible over the headset too. I returned the card about a month after buying it and replaced it with a different card which was much quieter, cooler and had no coil whine.

Handles any game (only tested 1080/1440p) I've thrown at it in max settings without breaking a sweat and is absolutely quiet. Get it if you have no plans of moving away from LGA-1366 tech.
