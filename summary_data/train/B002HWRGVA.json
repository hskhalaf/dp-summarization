A XL Twin size mattress for the top bed and a Twin size mattress for the trundle were a perfect fit.",

(Candlelight might be a good description?). Bed is solid and looks great. Easily and quickly put together (used a drill) with 2 people. My 10 year old loves it. A standard twin mattress is fine. The trundle is functioning as a drawer now but will hold a mattress easily. Great purchase with no regrets.",
