Right now, I have to hold my smartphone beside it to show date/time when I start measuring. Not a big deal, but a nice to have. I have to make the video anyway, so I live.",

At the same time, it shows the sound level readings using a fast-responding analog bar graph with a 50-decibel range that updates every 40 milliseconds for viewing varying trends. The unit has AC analog output and records max/min values over time.Compact, Lightweight Design\nThe Extech sound meter weighs less than 6 ounces, and is designed to fit comfortably in the palm of your hand. The meter is white with a black-framed screen and black buttons. Useful features include auto power-off, max hold functions, and fast/slow response time.\n\nProduct and Warranty Information\nAll of Extech's assessment tools are factory calibrated to specifications and work to spec. You can also add an NIST calibration certificate for audits if necessary for licensed testing. The meter measures 9 by 2-1/5 by 1-7/10 inches (H x W x D), and uses four AAA batteries.\n\nThe Extech Digital Sound Level Meter is backed by a manufacturer's one-year limited warranty on parts and labor.\n\nWhat's in the Box\nMeter, microphone windscreen, four AAA batteries, and user manual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nSound level meter measures from 40 to 130dB with an accuracy of 2dB.
