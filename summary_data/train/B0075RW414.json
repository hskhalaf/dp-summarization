      "text": "I've bought several of these collars over the last few years, for my rescue dogs. I've never been disappointed with the workmanship or quality. The white reflective background that the embroidery is on, stays white and always reflective. The embroidery is clear and precise, and the collar is of sturdy quality, with a good plastic clasp that will not come undone. I don't worry about a collar coming off or a id tag becoming worn and unreadable with this. Every dog deserves a collar like this.",

My other dog is a very strong 65 lb dog who is dark brown/black. This collar did make him visible if the lighting was just right but he snapped the buckle on the collar after wearing it for a few months. My suggestion is to use this collar as a backup over an existing more solid buckle type collar. Another suggestion is for the designer to make a collar with a metal buckle instead of a snap and click backpack type buckle.",

Loved the idea of my phone number stitched on the collar in case it happened if he got lost. I also have a black German shepherd who is really hard to see at night which is why we went with the reflective one. The reflective material is pretty thick and sturdy. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because the stitching is starting to unravel a bit and we've only had these collars for about a month.",
