      "text": "Worked pretty well to take apart some ratchet wrenches to relube. I did notice that the way they are set up, it's kind of hard to fully squeeze some retaining rings to remove them without having the vinyl handles interfere. Still, they did the job. Craftsman should slightly redesign these to keep this from happening and they'd have the perfect design. Metal seems to be of good quality, and did not deform in use like many other Chinese-made tools like this (yes, most Craftsman tools are now Chinese).",

If you're wrong-brained like me, and can't accept that squeezing in makes the tips move outward, you can put the screw in the other pivot hole, grip the handles with each hand and pull outward. I think you also get better leverage with those stubborn high-tension snap rings too",
