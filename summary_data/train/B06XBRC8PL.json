I know that these are billed as a temporary safety measure, something that guests would wear as their visiting your facility. But I can tell you that I use these as my primary safety shoe, 5 days a week, 12 hours a day. The new design is more adaptable to different shoe types and sizes also making them longer lasting. I typically get 4 to 8 months worth of use out of them before replacing them.",

One of my sites bought these for guests and I've used them for when I forget boots or have a guest. These fit firmly and don't clomp around noisily as others I've used so I bought a pair to keep in my truck for unexpected need. Only issue I see is that the straps can break away from the shoe and then you are stuck with no way to hold them on.",
