      "text": "This loom arrived nicely packaged and nothing was damaged. I sanded the parts lightly with 220 grit sandpaper and rubbed it down with danish oil just to protect the wood. Assembling the loom was as easy as can be- the instructions we clear and easy to follow. I've put it through it's paces an it works great. The 16\" loom is perfect for scarves, throw pillows, kitchen towels etc. This size works well for me since I have limited space for weaving.",
