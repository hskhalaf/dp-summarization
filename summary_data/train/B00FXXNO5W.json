He can't reach the pedals but that didn't stop him from being excited to receive it as a gift. It was fun watching him recognize what all the pieces were becoming as our son built it for him. Perhaps in a few more months he will be able to enjoy it.",

We have wood and tile floors and this bike is perfect for them. The rubber tires have good grip without scratching and the handlebar grips have a round rubber ball thingy that also protects the floors and walls. The adjustable seat is a must for his growth. It's also easy to assemble. Pricier than other bikes I researched, but the quality seems good so far. Very sturdy amd made with quality materials. We expect it to last through our next child.",

    "description": "Introducing the new YBIKE Evolve 3-in-1 developmental ride-on. Designed for young children, the Evolve will help your little ones develop early valuable motor skills and transition to a normal pedal bicycle when they are ready. Unlike most combination ride on toys, the patented conversion system of the YBIKE Evolve is focused on skill development and easy adaptation. This innovative system allows parents to easily convert the Evolve from a classic style pedal trike to a balance bike. Change to a no-pedal two-rear wheel balance bike for initial stability and ultimately, convert to a single rear wheel for a more advanced running bike, requiring better balance skill. The rear triangle articulates to adjust to each skill level. All three wheel positions are essential for a child\u2019s physical development prior to riding a \u201cbig kid\u201d bike. The YBIKE Evolve can be used inside and outside of the house. The quiet rubber wheels make it indoor-suitable to ride on tiles and floorboards. Made of high-quality materials, this tricycle is also durable and strong enough to use outdoors. Use the Evolve to teach young children pushing, steering, coordination, and motor skills. Ride on equipped with adjustable saddle height, quick release lock on pedals, aluminum main frame, composite rear stays, injected composite wheel core with TPR tread, rubber grips, and injected molded plastic seat with open cell EVA pad. Toddler bike recommended for ages 2-5, with a 66 lbs maximum weight. Assembly Required.",
