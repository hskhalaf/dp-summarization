His back legs are getting wobbly, and the vet stated this was normal in older dogs. I was devastated. i looked online for anything that might help my pup. i came across the body wrap and how it helps calm your dog. OMG!! after the 2nd day of wearing it, my Maxie is back!! he's alert, ready for outside, just amazing!!! what a change!!!! thank you so much for giving my pup back!!!!",

The extremely loud ones still startled him, but not like in the past. I highly recommend this! It does run a touch small...his chest measurement falls in the middle of the large size, it fits, but an XL might've been a little better.",

Without this she would often scratch up the carpet and chew on the baby gate that keeps her separated from our male Jindo in the house. Since she's been wearing this while we're at work she's done neither. Our male Jindo has the gray version, and the velcro came unstitched which is common, including with the Thundershirt. We used fabric glue to repair it and it works good as new.",

      "text": "My sweet Daphne is a rescue corgi/mix. She is blind and deaf, and quite old. She has extreme anxiety when she gets stressed out. I didn't know if the calming coat would help her or not. I am so glad I took a chance. Typically one of her meltdowns would last 1-2 hours. Within 5 minutes of putting her in the coat, she was calm. It did take some time for her to adjust to wearing it, anything new is frightening to her, but she feels safe. So glad I purchased this.",

I guess you get what you pay for....I will give it tyo someone who has a smaller dog and if I want a spare will order the Authentic Thundershirt which is well worth the price.",
