Two pieces slide together with a plastic bushing to ensure a snug fit. That bushing never wanted to seat correctly and it would always slide up about an inch, causing a little play and wobble. I re-adjusted it after almost every use, but it had caused enough wobble that the metal actually TORE! If you value your eyes, teeth and nose, there are far better choices.

All you can feel when attempting to perform hyper-extensions is the wood base, and no padding support. In addition, using this for \"roman chair\" sit-ups is awkward at best and again, very uncomfortable. Correct this issue, and this piece of exercise equipment would be OK for hyper-extensions only.",

Nicely made, easy to use, and a great value for the money. Also, like others have noted in their reviews, a 17mm socket wrench, 17mm open/box end wrench, and a 10mm nut driver are all very helpful in putting this together. There are two wrenches included, but they are thin stamped metal and really only good in a pinch.",

It does not wabble, the top pad protects your hip bones and all that just fine. great support & by support i don't mean not helping me with exercise - keeping me where i need to be comfortably. The ONLY thing i will say - don't get this if you're short!!! but it's the best money i think i've ever spent on workout equipment equipment.",
