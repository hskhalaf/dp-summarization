Amazing picture clarity, plenty of functionality and great connectivity make it a quality piece of kit. Bluetooth connectivity means I can transfer photos to my phone in seconds and upload them to Instagram/Twitter within seconds. Have also been working on selfies and selecting 1 or more faces from the face recognition using the flip out screen which is awesome and easy to use for shots from any direction.",

Apart from this small problem I found the camera to do a great job. It\u2019s Bayer but the colours are great as you would expect from FUJI. OVERALL VERY PLEASED WITH THE CAMERA.

It has all the features of a larger SLR but the convenience of compactness and light weight which is great for travel and general everyday purposes, which is what I was looking for. Highly recommended.",

The camera's auto-focus really struggles even in simple situations, and is very slow to lock on a target. I also had the camera freeze on me a couple of times and had to remove the battery to reset. Seems like the software and/or processor in this camera just isn't up to the task. Maybe the former can improve via firmware updates but the camera experience is sadly not on par with recent models from sony, canon, lumix or more expensive fuji ones.",
