It's easy to connect to our kitchen sink with the universal adapter we also bought on Amazon. Had to pay extra to get it sent to our remote location in Alaska, but it was worth it. We found that liquid dishwasher soap works best. Some powder packets did not dissolve as expected even when cut in half, but we later figured out it may have been the packets not the dishwasher at fault. We were hoping it would fit on the counter under the cupboards but it was an inch too tall.",
