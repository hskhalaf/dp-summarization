The IRobot company describe a edge brush to replace after 3 month, but its not a really. Only work two clean and brush damage. In overall, this machine is a waste money. Its a lot expensive over $1,200 and Roomba old version working much better and cost $250 to $350. I'm so disappointment and upset with this product.",

It even cleans under the couches and coffee tables and chairs with no problems. It rarely gets stuck and when it does it's usually due to something we've left in the way like a cord. The self emptying dust bin is very nice and works well.",
