I just wish the gears were more connected when put in different directions. LIke if you put one top and second one you put on the top of the first in different direction, it doesn't interconnect. IF it was, i'd give it all 5's. Very durable product.",

The concept of turning the axle from horizontal to vertical motion looks cool to me, but is too much for toddlers to grasp. They loved being able to turn the handle and see the entire set in motion.
