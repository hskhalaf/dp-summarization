This item worked very well on stretching out those problem areas on my left foot which is just a tad bigger than my right. Would like to see more than 3 metal spot stretchers. Had to stretch meuktille days as there is only 1 stretcher and only 3 metal spot things. But even after all that, I have to give it 5 stars as it works. Very well. Use leather stretcher spray or do a 50/50 rubbing alcohol/water in a spray bottle. Saved my $360 boots. Awesome!!!",

The stripped threads on the adjustment screw have rendered the product unusable, as it can no longer be tightened. Additionally, the holes for the pressure point inserts are not evenly located on the two halves of the stretcher, making it impossible to uniformly stretch right and left shoes, and are too loose to reliably retain the inserts. This product is a complete failure and not worth consideration",

You would think there would be a universal size for shoe sizes that all companies have to go by but that's not the case.

Anyway I used this stretcher on my troublesome left boots and it definitely did enough to make them comfortable and I can now wear them all day without issue. I have a 10.5-11 size foot and I bought the large size. Although it worked fine, it is a tight squeeze so I'd suggest ordering true to size. I would recommend this product.",
