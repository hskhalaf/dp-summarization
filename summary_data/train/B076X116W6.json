You can change the color, and pick different moods, my daughter likes the rainbow mode particularly. And .. you get a speaker on it! The sound is not like a super expensive speaker, but I was impressed by it. If there is an improvement needed, I would say, add a timer function to the app? so it can turn itself on at say 10pm and shut itself off at 7am for a night light. Overall, it's beyond my expectation, highly recommend!",

I do enjoy the light effects, but the app is noticeably low res, and no real customization available, which I understand that to keep the cost down this product is not feature-rich. The sound quality is good, not as loud as the pulse solo, and no stereo quality audio.

It connect to devices via Bluetooth which is a + since i can paly music from YouTube while still moving around the house. Its loud enough for a bulb speaker and sound quality is good. Sometimes the app connection is slow and i have to disconnect the Bluetooth which can be annoying but rarely do i use it since my core functionality is normal light and the sound. I'd say its a good buy.",

We got one of these to replace it and broadcast louder and better sound from our phones without adding the clutter of a portable speaker. It's been perfect for that. The light is a much better match for other sources as well; behind a lamp shade, or inside a recessed fixture, you're unlikely to even notice it. It's not going to overpower a crowded party, but for listening to podcasts while knocking out chores, or playing some tunes for family game night, it's a great choice.",

My only complaint is that it is slightly longer than standard sized bulbs so my originally plan to put this above my kitchen table didn't succeed. I've had this in the bathroom for a couple of months and it seems to handle the humidity from the shower and such very well.",
