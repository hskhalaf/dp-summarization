There was maybe two days of break-in period where my feet were just more weary at the end of the day...but no pain. On the fourth day I had these I spent the entire day in them walking all over Pompeii. They were perfect...and have been my go-to footwear all summer. I even have the \"Z tanline.\" =)",

If sand or rocks get kicked up (which is impossible to avoid) they get stuck between your foot and the sole and the straps make it so you can't get the debris out without taking the whole sandal off. So your options are take your sandal off and restrap every 3 minutes or get absurd blisters. Even without debris I get lots of rubbing and blisters all over. These belong in the garbage.",

I hiked the mountains, bushwacked to remote fishing spots and generally wore them until the soles fell off. I tried the recent styles with the toe loop, but they just didn't feel right. I'm so glad Chaco is keeping this classic style available. As soon as I put these on they felt perfect, like an old friend, my feet just immediately felt at home. I have my doubts these will last 8 years, but as much as I abuse them I'm confident they'll serve me well.",

If you splash the rue a river the straps stay wet for a little bit but drive fairly quickly compared to a keen or similar sandal with more layers. Honestly I just love the pizza slices compared to any of the other designs but the build quality has won me over to the chacos",
