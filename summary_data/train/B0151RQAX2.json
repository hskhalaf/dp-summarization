It is very weak plastic as soon as I began to tighten the clamp screws the corner of the bracket snapped off. The third photo is of the redesigned bracket sent to me from the company's customer service. Since I had already made my own bracket I have not used the one sent to me but it does appear to be a stronger design than the original one that broke while installing it. I will say their customer service is responsive which is appreciated. Due to their great service I have bumped my original review from 3 stars to 5 stars.",

I had visions of having to cut this 1/2\" cable off but using a slip-joint pliers to hold one dial while using another to move the adjacent dial, was able to get it off.

IMO suggest you get the 6' version unless your application fits the narrow window described. Update: Company sent me a 6' version of this bike cable/lock (for free) which is much more practical for most situations. Kudos for good service. Thanx",
