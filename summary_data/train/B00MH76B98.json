It carries a smooth leather upper with premium stitching and overlay accents. It provides the finest comfort and support by offering insole with Memory Foam, padded collar and tongue and the soft fabric shoe lining.The shock absorbing low profile and flexible rubber outsole of this shoe provides maximum support while walking with it. However, the outsole of this pair is not grippy enough, especially on wet surfaces. \u00a0Reevaluating all the features of the Skechers Citywalk - Malton at the price point that is very affordable, this pair is worth every penny.",

I've upgraded them with some aftermarket insoles to help and thrown the stock insoles in the garbage. YMMV,but I like Skechers because they fit my foot shape and were (usually) a very comfortable shoe to wear. These don't feel that comfortable.",

The \"memory foam\" padding it advertises by the way is absolutely worthless. Just add a nice insole on top and be done!",

Is it due to a mistake or is it simply how they are made? Whichever it may be, the length and width are not the same as the others with this pair. They are such that if I wear a thicker dress/casual sock with them they are too tight and my toes rub in them. Thinner socks make them bearable and not much more. FYI I ordered the size 13W.",

The front of the shoe seems to be curved up a bit more then it should be which made it uncomfortable for the first few days of wearing them. I made the mistake of wearing them outside as soon as I received them so I was unable to return them for a refund. The sole does not provide that much support either, at least not for a 6'5\" 215 pounds guy. I would not buy these shoes again or recommend them to anyone else. On the other hand they look good.",
