      "text": "Great as a plug-in. Good, low-end heavy sound. I like that I can play music directly off a USB drive. As a true portable, it's not great. It takes about $30 worth of D batteries, so it's really not feasible to use it in that manner. But when you get down to it, to get really good sound, you need real power and this thing has it. Considering buying 2. Not something you'd take to the beach, but great to use plugged in by the pool, in the bathroom or even as a home stereo.",

For the price, it's far and away the best portable speaker system I've heard. Note: portability comes at a small price. If you take this on a plane flight, you will have your luggage searched every time. As a TSA agent said, \"Man, that thing looks SINISTER on the x-ray.\"",

Minus 1 star because this like their other boombox will still draw power from the batteries when it is turned off, fresh batteries will be dead in less than a week if not removed.",

I love the fact they did that! As far as the sound goes, the audio is crisp, clear and loud. So far, I have not found fault with the unit.

New version has to be plugged in at all times so it is not practical if you want portability and don't mind an extra wire to hook up your devices. I think the new version doesn't have a tuner either!
