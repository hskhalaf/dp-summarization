I replaced the faucet with the KOHLER K-6666-VS Wellspring Beverage Faucet. Water tests of the tap water (Los Angeles) are as follows: total dissolved solids (TDS) of 334 ppm, PH of 7.74, and electrical conductivity (EC) of 670 uS/cm. After flushing through three to four tanks, the HydroPerfection system provides a TDS of 27 ppm, a PH of 7.86, and an EC of 53 uS/cm. Water tests were performed with the Hanna Instruments HI991300 pH/EC/TDS low range meter.",

One of the main reasons I chose the Home Master system over other brands is the 5 year warranty, compared to only 1 year for all the others I researched.

I take a large bottle of water to work everyday that I fill at home because nothing out there tastes better or is more refreshing. It was a breeze to install. We went for a 9 gal tank due to 3 large teenage boys. I even bought their food grade tubing and ran a refrigerator line. No leaks, no fuss. Yes...the knocking sound of the pump can be noticed, but there are methods to mount it with some shock absorbing material between it and the wall to reduce that. Highly recommended.",

      "text": "This has been the best investment we have made in a long time. With a family of 6, drinking bottled water was becoming increasingly expensive and half the time, only half the bottle was consumed before the kids would confuse whose water bottle was whose. Frustrating and wasteful. This has eliminated all of that! The water tastes much better than store bought bottled water and no longer worried about bpa's leaching into our water. I did by 48 oz bpa free water bottles by Nalgene on Amazon so hubby and kids could carry to school/work. Installation was easy and straightforward. Hubby completed in about 2 hours.",
