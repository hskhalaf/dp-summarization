      "text": "This thing is awesome. I have taken it hiking, camping, and used it around my house. It is strong, but not too heavy. The blade has hacked through 3 inch branches with minimal effort. The saw back is a little cantankerous because it seems to clog with wood if its not dry wood. It's a fantastic tool for bushwhacking. The little knife that comes with it is cool to. It could use a better handle but works all the same. I don't really feel the need to take another blade when I go on a hike, this thing has me covered well.",

It's great for dry hands, but any kind of sweat would make it hard to hold on to. Also, it would be nice if they offered the sheath as a left handed option as well. Overall I would recommend this to anyone.",
