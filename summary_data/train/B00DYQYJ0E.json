I've used these in larger sizes to take movies on airplanes, make playlists for my car stereo, and other normal thumb drive uses, etc. The design works for me because it's easy to carry, can be put on a keychain, and the utilitarian shape allows for east labeling.

      "text": "I needed memory for backup and file transport. Previously purchased some 'no-name' brand pack of five sticks and found them to be full memory but SLOW to the point that they couldnot be used. The 'no-name' brand transffered data at roughly 27Kb/sec! It would take hours to fill a stick at that rate and the access time was worse. I then decided to pay roughly $1 more (each) for five of these Kingston thumbdrives. They flash on for immediate access, transfer data in burst at more than 20Meg/sec and constant transfer at 4Meg/sec.",

I'm a college professor and had it on my office keys for three or so years to bring my lectures with me to the various classrooms. That drive got full so I got the 32 GB replacement. It has been really slow. It took a long time to transfer files from the 8GB drive to the 32 and whenever I open files on the 32 GB drive it is really slow. I have no idea why the larger drive is running so much slower, but it is rather disappointing. I never experienced the memory part falling out of the casing as others have reported.",

      "text": "This drive is super durable. I normally get a little antsy about the plastic thumb drives but I still buy those because I do like that they are a bit larger and more colorful so they are less likely to get lost in my bags. I keep this attached to my keychain and I am not gentle with my keys. It has survived a lot of abuse and has come in handy many times. I don't keep anything important on it, but rather use it to transfer files or as a secondary backup option to keep my hard drive clear. It is small enough that I don't even notice it on my keychain while I'm carrying my keys around.",

The pictures don't do it justice. The thing would fit inside a USB slot if it were a little deeper. Look at the plug that sticks out of a USB device, That's the size of the entire drive. It's one piece of smooth metal. One side is stamped with Kingston and the size is on the other. Both completely understated. Lovely thing. I got 8 and 16 GB models and the only difference is the amount of storage, and in the right light the size etched on the outside.",

Unfortunately, it is quite slow - I can only manage about 4MBps read or write. I am only getting these to send large collections of photos or the like by mail, so it doesn't matter too much, but it is much too slow for real-world use, like copying a bunch of files quickly from my work PC (where I have a fast Internet connection) just before preparing to leave.",
