The bottom of the trays are \"woven\" and not smooth so if you were to cook anything in it I believe that food would be caught in those grooves which would be hard to clean and not to mention all those \"bamboo threads\" just way too many for me to feel comfortable using and there was a metal wire holding one of the trays together. I'm surprised that they didn't use any of the bamboo threads to hold it together.",
