I bought these as a Christmas gift for my daughter, and even with an initial gentle no soap wash, her hands swelled so bad her fingers were straight for 3 days. It was not the material as she is a scuba diver, and after I washed them twice, in a regular wash cycle with soap and hot water, she stopped breaking out and swelling. She does enjoy them, and they work well, but beware to thoroughly wash them at least twice with soap and hot water before using.",

Although I like these for swimming, cannot recommend as they will ruin your items if in close quarters such as a gym bag. I believe if the manufacturer addresses this problem, they would be fine",
