They are everything I would ever hope for in a toothbrush. They have a very nice and smooth mouth-feel, unlike traditional toothbrushes (which have the tendency to feel like pine needles). The texture of the handle is also magnificent. I found it very nice that it came with four toothbrushes. That is essentially a years worth. In fact, it would have lasted a year for me, had my parents not stolen them for themselves, after my constant boasting of their quality.",

I like extra-soft bristles, but I like these, even though I'd rank them as \"soft\". I think they have the effect of extra-soft bristles because of their tapered lengths: they're not cut blunt. A huge plus is how small the brushes and heads are! I didn't know that tricked-out conventional toothbrushes are too big for my mouth. I didn't need longer bristles: I needed a smaller toothbrush head! My molars are so happy and smooth. These brushes feel great in my hand, they fit in my cabinet, and I feel good about keeping extras for guests. Hooray!",

Also a few bristles have shed. The last thing I noticed was that it feels like, well, a twig in your hand. I found that by running the whole brush and handle in water this wasn't an issue. Might just be me, but it solved the problem. I like it, and have a whole set of brushes for me.",

The body of the brush feels really thin, but it's surprisingly strong. I loved the fact that the company sent me emails asking if I received them, if they were ok, and to see if they were what I expected. Loved the communication, the packaging, and I can rest at night knowing we're making a difference by not using plastic.",

That\u2019s 50 million pounds of plastic trash that\u2019s dumped into landfills. 80% of that plastic ends up in our oceans. If each toothbrush takes 300 years to decompose, that makes 15 billion years to biodegrade. That\u2019s a serious problem. \n\nThe Solution\nUse the White Smile all natural bamboo handle toothbrush with natural charcoal bristles. The bristles are soft, and naturally antibacterial. The handle is made of a smooth moso bamboo that will be gone in months after you stop using it, instead of centuries. \n\nFeatures \nFree of BPA Plastics which have been known to cause brain memory loss, retardation in unborn babies, diabetes, asthma, and male impotence. \nSoft charcoal bristles made of naturally activated charcoal. \nMoso bamboo handle, smooth and will biodegrade quickly. \nAs economical as plastic toothbrushes, why put more plastic into the oceans?\n\nWhy Choose Us?\n* We support local economies and buy from small family run cooperatives. \n* We give back to the OceanCleanUp Project to help keep our planets clean, the largest human endevour to clean our ocean's in history. \n* We're based out of the USA! Family owned and operated.\n\nLIFETIME GUARANTEE \nSome people talk about a 30 day money back guarantee, Ha! How about for life? If you have a problem, just write us and we'll honour our word. \n\nBuy now on the sale price, we don't know how long this will last!",
