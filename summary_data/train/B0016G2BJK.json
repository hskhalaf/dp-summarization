    "title": "Dove Beauty Bar Gentle Cleanser for Softer and Smoother Skin with 1/4 Moisturizing Cream White More Moisturizing than Bar Soap, 3.75 oz, 6 Bars",
    "description": "Dove White Beauty Bar combines a gentle cleansing formula with our signature 1/4 moisturizing cream to hydrate and nourish skin, instead of leaving skin feeling dry and tight like an ordinary bar soap might. Dove mild cleansers help skin retain its natural moisture, which helps keep skin hydrated, and Dove Beauty Bar even helps replenish skin-natural nutrients that can be lost during the cleansing process. Use your Beauty Bar as a facial cleanser or as a gentle skin cleanser for your body and hands. For best results, rub between wet hands and massage the smooth, creamy lather over your skin before rinsing thoroughly. The secret to beautiful skin is moisture, and no other bar hydrates skin better than Dove. That\u2019s because Dove isn\u2019t a soap; it\u2019s a Beauty Bar. Formulated with mild cleansers that care for skin as you cleanse, this moisturizing bar helps deliver nourishment and leave your face and body feeling soft and smooth and looking more radiant than ordinary soap does. Our vision is of a world where beauty is a source of confidence, and not anxiety. Our mission is to help the next generation of women develop a positive relationship with the way they look, helping them raise their self-esteem and realize their full potential.\n\nBRAND STORY\nBy Dove",
