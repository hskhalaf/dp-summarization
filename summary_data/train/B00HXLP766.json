I bought this globe to help my children with homework; specifically state capitals in America. Now I have to buy a map of the USA. The quality would have been 5 stars but without state capitals, it's useless to me so it only gets 1 star.",

We are very satisfied with the quality and design of this globe. It feels good and solid, not loose or rickety. The seams and longitude lines are 99% correctly lined up.

The gimbaled base is very useful when you want to examine the southern hemisphere, and is much better than a fixed axis globe. The alignment between the hemispheres on our globe is pretty good, though not perfect. The analemma is not drawn accurately and isn't marked with dates, just seasons, but this isn't a feature we ever use, so it isn't an issue for us. The time zone disk at the north pole doesn't seem to be rotatable like on other globes, though possibly loosening the top screw would allow it to turn.",

The students were immediately attracted to it and began asking questions, such as where countries are located and how the earth's rotation results in the daytime/nighttime cycle.",
