I thought the angle of the glass was extreme, and I worried that I couldn't view it and read naturally, and yet, that company knows what they are doing.

I'm extremly satisfied. Old Review: Everything works except the glass itself, it doubles the image with any screen you put on.

The fabric smelt of cigarette smoke when I received it and sometimes falls in front of the lens despite using the cord and the neck.

I had to add a cheese plate between the teleprompter and my tripod mounting plate because there are very large screw heads protruding from the bottom of prompter, so without the added height it wouldn't slide onto the tripod. 2. Add a second screw to the camera mounting platform. With just one screw the camera can slowly spin (used and FS5), out of place as you take it on and off the tripod. Again, this wouldn't stop me from buying it again, just little details that would be nice.",

I preferred it over both reading the teleprompter and filming straight on my phone.",
