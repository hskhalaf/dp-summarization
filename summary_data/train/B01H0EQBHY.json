This method took hours to make the ice cream but it was worth the wait. This mix comes close to the original homemade cream. I was so impressed I recently ordered my second box and will be making my second batch over the weekend. I even froze the leftover and it retained its soft-serve consistency which I was was not expecting. This was well worth the money and I will be a frequent buyer.",

Light, creamy (as are all Triple Scoop's mixes), flavorful, & delicious, their vanilla is perfect for enlivening a bland dessert, or for serving on its own with a topping of home-made jam. When making this ice cream, I've sometimes mixed-in a little melted chocolate, small pieces of fresh fruit, or a few drops of almond extract, all with delicious results.",

With this product he has been having fun creating his own gourmet flavors like adding a ribbon of salted caramel, or adding a balsamic reduction with strawberries, or one time he infused earl grey tea in it. I highly recommend giving it a try!",
