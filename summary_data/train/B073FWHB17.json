Plus a big rubber pad to practice on any table top. Buy this and put top of the line heads on it and it will be the last snare drum you will ever need, Wanted to add....the stand that came with my order is far heavier than the one in the pics My lucky day??.The ONLY issue I have with anything is the stand is made more for a standing position,It sits quite high,but still usable with a full set.",
