It's important to hold the skin taut with one hand as you brush with the other hand, and to not brush too hard or too long in one spot. I do think using this brush too vigorously could be painful. I alternate brushing a few strokes with this brush, and then a few strokes with a soft rubber Grooma brush to kind of massage the area and make it feel better. I definitely can't do a full groom in one session with this brush, at least with my sensitive skinned cat.",

I thought because she was a shorthaired dog that she wouldn\u2019t shed as much but I was wrong. This brush collects so much hair every time I use it, it\u2019s amazing!! I brush her for about 5 minutes every other day. And I\u2019ve noticed a great difference in how much she sheds. If I forget to do it for a couple days she sheds a lot again, so consistency is key!! I am so happy with this purchase and won\u2019t ever use anything but this one ever again. I 1,000,000% RECOMMEND!!!!",

It's narrower than I thought it would be but that's on me for not paying attention to descriptions. I should definitely be able to catch up on my brushing now. Would buy again.",

The cats really enjoy being brushed with them, and we use them daily. If you want a great brush at a reasonable cost, this is the brush for you. Chances are you will want to have more than one to keep at different locations in your home to keep your pet looking good and your home fur free. We highly recommend this brush.",

I convinced my mom that she also needed one for her golden doodle and this thing takes off a small dogs worth of hair from him every time she brushes him out.

My cottony Persian tolerated it somewhat, but it pulled his fur way too much, and I got a lot less fur on the comb than I do with the typical pet store brush. I will continue to use this on both in hopes that it prevents matting on my Persian's fur, but I'm not too optimistic!",
