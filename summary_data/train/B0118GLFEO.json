Because of foot issues (bunions & arthritis), I normally wear extra wide. The silver color is a shade of light gray & looks nice. I returned them because: ~~One shoe seemed longer than the other & was too long for me. ~~One shoe had a weak spot on the inside, near the small toe. The shoes are designed to be light & somewhat airy so I was concerned the weak spot would wear and eventually cause a hole in that area. And the longer shoe flopped up & down on my foot.",

I guess that's because they are so lightweight and have super flexible soles. The inside feels good and there is some light arch support, but the fabric of the shoes themselves is sort of stretchy so they don't really hold your foot stable. Anyway, since I can't really wear them for work because I need something more supportive, they'll be fine for yard work or something. They are too unattractive to actually wear with anything besides scrubs in this color.",
