Because of the somewhat heavy weight of the head this becomes tiresome over time.

The only problem is that grass and weeds do have a tendency to get tangled around the blades fairly easily although they are easy to remove. The battery did well although the total area I did was only about 100-120 square feet. I do have a second battery from a Black and Decker hedge trimmer. It was also comfortable to use as the handle adjusted very easily. Overall seems good for light to medium duty work.",
