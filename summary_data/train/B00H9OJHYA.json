      "text": "First the tent itself is very nice, Nice zipper and nice fabric. Little light leaks out. The inside has diamond mylar with enough openings to vent or whatever. Now the two things to watch out for. 1. The instructions are not accurate. You have to assemble the frame inside the tent not fold the tent around as shown. 2. The frame is too big for the tent. I had to shorten both ends of most of the poles in order for them to be assembled. There was no way I could have put the frame together as it was. Now that it is up, I do like it but I shouldn't have to modify it so it can be assembled.",

I've been using it on and off for close to a year. My favorite part is the Zipper: Only one seam to unzip. My Gorilla grow tent takes 5 (! yes, 5 separate zippers!) to open the front, so I appreciate there only being one zipper. NOTE: This tent is NOT light proof... although no tents are really. Even my Gorilla tent has light leaks. But if you are ok with this, this tent is an amazing bang for the buck.",

Soon we'll need to purchase a vent fan and filter, so I'll update the review when we actually use the 6\" vent holes.

Some people complained on here about it being too snug and difficult to put together, but I didn't seem to have those problems at all. Others said it's\u200b a 2 person job.
