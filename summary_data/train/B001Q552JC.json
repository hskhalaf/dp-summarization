The color fades a bit after a few hours, especially if you're eating or drinking (like sipping coffee at your desk all morning, for instance) and you'll need to reapply, but I think it's not a big deal since these marker-type stains don't usually last all day. I usually top with my favorite chapstick and am good to go.",

The only thing I could say is a flaw, is that it's supposed to be a lip stain, and although it does stay, it doesn't last long... I had to reapply a few times a day to maintain the colour. Overall, it's a handbag staple, the colour is gorgeous & it's a definite must have. Buy it!!",
