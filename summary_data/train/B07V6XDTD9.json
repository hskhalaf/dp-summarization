Unable to ascertain if the laptop had been tampered with and the disguised damage to the seals themselves suggests that something is not right. I returned immediately and highlighted poor quality to Amazon. Waiting for a refund. Pictures show a broken seal but in such a way to allow the original printed section to be 're-stuck'. The inner product box was similar. Very disappointed as the item was purchased as 'new'.",

    "description": "Size Name:17.3| Style Name:Core i7, RTX 2060Ready for battle and eager for a fight, the Helios 300 drops you into the game with everything you need. Only now they have armed it with NVIDIA GeForce RTX graphics, the 9th Gen Intel Core Processors and the custom-engineered 4th Gen AeroBlade 3D Technology. Your gaming laptop\u2019s style should match your own \u2013 with a look that says, \u201cStart the match! I\u2019m ready! \u201d So that when the black, metal-clad machine flares into life, filling the screen of the narrow-frame display with lurid colors, let it remind them that you know only one path: victory. Speed is at the core of this laptop with the display leading the charge. How? they have chosen a 144Hz IPS panel with a 3ms Overdrive response time. Farewell blur and hello clear, crisp, high-octane gameplay. Go on and hook up a few extra displays via the ports through HDMI 2. 0, DisplayPort 1. 4.

All Predator laptops utilize the custom-engineered cooling technology. The latest generation\u2019s new design reduces noise while increasing airflow \u2013 allowing you to maximize your performance no matter the task. Inspired by silent, powerful owl flight mechanics they gave the fans a serrated edge, allowing more air to pass through. Each of the 59 bionic blades is just 0. 1mm thick and all-metal with a stabilizing dual indent groove. Winglets along the top and bottom fan edge and a curved fin along the inner blade further reduce turbulence. The 4-zone RGB customized keyboard uses the own Predator typeface, has see-through concave-shaped keycaps for WASD and features two integral keys to take note of: Turbo and PredatorSense. Tap Turbo for instant overclocking or hit PredatorSense to open the utility app. Turn any pair of headphones into a high-end 360\u00b0 surround sound system with Waves NX 3D Sound \u2013 enabling you to experience your favourite movies, music and games with real-world 3D sound.

With Killer\u2019s E2500 Ethernet Controller, Wireless-AC 1550i and Killer Control Centre 2. 0, you have all the tools you need to clear out the online competition keep your ping low and 100% optimized.",
