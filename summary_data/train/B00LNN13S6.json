No it can't do TTL or anything fancy like that but if you want a manual flash that's easy to operate and reliable with a decent build quality then this is your best bet. It's plenty powerful enough and also comes with a terrific little soft box which is incredibly useful and can also be used for other classes as well.",

I can also hook this up and use it as a flash off camera because I also bought a wireless flash trigger from the same company. I love Altura products and will continue to buy them in the future.",

A bunch of shots are either you dark, or very grainy because my ISO had to be so high. I won't be buying again and don't recommend anyone else buying unless you only need it for a few months.",

It's a solid purchase for first-time flash users and good quality at a very good price. I'm thinking of buying a pair for some studio setups.",

It will fail :( Update - I changed my review to 3 stars because the customer service is great. The company contacted me and issued a refund for the defective flash, which was a very kind and respectable thing for them to do.",

Intensity control is good, and I like the pull-out diffusion plate, although you need to be gentle with it in general, as this is not the most durable flash. This thing is pretty bulky as well. The little stand is close to useless. My favorite item that comes with the kit is the bag. I'd recommend for the photographer on a small budget, but you get what you pay for.",

      "text": "The flash is great for lighting up the area or possibly blinding anything within a 100ft radius including yourself. I've used the remote and microfiber cable a lot more than I've used this flash. For the photography that I take, (primarily automotive and event photography) the flash is too bright and I can't find much use for it. The diffuser and lightbox are somewhat of a joke and don't seem to soften the light at all. Even on the lowest setting the light can be obnoxious and cause too much glare.",
