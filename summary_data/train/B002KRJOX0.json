Getting the shock sensor adjusted and working correctly for each application is always iffy. Directed Electronics tech support would prefer you take their products to an \"authorized installer\".",

And you may think so what its not a big deal however, it becomes an issue when you don't know if your car is locked or unlocked. plus I hate buying things that show a picture of one thing and you get something else. I will say amazon and the seller were great about it. I told them of the issue and got my return shipping paid for and was refunded for the shipping I paid. so buy with confidence",

      "text": "Nice unit, instructions geared toward installers (so you need to know what wires to connect to in your car) The manual provides a little guidance, came with siren, LCD remote, control unit, wiring pigtails, and remote antenna. Installation (one you identify the various connections in your car) not too bad, recommend professional installation unless you really have time and patience available to you. Note Directed electronics makes virtually all of the car alarms (Clifford, Viper, Avital, etc) so its the same unit. This version includes internal relays for the parking lights and door lock/unlock and start disable. Instructions are pretty good about power lock wiring. This is *not* for the faint of heart though, you've been warned :-)",
