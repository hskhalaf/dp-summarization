      "text": "It's easy to see why GoPro is doing well, and Contour went out of business. My camera never worked quite right. After a short time recording, it would stop any further recording without having to reformat an SD card. It doesn't matter if it was the same one it was just using, or a new one. You would just have to reformat again for no good reason if you wanted to keep recording. I'm not made of money and spare SD cards to wipe clean just to record another short session. So I sold this thing off and picked up a GoPro hero 3+ silver, which is the best camera I've ever had, not a single hiccup yet with it.",

      "text": "Camera is amazingly flexible in programming features. When riding, I found audio to be relatively poor, may be related to filtering of ambient noise........ Audio was good in low noise environments. Video and still photos are of excellent quality and the GPS feature is very useful when editing video and photos weeks later when you are not sure exactly where you were when a photo or video footage was shot. Camera is very aerodynamic when mounted on motorcycle helmet. Very little noticeable drag, even at very high speed. Looking forward to using camera at Sturgis in August.",

The slide on top of the camera turns recording on and off, and unlike with other helmet cams that use a push button, it's easy to tell which direction the slide is in. What I like least is that it's impossible to tell what you are filming. The camera will give you a preview using bluetooth and a smartphone (iPhone adapter cost $30 extra), but it's not live action. Battery life is mediocre.",

The power on/off button didn't work well and it usually took me several times to turn off the machine; 2. The battery is not good and it only work less than 2 hours with full-charged battery; 3. The body of the camera turned too hot during long recording. I am not sure whether it is the product design issue or it is only quality problem for my camera, but I really don't suggest to buy this.",

However, the fittings and accessories are somehow expensive and not really quite versatile to adapt to many outdoors applications.

Good camera, but surely needs a lot of improvement. Not sure I would get the same one if this one eventually breaks.",

In sunny days the picture is gorgeous, although snowboarding under snow and or rain will wet the lens and ruin the picture quality, but I guess this is true for any other camera. Overall, a good buy for me, but I did not try other video camera of comparable price range to compare.",

    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\n\nVideo mapping from the world's smallest and lightest gps video camera. The ContourGPS captures beautiful 1080p video. It utilizes a 135\u00b0 wide-angle rotating lens that delivers a true high quality image that captures all the action with minimal distortion and fish-eye. It records Full HD in all its glory. \n\n\n\n\n\nCONTOURGPS PRODUCT FEATURES:\nLOCATION\nAdd an entire new layer to your storytelling. The built-in GPS receiver tracks your location, speed, and altitude while also recording in beautiful hands free HD. Using our Storyteller application you can assemble and upload your run to contour.com and watch it via interactive map and video player that allows you to rewind, fast forward or click to the best parts in your run. \n\nHD\nThe ContourGPS captures beautiful 1080p video. It utilizes a 135\u00b0 wide-angle lens that delivers a true high quality image that captures all the action with minimal distortion and no fish eye. It records Full HD in all its glory.\n\nWe provide several different camera settings so that you can get the shot that best fits your activity. Choose between 3 resolutions and 2 frame rates or a still photo mode.\n\n\nHANDS FREE\nThe ContourHD revolutionized the way people shoot and share video by creating the first wearable HD video camera. The Secret? A low profile design mated to the patented TRail\u2122 system that makes it easy to slide and lock to your body, equipment, or vehicle. The camera, at only 5.2 ounces is the smallest and lightest combination of hands-free video and GPS. It's also easy to operate and use. As simple as sliding a single oversized switch forward to start recording, even with a pair of gloves on. In addition we make it simple to line up your shot with a rotating lens and two lasers that assure you get that perfect shot. \n\nMOBILE\nThe most connected video camera in the world, ContourGPS has built-in Bluetooth and a mobile App to turn your phone into a wireless viewfinder. Available on the Apple iOS platform, ContourGPS enables your iPhone or iPod Touch to line up your shot and change your settings in real-time. Hands-free video just got a lot more hands-free.\n\n*To use Apple iOS products with a ContourGPS you will need to purchase the Connect View accessory.\n\n\nAUDIO\nThe built-in omni-directional microphone captures the rich sounds of the ride. Using AAC Audio Compression, the bottom-facing microphone assures you that you see and hear your adventure. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDITIONAL PRODUCT FEATURES\nSTORAGE\nThe compact and lightweight design principle was carried throughout every detail of the ContourGPS. The internal Micro SD card captures hours of HD content while remaining one of the smallest pieces on the camera. When expanded up to 32 GB, it will record over 8 hours of HD content on one card when in Full HD 1080p mode. \n\nSOFTWARE\nWe provide the tools for you to download the videos from your camera to your computer in just a few clicks. Editing is as simple as an \"Awesome\" button to feature the best parts of your story, then you can become the ultimate producer by adding a title, description, and keywords, and epic location of your video.\n\nCOMMUNITY\nYou provide the story, we give you the platform to tell thousands of members just like you.

Tall HD 960p 1280 x 960 30 fps For those sports like surfing that are better suited to a taller image. Action HD 720p 1280 x 720 60 fps When frame rate is more important than resolution. The perfect setting to capture the fastest action. It reduces blur and rolling shutter effect. Contour 720p 1280 x 720 30 fps When space on your card is at a premium and you need to record that last epic adventure. Still Photo 2592 x 1944 3, 5, 10, 30 or 60 sec When you want to freeze frame the action, the photo mode is your perfect shot.
