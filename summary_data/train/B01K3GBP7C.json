      "text": "I haven't been using it too long I've only done about 20 shirts. But so far so good! I was pressing vinyl on shirts with an iron and one 3 layered onesie would take about an hour AND the vinyl would shrink so it ended up not lining up well. Best $200 I've spent. I've cut pressing time by about 2000% so worth it if you have constant requests coming in! S/n: If you're wondering if it's a good choice or not I asked a family friend who owns a print shop to help me choose between this and two others and he said this was a good choice for price quality and size!",

However it seems no matter how focused and hard I tried to iron on the vinyl I would get peeling spots after washing. This heat press has made it so much easier to make shirts and I have not had an issue with peeling using multiple brands of vinyl on different types of fabrics. Highly recommend this heat press for anyone working with HTV!",

I purchased the 15x15 because my husband is a 3XLT and his shirt designs are all 11.75\" wide, so a smaller one wouldn't have sufficed. Extremely easy to use. Plugged it in, selected the temperature and time and that was IT! However.. when I have this on and it switches into heating up mode, my ceiling fan light dims. When it switches off, ceiling fan light goes bright again. It's on a normal wall socket.",

Ex: 331 on the digital readout is actually 320 at the platen, measured with a temp gun. The upper platen has quite a bit of variation in heat distribution. The front usually ranges from 5-8 degrees hotter than the back, when checking with my laser temp gun. This poses a challenge on larger transfers for even heat distribution. Once you get the specifics of the machine figured out, it is easy to use, and seems to give even pressure throughout. Overall, I won\u2019t complain for the price. Great for starting out with your first heat press.",

When attempting to open on heavy pressure, the whole thing lifts. I have to pull down on the protective sheet and lift the arm at the same time. My tip is start trying to open around three seconds remaining.",
