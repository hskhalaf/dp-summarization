So each of these can fill a 10 oz sanitizer 3 times and is equivalent overall to having 12 smaller pump bottles of sanitizer. A great deal for the price point! It is effective at killing germs and keeping us healthy during this crazy time we're in. It does seem a little thinner than it used to be and not as thick as Purrell. Overall, very happy with these and they'll last us a long time.",
