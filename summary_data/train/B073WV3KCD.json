I've had the same one at my desk for almost a year now and it works perfectly everytime, just like my OEM cable at home.",

Update: updating stars from 1 to 5 for excellent customer service. Merchant reached out, apologized, and offered a replacement or a full refund. I chose new cables as these are nice looking cords and cannot be confused with the other types of phone cords which are typically black/white",

The end snaps in to their receptive outlets and that I love. Hopefully, the company will send me another set to try. My understanding they are still under their 18 month warranty.

I have my phone mounted close to my truck's 12-volt USB port and the smaller 1 foot cord is great for my setup. I don't like to have a lot of cords hanging all over my truck's dash and console so this cord is perfect for that. I was very surprised at the quality of these cables for the price I paid.",

I was also surprised by the wee bag. I liked them enough to buy it again. The sizes are a better selection than I expected. The 6' is a lot of cable but nice to have when you want to use the phone when charging. The two 4' cables work well for general purpose data and charging. And that 1' cable is a perfect companion for an extra power battery because it packs away very small.",
