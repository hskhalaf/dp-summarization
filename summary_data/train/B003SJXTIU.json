The flow adjuster is, thankfully, on the top - not inside the unit or inside the tank like some other brands. Makes it really easy to play with the flow. The flow can be notched down for this to give a moderate flow in a 10 gallon tank to higher flows for bigger tanks. Easy to use, easy to clean - everything slides out individually. Because the filter is compartmentalized, like a canister filter, you can customize your filter media. The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is that the unit is a little loud.",

The filter material would get so clogged with algae at the top that it would be a trickle of water coming out, and I would clean it out. I did a full clean of the filter two weeks prior to this. It was on my 30 gal guppy tank, tanks been established over a year and this was supposed to be a replacement/ upgrade from the aqueon i had. I think ill end up getting an aquaclear as i have two other established tanks with them. They keep a much better flow as well.",

I have tried rebuilding it multiple times, and tried every tip that I could find on the internet. This thing is terrible. It's loud enough to Wake the Dead.

The C4 fits the rim of a 40 breeder easier compared to the Aquaclear 70. I'm not sure I like the telescoping inlet. The whole filter syphons out once you drain your tank lower than the joint.

It does a great job and the water is crystal clear, but after four months this thing is noisy, I mean loud noisy. I have my 29 gal setting here in my living room, and it is very distracting how loud the Fluval C4 is. I have cleaned the motor and impeller, lubricated it with vaseline as others have suggested, and it does help the noise, but a couple of days later it is just as loud and noisy as before. Ordering new parts, motor and impeller is not much cheaper then buying a whole new filter. But this time I am going with an Aquaclear.",

It does take a little effort to get it primed (used a cup to pour some water into the top until it caught up) and you can hear it if you listen, but I would certainly not call it loud or annoying and other posts suggest a little Vaseline on the gears to solve both problems. I haven't tried it yet, but I expect it would work.",

I LOVE that the different filtering stages are separate and can be replaced/cleaned separately. Super happy with my purchase. Was at the end of my rope. I have had other \"comparable filters\" before. One with that stupid bio-wheel. HATED THEM! I resisted getting a \"filter\" other than the sponge filter because of those experiences.

My wife is using it on her 37 gallon salt water tank and the nitrate levels are always good. It has a little red pop up bottom that lets you know when the sponge is full of \"stuff\" so you can rinse it in the sink. Unit is compartmentalized so you can leave it on the back of the tank and just pull out the various filters, media, carbon and clean or change them out. You can also choose two flow speeds by moving the intake tube from left to right, hi and low.",

    "description": "Style:C4| Product Packaging:Standard Packaging14003 Size: C4 (Between 40 and 70 gallons) Features: -Power filter. -5 stages of filtration: 2 mechanical, 1 chemical and 2 biological stages for top performance. -Equipped with Poly/Foam, Activated Carbon, C-nodes and drip tray pad. -Biological filtration is super charged for fast and efficient nitrification. Filter Type: -Power. Filter Placement: -External.

The Power Filter is designed to provide maximum surface area and optimum dwell times in all stages of the filtration process.\n\nNEW 5 STAGE FILTRATION SYSTEM \nStage 1 & 2: Mechanical- Poly/Foam Pad Effective mechanical filtration is essential for efficient chemical and biological filtration. The large surface area of the Poly/Foam pad effectively performs two stages of Mechanical filtration. The first stage of porous foam traps large particles and the second stage of dense polyester captures fine debris.\n\nStage 3: Chemical- Activated Carbon Insert The Fluval Activated Carbon Filter Insert contains 100% premium research grade carbon, which provides large amounts of surface area for adsorption of undesirable impurities. The activated carbon filter insert removes unwanted odors, discoloration and impurities, resulting in a crystal clear aquarium.\n\nStage 4: Biological-Bio-Screen An additional hydraulic circuit conveys part of the intake water to the Bio-Screen placed at the top of the Trickle Chamber cover. Fluval\u2019s Bio-Screen removes any debris before dripping into the biological chamber. It also ensures that the water pumped to the Trickle Chamber is evenly spread through all areas before it drips on the C-Nodes, which are contained in the chamber. The motion of water dropping slowly through the grids mimics the rain.\n\nStage 5: Biological- C-Nodes The surface of the C-Nodes is made up of a complex pore system that provides optimal living space for beneficial bacteria to thrive and enhance the removal of ammonia and nitrites. The new \u201cStar Shape\u201d provides a higher filtration surface and more biological power than a traditional cartridge, resulting in a healthy aquarium environment.\n\nPATENTED REFILTRATION SYSTEM\nSometimes delicate fish and plants require a more gentle water flow. Fluvals\u2019 patented re-filtration system allows you to control the flow rate without compromising filtration efficiency. When the flow rate is reduced, up to 50% of the water within the filter chamber is re-processed multiple times. More impurities are filtered out, creating a healthier tank with sparkling clean and clear water\n\nWHAT\u2019S IN THE BOX?\n1. Filter Cover 2. Filter Case 3. Leveling Device 4.

Never replace all c-nodes at once.\n\nActivated Carbon Insert: Replace Activated Carbon every 2-4 weeks.\n\nBio-Screen: Replace Bio Screen every 2-3 months.\n\nMotor O-Ring: Replace once a year to prevent leaking.\n\nPOWER FILTER MAINTENANCE\nFor optimal performance it is recommended to clean the impeller cover assembly once a year. The motor should be thoroughly cleaned every three months. Always unplug the Fluval C Power Filter prior to cleaning. Remove cover, filter media and discard water remaining in the filter case. Thoroughly rinse collected debris from the case, impeller cover and impeller assembly using clear lukewarm water. The intake \"U\" tube and extension tube can be cleaned with a filter stem brush to remove any buildup of deposits. When all parts have been cleaned and thoroughly rinsed, reassemble filter and replace any scheduled media. Install the filter once again back on the aquarium making sure that the filter is tipped slightly forward. Then fill the Fluval C filter box with aquarium water. Finally plug the filter into an electrical outlet and the Fluval C Power Filter will self-prime and begin running in a few seconds. \n\nModel Fluval C2 Power Filter Fluval C3 Power Filter Fluval C4 Power Filter Aquarium Capacity 10 to 30 US Gallons 20 to 50 US Gallons 40 to 70 US Gallons Dimensions 4.5 x 6 x 8 inches 4.5 x 7 x 8 inches 6 x 8.2 x 8.5 inches Stages 5-stage filtration 5-stage filtration 5-stage filtration Max Flow Rate 119 US Gal/H 153 US Gal/H 264 US Gal/H \n\nFLUVAL C FILTRATION/MEDIA\nFluval Poly Foam Pad - 3-Pack FLUVAL POLY FOAM PAD - 3-PACK\nThe Fluval C Poly Foam Pad Replacement Media, 3-pack, has two sides that combine to provide thorough and effective mechanical filtration.
