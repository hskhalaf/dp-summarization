      "text": "Lovely little pre-amp. I combined this with a Nobsound TPA3116D2 Amp and a pair of Polk T15 Bookshelf Loudspeakers. The Bluetooth feature sucks, being nearly 9db down in sensitivity compared to the line-in. Come on designers, at least bump it up on par with the RCA line-in. The change to GE JAN 5654W tubes makes a significant improvement in warmth, although the original tubes ain\u2019t half-bad either. Price-point is great and cosmetics are handsome. This setup fulfills its intended application very well.",

      "text": "This unit works as promised. I tested USB, bluetooth, and line inputs and send the output to a pair of powered computer speakers. The wire input works the best because I used a DAC that's better than the built-in DAC in this preamp. The USB and BT worked adequately in my opinion. I tried upgraded tubes (GE 5654W). They sound a bit better than the stock tube. Real HIFi fans probably won't take this too seriously. But I think this makes significantly improvement if you try to invest <$500 to improve the desk PC audio experience.",

      "text": "This is a real winner. It replaces 4 of my devices with a single one, which is super convenient. Previously, I had a USB DAC (for the computer), a bluetooth receiver (for ipad), an RCA switcher (for switching between 3 inputs), and I was in the market for a preamp (to boost the bass of my open-back headphones). Everything worked out of the box. My PC had no trouble connecting via USB. The bluetooth works great with ipad - it even connects bluetooth automatically when I turn it on (my previous bluetooth receiver didn't do this). Regarding sound quality, I have no complaints. However, my bar is pretty low. As long as it doesn't hiss, I'm happy.",

      "text": "I ordered some 6\u04161n-EB tubes from Moscow to replace the ones that came with the unit. They definitely improved the tone. The 6\u04161n-EB tubes (Vostok Rocket Tubes) added more bass and a little crispness to the treble. With my AKG K712s just sound crazy good with this amp. Even better than my Sennheiser 650s and my planar magnetic HiFiman cans. Definitely recommended even without the tube change. The tubes that come with it are more than adequate and still sound really good. But get some 6\u04161n-EB off ebay if you really want this little preamp to realize its potential. Great work Douk Audio!",

Budget stereo but I'm getting more out of it with this P1. The stock tubes were good enough but $20.00 on some GE JAN 5654W is well worth doing. These tubes really opened up the sound stage, more clarity. Immediately noticeable. Look forward to more after they're burned in! This preamp has good control ability, and it sounds great right out of the box. It's a solid build and it looks good.",

I use the DAC when I hook up my phone or laptop, and the bluetooth when streaming spotify. I upgraded to vintage match old stock GE 5654s, but honestly I couldn't tell a significant difference from the originals tubes. I split the RCA signal to hook up a Sunfire True Super Junior sub to round out my lower freqs. I'm crazy happy with the results!
