      "text": "Previously, this product had an out-of-bottle texture that was a little oily, but had great coverage and lasting power, and no smell. I have an extremely fair, neutral skin tone and the BB3 color WAS perfect for me. Now, the texture is airy, pasty, less coverage, far less lasting power, and has a strong and distinct lemongrass scent (citrusy). BB3 is much more yellow than the previous formula, as well. Unfortunately, I didn't realize how pronounced the formula change was until it was too late to return this product. It's a huge disappointment, since true neutral tones are difficult to find (neither yellow nor pink), and with skin cancer running in the family, I always wear SPF foundation.",

I am Hispanic with olive undertones. Unless you are looking for very yellow and heavy full coverage, don\u2019t get BB6. I wish I could return it, I tried one small drop of it.

It' much more sheer so the famous coverage isn't there, and I literally have to apply 2-3 times as much, and it still never looks the same- and it wears off by the end of day, whereas the old formula didn't. I don't know why they had to mess with such a fantastic formula. Sadly, will be looking for something else now, Can't justify spending $48 for this anymore.",
