I wa svery excited about it too, but I'm really disappointed.",

      "text": "This is a really neat lens, allowing you to take some really cool pictures. It's easy to install and use. BUT...be patient, it takes awhile to figure out how to make it take te pictures you see on the website. It's really best for spots or movement, not still shots. The movement makes the blurry part show up more. THis is a great lens to have in your bag, and good as a starter. I bought this as a gift, and I have the Lensbaby Composer for my Nikon. The Composer is a bit easier to use and has a lot more nice features (at over twice the price), but still takes time to learn to use it.",
