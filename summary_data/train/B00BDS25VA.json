Screen is great for video and camera is reasonable quality for video - at least she's pleased. it's also been useful for some school projects and as a quick substitute for a laptop when she's out and doesn't want to drag her laptop along. It drops in a larger purse or fits easily into her book bag. Battery life is a bit problematic. It discharges pretty quickly on standby, though when she's using it the battery seems to last long enough to spend an afternoon at a coffee shop.",

I knew from the get-go that there would only be a front facing camera and that it really wouldn't be super, but, that isn't why I was getting the unit. Maybe later I'll get a better one but right now... this is quite wonderful. As I have android devices the learning curve is pretty none existent. For a hundred bucks... it's premo.",

      "text": "The tablet is not lightning fast but fast enough. One great feature is that it allows you to utilize the entire formatted 12.8GB of storage which some tablets won't let you do this they set a predetermined size of memory for apps and the other storage what ever that may be is for music so overall it's a pretty decent tablet i recommend this tablet for first time and intermediate users this tablet should serve well for adults or kids.",

It tells her how to get to her sales calls, keeps track of her leads, entertains my grandson, etc. And you Android people know exactly how it does all these things. It is not an issue for her that it's an entry level tablet because she's an entry level user; she doesn't even have a smart phone. Go ahead and buy it for the tablet neophyte in your life.",
