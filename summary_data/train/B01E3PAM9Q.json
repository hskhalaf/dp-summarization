The grit difference is barely noticeable to me, but it's somewhere between the standard red/white emery boards. Does the job nicely.",

I don\u2019t have the issue I usually have with files of the edge separating. The two different grit choices are nice. I use the coarser grit when shaping and it makes quick work of taking off length. The finer grit perfectly finishes and smooths. Also, I find the price a very good deal.",

I believe 180 was the hardest I had ever owned in the past now that I have used it. The 240 is really strong and coarse for acrylic nails. The 180 is still really strong. I am going to need a separate file with a smaller grit as the second step as both the 240 and 180 leave textured roughness. In the past I guess I had 180 on one side and something much less for the finishing (not a polish, but a smoothing). These are a good value. Rating 5 stars = Love It.",
