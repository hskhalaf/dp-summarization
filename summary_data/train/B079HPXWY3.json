      "text": "Easily my favorite field watch. Comes on a vintage-y NATO strap that I instantly replaced with one of my own choosing. The black dial lends itself to endless strap choices. I like the Barton Jetson NATOs as well as the AlphaShark line from BluShark straps. Mind that you don\u2019t over-wind this timepiece as it does not have over-wind protection. Start slowing down at 30 winds or so from a dead stop and quit winding as soon as you feel resistance. After 24 hours, 17-20 winds will do it.",

How can you beat +1 sec after a month!!! Really, a Swiss watch that accurate for under 400 usd is a steal. If you don't like the vintage looking lume, don't bother about as it is way way less aggressive when you see it in the metal. Forget about your skx0xxj, this is THE best buy around!",

      "text": "Excellent watch! Just the right size at 38mm. It's a very nice looking watch that I find myself wearing more and more. It's reasonably accurate, with the ETA2801 movement getting about 10s/day. It's nice and thin and takes any G10/NATO strap with ease. Looks good on a bund strap as well. I was hesitant about the \"old radium\" lume, but it is now one of my favorite features. It's not as pronounced as it as appears in the photos, much more subtle. I highly recommend this Hamilton for any collection.",
