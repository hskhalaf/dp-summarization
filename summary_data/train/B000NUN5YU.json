Within 3 days of having it one of the arms broke off at the elbow. My son slept with this thing and it never left his side for 72 hours, including in the shower, so who knows how he did it. Superglued it on fine and he continues to play with it (albeit lighter use than before), but since the arms and legs are separate pieces at the elbow and knees that are glued together, I'm not sure its built to be a toddler's toy.",

It is apparently inspired by the Spinosaurus that appeared in JURASSIC PARK III. However, it's posture is the model's main problem. In hot weather, because the model is front-heavy, the soft toes give way causing it to lean forward and over. My Spinosaurus leaned over until its left arm/claw was resting on the surface. This problem can be solved by heating its toes with a hair dryer and bending the toes back into place. Overall, Papo's Spinosaurus is another fine dinosaur model, but one that may need a little periodic maintenance with a hair dryer.",

It's pretty anatomically correct (nostrils on top of the snout, longer index claw) as well, so immediate, obvious plus. Would I recommend this as a toy to be knocked around and beat on? No, this toy doesn't seem fit for rough playing, though light playing is okay, just be careful. Do I recommend this is as a collector's figure? A hundred times yes, it is probably the best Spinosaurus figure on the market.",

      "text": "Great dinosaur figure. More detailed then the pictures depict. Mine is precisely 6 3/8 inches to the top of his spine. 6.5 inches to the top of his snout. 11 inches from tip of his tail to top of his neck. Then 3 inches to the tip of his snout making him/her 14 inches in length. Weighs 12.8 ounces. Surprised he/she is 1.85 ounces lighter then the T-Rex. Was able to measure with my calipers and the Spinosaurus was leaner widthwise by 3/8 inch in the torso from the T_Rex. Might explain the weight difference. Was going to give to one of my great nephews but decided to keep it myself. Will look for something less expensive. :)",

    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe Spinosaurus or \"spiny lizard\" is one of the longest known dinosaurs measuring up to 18 m in length, 6 m in height and weighing up to 9 tonnes. It is recognizable for its large back spines, which lead us to suppose that it had a sail used as a temperature regulator. The Spinosaurus, which lived in the Cretaceous period, was both a carnivore and a fish eater. Both long and narrow, and equipped with numerous straight teeth, the Spinosaurus skull is a similar shape to that of crocodiles.",
