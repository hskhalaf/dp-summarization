It just says meets or exceeds all EN, canadian, and U.S. safety standards. Not sure if this should be a red flag or not. Hopefully someone will reply to this and let me know.

The stain transferred to the blocks and is impossible clean off. Now we have blocks with wood stains and bins with unstained squares where the blocks were sitting. None of the other plastic toys that were kept in these same bins did this--only these blocks. Recommend keeping them in the packaging or another plastic container for storage.",

I purchased multiple other toys from this brand after receiving these because they are the best baby toys around! Definitely check out the rest of the toy line.

Although my mom did use them in the bathtub with him, and he really did enjoy them in there. I just didn't like how it was difficult to get all the water out of them each bath time, so I removed them from the bath. But, they're not made to be bath toys, so I cannot truly complain about their water retaining tendencies.",

Careful: some block\u2019s plastic moldings around the numbers are jagged: I\u2019m not sure bits wouldn\u2019t tear off in child\u2019s mouth, so maybe not best for teething purposes because I don\u2019t know what material blocks are made of.",
