I'll admit, it's a bit tricky to take meds with it because it requires more \"sucking action\" than a normal tumbler/straw (because of the filtering, I'm sure), but I realize that's not what it's intended for. Also, the glass makes it heavy. Not sure I'd want to haul it around but I guess if you're hiking around unfiltered water you might not have a choice. All in all, I'd recommend. it.",
