This is one of my favorite games off all time and I used to play it for hours on my ps2. I saw that this game was remastered for the ps Vita and I went out and got a ps Vita just so I could play this beautiful game. I have over 327 hours of gameplay and will continue to play it some more. I didn't even mean to play it this much it just happened but be careful, as soon as you play this game your social life will slowly disappear.",

If you are a JRPG fan like me, I would definitely check this game out. I have a blast playing this game. I've probably spend over 50+ hours of playing the game. It's just that good.

I still haven't beaten it after having it for over a year because I don't want it to end, and I have a feeling I'll feel the same with this one. Besides Final Fantasy X/X-2, I haven't been interested in ANY PS Vita games. I'm glad I purchased this.",

The rain function for rescue is interesting and a new concept for me. The only thing I would have to complain about is the lack of SP items. It frustrates me to high heaven trying to find some.

Anyways, the ability to smoothly switch players between different realities is greatly handled, and though there's many things to keep track of, you'll find yourself getting used to knowing what to do.

The gameplay and story is already very engaging with lovable characters to add, but also the soundtrack, i'd say, is one of the best in video games period.

This game is awesome, very in depth story and character moments, feels very much like playing an anime. Most Dialog from main characters is voice acted and for an RPG with this much dialog that's always impressive. It has neat mechanics for combat and you can directly control your party or put them on track to auto act in accordance with a certain tactic. I would say this is a for sure pick up for anyone who likes the genre",

The game's aural presentation is better than ever, with 1.5 times the voiced dialogue of the original release. A new online dungeon rescue feature allows users to call on other players for assistance when they are about to die in the TV world. P4G is also overflowing with new content: new Personas to collect; new story events along with an all new character; stunning new anime cut scenes, which include a new opening animation with a new song from master composer Shoji Meguro; a host of fan suggested tweaks and changes, and much, much more! Persona 4 Golden is far more than just a handheld version of an all-time classic: it's the best way to experience it yet!",
