      "text": "I purchased this cheeseboard for my son\u2019s birthday party and was really happy it was delivered the same day I ordered it. One less thing to worry about! There was a slight imperfection in the wood which was probably the result of the manufacturing process and the merchant was great about sending me a replacement right away. Excellent customer service! I am really pleased with my cheese board purchase and received tons of complements. The design is awesome and I love the pull out knife drawer complete with cheese knives! Would definitely recommend this product!",
