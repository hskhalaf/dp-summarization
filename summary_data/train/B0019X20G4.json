Since he is very young, we really wanted to encourage him to eat more for growth and so got this soft food to mix into his hard food. He gobbles it down, but it backfires b/c he just picks out the chunks of this. We finally found a hard food he loves, so now are giving this to him as an extra dinner treat. GOBBLES IT DOWN WHOLE!! He LOVES this stuff. All Natural Balance products are amazing. And this kept up the positive streak we've had with them. We even feed our cats natural balance brand food. NB hasn't let us down yet!",

(We also tried the PN dry, but he refused to eat it.) This past Dec. we could no longer find the PN beef on Amazon or in local stores. I contacted PN and they emailed that they were having difficulty finding organic beef. Bailey does not care for chicken or liver so I went to Dog Food Advisor.com and started searching 5 star canned dog foods. I discovered Natural Balance Beef and the Amazon price was right too. He LOVES it. He also LOVES the NB dry which we keep as an open feed.",

      "text": "I didn't read before I ordered. I meant to order a chunky with gravy type of dog food but bought this ground up food by mistake. So initially, my dogs were not happy. Eventually they realized they had to eat what we had before I bought anything else. And, they learned to like it. My dogs are 5 years old and very active, outside running and playing or trekking along with me into the mountains when I ride my horses. I mixed this food in with their normal science diet or blue buffalo kibble. The 4 stars only reflects my preference for chunky with gravy over this ground up style. My Mistake.",

Now, there is a lot of water, but that's typical for wet dog food -- it doesn't have an overly soft consistency, so I think that amount of water is what it requires. The taste test passed with flying colors. In fact, the dog has taken to refusing the super-premium dry dog food, hoping I would give her more Natural Balance canned, and she's a tough critic.",
