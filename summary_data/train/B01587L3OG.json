I don't know if this kills 99% of bacteria and fungus like the manufacturer claims - but it does a good job removing the smell. It comes with a certificate from the \"Guangdong Detection Center of Microbiology\" saying that it kills 99.99% of bacteria - seems legitimate, right?! Ha. My only gripe with this item is that it's not UL listed, so I don't like to leave it unattended while plugged in.",
