Thank you Cesar - only wished we picked up this book before we even got our puppies as there is so much knowledge and helps us also understand our puppies behavior and how we can make their lives and our lives all the more better. Both of us were able to read in less than a week and now we have a much happier and healthy household - highly recommend this book for anyone who wishes to get a puppy, already has a puppy or even has an adolescent dog.",

Cesar made his money and fame from whispering to dogs, so maybe he doesn\u2019t want to let the rest of the world in on his secret.

The recipient was super thrilled with the book. Recommended to anyone who will be getting a puppy!!",

And I went right to CMs web site and found out what I need to know at this time. He has helped me direct the future for my pup as she is a working breed and will need loads of energy expending jobs to do. How to raise the perfect dogs just touches on all the facts that pack leaders need to know about. Thanks again Cesar. <3",

The tips on what to look for in a breeder were very helpful! Also, a pretty easy read. I am not a heavy reader and I read within a week. Overall a very useful and practical book and I would recommend it to anyone new to dogs (like myself) or someone that needs help establishing boundaries with a current dog.",

This books focuses a LOT on the first few weeks of the pup's life, and how everything in the beginning is so crucial, which I don't buy into. Since we missed those few weeks, half the book was kinda depressing. Cesar Millan says himself that you can condition a dog at any age. This book wasn't so helpful for us. The info on different life-stages and behaviors was helpful, as well as the info on crate training and house breaking.",
