The grinder locking mechanism (top) while grinding needs to be carefully handled chances are there it can break and you can't use the grinder without fixing it. It looks compact and elegant compared to the old wet grinder. It takes totally an hour for grinding urad dal and rice separately as you use more it might slow a bit.",
