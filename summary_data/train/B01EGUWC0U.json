It stops litter from spreading all around the box, but as seen in my photo they still kick plenty of litter out the front. My other least favorite thing is that it doesn't really block smells like I thought it would. If the cats don't cover their poop sometimes it reeks as much as it ever did. So whatever",

I took off one star because (like most other covered litter trays I've had), the lid and base don't always line up very well and so the latches don't always engage very easily at first.

My only \u201ccomplaint\u201d is that the lid clips do not All snap shut but they work good enough. I also like that an extra clip in included.",

The entry has a lined edge, so no sharp plastic edge and the size of the opening allows for easy scooping without having to remove the cover. The cover does, of course remove for changing the litter. The size is outstanding to give kitty plenty of room to turn around. This is a large capacity box, so plan on using more litter as it easily takes 10 lbs. There was no transition time, kitty walked right in and took care of her business. The best part is that everything stays in the box, thanks to the cover.",

The only CON is that one of the clips came broken, like the platic broke, but i couldn\u2019t return cause i needed the litter box ASAP and decided to keep it. But the broken clip does not interfere with putting the litter box together or whenever i need to clean it. I do like that it beongs extra clips just in case",
