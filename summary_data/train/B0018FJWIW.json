Though I don't have giant hands by any stretch, the finger (stalls) pocket depth is too shallow and the heel of my palm sticks out of this glove about 3/4\" further than it should. Everything else about this glove is great. It's all about fit, so I'm not knocking it down too much (1 star) for it's slightly smaller fit... than what I expected for a 14\" glove. If you wear smaller than size-L gloves, this might be a good fit for you and you'll have a great glove.",
