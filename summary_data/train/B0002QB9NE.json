I use a ped-egg to exfoliate, then put this creme on and put socks on my feet before bed. This removes dead skin, and the lotion can really work, the socks keep feet covered and let the lotion really sink in. Do this every night for a few days and you WILL see a huge difference.

Well, I was washing my hands so frequently that they were cracking and bleeding all over the place. Working hands had me back to normal after ONE NIGHT of use before bed. That being said, their foot cream isn't quite as amazing, but still works very well. I use it before bed when my feet get really dry and wear socks during those nights. Usually has me back to normal after 2-3 nights of use.",
