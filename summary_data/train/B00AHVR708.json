It was easy to put together, it has three settings for reclining to sitting up, and it's easy to travel with. We took the booster part off to bring to someone else's house for dinner and it was easy. The straps that connect to the chair are tucked away in its own compartment for easy storing. The pad itself seems to be made out of vinyl which makes it really easy to wipe clean after a messy mealtime.",

My 7 month old grandson loves it. I like the harness\u2014they only had lap belts back when my children were little. My son and daughter in law got the more expensive Graco high chair (Blossom?). I love the leatherette seat pad and the metal tray arms that slide into slots. Much, much better quality. Of course they paid more than twice as much as this one cost.",

Straps hold little guy very securely, and it appears to be very comfortable.",
