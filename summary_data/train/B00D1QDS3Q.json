Like big stickers, and they are colorful and vibrant. My daughter loves them and had fun helping pick spots for them. Her room is green and they work well with that color background. Def worth the money, it's a sure buy. I'll def recommend RoomMates to everyone!",

This year, we've repainted and arranged the decals on her doors. I'm very impressed, not just with the reusability (peeling them off and putting them elsewhere did not hinder the sticking quality), but with how well they stick and mold to different surfaces and textures. I've added a photo of the decals on her door. Really great product for a great price.",

Be sure to clean surface with rubbing alcohol and make sure it is dry. They peel off with ease and leave no residue on the wall. They are AMAZING quality and I would recommend them to anyone. They have some glitter on them for those anti-glitter people but from my experience the glitter did not come off at all even after all the rubbing I did to make sure they adhere to the door. This momma approves of these 100 percent.",

The smaller stickers were placed alongside the bed and in the steps but she has already removed them. They also stick very well on our concrete walls.
