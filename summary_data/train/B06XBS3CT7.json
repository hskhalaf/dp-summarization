Ignore the silly reviews that claim it leaks or cuts fingers; the instructions are clear and unambiguous. Makes great smoothies and is so easy to clean. Owners' videos on YouTube helpful. Always add water up to the Max line. Don't pack ingredients too tightly. Shake before juicing. I haven't used the recipe book yet - use your imagination, your taste buds and what's in your fridge. Only way I'll eat kale, carrots, beetroot, lemon juice and ginger first thing in the morning. Superb.",

This is the second Nutribullet which I have purchased as the first one became difficult to attach the cups to, it kept jamming. It did last about three years though. I wouldn\u2019t recommend putting the blender tops in a dishwasher as they accumulate water inside. The actual cups wash well in the dishwasher. Easy to use but may be a problem if you have very weak hands or wrists as you need to twist the cups onto the machine. I recommend this blender.",

Thing is, I hate eating and preparing fruit - peeling it, cutting it too pieces and getting your hands dirty - all too much to bother given I don\u2019t particularly like the taste of most fruits. So we tried the Nutribullet a few years ago as an alternative. And it didn't take much to find an easy tastefull blend with hidden greens. So this is what we now have almost every day. Recently bought this slightly updated Nutribullet as the former one is now being used in our holiday home.",

Occasionally, the screw on blade isn\u2019t screwed tight enough so the smoothie leaks whilst blending but this has only happened a handful of times and is my fault but it is something to be careful about. Also I wish it came with a lid with a flip top so I could drink directly out of the lid rather than the cup itself. Other than that it is great and I would highly recommend it.",

I can honestly say that I have used it almost every day since it arrived and it is so easy to use and to clean. The favourite are smoothies, but I have pureed sauces, ground nuts and coffee, and pulses. Nothing seems to defeat it, you just bung it in, and it does it quickly with ease. Love it !!",

Firstly this is by far one of the safest smoothie makers you can use purely because of how you turn it on by pushing the whole cup down and twisting. Secondly this is really easy to clean, the blades can be rinsed with running water. Thirdly the blades can chop pretty much anything up that can be made into a smoothie. Comes with 2 cups obviously, but I personally have not used the small one. The handle it comes with is practical.",

Great with frozen ingredients as well as fresh.. make sure you wait until the blades stop spinning before removing it from the motor otherwise you risk damaging the roters.",
