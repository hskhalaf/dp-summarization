      "text": "Love this. I travel full time for my job so I use a microwave in hotels often. This device makes lovely, huge frittatas that I have any time of day. I use fresh veggies and cheeses and sometimes precooked meat or ham. I buy egg whites or scrambled eggs sold in cartons. Liquid egg whites take longer to cook but makes for a healthy option. Although it\u2019s silicone, I spray a little coconut oil in one side when I steam the veggies and meats first because I like to have the healthy fat in there but you don\u2019t need to. It can get a little cumbersome to flip over and clean but I feel this product is genius!",

Then sprinkle my cheese on top, fold the egg over, and cook the rest of the way. I do not flip the Lekue. PERFECT! 2-1-19 Just used this round Lekue to warm my 6\" tortillas for dinner!

Since my wife won't eat an egg-white omelet, I'm stuck making single serving omelets. I should have saved money and bought the smaller half-round Lekue. On the positive side, it cooks quickly and is easy to clean, and it probably has wider uses I haven't discovered. The manual is microprint, but it is also available as a PDF online",

It's easy and cooks the omelet to a \"T\". I am very happy with this, and should it ever wear out, I'll be looking for the same brand to replace it!",
