      "text": "I was looking for a gray and yellow rug for a new office space. I read a couple of reviews about it being wrinkled, not very thick, etc. Since it was only approximately $60 I wasn't expecting high-dollar quality. However, it is perfect for what I wanted. It does not come packaged wrapped around a cardboard tube so there are some wrinkles. However, I've had mine down for over a week and the wrinkles are already gone. I couldn't be happier!",
