It is small enough to fit in tight places and strong enough to put a screw into just about anything I have come up with. Also the tool belt hook is a great feature. I personally hate dealing with batteries and replacements are over priced so if you can deal with a cord and maybe an extension cord then this impact driver is worth every penny. So when the other guys run out of juice and have to go recharge the batteries you can keep working and get your projects finished.",
