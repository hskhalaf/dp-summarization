Save the cap and the plastic bag for storage as the nozzle leaks all over the place (at least mine did). Bottle has the aluminum-type tab cover that needs to be removed - no help there either as there is no notch to the removal so you have to use a knife and will never get the residual aluminum off the top to the bottle. The product itself seemed fine but using it was not a pleasant experience. Won't purchase again.",

This is a gentle formula so if I have a stubborn stain/mark I do add a little more product and rub down a little harder but it does the job. I tend to have a couple of make up stains on my steering wheel in the morning and this gets that all off too no problem!",

The host, Kent, made a personal recommendation about 303 products on the Mercedes interiors he touches up in his shop. I love the way it cleans/conditions the leather in my Mercedes without the oily feel and glossy shine other products leave. I'm sure there are other products like this, but so far this is the one I tried and it works very well. Before I used 303 leather on my seats and door panels, I wiped them down with a microfiber cloth soaked in lukewarm water with dish soap. I had to use soapy water to clean off the other layers of oil that previous leather products left.",
