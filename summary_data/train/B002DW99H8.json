It had no problems going thought the Xray machine at the airport, with my tripod still attached. I was able to keep it under the seat while on the airplane and still have a good amount of foot room. To top it all off, it's convenient when you need to pull the camera out quickly while still protecting the rest of your gear from the potential bad weather. I love this pack.",

I took out most of the separators and am able to carry multiple lenses flash gun charger etc. Things I did not like: The outside pockets could be bigger and the tripod straps are too short for a large tripod. Neither are a big deal, overall I am pleased with this bag",

Pros - Comfortable. - Easy to customise. - Build quality seems solid. - Thicker than normal dividers. - Nice styling. Cons - No rain sleeve - Top handle should be attached to the middle of the bag and not the very rear as it makes it VERY sketchy to lift if the laptop section is even slightly unzipped. - No waist buckle. - No water bottle/mesh pocket. Despite the cons I'm confident that the bag will do its most important job well, and that's protecting my equipment.",

This seems to be quite well made and proved to be comfortable on a hike up through Mt. Rainier last summer. Yes, it's a tight fit but managed to fit the body, a 16-24, 105, and trusty 18-200 along with a slew of filters and other supplies. I did need to permanently remove a few of the padded dividers (held by Velcro) but that was simple.",

The padding gives me an extra bit of comfort from hard knocks. The only drawback is that the slits for the hammock can only accommodate a regular sized lens as my zoom would not fit. It would be good to provide an extra hammock with larger slits. Great product.",

I love the tough rubberized bottom part, perfect for setting it down on rough ground. The laptop storage space is adequate as long as your laptop is on the smaller side. Overall I'm pretty happy with it. I wish it would have come with a rain cover though, like my previous Case Logic bag did.",

      "text": "While an excellent backpack, it's quite heavy and very inflexible as to purpose. It excels at carrying camera and lenses, but don't expect to do much more. The padding in the compartments is so thick and strong that you can't really do much more than carry lenses. I'd still probably buy it again but it definitely has its flaws. If all you want to do is carry a body and lenses, go for it. Just don't expect to carry much if anything more.",

You can carry gobs of camera gear in this case but being a backpack with two straps it requires removal for camera access by opening the rear zipper. No problem because you will be planning for this but I will usually use my sling and go on shoots with very little gear. But when I need a lot of gear this is one heck of a case!",

It also has the rubberized bottom so you won't ruin anything if it happens to get wet on the bottom. Side attachments for a tripod and like things on each side. Its a very good case, my wife is not a professional but she does a lot of outdoor photography, family photos, weddings thing of that nature and this bag is perfect for her.",

This bag has a laptop slot but overall the bag just doesn't have a quality feeling to it. I think that feeling is mainly because of the thin straps. I've used the bag for several months and so far the straps have held up, but the straps twist easy so the straps don't feel as rigid. Really hard to explain why they don't feel right. Also, my camera doesn't remove as easily as my LowePro did. One positive of this bag is the orange inside. That I do like.",

Side Note: I sprayed mine down with a few coating of waterproofing spray and was able to use it in a decent rain storm for hours. A tiny bit of moisture seeped through the zipper, but not enough to get anything inside wet.",

Instead of bringing my lap top I used that pocket for magazines and light reading on the plane. I shoot with a Nikon D3100 and this pack worked out perfectly for the camera, extra lens and a few other accessories. At Yellowstone the exterior tri-pod holder was a huge plus and the ease of accessibility for just the camera was super handy. After adding my extra lens we still had additional space free for a few power bars and a nalgene bottle :) Would highly recommend this product!!!",
