There is a firmware update out there but unless you have issues, I advise you to pass on it. Not of big fan of flashing devices unless there are issues.",

The gentleman in India had to call his supervisor for help. Hint: DISABLE WI-FI by selecting the \"Advanced\" tab. Then select \"Wi-Fi Protected Setup\" and uncheck \"Enable.\" Once configured, I discovered that the antennas don't screw in, and thus are not replaceable. I just assumed, based on their appearance, that they did. I pulled on one and removed it partially, and wires came along, but once replaced, no harm was done. I'm somewhat disappointed, and feel I should have spent more money on another more powerful router, or one which had replaceable antennas for more range.",

However, if I streaming video from two PCs, the network becomes unusable (e.g. one Netflix, one Youtube). After using the router for a few days, the network becomes slow and then stops working. I have to reboot it. Note, this might be caused by Timewarner cable -- this may not be caused by this router). Occationally, there are conflicting IP addresses (it is configured to support DHCP so I don't understand why it allocates duplicate IP addresses in the first place).",

But after reading the great reviews on this router I decided to take a chance. I did have some trouble getting it set up inititally, but they have a fairly easy online configuration utility on their web site, and with help from an excellent customer service, it was up and running pretty quickly. I've been using it primarily for Netflix movie downloads through my Sony Blu-ray player and have had reliable and very fast throughput for several weeks now with only a couple of drop-outs, which were quickly resolved. I highly recommend it.",

My current TP link gets 700mbps down and 800mbps up. I just switched it out with the SMC and would get usually around 30-50mbps, peaking sometimes around 100. I poked around the basic/advanced settings all I could to boost speeds but nothing seemed to help. Am returning and paying a bit more for a dedicated netgear gigabit switch.",

Once I realized this was unnecessary for my application it connected right away, and has not had a problem yet. I also love that I can wirelessly connect to my printer now, great feature!!
