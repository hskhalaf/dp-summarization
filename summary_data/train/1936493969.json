Cookbooks should be spiral-bound anyway to allow them to lay flat when you're using them. I love the recipes and all the hints in this cookbook, definitely worth the effort.",

Unfortunately, this really isn't enough for those with special dietary requirements. When eating animal products, protein needs are easily met (and frequently exceeded), but this is not necessarily true for plant-based diets.

It works out exactly right that way. I do think they underestimate the servings though. Where they say 4-6, I would say 8-10. I mean, the tagine recipe called for 8 servings of chickpeas, but then said it served 4-6. We got 8 from it.",

Overall, I am satisfied with this purchase and I might just buy another cookbook from this brand!",
