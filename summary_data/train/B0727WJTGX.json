I've had guests hand me back the cup saying it was dirty, which just makes me look like a bad hostess.",

They are rather thin stainless with not a lot of weight to stand on their own, but are fine when filled. The size is fine. The rim leaking old water is not fine. You can shake them, dry them, and put them away. 2 days later you get one out of the cupboard and before you fill it, you notice the water (or whatever) leaking out of the rim. Should I caulk them or send them back?",
