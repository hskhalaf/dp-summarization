      "text": "I've used many different headphones from many different manufacturers. Many people might buy bears or other well known brands, but many of the popular branded headphones are overpriced, and soind, and quality are not equal to its price. Phiaton BY 330 is very good features. BY 330 has a long battery life ( over 25 hours without noise cancellation, and 14 to 15 with noise cancellation on) great sound, very sturdy, and stylish. Did not give five stars cause these headphones press ears a bit too tight...overall, an awesome headphones. However, wired doesn't work that well..",

But if you are sitting on a plane or in a noisy office, these are awesome. Bluetooth quality is better then most. Battery life was better then expected. The on-phone controls are simple once you learn how to use them.",

They way they are made appears like there is no ridge or lip to even apply super glue so I guess these will be going in the trash unless I duct tape.",

I would personally prefer for the ear cushions to be a little larger, because if I don\u2019t set them right, they feel weird on my ears. They are definitely not lightweight enough to take them out on a jog or some other physical activity! The battery seems to hold a good, long charge, and they pair with any Bluetooth device without any issues. They can also connect with a cord, which is an unusual bonus when it comes to Bluetooth headsets! The sound quality is crisp and clear, with great bass to boot!",

I would say they were probably broken when they got here, but I can only discuss my experience with this pair. As it stands, I'm thoroughly disappointed with these.",
