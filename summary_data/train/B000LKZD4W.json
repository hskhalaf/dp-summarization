This product is very sweet, as teriyaki is supposed to be. It has a nice \"meaty\" texture and taste. As a vegan for moral reasons, it is hard to find tasty, affordable vegan products with respectable ingredients, so I am GRATEFUL that this company has met all three criteria. And I will be back to try other flavors!",

So, if you, like me, are soy intolerant and want a great-tasting vegan meat substitute (that hasn't jumped on the stupid \"gluten free\" hype train), look no further than the Teriyaki primal strips. (If, however, you are one of those who suffer from Celiac's disease or have a wheat allergy, stick to the soy-based primal strips, like the Hickery Smoked ones I can't eat.)",

The texture and taste was so similar to regular beef jerky and I was blown away and couldn't stop craving one.

The individual wrappings are easy to open with scissors. Tougher to open by hand. Individual wrapping has a cut at top for peeling open. I had no luck that way.

Rarely do I ever get the package to open perfectly, the plastic strip either tears off or it opens just a tiny amount.

I'm vegetarian and finding this product was like hitting gold. I'm camping at a festival soon and need easy non perishable foods that will satisfy my hunger and these are perfect. Texture: A bit soft, yet very chewy (Almost like pulled pork?) Flavor: I've only tried the Texas Barbeque, but the flavor is on point. Very juicy, sweet, and smokey. Would I recommend them? Yes, I would.",
