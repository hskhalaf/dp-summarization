A months worth of regular use and probably 20 charges in, these are still better than any other brand I've tried.",

I then gave the Energizers a chance and after a year of using a couple dozen of those in rotation, only one has failed and won't take a charge anymore. I don't like to bash a competitor, but if they want to keep up with Energizer on this front, they really need to go back to the drawing board.",

Energizers are a good reliable brand, I'm sure there's others out there that I haven't found yet, but until I do, -I'll keep buying these. Make sure to get the ones with the higher-quality, higher output 2300 mAh and not the lesser ones. Or you'll be sorry you did.",
