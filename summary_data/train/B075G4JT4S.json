      "text": "I received the headset June 6, 2020. The headset began going out by the end of June. It finally went out in July. By July 9, 2020 it stopped working altogether. I contacted Amazon which said it was outside of return date, and sent me on to Logitech and and Asurion. Logitech didn\u2019t respond or answer, and Asurion sent me back to Logitech. I\u2019ve purchased this insurance on many products but haven\u2019t had to use it. I will not purchase anything with the insurance. What is the point when Amazon allows the manufacturers to ignore customers making them feel as though they have been given the run-a-round. Seriously disappointed!",

The metal sheathing where it joins with the plastic case of the connector is not connected sturdily inside the connector to protect it.... in fact it resides just outside the plastic connector case consequently not very stable, and if bumped with, even a mild up or down force, will cause it to bend and the metal sheathing to come off and leave the connector un-useable. So, Bottom Line... if you can't connect it... you can't use it. It's too bad, I really liked the comfort and sound.",

The headsets are comfortable for all day wear - which is important to us and also fairly durable. They last longer in the hands of adults in an office environment than for teenagers, however - which is no surprise. We have bought more than 10 sets of these over time for business and personal reasons and believe that they are great value for the money spent. Especially so if they are refurbished or on sale.",
