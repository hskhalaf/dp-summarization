There are no wheels on his feet, but one can easily imagine toddlers pulling his front legs forward, then pushing up the rear legs, over and over, to move him across the floor. Older children will enjoy draping him around their necks -- as will grown-ups. The ability to pose him in many positions means he'll \"play well\" with other toys. Or you can use his \"spring belly\" to hold small action figures prisoner. This is likely to be another \"Tickle Me Elmo\", in short supply at Christmas.",

Not only will every child in the room immediately lock eyes on this toy, every adult will too. It's just one of those toys that immediately attracts attention. The playability is good but somewhat limited, however this is not the type of toy that gets stuffed away in the closet and forgotten about (it won't fit, for one thing). This is the type of toy that stays permanently on display in the playroom or kid's room because it just looks really neat. It's definitively the type of toy that you keep. Very pleased!",
