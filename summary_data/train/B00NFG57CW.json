This phone does get LTE coverage with T-Mobile and AT&T in the US as long as you get the the RM 985 variant. I'm with T-Mobile and my phone got LTE coverage right out of the box. Make sure you ask the seller if they have the 985 variant of this phone. I bought mine from FoneGuru here on Amazon after confirming that they were selling the 985 version. I guess FoneGuru is sold out at the moment, but hopefully they will get more in stock.",

Although the phone supports said features, AT&T will not support them unless the phone is locked to the AT&T network and branded. This is extremely disappointing as the international version is over $100 less than a branded phone tied to the carrier.",

Besides that, it's a great phone but the app store is a little bare. (No Snapchat or pokemon go)",
