This wok is as solid as a ROCK. It doesn't move as you stir fry, it heats evenly, it's easy to clean, and it's going to last me the rest of my life. It works superbly on my gas range.Flat bottom is nice - holds it real steady.",

That small area can be a blessing and a curse; searing can only be done in small portions, but pushing veggies up onto the sides and steaming them with a lid on should be more effective.

I had been using a cast iron skillet since my Behmor's heating element started failing, but lost too many beans and it never roasted evenly.
