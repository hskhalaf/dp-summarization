      "text": "i bought this to upgrade from my cheap, white plastic tiered spice rack. the wood is nice quality. however, the 1/4 inch thickness of the wood leaves any spice jars that are placed on the crease to sit unevenly. Additionally, there is space between the bottom of the rack and the cabinet due to the edging on the wood. Also, the insert tends to slant inward once extended. Lastly, i was charged $5 for the return... my fault for not checking the return policy before purchase. anyway, i'll stick with my cheap plastic rack, that has lasted over 20 years!... i guess the adage don't try to fix something that isn't broken applies here ;)",

Also when it's pulled all the way apart it bends a little so could be a problem down the road if I ever tried to slide it forward (the middle could buckle back).",

The only thing that could be improved would be if there was some sort of \"lock' or stopper for it to be able to stay out. If i accidentally push something next to it, it starts to slide back in. Other than that I really like it! Will most likely order another for another shelf.",
