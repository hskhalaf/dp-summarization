Played Fallout 4 while listening to Gunship on Amazon. No issues. Five stars because of overall price-to-performance ratio. I've bought $80 headphones that were worse.

This headset is an INSANE deal, and it's basically the only headset i've found that genuinely has no ear pain after 8+ hours of use. I have no idea what Razer, Logitech, Turtlebeach are doing, this is MILES ABOVE them and it's dirt cheap. I am thoroughly confused by this juxtaposition.",

Quiet and comfortable, the headset comes with the basic functionality you expect in more expensive headsets. It does not have a separate mute button, but for our gaming needs, it works great.

Not great for listening to vocals, but great for listening to beats, and gaming -Microphone is omnidirectional, which leads to it picking up a lot of background noise.
