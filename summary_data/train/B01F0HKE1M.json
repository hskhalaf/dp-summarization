I'm not responsible and this was totally worth it! Snapchat filters work on it, it looks scary especially in black and white, my cats are amusingly confused by it, my niece and nephew love it, my coworkers were amused by it... I have nothing negative to say. If you're a responsible adult and can't justify why you'd spend $20 on a stuffed animal for yourself- instead of spending $40 going out for dinner and drinks buy this and stay in one night with ramen and a 6 pack. You won't be disappointed.",

As their favorite aunt it's my job to find them the coolest - sometimes weirdest - toys and let's just say that Christmas will be a challenge because these blew their little minds.",
