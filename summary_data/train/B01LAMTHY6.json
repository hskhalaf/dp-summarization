Each timer is its own little universe. The motion of the drips is soothing because it's predictable and pretty evenly-paced, and I get to decide when to turn it over. The color combinations are also very calming, and as far as I know, this pack always comes with the blue-green timer, and the pink-blue timer. :)",
