I quickly realized that they have to be stacked in certain order when led to my daughter hitting them together and getting upset (bath time is right before bed when patience is at an all-time low). I ended up giving her only two at a time that fit together and that has helped. I\u2019m hoping as she gets older and plays with them more she will have a little better with them.",

These boats are so easy to clean and have nowhere to keep the water after the bath is done. The holes in the middle make them easy to quickly dump and are great fun for the kids. My daughter loves using them as submarines, water transport, and speed boats. So many fun games to play with them! I am very happy with my purchase!",

The boats are great for scooping, pouring, or sifting, just as advertised. They're also all slightly different dimensions to make the stacking easier, so they only stack in order. That said, although they were a gift for my youngest all three boys (5, 7, 10) enjoy blowing them around, splashing them, making waves, and trying them all to see which ones they like best. These things are going to be a stable for bath time and the wading pool in our backyard for a long time to come.",

I bought these to try to entice my Autistic toddler to want to bathe without a fight and they did the trick. Using them as a rinse cup has made washing his hair so much easier. Plus I feel like these are less likely to collect mold and will be easier to clean with the simple design. Great product for the price.",

      "text": "I bought these for my two daughters to play with in the bath. The love that they are boats, hold water for pouring, and if you flip the boats over and fill it with water - the middle is perforated so it makes a shower stream of water. I use them for hair rinse cups and they stack so storage is easy. They are plastic also so I can run them through the dishwasher periodically if I think they need to be cleaned.",

They do sink easily, but they also lend themselves to rinsing shampoo out of hair, learning to stack, AND they take up very little real estate in the bath, which is appreciated. I think we will get a couple years enjoyment out of this cute purchase.",
