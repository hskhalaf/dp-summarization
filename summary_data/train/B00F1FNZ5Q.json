After assembling them I realized they were both 26 \u201c high, description states they are 24\u201d high, which is what I ordered. Also, one of the stools is not level. Two of the legs are about 1/4 inch shorter than the other two causing it to wobble. Trying to decide whether or not to return. Was time consuming to assemble. Description is confusing listed as 24\u201d on main ad but 26\u201d in other description. This needs to be corrected. The stools are pretty and look very nice but are a bit higher than what I wanted. The package does describe them at 26\u201d.",

The plywood on both stools has cracked and formed holes under the cushions, and the screws won't stay in anymore. For reference, my husband is 6 feet and 190 and I'm 5'6\" 145. We're not exceptionally tall or heavy. I'm really disappointed in these benches. We have to replace them already.",
