On our other stroller my son seemed to slide down and would end up kind of hunched. But this stroller gives him some good support. It's fairly light, super easy to fold, it has a carrying handle, and folds down smaller than what we had, so I there's more space in trunk. The ONLY thing that I wish was better, but I think its not a big enough deal to deduct a star, the canopy is a bit small.",

The basket is super roomy (when you don't have the seat connected), and I love the quick release straps for baby. The side cup holder is really nice, though it gets in the way every once in a while. It's easy to fold, easy to store, and light to carry. Baby is only 10 months old now, but we'll be using this for a long time to come.",

It is lightweight, easy to open and close, compact, and we love that pattern! I also love that it accepts click connect car seats. We have a jogger and now this stroller and they are perfect! I would definitely buy this again. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because a bigger child may have a hard time with the footrest being so high. Seriously, but this, it's way better than those cheaper bulkier strollers and graco is awesome!!!",

He's by no means a large kiddo, but he is rather tall. We ended up returning as it was just way too small and uncomfortable for my kiddo. It was comfortable to push and seemed to have a nice ride though.",
