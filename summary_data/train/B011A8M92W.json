My child is also very chunky and the extra elastic I loved when she was a newborn now seems to cut in to her it leaves red marks on her skin after changing so maybe not so great if you got a little chunk",

This cover is always a the back of the queue of available covers, and usually gets skipped if it happens to find it's way to the front. The only snaps on the back are at the far edges of the tabs, so we find that the wings on the front of the diaper usually droop down LO's legs, causing poor fit and leaks. He honestly hasn't worn it long enough to experience leaking around the tag, but that doesn't seem like a very logical choice of placement on something that is supposed to be waterproof.",

I did in the disposables. I have bum genius, thirsties, best bottom, and buttons diaper covers, and these are my favorite. I will only be buying this brand for larger sizes. Best bottom and buttons are horrible fits and leaks. The thirsties material absorbs the urine, so you have to change the cover with every diaper change, which defeats the purpose in my opinion.",

      "text": "Best cover that I have found. Only issue I have found is there is a tag on the back that if it gets wet it easily soaked through and gets my baby's back wet. He is a very heavy wetter and he only gets wet when he sleeps longer than 6 hours during the night in this cover. Other covers we have tried he has wet through them in 20 minutes during the day. We haven't had any poop outside the cover yet and he has had some big messes inside the cover. Overall a great buy for a diaper cover using a reusable liner",

In between changes they can be wiped dry, unless of course your little one has a blow out like my little one does sometimes after which they need a real wash. They also come in several great colors.

      "text": "This quickly became my go to cover for my newborn. She is now 6 weeks old and this has fit her the best since we started cloth when she was about a week old. We have thirsties covers as well which are nice but I liked this one to start off better. The double gussets are awesome at containing breast fed baby poosplosions! I just put a trifolded prefold inside and while it usually gets on the cover if its #2 the cover is very reusable for just #1. I'm very glad I got this cover to get me through the newborn stage until my babe could fit into one size diapers.",

They fit more trimly and are made of heavier material, which seems to do a better job of containing messes. I recommend trying these and the Buttons covers to see what works best for your family. P.S. I use these covers with the OsoCozy prefolds and they work well.",
