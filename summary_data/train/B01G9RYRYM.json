      "verdict": "A lot of trail running enthusiasts were fascinated with the Gel Sonoma 2. They said that it performed well, that its cushioning system was agreeable, responsive and supportive. Appreciation was also given to its design, as well as its trail-ready outsole. Some even said that it worked well on both the trails and the roads. But, according to others, the durability of this trail shoe wasn\u2019t up to the task. Apparently, the outsole and upper easily broke down on them.",
      "pros": [
        "A runner wrote that the upper unit of the Asics Gel Sonoma 2 didn\u2019t rub against their skin, thus preventing irritation and blistering",
        "Many consumers stated that this shoe felt great right out of the box",
        "the word \u2018comfortable\u2019 was used many times to describe their time wearing it",
        "According to a number of runners, this shoe\u2019s facade was visually appealing",
        "The mid-sole unit was supportive enough to correct supinated foot-motion, a tester noted",
        "The lugged outsole unit was able to provide sure surface traction, which made it easy for many testers to traverse the trails",
        "The rubber compound used in the outsole did not wear off easily, according to those who have tried it",
        "A lot of runners agreed that the price of this trail shoe was affordable",
        "Some purchasers wrote that the Gel Sonoma 2 remained efficient & comfortable when used on the pavement",
        "It felt lightweight, according to reviewers"

        "After a month of use, a runner noticed that a hole began to form on the lateral front section of the upper unit",

I have not worn these every day or even every week as they were bought for dog walking and in the winter I used wellies so certainly haven't worn them out by any means as the following photos will show. I always look after my things so no neglect on my part. First pair of Asics for me and will now be the last. Poor materials and very shoddy.",

Wasn't looking to spend a fortune on a good pair of trail running shoes and these fit the bill perfectly. I have a narrow foot and usually wear a UK 6, ordered a UK 6 in these are they fit perfectly.",
