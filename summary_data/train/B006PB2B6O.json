Also, was very happy with the ease of putting in and taking it out of a car and airplane! the only thing you need to be aware of on a plane is that the buckle ends up behind the child's back, so you need a little pillow or folded blanket to pad it so they don't feel the buckle in their back. Perfect and a great price. Will use it for all travel in the future, and for an extra car seat for Grandma (did I mention it's sooo light?!)",

It seemed very uncomfortable, maybe because the fabric was so thin. I know this was a less expensive car seat but still. I did get one even cheaper than this one and can uninstall it in minutes, it's cushy and cleanable fabric.",

The seat is well-padded for a comfortable ride. Only complaint is that the cup hold on the outside of the seat is hard for little ones to reach. Once kiddo is a little bigger, he should be able to reach his cup. The cup holder can be attached to seat on either side so it doesn't get in the way.",

As a result it is a struggle to get the latch hooked up & in our friend's honda it would not fit at all! Also the harness straps have no padding so it left marks on my child (not severe, but that was just during a normal car ride, I can't imagine what would happen in a crash). The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is that it is light weight; which is good for traveling.",

The cover is pretty thin, so my toddler is basically sitting on plastic. It takes forever to warm up if the car was out in the cold overnight. We have to leave the car on for 10minute and the plastic is still pretty cold. My toddler cries when we put her in in the winter. I think a little bit more padding or different fabric might be a great improvement.",
