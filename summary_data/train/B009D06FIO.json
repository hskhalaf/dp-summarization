Highly recommend to anybody who wants to give this a shot.",

After reading some more reviews it seems it is a glitch that was never addressed. If not being able to save does not bother you then go ahead and get it.",

But when I played it I found it painfully repetitive, with a disgustingly bland \"future of the 90s\" j-pop sound track, a physics engine more broken than the Obamacare website, characters so embarrassingly racist they will make you wince and a plot that could generously be called nonsense bullcrap. I'll give it an extra star because it tries hard to make a unique identity for itself but I could not recommend this game to anyone.",
