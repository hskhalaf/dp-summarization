Anchor strap only comes with one hook so I mad a a slip knot in the other end to anchor it. For reference I drive a '14 F150 Supercab with max towing/payload options on it so the back end sit's a little higher than normal. With an extra set of hands to balance the bike it went flawlessly. Best part is when it's folded up it's small enough to fit in the backseat floorboard so it doesn't slide around in the back of the truck with the bikes.",

ITs only good up to 600lbs per ramp though so i have to be careful to limit who helps me push up the ramp if she's not running.
