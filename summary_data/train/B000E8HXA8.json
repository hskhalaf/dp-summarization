The hardest part of the job was getting up the nerve to drill the first hole (and eventually 3 more) in the deck of my new pontoon. Suggestion: Read all the instructions carefully and then decide where you want it. Next, set it in carefully into position, double or triple check your clearances as the anchor travels up and down, measure everything three times and drill the hole. After the first hole you can't turn back so it gets easier.",

It allows more rope to be let out automatically when there is tension in the rope. Installation was fairly simple though I recommend purchasing lock nuts to use instead of the included regular nuts. The nuts can loosen from the vibration of the winch. I also recommend purchasing and installing the remote. All-in-all, I don't miss wrestling with the anchor and rope. One negative is that the power cables that attach to the battery are too short. I needed to purchase extensions for cables.",

      "text": "I purchased this because the 25 lb electric anchor winch ( a different brand) I had was constantly binding up inside the gears. My plan was to use this with a 30 lb anchor and it is a success. I did have to add a plate on the back of my boat to extend the pulley outward. That was just a function of my boat however, and I'm hopeful this anchor winch will continue to do the job!",
