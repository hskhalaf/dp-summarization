Setting it up has been extremely easy and it has an app for everything. I'm most impressed that it makes sure I don't forget important events and meetings as it syncs brilliantly with my schedule providing essential notifications for every appointment without being intrusive.",

In terms of the watch itself, I have been waiting for ages to find an elegant (not squared or too sporty) and functional watch that I can use while runing and in the office. The interface works perfectly and is capable of using all the applications that I use like Spotify, Whatsapp and adding my personal music (8GB of memory) in case of not having internet. This is a really good option for those thinking in buying a new smartwatch!!",

It is a good gift if you are looking for a smartwatch with quality and aesthetics.",
