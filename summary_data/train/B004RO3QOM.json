Cops were hiding out in places they usually don't, this detector gave me enough time to slow my speed. I am more than happy and will be buying at least another for the mustang! LOL!

My only complaint is that the font in the instruction booklet is so darn small one needs a magnifying glass to read it even in bright daylight. A real pain in the butt if one had to look up what button changes what function and you don't happen to have a magnifying glass in the glove box. Regardless, I would recommend the detector.",

Other than being in a parking lot near a supermarket with automatic doors, I get almost no false alarms. I recommend the city mode for urban areas.

Not sure if the \"S\" safety alert works though - it seems like the \"K\" band also picks up the safety alert alarm. It has a pretty decent range except on hills - as I'm guessing most radar detectors probably don't do well on hills.",

That's what I noticed, to many things set it off in a town but highways this does excellent. So if your just driving around in a city big city. Then maybe look for a different one",
