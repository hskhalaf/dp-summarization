Only thing I might have concerns it the turning knobs. They are durable as well and not easily breakable, but as you turn to tune you have to make sure you turn slowly. They're gears versus the usual knobs I suppose \ud83d\ude05, but for children it's keeps them from breaking the strings so 5 stars from me... Absolutely love it!!!!!!! Blue guitar is very vibrant!",

The strings are very low quality and I broke one while tuning it also the go out of tune very quickly. The fretboard is less the desireable as it has gunned up paint on the side of the frets. Other wise it is a perfect first guitar for any child wanting to learn",

It takes a little time (maybe 24 hrs) for strings to settle and hold tuning. Its also important to stretch the strings so that they hold tune,stretching them properly can take days or weeks before they achieve optimal tension, thank you."
