I'll use this if I'm flying someplace, but once I arrive, I switch back to the canvas bag. It's also not great construction; the zipper on the side pouch came off the first time I used it and the shoulder strap is really stiff/bulky/uncomfortable. Not a fan.",

I really should have just bought this amazon basics bag first because it would've saved me some hassle. The bag is small but fits my camera perfectly. The strap has a little shoulder cushion which is great and the bottom even has a hard exterior. The bag did come with some of those little \"hairs\" that people have complained about but they are not human hairs. They thin, hairlike pieces of the bag's fabric. Probably there from manufacturing. Overall, I'm very happy with it!",

The exterior fabric is 'good enough' to withstand some light exposure to rain and wind, but it's definitely not built (seams/zippers) and treated to be an all weather bag. The only knock I would give it are the strap clips. The plastic feels cheap, the assembly flimsy. I swapped mine out with some spare Peak Anchor links and a strap.",

      "text": "This camera bag arrived with my camera as scheduled. The camera bag is very sturdy, well padded, fairly light and compact and serves my needs...but has somewhat limited side pocket storage compartments...There is room for the camera body and two lenses...but not much else in the primary compartment. The \"outside\" zippered side pockets can hold a couple of back-up batteries, extra SD cards and lens caps...the front pocket can hold a charger and maybe a cord. You can put the charger in the camera compartment but it will crowd the fragile camera and lenses. There is plenty of room if you are only carrying a single lens and camera body. Overall, I am satisfied with the camera case.",

This case was inexpensive, fits the camera perfectly, and feels durable. It also has a firm molded bottom that lets it stand upright and protects the camera and fabric from the elements. I highly recommend it and for less than $20, it is less expensive than any of the competition!",

I'm kinda disappointed especially considering how littles it's been used, at how soon it broke. But if you're looking for a cheap, and ugly bag for only one lens and a body, then this is it.
