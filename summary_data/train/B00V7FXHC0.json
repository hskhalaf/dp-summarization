      "text": "Phone was defective. The fingerprint sensor didn't work right. It wouldn't authenticate after setting it up. The phone also would not connect to any cell phone towers and could not make phone calls. This also cost me a lot of money as I had to pay twice for activation fee, then upgrade fee to switch from this pile of junk to a phone available from Verizon. It also forced me out of a promotion losing me a further $120 on top. In my opinion not only should this have been a refund, but owed me for the money lost.",

Every time I lost service I had to wait longer and longer (for hours) until service was back. Now, in less than 3 months after purchasing the phone, it lost the service forever. I have checked my sim card on another phone. It works perfect on other one, not on my Samsung Galaxy S6. I have to buy a new phone now (the limited warranty was 30 days), so this purchase was a complete loss of money. The phone was indicated as a \"NEW\", but now I don't think it was true.",

After chatting with a Verizon rep online to have the problem fixed, I had to do a factory reset. However, the problem returned once I restarted the phone. I had to bring it to a Verizon store to have someone actually work on it to disable the app and return the phone to its original condition. This is something Samsung needs to tweak.",

I'm used to holding my phone along the bottom and with the controls situated along the bottom I keep hitting them just holding the phone. I tried to hold it by the sides but kept pressing those buttons. Ended up returning it, just wasn't happy with it.",
