They keep doing this too, I think there are at least 3 different card backs currently... There's absolutely no reason for this other than a money grabbing scheme.

Cons: - Hard to read some of the descriptions on the card due to their size. I would recommend this game to everyone who wants to have a fun new card game to play with friends and family!",

The 12 year old did ok. We did a practice round where we helped each player lay their hand. If your family already plays more \"modern\" games they'll catch on fine (killer bunnies, ticket to Ride, Catan etc) This is a quick game! With just two players each game lasted about 20 minutes.

We play multiple times per week, and after a month the cards were shot. Edges wear and bend to the point that others know what sits in your hand. After contacting them, the company requested proof of purchase for replacement cards insisting their card manufacturer is top notch. When you can buy top of the line Bicycle cards for less than 3 dollars, it's frustrating to be out 50 bucks for this and all the add-ons.",

I can see why they had to create extension packs just to make it more interesting.
