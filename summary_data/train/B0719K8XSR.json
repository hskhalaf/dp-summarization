Obviously this would be used under an umbrella, so it wouldn't get rained on, but don't leave it outside overnight. Good thing it's easy to install and remove because you'll be doing it every time you use it. Especially if you want to close the umbrella. Overall seems like a good product.",

It looks like it takes 3 AA batteries. There's a port I guess for charging but not wires or connectors. Also, no manual or any instructions to help. Hopefully it's straight forward but I would still appreciate an insert of some kind letting me know what comes with the product and how to use.",

With this one, once you close the \"jaw\" it is secured, requiring no adjustments. Would have liked a remote as our old one had, because my wife and I are both short, so it is a stretch to reach up to turn it on/off. But that's the only thing keeping it from being a \"5!\"",
