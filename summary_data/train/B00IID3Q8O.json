Programming is abominable - entering a specific frequency is impossible if the unit refuses to recognize the frequency entered and will instead round the number to what it considers a valid frequency. Total waste of money. Shame I didn't listen to the critical reviews. Don't waste your money on this unit. Amazon has better scanners I would commend to you.",

Has little to no signal receiving power, can get some transmissions from Police/Fire base stations, but either VERY scratchy, or none from the mobile units responding. Frustrating because the mobile units are the ones giving the Lat/Longs of the fires. I'd hoped the handhelds had improved over the past 20 years, they have not. My Dad had a handheld years ago, it wasn't the greatest either, maybe good for in the city, but out in the country where the police/fire are transmitting from, miles away, this is pretty useless.",
