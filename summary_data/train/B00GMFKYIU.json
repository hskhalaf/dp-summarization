The bugs though, the extreme lag makes this game almost unplayable. Seemed to only really be a serious problem with huge fights, like the processor couldn't keep up. That was terrible and really held me back from being immersed. Very short game and the final boss was lame. I am a fan of LOTR and just wished they would've spent just a bit more time getting this right.",

I will never purchase a game from the maker again because they just went on with the ps4 version and left us out in the cold with a broken game.....Thanks SO Much for customer service!!!!

To be fair, if I had played more, it may have been enjoyable. The setting of Mordor that you begin in, is a bleak and desert area filled with enemy Orcs, and it feels a bit more assassins creed than dark souls, I fought one of the Nemesis orcs but it was inconclusive, so he ran away.",

The combat is amazing it makes you just want to forget about the story and just find orcs to fight!! The graphics are the reason for the 4 stars because there not great but there really no as bad as people are making them sound. there was an update out out and it fixed a lot of issues people were having. I would defiantly recommend this game",

There are constantly weird audio bugs that causes the same audio track to repeat, which is really annoying. Game has froze on my ps3 at least 3 times within 2 hours of gameplay.",

      "text": "All of the bad things people say about the PS3 version of this game are true: the gameplay and audio lag constantly, it takes 10+ seconds to open the pause menu, textures show up well after you've arrived in an area (or not at all), etc. All of the words people use to describe the folks who let this travesty make it to market are also accurate: shockingly unprofessional, utterly embarrassing, and so on. It's a real shame, because you can tell that the game should be great (and IS on the next-gen systems). The optimists say that things will smooth out with some patches, but I'm not holding my breath.",

The game occasionally freezes when you get into a big battle with many enemies, or when you are at the Sauron's Army screen. I hope they patch this soon. It is a pretty fun game. With these frustrations though, I wish I had spent my 60 dollars elsewhere.",

Shadows of Mordor on the ps3 is terrible, the core mechanics of the game do not run as smoothly as Batman and/or assassins creed games. Also, the nemesis system for the ps3 version is a shadow compared to the ps4 version. Here is a link to a blog about the matter -->",
