For those looking for help choosing between the two I would probably be happier with the mini as I haven't found the screen size too small nor noticed anything different so, for the difference in money, I don't think it's worth stretching yourself. For those on the go then the mini is for you.",

After a few months of using it I don't know how I managed without one. I love it. Very pleased with my choice. My tip would be to think about what you want to use it for and then get the iPad with size/memory that best suits your needs. Then you too will be app happy...",

There's no discernible difference between the mini and it's big brother in everyday use, it's just lighter and easier to hold in one hand. For me, this is the one I pick up most often which probably says more than all the technical comparisons you're likely to read.",

Some of the websites which her school recommends she use won't run on the ipad because they have flash content. Flash maybe replaced in the future so this might not always be a problem, apart from this it has been a great gift and the battery life is great.",
