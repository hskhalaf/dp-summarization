      "text": "This is a preliminary review after only one month of use. The unit works fine installed in a 2007 silverado classic with a rough country hidden winch mount. I have pulled with it twice and have had no issues. The complaints I do have are 1) the remote receiver has delicate prongs and a rubber cap that is easily dislodged. I would prefer if smittybilt put a more robust pin system in their remotes. 2) the clutch to freespool can be troublesome in moving from engaged to disengaged but nothing that can\u2019t be overcome by simply winching in or out with the remote. Overall I am satisfied and will provide periodic updates as time and conditions warrant.",

MotoGod responded by advising that I needed to contact manufacturer - Smittybuilt - who then informed me that I needed to refer the matter to the vendor. Both parties are now pointing their fingers at each other with me in the middle with an unusable winch.",

      "text": "I bought this for my 2003 GMC Sierra 2500HD. I thought it would be enough, but I later read that the winch should be 1.5 times the weight of the vehicle. I decided I'd buy a stronger cable before I used the winch. Well, as plans go, I got stuck before I bought a cable, and I was pulling a trailer. This winch pulled us out without any struggle. I even did it a second time just to be sure. I would recommend Smittybilt winches.",

      "text": "Beyond cheap plug connection from remote cable to control unit. The first time I tested the unit after installing, the connection point on the control unit broke apart when I unplugged the remote cable. The cheap plastic design will absolutely fail at some point, for me it lasted less than a minute and this happened in the garage, not even on the trail. I'm baffled that Smittybilt would put their name on a product so poorly designed that could someday be required to save your life. The actual winch seems to be solid but when, not if the control unit breaks it quickly becomes a 50 lb. anchor on your front bumper.",

Now hubby is having the same issue where the motor is dead. You can hear it clicking but the motor is not pulling the line in or letting line out....",
