      "title": "This was the 3rd Igloo Marine backpack cooler we purchased",
      "text": "We have always loved our Igloo marine backpack coolers and recommended to others throughout the years. The reason we had to replace the others was one flew out of the boat and the other one, the zipper broke after years of use. However we are extremely disappointed that this backpack started leaking after a month or so. We have owned others identical to this one and they never leaked. For the price it should last MUCH longer than a month. I guess Igloo's quality is no longer a priority.",

It holds a lot, is easier to carry than the old cooler, and seems to keep things pretty cold. We have not given it a hard test -- neither hot conditions nor a long duration event -- but everything I've seen so far says it will be far better than our old cooler was.",
