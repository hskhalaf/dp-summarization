The construction of these shirts wicks away the sweat better than any work shirt I have owned and keeps me cool; Much more so than a cotton T-Shirt has in the past. They are very durable and VERY visible at night (as they should be). 30+ washes and the reflectiv strips are still bright. Size!!! To put it simply; they are not relaxed fit. I wear an XL and the XL fits just fine, but don't push it. Get a comfortable size for you. Was my review helpful? Please let Amazon know. Thank You",

A month after I purchased them ( no longer returnable), I finally needed to open them up- they were a full 1 1/2 inch longer in the sleeves, length and chest. I am swimming in them. So disappointed. If anyone wants mine (only one is open) I'll sell you them for five bucks less than these guys.",

Fair warning though, my hubby has a pretty flat stomach, but the reflective band that goes across the stomach is... not tight, but not stretchy either... so just be aware that if you have a not-so-flat stomach, it might affect you (I do not know this, though).",
