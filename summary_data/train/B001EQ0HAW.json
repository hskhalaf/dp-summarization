But when I received it, it was packaged nicely in a small box the zune was wrapped in bubble wrap and it came with a charger and earbuds. No scratches or marks anywhere. It is a gift so it hasn't been charged and turned on yet to see if it actually works, but I don't see why it wouldn't judging from the outside appearance of it. So far I'm very pleased and even more so that I saved over 200.00 buying used instead of new",

After I received the new Zune Microsoft (their service is incredibly easy to navigate for the Zunes by the way) I purchased afor an incredibly good price and I have not had any problems with it since then. Overall, I would recommend this product to friends because of it's beautiful screen, large capacity, and ease of support services from Microsoft.",

A simple file system would do it. Instead, one has to scroll through gigabytes of songs to try to find the one they want. The touch pad is also prone to mistakes which can land one back at the start after scrolling around for \"days\" to get someplace. Give me a file and folder system. Run the Zune style scheme over that. As it stands no one in our household even really uses the Zune. We all prefer other players.",

This company worked with me and were very nice to work with. They are not nai\u0308ve, but were willing to listen and make it right. We came to an agreement to satisfy both parties and I would gladly buy from them again. Thank you, Duciespade LLC!",

Not only did the harddrive start skipping but they repairman told me the battery was bad and needed to be replaced! I think they must have skipped this one and slipped it in for sale without fixing anything! I will not buy refurbished again and I will not buy from this dealer again either. I had to spend $200 more to repair everything when I had it less than a month! Lesson learned!",

Every person I know that has owned an ipod has had to have it replaced because it was broken. I've never once had an issue with either of my Zunes. The screen is large, crisp and clear. I LOVE the radio feature. This really is an all in one device.",

The Zune software is ok at best. Some things I should mention is only the Zune software works with managing the Zune. You can't use Windows or Winamp or iTunes. Also when I bought this off Amazon I paid $220 for it. The date of this review, I see that the price is at $339.99. Either these things are really in demand, or Microsoft/Amazon is purposely trying to get you to buy the Zune HD models.",
