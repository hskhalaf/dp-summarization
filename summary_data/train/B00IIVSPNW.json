The shipping was timely and well packaged and I'm really happy with the product so far. These are stylish, well made (they simply feel more expensive than they are) and they are very clear. I've had other readers that just aren't that clear for some reason and these are crystal clear. I'm very happy with my purchase. I was also happy to learn that this is a family business and I love supporting small family run businesses.",

At 73 years I do require reading glasses yet my distance vision is great so paying over $600 bucks for one pair of readers seemed ridiculous. These are working fine and should I lose a pair or break them it is not a concern. I would order these again. They work just fine for the very limited time I require wearing glasses.",

These readers are quite sturdy, but as I tend to \"lose/sit on/abuse/step on/drop in the river/drive over/chew on/leave in a restaurant/loan out\" my reading glasses, theses are perfect - both in price and durability. Only had one pair actually break (the frame at the bottom of one lens cracked after quite a bit of use), and I probably contributed mightily to their demise. This time there was a small glitch in the order - the storage bags were missing - but one e-mail and everything was made right IMMEDIATELY. I had the bags in two days. Greg from Newport even called me to make sure I was completely satisfied. Great customer service!!!",

And the price was way beyond reasonable. 5 pair for $17, including a pair of shaded readers which I will definitely use. We will see how they hold up, but at this price, I'm a very happy customer!",

If you are a little princess and take care of your glasses like butterfly wings, then these may work for you. If you plan on ever putting them in your pants pocket like you might a regular prescription pair of normal glasses, figure they'll last you about a week tops. Two stars because the lens quality is okay and the price is good",
