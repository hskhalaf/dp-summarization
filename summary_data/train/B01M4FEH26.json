I was powering a few circ saws, drills and lights all less than 23 amps like the data plate says but the power was poor. Had my electrician look at the gen and tells that the machine only good for 4900 watts. Now im at the jobsite without enough power. There should be law against this.",

      "text": "Not impressed with the casting of motor, divets all over. A window unit keeps tripping 20 amp gfci outlets, the a.c unit is 4.5 amp, 515 watts. CAT support said i needed 30 amp cord converter to solve. Will not run anything of substance without 30 amp breaker cord/ converter. This generator does not come with cord. Unlike briggs&stratton storm surge 6250. The rp5500 ran ok for the first 2 nights, but now on night 3 at 30hrs the voltage output has dropped from 240v to ~200v. Again not impressed with this generator but still in the midst of hurricane florence in eastern NC. Big time let down by CAT rp5500. I dont recommend, especially without 30 amp cord",

Not a single problem. It ran a commercial refrigerator, house lights, ceiling fans, window a/c unit and electric skillet. We alternated the fridge with a deep freezer. After the storm, cleaned it, changed the oil and ran the gas out of it. Just pulled it out of the shed almost a year later because of another possible storm. Poured some fresh gas in it and it started on the second pull.",
