The present camera would not turn on using either POE or a direct 12 volt power supply. The other cameras (different models) have worked fine for me (once I dealt with the POE problem on Camera 3), but after two problem cameras in a row, I have returned this unit to Amazon and will now turn to other companies.",

Purpose of the camera was varifocal, doesn't work very well compared to other brand at half the cost. Amcrest wifi cameras for sub 100 makes sense, but this one fails on every level and it's unreasonably priced.",

I went to upgrade the firmware and upgraded to a non-zoomed firmware. When I contacted support to get the newest or original firmware to roll back to, NO firmware is available whatsoever. Priced a bit too high for what it is. At this point, it is just an extra camera around the house and is the only one that is not actively recording.",

Ease of connectivity: Just open the Amcrest Pro app on the phone, add device and scan the QR code to set the new password. Once set, i logged into NVR and added by searching the camera into the system. Quality of video: Excellent day and night video quality. I can set the recording settings in the NVR. Overall: One of the best video cameras i have got and ever improving hardware.",
