After doing some research (not on amazon) I have found that a lot of folks using the Note 5 with Android 6 were having the same problem. So if you have this phone beware!!! It's not compatible!",

Based on what I read here, we had high hopes. However, when we pulled it out of the box, and the family started printing pictures, there was nothing but utter disappointment on everyone's face. The print quality is terrible. Really, truly, BAD. We tried printing pictures from everyone's phone, and not a single one of them was of decent quality. It was not a matter of the prints being too dark, they just looked awful. Weird colors, poor contrast, streaks, etc. Don't waste your time on this one.",

You have to mess around with the brightness on your phone before you print. You get a complete print on the sheet instead of a border print like the Fugi Film. You can also modify, add borders, and other stuff on the app. Highly recommended.",

But the bad results I've gotten haven't been bad enough to throw away the picture entirely so take that how you will. Some sky photos it stuggles unless the colors are solid it seems. I felt like the first few pictures kinda broke the machine in and it just got better from there. The app is also super easy to use which is a plus. Only way to get 5 stars is to be flawless all the time but as I said what do you expect for the price.",
