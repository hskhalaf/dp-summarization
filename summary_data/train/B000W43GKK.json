      "text": "Initially, I really liked the fit, color and feel. But as fall moved in, they would blow off the chairs easily. The drawstrings deteriorated quickly compounding the problem. After a few months in the sun, the material became weak and the fabric began to tear at the corners of the furniture. The pictured covers are exactly one year old. They just don't hold up. They were torn after 5 months. I tried an adhesive patch but it didn't take. I can give them 2 stars because if you have furniture that is protected from wind and sun, these would work fine as a nice dust cover. If your furniture is fully exposed, keep looking.",

Nothing smells mildewy, the covers seem to repel water and dry quickly. They didn't crack in the cold, and they hang on despite high winds. There are a few rips on the bottom seams where I imagine they blew some and rubbed against the patio, leaving the small holes. But, it's not going to impact its function. I will say they don't form-fit the chairs like the images shows, but if you can get past that, they're great for protecting furniture.",

They have not been abused, the fabric has just become very poor after being in the weather. The funny thing is, it is just starting to get hot. They have not even had to survive the worst of what Texas has to offer. Can't believe Amazon allows such a terrible product",
