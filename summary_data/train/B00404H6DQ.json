      "text": "These headphones I have really been enjoying. They provide rich, clear, warm sound and look fantastic. The only problems I've had with them are: 1. You really can't move around a lot or they will fall off. Tilt your head back and they WILL fall off. 2. The headband can be a little rough on your head. It's not really padded; it's a solid piece of rubber, but it's not overly painful. You get used to it after a while. Unless either of those really bother you, I would recommend these to anyone looking for a good pair of warm sounding headphones.",

They are perfect for this.. and rugged and tight fit on the ears for proper positioning in the mix. Not a commuter phone, a pro dj phone. Recommended.",
