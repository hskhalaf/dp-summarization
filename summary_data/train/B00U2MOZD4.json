There are many cracks throughout the vanity, doors don't line up, drawers also don't line up to each other, etc. I gave it two starts due to the fact that it's all plywood instead of compressed board. Very disappointed. I've attached photos",

Everything looks great so far. When the bathroom remodel is finished, the vanity will be installed. The knobs are already on the drawers and are very pretty. The top is beautiful, a pure white quartz, and has to be secured when installed. I purchased two of the vanities, one 36\" and one 43\". I love them both.",

I watched my UPS guy tip it off the back of the truck. No surprise that the sink cracked. The company did send a replacement, by a real freight company, in a couple weeks. The color is a soft white. A creamy off white color. I love that this vanity is a right sink. We went from a tiny sink to this one and this allowed us to not have to move the plumbing. Its very hard to find a right offset sink. The vanity looks good. I think the price is right.",

Soft white colored base with soft close doors and drawers with ample storage. The white quartz top, although a tad thin looks really quite nice. The Plummer that installed the faucet and vanity complimented as to how well made and good looking it is. Seriously, could not be more pleased.",

Had to make some slight modifications to the lower shelf and drawer to accommodate existing plumbing. Shipping was fast - as it arrived a day earlier than scheduled....and delivery driver helped store it in a workable location till I could unpack it. Only negative - the 3 drawers do not have even gaps from top to bottom. Hardly noticeable unless you are use to looking for faults like that.",
