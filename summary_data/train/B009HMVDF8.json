A couple of pounds lost. I like the added coconut oil which I believe gives this product an edge over others. Coconut oil helps with fat burning. There's no reason not give 5 stars since this brand gives the highest concentrates and if you do it right and not overeat, expecting this to even out the calorie intake, you're going to have good results.",

I have taken GCBE before (by another manufacturer) and never had a reaction. I will need to take something to counteract the reaction so I can stop itching. I do need the GCBE (because it really works) but I cannot use this product by this manufacturer.",
