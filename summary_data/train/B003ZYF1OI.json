I feel like I am sitting on a soft magical blanket all the time, and we are soaring into a world where all my furniture isn't covered with an old sheet. Very VERY nice. I love it.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the arm covers are what is too short. They could be a good 24\" to 36\" longer. But, too short arms are not as bad as a too short back. I washed the throw before using it and have not experienced any fabric/color rub off. Oh, did I mention, the price is the best!",
