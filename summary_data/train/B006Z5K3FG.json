I'm only giving 3 stars because mine didn't come with the 2 free brushes! The box was in perfect condition...it's was sealed shut with what looked to be the original seal, however the slots for the brushes sat empty. How frustrating! I'm not sure how great the quality of the brushes would have been...but #1 as a MUA I could ALWAYS use more brushes and #2 if it says it comes with it then....hello, I expect it!",

I wish they had a black or two in it but for the price and amount of color you get it can't be beat. There are some duplicates which I was a little irritated with. The quality of the shadows are fantastic. Mix them with a bit of water for more pigment. The set I got was ALL glitter. NO matte colors at all. I am really hoping Shany comes out with a set that is matte. I would order that in a heart beat.",

If you like shimmers and glitters, this will be a perfect match. The pigments come an a black tray and the containers can easily be stored in the sturdy product box. I would recommend this product to others and I'm planning on purchasing more products from Shany. I feel like this company, which is PETA approved needs more recognition.",

For a lot of the eyeshadows it seems like the color and glitter look disappears almost completely even if you're using a lot. Also when using a lot, the glitter tends to run down your face as the day progresses, so you look like you're crying glitter. On a separate note, the bright orange shadow made me look like an alien. Conclusion: Pretty expensive product for what it turned out to be, I would have been better off buying individual eye shadows with glitter already in it...that way I would have only the colors I want.",
