      "title": "Great, Studio Quality Sound, at a BARGAIN!",
      "text": "The sound quality form these headphones is absolutely fantastic. This is no questions asked studio quality sound and a cracking price. Comfort wise, these do the job, but, as I have done, I would recommend replacing the earpads as they can get uncomfortable after an hour or so. Brainwavz Round pads are excellent for this. If I have one other gripe about these, it's the non-detachable cable, however at this low a price point, you really cannot grumble. I would get another pair of these again in a heartbeat. Did this help you? Please consider marking this as 'Helpful' below, it would be much, much appreciated!",

      "text": "The first thing you notice when you open these headphones and pull them from the box is the weight. They are VERY light and whilst this might sound like they would be comfortable to wear, they've been designed (and sold) as high-quality well-made headphones. They're not. The second thing is the ear pads. These are more like pieces of polystyrene covered in fuzzy felt, than soft velour over soft foam. This was the main reason I bought these, for comfort. Disappointed. Good thing they were cheap. Once they break - and it probably won't take long, I'll go in-store and try out something genuinely professional.",

When they arrived the packaging was a bit so so When I took them out they lacked a quality feeling to them and the plastic seemed lightweight and cheap. However they seem to have a reasonable sound and the headband adjusts easily for a good fit. They cover my ears well. So... not disappointed with the performance & fit but the construction is a bit light.",

They present a well balanced flat clear sound which makes listening through them a pleasure. I\u2019ve listened to various genres from folk to rock, and the Samson SR850 headphones handle it all with ease. I\u2019ve also used them to mix music, and this is where they really come to life. Without colouring the sound, they make mixing music far less taxing providing a nice separation between instrument frequencies. Definitely buy these... at less than \u00a330 why would you not try them?",

When the first side snapped clean off on the second use, and then the other side on the third use, I was proved right. My return window has now closed, and I'm out \u00a326 and without a usable set of headphones. So upsetting. When I can afford to I shall buy something better quality.",

The build quality is great, good quantity materials and nice finish, they look much more expensive that their price tag. Soft ear pads and self adjusting strap made them very comfortable too. I was blown away with the sound quality, sharp clean tones, and great bass. Far better that my old gaming headset, and good enough for listening to my vinyl too. The only down side is no microphone, but a good stock on gaming mic is an easy fix. I would highly recommend this product",

Pro: quality, comfort, light weight, price, long kink-free cable. Con: level sometimes a bit low (but OK for most uses). Tinny treble at first while 'running in', but the reviews warned me about that. Bulkier to look at than they feel -- wouldn't want to wear them in public, e.g. on the tube!",

With that being said, the build quality falls short on comfort, they don't have a good clamping pressure and feel very rigid.

The Samsons are unlikely to win any design awards but do offer maximum performance at minimal price. Well worth an audition!",

I was hopeful from the reviews that these were going to be at least half decent but at the price I truly didn't have the highest of expectations. I was pleasantly surprised in the end. These headphones are so much more transparent than any other headphones I've ever used, although I will admit to only ever having consumer rather than reference headphones prior to this set. For the price, I really don't think you can go wrong with these even if it is for general music consumption rather than creation.",
