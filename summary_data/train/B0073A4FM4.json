      "text": "I've owned a number of headphones over the past 50 years. A few I've owned: Koss Pro 4AAA Sennheiser HD 650 and Momentum Beyer T90 and DT 880 AKG 601 The Shures are the best of all. Beautifully detailed sound with a solid low end and a smooth high end. Never fatiguing. I listen to Classical mostly and these headphones render the soundstage, imaging and frequency response ideal for that type of music. I also use them for monitoring when recording. No need to spend more. I also own the Shure 1540 Closed Back and they are equally as good. Excellent quality and performance.",

      "text": "I had bought a pair of these phone on ebay for a huge discount- less than 1/2 price. I spent a lot of time and money trying t get the headphones to perform but never could. I recently bought the full priced Shure SRH1840 headphones on Amazon and what a difference, WOW! The old headphone were identical in construction but they were clearly seconds or knockoffs. The new Shure SRH1840's were exceptional in every way and compared well to any headphones I have under $1500 ( I have many). They are dynamic and sound great with all genre's of music. Comfortable and simply a pleasure to listen to. Expensive, yes but well worth the price.",

Update 5/9/2018 Still using this headphones and the sound is still awsome. I smile every time i put it on. Background, I used to own the hd598 and hd650. I love the hd598 but the sound is not clear. This is better than both Update 7/14/2018 Im using it with the schiit lyr and bifrost dac. The sound is so much better now. Its incredible. Make sure you get a strong amp and a good dac to take full advantage of the headphone.",

After a few weeks I tested them on a Meridian Prime headphone amp and compared them to the Audeze LCD-2 and was shocked at how well they stacked up. On several songs I preferred the Shures from a sonic standpoint and on EVERY song I preferred them from a comfort standpoint. These are great if you will be wearing them for an extended period of time. Very highly recommended.",

I mix music with my DT-880's so I wanted something I could use for casual listening and occ mixing duties. The sound is much fuller and richer than either Beyerdynamic, with a really musical quality. I also have Focal Alpha 80's which I use for occ mixing, casual listening and movies. Worth every penny. really a bargain; I would place the price around $700 or so. They are super comfortable as well- been listening to music for several hrs a day since they came in 4 days ago. It's like breathing new life into old songs. Highly recommended!",

These things must take one hell of an amp to power sufficiently. I tried 3 different headphone amps and wasn\u2019t able to get enough juice out of these without killing the SNR and inducing hum. The sound quality was phenomenal however, just quiet. Comes in a nice hard case with extra wiring. I\u2019d probably have better things to say if I could\u2019ve powered them enough. Headband is still terrible though!",

Sound is quite transparent and revealing. Very lightweight and comfortable; three or four hours of listening create no fatigue. As others have noted, they do benefit from 100 hours or so of burn-in, mostly in the bass response. If open-back headphones meet your needs, I recommend these.",

Amazing how similar they are to my 310s in that they don't hype the bass or high end- things sound tight, crisp, smooth- representative of the actual mix- you can really hear the reverb tails, etc. Really good clarity for a 500.00 headphone.
