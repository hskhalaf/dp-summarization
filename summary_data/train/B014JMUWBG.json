Not sure the options when you have larger than 'standard' arms and a neoprene suit. She will be wearing it surfing this week in the Atlantic so will advise any additional info (good or bad) thereafter. Sizing charts are spot on and she really liked the color scheme and the 'womens' cut as she tried on her brothers suit and it definitely did not fit her hips / waist properly. Stitching and quality solid. YKK zippers are outstanding.",

The material is super nice and durable looking, great for scuba or snorkeling, which is what it's intended for, I'm sure. The suit looks fabulous on, as well, but I think I would just look ridiculous wearing this to class. No fault on the manufacturer, at all.",

      "text": "I am 5'1 and 114 lbs, so my dilema was to either buy a womens, or a large youth. While I fit into a youth 14, the womens was MUCH MORE comfortable(more room in the crotch, legs longer, to top of knee, rather than 1/3 down thigh like youth 14). Haven't worn it in the water yet, but expect it to be great according to other reviews. Arrived on time and in great condition.",
