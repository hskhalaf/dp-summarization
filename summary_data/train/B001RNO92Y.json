      "text": "No doubt these are wonderfully sounding headphones. The problem I had was using a sansa fuze and a Fiio e6 amp the headphones would cut out or clip when turned up too loud. I've never had headphones do this..I use Sennheiser px-100, Metro Fi 220s, Panasonic RP-HT600s(get a pair of these if you can..worth it to add for the price..they are great cans) and none cut out..or pop..I think it's called clipping..but these do really bad.. This is just my experience with this setup. They do sound amazing at normal volume. I give it 5 stars for sound..just didn't work for my setup I suppose..",

These are certainly a worthy successor of that legacy. Very light weight and comfortable and the sound blew me away when I put them on. I have LOTS of headphones. With 12-14 hour days, I have to change what is on my head once or twice a day. These will probably last much longer than most. The ear cushions could be a little larger, the cord could use some more beef,but they are the best first impression headphones I have put on in decades.",

If you are looking for a headset that isolates the sound to only that which comes from the headset, this is not for you. It's comfortable, and offers great clarity in sound. I would recommend to people like me, who want to be able to hear everything around you, but at the same time, enjoy music at the same time.",

I decided to get headphones but knew I did not want over-the-ear closed headphones due to weight and comfort. I recalled a friend's Sennheiser open-air headphones from the '70's. I am listening to Hendrix right now (I am a huge fan) and hearing details that I haven't been able to perceive in over 30 years. I thought I had lost my high and low range. They are also comfortable. I think these are great and recommend them very highly for both performance and price.",

      "text": "Pretty amazing. I wanted on-the-ear, open headphones, and went with Sennheiser because of past experience with their products. These headphones amazed me with their sound from the very start -- I can't wait until they fully break in. The open design gives strong (but not overpowering) bass, including deep frequencies, and the sound leakage is fairly minor. Plenty of volume on my Android smartphone. Quite comfortable -- leather/felt earpads. They don't collapse like the Bose OE do, but felt more comfortable by far. Only a pouch for protection, not a case, but that should be good enough. And, through a \"Fulfilled by Amazon\" vendor, less than one-third the cost of the Bose. (Half what Amazon itself was asking!)",

The sound is good and they are reasonably comfortable; however, the Panasonic headphones that came with the player are better. It is perhaps an unfair comparison because those Panasonic headphones were superb compared with those of any price. Anyway, these Sennheisers will do, although I suspect there are better ones for less money.",

Sounds come in, but very few goes out. It will only be heard in the surroundings if they are at high volume in a really silent environment. Got them refurbished for less than 20 bucks.

A couple of quibbles: the cord is a bit short, and ends in a mini phone plug - clearly Sennheiser has aimed these headphones toward the MP3 player crowd. For the price (and quality), Sennheiser should have seen fit to include a mini phone plug to standard phono plug adapter for home listening.",

They look nice. \"Seems\" well built. Cons: Leaks a lot (I know they're open headphones, but still, the sound leakage is way louder then other open headphones). Lasted one month and died (the right ear driver itself, not the cord or connectors). Did I mention they died after 1 month?",
