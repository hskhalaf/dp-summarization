My ENT gave me a tip to help it work even better and I'm not sure why it helped so much but he said to take a 180mg tablet and split it in half.. take one half in the AM and the other half in the PM. This made this allergy medicine twice as effective when i dosed it this way for some reason. I hope this will help someone else who has allergies",
