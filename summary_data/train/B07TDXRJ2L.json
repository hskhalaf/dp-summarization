My son finds other mouthguards too bulky and he has braces, so we needed the perfect mouthguard for him to use and this one was the perfect mouthguard to use for football this year with his braces. It wasn't too bulky or hard. He was comfortable with wearing it for the long practices and games. He said, \"It's just perfect!\" I would totally recommend this protective mouthguard for the size and the material. It lasted the full season as well.",

I had to adjust mine by cutting away a small portion on the top so that it would not dig in to my upper gums. But it was easily done with a razor knife. Now it fits to perfection and it is the most comfortable mouthpiece I have ever had. I would highly recommend it.",
