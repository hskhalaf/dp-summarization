It's a matter of attaching the wheels, attaching the frame that goes around the tank, connecting the tubes, screwing in the completely installed head unit, and then the reflecting disc on top. 45 minutes tops and I could do another right now in half the time. Best yet it lit up instantly and throws off a lot more heat than any of my other heaters. The stainless steel is good quality and looks great. Very happy so far!",

      "text": "About the best patio heater you'll find. You'll appreciate the extra heating capability: most pole heaters top out at about 40-41,000 BTU; Xtremepower's produced an impressive 48,000 BTU. It holds only a 20 lb. LP tank and that seems to run out quickly, even set at low. But, after an initial warm-up, you shouldn't need a setting much above low since a great deal of heat is generated even at low setting.",

The date span given for arrival made it look likely it wouldn't make it but we'd still get use out of it so I went ahead and ordered. It arrived before the date span given and after my son put it together it worked beautifully and gave everyone something to huddle around as the night came on. I told several people about how cheap it was and they were quite impressed.",

Replacement arrived within a few days and was perfect. I do suggest bolting this thing down to your deck with some long screws if you're putting it on the deck. Otherwise, the wind might knock it over and it will damage the hood. However that is typical with all of these types of heaters. I will be buying two more of these in the springtime to put by the pool.",
