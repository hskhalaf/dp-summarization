Great pictures, functions well. I recently used it while snorkeling and we had no problems with waterproofing. The camera has also endured being tossed around a bit on several hiking trips in both Costa Rica and Maui, Hawaii. I highly recommend this camera for colorful shots with outstanding clarity!",

I didn't reliable electricity to recharge it, but the battery lasts long enough so that if I am conscious of conserving it it will last many days (taking only pictures that I think will be good, and not ever tree that I see).

Geat deal mainly because of the price, it was originally $599 but was reduced to $234. There were few sales when it was new because of the price for the size.",

The waterproof and dustproof camera features a 3.3-inch OLED touch screen, an 18.2MP sensor, an ultra-stable 5X optical/10X Clear Image Zoom, and Hi-speed AF. The DSC-TX200V also captures incredible low light pictures at up to 10fps, and Full HD 1080/60p video. \n\n\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n18.2 MEGAPIXEL BACK-ILLUMINATED EXMOR R CMOS IMAGE SENSOR\nThe 18.2MP Exmor R CMOS sensor captures ultra-high definition images that take full advantage of the camera\u2019s sharp Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar lens. The sensor enables advanced processing that reduces noise levels up to 6 times more than other sensors, resulting in stunning low light images with incredible details.\n\n\nWATERPROOF AND DUSTPROOF\n\nThe sleek and stylish DSC-TX200V fits the slimmest pocket or purse. Thanks to its airtight construction, it is dustproof as well as waterproof to a depth of 16 feet.\n\nSLIM GLASS DESIGN PLUS A 3.3-INCH OLED\nThe DSC-TX200V features a sleek, polished glass camera front without protruding lenses or control buttons, making it one of the thinnest cameras in its class, and adding to its water- and dust-proof design. The 5X optical zoom extends internally, and scenes can be composed or played back on the camera\u2019s bright and colorful 3.3-inch OLED monitor.\n\nHI-SPEED AF\n\nTo improve focusing speed and sensitivity, the Exmor R CMOS sensor uses its rapid 240fps throughput to deliver high-quality image signals to the camera\u2019s BIONZ processor, which provides intelligent response data to a new high speed actuator motor in the lens. The result is fast, DSLR-like focusing speeds even in low light. \nFULL HD 1080/60P\n\nRecord crystal clear movies at the highest resolution available with capabilities for 60p in 1080. This provides stunning, fast motion video with less distortion for playback on your HD TV. With dual record of stills and movies, you can shoot both at the same time.\n\nOPTICAL ZOOM PLUS CLEAR IMAGE ZOOM\n\nMost digital zooms use electronic cropping to get closer to the subject, resulting in unsharp images. With Clear Image Zoom the powerful processor compares patterns found in adjacent pixels and creates new pixels to match selected patterns, resulting in more realistic, higher-quality images. Clear Image Zoom doubles optical zoom for closer photos.\n\nCAPTURE THE DECISIVE MOMENT WITH UP TO 10FPS\n\nCapture full 18.2 megapixel resolution images at up to 10 frames per second, helping to ensure that the decisive moment is captured such as the soccer ball flying into the goal. In addition, a mechanical shutter helps reduce distortion when continuously shooting moving subjects.\n\nOPTICAL STEADYSHOT WITH ACTIVE MODE\n\nOptical SteadyShot with Active Mode for blur-free movies even while walking. Camera-shake compensation using Optical SteadyShot/Active Mode has been improved with the addition of new electronic image stabilization. Now it\u2019s easier than ever to obtain sharp, blur-free movies even when zooming in unsteady situations, such as shooting with one hand while walking.\n\nPICTURE EFFECT FOR MORE EXPRESSIVE PHOTOS \n\nPicture Effect adds a new level of expression to photos, making ordinary landscapes and portraits come to life by heightening mood and emphasizing certain attributes. Select camera models have up to nine different effects. \n\nPHOTO CREATIVITY\n\nPhoto Creativity allows you to fine-tune your exposure settings, such as brightness, color, and vividness, and quickly choose the right enhancement for your subject. Now you can view Picture Effects and Photo Creativity effects in real time on the camera\u2019s monitor or in the viewfinder before shooting. \n\nBACKGROUND DEFOCUS\n\nDSLR photographs are often beautiful because they blur the background, putting the emphasis on the subject. Now our point-and-shoot cameras can deliver this signature DSLR benefit. The system takes two shots, identifies the background and applies a defocused background keeping the subject crisp and clear.\n\n\nSUPERIOR AUTO MODE\n\n\nGet cleaner, more dynamic pictures and fewer missed shots. The DSC-TX200V automatically recognizes the correct scene mode, then quickly shoots and combines up to six shots to produce images with greater clarity, optimum dynamic range using backlight correction HDR technology and lower image noise using 6 shots layering technology. Superior Auto intelligently detects 33 scenes for still images and movies, making it easy to get the best shot.\n\n\nFACE DETECTION TECHNOLOGY\n\n\nFace Detection technology detects up to eight individual faces and adjusts focus, exposure, and white balance to help deliver crisp, properly lit images of family and friends.\n\n\n\nSMILE SHUTTER TECHNOLOGY \n\n\nSmile Shutter technology captures a smile the moment it happens. Simply press the Smile Shutter button and the camera does the rest. You can also select adult and child priority and indicate the degree of Smile Detection sensitivity. Intelligent Scene Recognition can now be used together with Smile Shutter mode when the Intelligent Auto mode is on. This means that beautiful smiles can be captured with settings optimized for the particular scene, even in difficult conditions such as twilight and backlighting. \n\nANTI-BLINK FUNCTION \n\nIt\u2019s frustrating to capture the perfect shot, only to review it later and discover subjects blinked during the photo. The Anti-blink function works to help counter blinking and squinting. When the camera is set to Soft Snap, the Anti-blink function captures two images, recording only the photo with less squinting. If a blink is detected in other shooting modes, a warning will be displayed after you take the shot.\n\nSOFT SKIN MODE\n\nPortrait subjects will love the results. Soft Skin mode recognizes skin tones and reduces the appearance of blemishes and wrinkles without affecting the rest of the shot.\n\nINTELLIGENT SCENE RECOGNITION (ISCN) MODE\n\nIntelligent Scene Recognition (iSCN) Mode automatically detects 33 different types of scenes and, within just 1/30th of a second, selects the appropriate camera settings. iSCN has two modes: Auto and Advanced. In Auto Mode, the camera takes a single shot using the optimal settings. In Advanced Mode, the camera takes a photo with the optimal settings and, if in difficult lighting (low light or back light) immediately takes a second photo with another optimized setting so you can choose which to keep.\n\nNATURAL FLASH\n\nConventional point-and-shoot camera flash shots just don't capture colors the way the eye sees them. Natural Flash mode takes a reference shot without flash and then uses that reference to correct the color, for far more lifelike images.\n\nMOTION DETECTION\n\nMotion Detection, along with Face Motion Detection adjusts ISO sensitivity and increases the shutter speed when movement is detected, reducing blur in moving subjects and faces.\n\n\n1.
