To be honest, I'm using a combination of products which I believe are rescuing my skin since it suddenly changed from oily to very dry due to possible hormonal changes. I've used Lather skin products for longer time, they are fantastic and less pricey compared to Tatcha. The Lather citrus balancing toner is excellent, and this is the one that I'm currently using along with the Tatcha cleanser. I'll keep trying Tatcha products to see if they work better than my so far favorite brand Lather.",
