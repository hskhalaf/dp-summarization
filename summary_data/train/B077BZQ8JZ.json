The only drawback that we didn't know about was that it only will hold a charge and fly for about 5 minutes before you have to charge the battery again. I am looking into buying multiple batteries for him so he can fly it for a longer period of time. The only other thing is that it's supposed to flip mid-air, and it did for about a week, then it quit. Now it just flies, and that's fine, but it was supposed to flip.",

This drone comes in good packaging, It is easy to assemble. Material quality is also good. Instructions are clear. It operates very well. Pic quality is also fine not great. We did not try video but i would expect it to be same quality. Battery life is low. Thats the only problem. Otherwise this drone is good for first timers.",

Even after practising a couple hours, the controls are VERY difficult to handle as most of the time the drone does not follow the directions. We ended up losing our drone after flying it with almost a full battery about 20 ft high, it lost connection with the remote and started flying upwards and so far away from the remote that we still have not recovered it.",

It\u2019s especially great for beginners, given the functionality and low price point compared to other brands out there. We have pretty strong winds in Texas and I was a little worried about the weight of the drone when it arrived because it was so light but it does very well outside and doesn\u2019t get affected by the wind so much. My only suggestion/complaint would be a thicker plastic or material for the landing gear but that\u2019s about it. If you are wanting to learn how to fly a drone, I recommend starting with something like this.",

It took me several tries to get it not to pull to one side, but once I did, it was a lot of fun to fly. I would recommend this for somebody who is ready to get a larger drone, but not quite ready for a professional-grade model.",

Speed modes, headless mode, flips, all worked as expected. I have over 30 years experience in the r/c hobby and have worked for a large networking company. Thus I do not use the wifi controls and video feed. Video over wifi has lag and you can not reliably fly FPV over wifi. I recommend this quadcopter for someone wanting to try flying a quadcopter line of sight. The app is separate from the drone and your mileage may vary with the app.",

And also, thanks to the rotator protectors, I havent damaged any rotators so far(2 extra rotators comes with the package). The 3D flip is also really cool. Overall, I am satisfied by the drone being a beginner because it is really easy to control and 3d flip is amazing!",

The Field of View in your VR googles is narrow so if you fly it FPV you will want to use a large area. I enjoy this drone. It takes nice video and photo that stream through your phone.

Amazing fun when flown close to the ground but when I tested to see how high it would fly, I lost all control and it drifted off it's own way. Good thing is the emergency stop that thankfully still worked and dropped it to the ground.",
