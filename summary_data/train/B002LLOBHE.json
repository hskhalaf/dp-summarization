Just a warning, your oven will likely take longer to heat up to temperature, but it should maintain a more steady temp, since this had to heat up as well. We leave in in the oven at all times, without any issues, but all preheat times have increased. If electricity usage is of big concern, it's just something to keep in mind.",

Works great cooking pizzas on my home oven pizza stone. Also worksgreat for large staeks and roasts on the grill. What I really like is that it's compact enough to use in our camper's mini oven, yet large enough for campfire chores. I would recommend this to a friend.",

After the bread had baked the loaves went back onto it without a problem. The bread had cornmeal on the bottom so it wasn't neccessary to add any to the peel or oven stone. Being able to remove the handle to toss it into the dishwasher is a definite plus and also helps with storage. This is my first pizza peel and I feel I picked a winner! Haven't used it for an actual pizza yet (lol) but if it performs like it did with the bread, it will be an added bonus.",

Also since you can't clean it while it's hot, it's really hard to get the gunk off when it's all cold. Reheat Pizza Instructions for crispy crust: 1. Set oven to 500 and make sure this pizza stone is in there. 2. Once preheated, set oven temp to 400 and place your pizza directly on the stone 3. Reheat for 10-15 minutes 4. take out of oven to cool or just burn your mouth on how good it tastes",
