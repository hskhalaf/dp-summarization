However after using one of the bags 4 or 5 tmes, all of a sudden I noticed a piece of cardboard in the bottom of the bag. It was from the lid and the insulating material had completely separated (not ripped, seemed it wasn\u2019t attached properly with how neatly it had come apart). See pictures below. So now that bag is useless. Very disappointing. Wouldn\u2019t recommend.",

Plus, I like that they fold up flat when I need them out of the way. And I really like the colors! Zippers tend to stick a little bit, but hey, they're only $20 for two, so as far as I'm concerned, they're a really good buy.",

(Just peeled off like crepe paper. I wasn't even carrying anything heavy). The long straps still work, so I've continued using them for the last eight months, but I'll eventually replace them with bags that have better reinforced side handles, as I found those very useful.",

I also like that they're stackable (with zippers closed.) I deducted 1 star because I found the zipper on one to be a little hard to close. Hopefully they'll hold up with regular use.",

I left a thermometer probe in so that I could monitor the temperature in the bag. With outside temps in the 40s and low 50s, this kept the turkey between 30 and 40 degrees F as it thawed and freed up my refrigerator space. I did double bag the turkey to prevent leaks and mess.

The zipper is a little finicky and it might not hold up to the test of time, but for the price the quality is pretty good. I like how they fold flat.

We can frequently fit all of the shopping for the week for 2 people in these with room to spare (not just the cold items).
