There is no way to identify the animal. It may be a raccoon, rabbit or a hog. I have used the unit for about 36 hours in the field and am only able to identify an animal with supplemental light at 100 yards.",

The color palettes are amazing, it\u2019s not heavy, the battery life seems good thus far, etc. The ONLY limitation I can find thus far is the 240 does not have a zoom, but that wasn\u2019t worth an extra $500 to me in the first place.",
