      "text": "From June 2014: I like most everything about this tablet. The camera is so-so but that feature wasn't important to me. My chief complaint is that it is not picking up my WiFi unless I stand right by the router. It isn't the router bc our laptops and two other tablets (a Surface and a Kindle Fire) get the signal anywhere in the house. October 2014: I replaced the original unit in June. It has worked great and now I am experiencing the same issue as I did with the first unit. Frustrating. I really love this little tablet. Acer is having me send the unit to their TX repair service center.",

I get to use to entire remaining storage space after Android OS. This was an issue on my previous tablet where apps were running out of space because of small \"Apps\" partition. Even though I was able to move apps to SD, app installation could still be an issue if the \"Apps\" partition didn't have enough space during installation. Furthermore, Acer is truly showing commitment to supporting this device. The device received OTA KitKat upgrade 3 weeks ago.",

However,we bought one for another family member & theirs won't retain Wifi passwords. We are constantly having to sign that one back into the Wifi, very annoying! Also, I still can't figure how to get the main screen to show temperature in Fahrenheit instead of Celsius even though the setting is in Fahrenheit! One last annoying thing is the speakers are on the back instead of the front, so the sound isn't very good without external speakers. Other than that, can't complain, I'm very happy with mine.",

Eventually hope to be able to sync phone an laptop too. I'm just not technologically gifted so it takes time and so many different sign ons for everything!! Not necessary in my opinion. But I think I have the little tablet that can and I'm enjoying learning with it. Good investment for such as me.",

Figuring out the Android operating system is a learning curve. It gets the job done. I just wanted it for web browsing and portable movie watching. I put a bunch of movies into a microSD card and it works fine. I'm not dissatisfied with the product, I researched extensively before I bought it. I just wish it had a better battery.

      "text": "From day one the charging system has not worked properly. Having never had a tablet, I thought they all worked like that; however, this product is a dud - as time goes by the problem has gotten worse. It no longer charges above 57%. Even though it has a year warranty and that has not expired, I am not allowed to return it or get my money back. I am now stuck with a tablet that does not work. My advice - don't buy ACER.",

Recharging can be very slow, or not functional at all, and discharging can be disconcertingly fast. Sometimes the unit will discharge itself to nearly empty after only a few hours on standby.The battery issue means that you cannot be away very long from a wall outlet. A couple of hours of use and bang, the thing needs to go back onto the recharger.",

When I recieved the second one, all was well and this time it only took 1 wk. For it to stop charging exact same problem. I absolutly Loved the tablet was so disappointed that it didnt work long. It is very good quality if it would have only worked for longer than two weeks. Thankfully I was reimbursed both times no issues. Hope this helps!",

Then fully charge the tablet. Turn it on. Try to HARD REBOOT and then it freezes on the command system with it saying something about a argument with the request dealing with the system reboot/factory restore. I learned that your tablet can be in a argument with its self.........I still love the product. I just got a lemon I guess.",
