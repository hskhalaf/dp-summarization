It more or less turned itself inside out on far to many occasions over the course of our week long stay. The umbrella also failed to lock in the vertical position and had a slight tilt even when it was locked at vertical. The umbrella is not even close to being strong and durable as advertised. The quote unquote sturdy designed fiberglass ribs were no match for Atlantic shore summer breeze. Buyers beware!",

The only two issues I would comment on, and there really not a big deal, is that the strap on the carry bag is a little flimsy and I wished that the sand anchor was slightly longer. Other than that, it's a great umbrella for the price. Almost 1 year and minimal use (literally 8 uses) and this umbrella is completely broken. A small breeze on the beach and the entire thing blew inside out and every rib inside broke away from the material. This umbrella is now useless. Just a shame. I don't recommend this purchase",
