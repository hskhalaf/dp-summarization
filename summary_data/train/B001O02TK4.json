My regret is I should have bought the 10x10 model because we use camp cots. They are everage size cots and its really tight inside the tent. It would work great if there is just one cot. Point is just an odd size and no room If your using cots.",

Besides that, the tent really is a breeze to set up, all things considered. While it's easiest with two people, I believe that even one person could set it up, if they needed to.",

The price is that it is heavy, so won't be going on foot into back country (nor will I anymore, come to think of it). Anyhow, I love it. Be warned, though, that some people may want the larger versions, if they need tons of space. This is for 3 people and our gear, or 4 people and not much else.",

Aside from completely killing the grass underneath it, it withstood strong summer storms and never waivered or leaked. It is easy to set up and take down and very spacious inside. It cost a bit more than a typical tent and is heavy, but if you want space and durability at your campsite and can wrangle the weight (this is not a backpacking tent by any means), this is a fantastic tent. Highly recommended!",

Fit the 6 of us comfortably with plenty of extra space. We camped through a thunderstorm with no problems (thank goodness). I'm planning to buy a smaller version. It's well worth the money.",

We had a couple days of rain, never once got wet inside of tent.....a suggestion here....put awnings on both side of tent to help with air flow in downpours. During rain could only open non awning side a couple inches or else rain came in. Other than that would highly recommend this tent.",

There were a few drips from the roof and a small leak on one of the seams next to our air bed. We had a few good down pours on one day. So only to get a few leaks and not waterproof the tent is pretty good. I would recommend using their recommended waterproofing spray before your first outing with the tent. I would absolutely recommend this tent to anyone looking for a canvas tent.",

    "description": "Whether you\u2019re headed to the campground with your family, or elk camp with your hunting buddies, this rugged, all-season tent is well suited for the occasion. Made with premium grade, Hydra-Shield, 100% cotton duck canvas. The tight weave and silicone finish make the canvas watertight yet breathable, minimizing condensation and mugginess. Go ahead and touch the inside walls during a downpour\u2014this canvas will not wick water. The Flex-Bow frame has tempered, spring steel rods that keep the tent taut, and robust 1-inch steel tube poles that will hold up to fierce winds. The floor material is a puncture resistant, 13.5 oz vinyl with welded seams, that keeps water out. Easy, one-person setup takes only a few minutes after you have it staked out. The steep walls and 6\u20191\u201d high ceiling provide a roomy interior with stand-up, walk-around comfort. Large front and back doors with top rated #10 YKK zippers give convenient access. Four windows, and two vents allow ample air flow. Windows and vents have no-see-um screen mesh, keeping out the smallest bugs. A customizable gear organizer system offers plenty of places to stow gear. A large awning provides shade and a covered entry. Sturdy storage bags and hefty 12-inch steel stakes are included.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nWhether you're heading to the campground with the family or the elk camp with your hunting buddies, the rugged, all-season Kodiak Canvas Flex-Bow six-person tent is well suited to the occasion. The Flex-Bow tent is made of a superior, marine-grade, 100-percent cotton duck Hydra-Shield canvas. The custom-woven, treated canvas is ideal for tents, as the double-fill design is strong and durable, while the silicone, dry-finish treatment is watertight, breathable, and durable. As a result, campers will stay comfortable and dry even in a downpour. Unlike synthetic fabrics or canvas with a paraffin- or oil-based treatment, Kodiak's canvas allows water vapor to escape, minimizing condensation, humidity, and mugginess. Plus, you'll rarely--if ever--have to retreat Kodiak canvas. \n\n The Flex-Bow frame is every bit as strong, with 1-inch galvanized steel tubing and 3/8-inch Flex-Bow spring steel rods keeping the tent taut at all times. To further improve ventilation, the tent includes two funnel-flow vents that circulate air and assist with temperature management. And campers won't feel claustrophobic thanks to the tent's spacious 6-foot 6-inch ceiling height, two large D-shaped doors (front and back), and four large windows, all covered with no-see-um mesh. Other details include a 16-ounce, polyester-reinforced vinyl floor; a large 72-by-78-inch awning; a customizable gear loft and organizer pockets; and a handy strap-and-cinch storage bag. The Flex-Bow, which sets up easily with one person, is designed for year-round use, but isn't suitable for extreme winter mountaineering or heavy snow accumulations. \n\n \n\n\n\nThe Flex-Bow's spacious footprint sleeps up to 6 people. Specifications\n * Capacity: 6 people \n * Ceiling material: 10-ounce Hydra-Shield canvas \n * Wall material: 8.5-ounce Hydra-Shield canvas \n * Floor material: 16-ounce polyester-reinforced vinyl with welded seams \n * Frame: 1-inch galvanized steel tubing \n * Rods: 3/8-inch solid spring steel Flex-Bow rods \n * Tent dimensions: 10 by 10 feet \n * Ceiling height: 6 feet 6 inches \n * Pack weight: 68 pounds (includes stakes weighing 6.5 pounds total) \n * Pack size: 30 by 13 inches, with pole bundle measuring 50 inches long and 5.5 inches in diameter \n * Warranty: Limited lifetime warranty \n\n About Kodiak Canvas\nBorn in the ruggedness of the Rockies, Kodiak Canvas has quickly earned a reputation for making tough, long-lasting tents ideal for almost any camping scenario.
