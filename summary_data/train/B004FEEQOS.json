Kids preferred to play with toys that were more fun looking like fish, characters, cartoons, etc. These were surprisingly bulky and heavy also (not good for packing on flights). On the plus side, they have long handles and are easy for novice swimmers to grab onto. Kids learn so quickly and got the hang of it very fast. How soon after that do you think it takes them to move on to more fun toys and never look back...minutes.",

Last year she was intrigued by stuff under the water, but at our first swim this year, she was actually putting her ENTIRE HEAD under the water. I figured, what the heck, these were very inexpensive, and might provide her some entertainment for the remaining swims. Well, these things were a HOOT! She would retrieve them, and in fact, ended up showing several OTHER dogs how to do this as well! They were surprisingly durable, considering DOGS were grabbing them in their months! I would recommend, and will probably repurchase \"fresh\" ones for next season!",

So far they have held up great and we did not have a problem with the streamers breaking up after a summer of use.",

She is just learning to swim and this entices her to want to dip under (a difficulty many parents have experienced I'm sure). As for the durability? I haven't had them long enough to comment, but it seems that with some usage, the flaps will fall off, but that is also to be expected. I think this is a great item for youngsters learning to swim as it gets them excited to practice diving under water to grab them. Great price too.",
