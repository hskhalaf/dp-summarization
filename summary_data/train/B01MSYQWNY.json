Probably a bad chip. Crappy bluetooth sealed the deal, though as I was already unhappy with the bass response. I feel they may have cut some corners in the design. Had to return, not interested in another. I appreciate the other reviews offering some competing products.",

UPDATE ON RETURN: I was finally able to acquire a return label from AMAZON \"not\" JBL, JBL was of no use to me as far as returning defective product after speaking to them on the phone. I paid $74 for speaker and am getting a $59 credit for my troubles. Buyers beware, I guess I'm lucky to get anything back at all \"MERICA\"",

      "text": "I ordered the teal version for my wife as a mother's day gift because it's her favorite color and this speaker had generally favorable reviews. A lot of other portable speakers have unattractive designs or color options, but this hits the mark. Pairing via bluetooth was easy on an iPhone XR and Android phone. I have not tested the app, but it's not needed unless you want more advanced options or pairing multiple speakers. Speaking of, this speaker has the ability to connect to other JBL speakers to create a sort of surround sound environment. I'd highly recommend this speaker to anyone looking for one. Charges via micro usb and holds a charge for a long time.",

      "text": "It's a JBL speaker - it's freaken good! What more can I say. Update: so I put it in my oven so that it maximizes the bass, kinda like the same thing as when you put your smartphone in a cup or bowl to increase the bass and loudness... Well anyway I forgot it in the oven and turned my oven to 400... 10 minutes later I go back to open my oven cuz I wanted to leave it open at 400 for the heat .. and there was my JBL baking.. poor thing. But the magic is that it STILL WORKS PERFECTLY :) It didn't even melt at all!! It was hot af but it's just fine!!",

With the 1 sub on each end and the units internal speakers, it really produced some great sounds from a unit that is not much bigger then your hand. I have to say I am excited to buy another one to create the surround sound feature. For under 100$ you really are paying for the best speaker technology has to offer. GReat buy!",

That said if you take it outside or into a large room it tends to feel a little tinny at high volumes, but for it's size I think it's the best in this category aside from maybe a bose. Very happy.
