My face feels refreshed and my hair is softer than ever. Next time I will leave it on longer. I look forward to future uses bc I can just feel how healthy my hair is now.",

Requires patience, but it smells good and the result is softer, smoother skin, so worth the effort, in my opinion.",

The finely milled clay makes for a nice texture for application and it dries down into a hard shell (which I prefer to clays that dry down to a flexible, leather-like texture). What I like about this clay is that it cleans out your pores without making your face too dry. It will leave your skin bright red for a little while after you remove it, so don't put it on right before you plan to leave the house. You also get a ton of product, so unless you're applying daily, you should have enough for a very long time.",
