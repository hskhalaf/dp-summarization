They were easy to fill and use to decorate - even my 5-year-old niece had no problem squeezing the frosting out onto her cookies. I chose this set because of how many different tips were included, and that worked out really well. They make very pretty designs. I'm not a good decorator and grew up just spreading the buttercream on with a knife, so this was a big step up for me - my cookies never looked better! Looking forward to practicing more with them.",

The specialty grass tip was expensive by itself, so I was glad to find it in this kit where a bunch of other tips and piping bags were included too. The other tips were fun to play with, I was able to pipe some flowers and shells.",

Plus you get to try out all of the decorating tips (except for the two large ones - couplers will not work with those) on one piping bag and save piping bags that way. - Flower nail: Making roses is much easier on one of those and is something a beginner should have anyway, in my opinion. Wilton provides quality products. I definitely recommend.",
