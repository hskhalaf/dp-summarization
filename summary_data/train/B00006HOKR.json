It stopped scanning on the FM channel the first time I turned it off and then back on. And the next day it was stuck in headphone mode, so there\u2019s no audio from the internal speaker (despite the 3-way switch being in the correct position). I know Sangean makes quality products, I\u2019m guessing I just got a dud radio. Oh well.",

This radio gets excellent reception and the stereo sound is great even with my impaired hearing. But note that I replaced the included earphones with my Apple earphones, which provide much better sound. The electronic tuning works well, and I appreciate the lock switch, which prevents the controls from being activated accidentally. The size and weight of the radio is perfect for my shirt pocket. The batteries last a long time if you use the earphones. Overall, this is exactly what I was looking for.",

When a \"favorite\" station is entered so the listener can return quickly to a station that is regularly chosen, there is no way to remove that setting. So, if you chose not to listen to that station anymore or if you're in a different part of the country, you cannot delete the setting. After time, you have too many \"favorites\" selected for the feature to be of any value. Another problem: Unless a station's frequency is strong, that station is not heard clearly.",

The digital tuning & memory presets are useful, for quickly switching between stations. I power it with 2 x AA Eneloop rechargeable batteries, and no problems so far. My only complaint is that you have to read the instruction manual carefully, because the buttons/controls aren't intuitively labeled. For example, the memory set button is called \"Memo\", but the memory tuning button is called \"My Favorites\". Consistent labels & terms - like \"Memory\" & \"Memory Tuning\" - would have made more sense.",

I listen mostly with earbuds, but the built-in speaker comes in handy sometimes, especially for sharing with another listener. Nice sound, and pulls in the stations very well. I particulary like the \"lock\" feature, which prevents you from changing the station accidentally while moving around. The radio is a tad heavier than I expected, but that's a reasonable tradeoff for the high quality. The unit automaticlly turns off after 90 minutes unless you choose to defeat this feature. Great for falling asleep and saving battery life. Recommended.",

Now, when he walks around the house he has the radio attached to his pocket because the station never fades in and out. Also, he has taken the radio with him when we have gone farther from home and his station. Usually the station would not come in at all. This time it did and it was crystal clear. The lock botton is also an added feature that keeps the radio tuned to our favorite station. This is a wonderful radio and I have ordered me my own.",

I find I need the aerial wire to get certain stations, but overall not a problem. I like the 90 min time out feature. I have not had to change batteries yet. The instructions were a little cryptic, but adeqwuate. Everything appears to work as advertised. I have not used the TV audio feature. Depending on your needs, this is a great general purpose AM/FM pocket radio that is well constructed.",

Keep up-to-date on the latest news, weather, traffic, sports scores, and much more with this ultra-portable pocket radio from Sangean.\n\nPOCKET-SIZED\nThe DT-200X is a small PLL-synthesized AM/FM stereo radio that's small enough to fit in a shirt or jacket pocket, and powerful enough to pull in those distant AM/FM stations. It measures a mere 2.5 by 4.2 by 1.2 inches, and weighs only 3.8 ounces, making it portable enough to take anywhere.\n\n\n\nPortable enough to take anywhere\n\nBIG FEATURES\nYou get 19 memory presets (and auto scan), plus a My Favorite Stations feature to help you zip right to preferred stations. The radio comes with stereo earbuds and a removable belt clip, as well as a trailing antenna. A stereo-mono switch improves reception when needed, and the built-in speaker affords headphones-free listening.\n\nWith Phase Loop Lock Digital Tuning and Sangean's traditional radio sensitivity, built-in speaker and included earbuds, you will be able to enjoy your morning jog, your short trip to the beach, or other outing without missing your favorite AM/FM station if you have the DT-200X pocket radio.\n\nBATTERY POWERED WITH AUTO SHUT-OFF\nThe Sangean DT-200X runs on two AA batteries (not included). A low-battery indicator on the LCD display offers a helpful hint on when it's wise to carry replacements. 90-minute auto shut-off lets you fall asleep to the radio without fear of waking up to dead batteries.",
