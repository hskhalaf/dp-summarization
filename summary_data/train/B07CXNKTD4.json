I left one in water too long and some of the finish came off. Still very usable but not as pretty.",

It is very delicate and fine and it would be good for serving or even using to eat, though it is large for that. I am well pleased with them. I recommend this product.",

They literally feel like Styrofoam painted over with wood stain. A common household metal spoon weighs more than this. I can assure that on a windy day this spoon would definitely fly away....like a turd...in the wind... The wooden stain also fades when washing not sure if these are just for decor??
