Had to shorten the hollow bolts in order to pass thru the narrower housing. *** Amps *** Will too often trip 15A. Waste of time. Migrated to 20A, but trips were not uncommon even at that level. *** Performance *** 40 feet of 4\" slab. Took about two hours. No faults other than the breaker trips. Much lighter than my gas saw.",

The saw does need a break every now and then to cool down. It does trip the 20 amp breaker when its getting close to over heating. Let it rest a few minutes when it gets warm and you wont have the breaker issue. If you want a saw that doesn't need the cool down break then spend the 900$ for a Makita. If this is only being used for small projects it's fantastic. Would buy again.",

It is cheaper to buy this than renting one for two days. Around here they rent for $75 per day and then charge you $100 for a new blade. Speaking of blades.......the $25 one that comes with this saw (can be bought separately on Amazon) is fantastic. No need for a $100 blade. If you only need the saw of a one day project just order this blade and rent the saw. I am very glad I bought this!!!!!!!!",

(it is rated at 15 amps). perhaps I am over working the tool. another issue is that the tool blade guard accumulates the debris and has to be cleaned out (wet or dry cutting). this has actually stalled the motor. however it is a very solidly built tool and I am expecting it will last to the end of my project.",

In 2 days I ran it about 5-6 hours from a 4k generator using a 20A rated extension cord. It cuts pretty well with new blades on. Once the saw heats up, the blade gets hot and its operator gets tired performance is greatly reduced. Gotta give time for the blade to cool off. Also even without binding the blade and not even pushing the saw into the cut it starts choking my 4K generator and saw looses power. it may not be designed for such abusive operation. Over all if I can complete this project with it it'll pay for itself.",
