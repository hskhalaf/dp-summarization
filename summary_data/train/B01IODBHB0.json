My mother is in a wheel chair from a stroke and the doctor told her that her feet needed some air so I had been looking for shoes for her. My mother has problems with her feet which makes it difficult to find shoes to fit. Since her illness her left foot is bigger than the right so she needs an adjustable therapeutic shoe. Most of the therapeutic shoes she doesn't like or they are too expensive so I got these and she liked them.",
