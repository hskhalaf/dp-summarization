I froze most of the package since it required refrigeration and I could not imagine a kitten managing his way through this bag in 2 weeks time. Side note - kitten does not enjoy them cold, so straight from the fridge is not ideal (he eats his regular wet food cold since we have to refrigerate the can portions, so not sure what the problem is).",
