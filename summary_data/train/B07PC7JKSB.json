No of course they\u2019re not as good as over the ear head phones, but in this arena they are the only choice. Real Rx sunglasses frames cost more than $200 and don\u2019t have the advanced electronics of these.",

After a year and a half they have simply quit working. They won\u2019t take a charge. I tried going onto Bose\u2019s website...basically useless.

If they are only going to last a couple hours, the case should charge them while I'm having lunch or in a meeting. Also, really? Another cable that doesn't work for anything else?! C'mon.

The sound quality is Bose at their best and the volume has to be high for it to be heard by others. My only complaint is the lenses aren't the best but you can upgrade and order interchangeable lenses.",

These items could be a good improvement for me and I hope Bose can do something with software to include these options.",
