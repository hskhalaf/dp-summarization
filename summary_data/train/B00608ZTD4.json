      "text": "I used a friend's DeWalt joiner for a while before ordering my own and they are pretty comparable. This joiner is a little heavier, but feels more powerful. The only two things that I'd say I liked better about the DeWalt was 1) the trigger is more ergonomic on the DeWalt - second nature vs. having to move your hand a bit and 2) the DeWalt doesn't walk down the board as much as this one does. Just make sure you've got a solid hold on the wood and the joiner - you'll be fine. If I had to buy again, I'd go either way - really I'd base my decision on price.",

My only complaint is that it does NOT cut a '0' (zero) sized biscuit and I have recently had two situations where I could have used a unit that did; 1/2 inch Baltic birch. The build quality is very good and dust collection was pretty good. Perhaps a very small annoyance was the balance and lack of forward handle to keep it firmly against the edge of the piece being cut.",

(l) it runs quieter (2) the brushes are inside the motor housing making it easier to grip (3) the slide rods are chromed and slide a lot easier with less dust accumulation and (4) the depth adjust knob is a lot easier to read.

I still buy Dewalt and Milwaukee when they're cheaper and ergonomics aren't a factor, for everything else, it's Makita.",

Dust collecting spout is falling out. The dust exhaust window was easily plugged with the oak shavings. Need to clean the dust bag after 2-3 slots or connect the vaccum with a good suction. The offset scale on the plate is way too coarse to use as a reference and is misaligned. So the it is pretty much useless. Plastic adapter is a junk.",
