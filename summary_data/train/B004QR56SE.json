Since all the zone 2 and set up menu is done on the TV screen it makes it pretty well impossible to set the receiver. I've been reading it's a problem with this unit that circuitboard for the HDMI goes out and it cost more than the receiver is worth. It's a shame because it still a perfect receiver just about useless though for my needs.",

And OMG, iTunes match with AppleTV made even connecting an iPod/iPhone irrelevant unless friends bring over their own music. The iPod interface DOES require that you use a TV to control your music when using the standard USB cable interface (not mentioned in any specs I read before purchasing). I do not know how the YDS-12 dock from Yamaha functions. Tiny little buttons on the remote but you can see that in the picture of the unit.",

THANK YOU YAMAHA and Amazon [please go back to tax free]!",

Network Receiver. iPhone/Android app compatibility.Power Requirements: 120V AC 60 Hz.2-Year Yamaha Limited Parts and Labor Warranty.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nThe Yamaha RX-V671 7.1-Channel Audio/Video Receiver offers many advanced home theater features including 6-in/1-out HDMI with 3D and Audio Return Channel compatibility, HD Audio, and SCENE function. Bring movies and music to life with 7.1 channels of pure surround sound. The RX-V671 adds the power of intelligent front presence effects to your multichannel audio. Combined with Yamaha's advanced exclusive technologies such as CINEMA DSP and Adaptive Dynamic Range Control, you can enjoy the most immersive audio experience yet from your favorite entertainment. Use the included mic and Yamaha's YPAO Optimization setup wizard to make setting up your 7.1-channel system easy.\n\nAmplifier flexibility is also a key feature of the RX-V671. You can add a second 2-channel stereo audio zone (Zone 2). Or, if you don't have a 7.1 speaker system, the receiver can be bi-amped to a pair of main front speakers.\n\nFront panel USB Digital Connection for your iPhone and iPod\nUse the on-screen GUI to make speaker set-up even easier. View larger\nSix HDMI inputs supporting the latest technologies and Network Control. View larger\nEnhance source video while up-scaling to 1080p with Adaptive Video Scaling. View larger USB DIGITAL CONNECTION FOR IPHONE AND IPOD ON THE FRONT PANEL \nA USB port on the front panel provides convenient connection for your iPhone/iPod, which also charges when connected. Because the digital signal from the iPhone/iPod is transmitted directly to the AV Receiver, noise interference is minimized and sound quality is iPhone/iPod much better.\n\nUse the AV Controller app and enjoy internet music streaming. View App Screens\nEnjoy the effects of CINEMA DSP surround sound without the surround speakers\nAdvanced technologies make the RX-V671 the center of your home theater. View larger USE IN A HOME NETWORK FOR MORE MUSIC, EASY CONTROL\nThis AV Receiver can be the control center of a home entertainment network connected to the internet. You can use the AV Controller app for control from an iPhone, etc., and enjoy music streaming from Pandora, Napster, Rhapsody and Sirius Internet Radio. It's also Windows 7 and DLNA 1.5 certified which allows access to music files on any computer or local NAS drive content available on your home network\n\nIPHONE AV CONTROLLER APP\nThis AV Controller App will turn your iPhone/iPod touch/iPad into a Wi-Fi enabled remote control for the RX-V671. This App provides the flexibility to control input, volume, mute and power commands. You can browse content from all internally available sources such as Internet Radio, USB and AM/FM tuners. You can also control all AV Receiver zones such as powering on and changing input for each zone. It's great to have all this control at your fingertips.\n\nON-SCREEN ADVANCED GUI (GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE)\nYamaha's latest Graphical User Interface has a high resolution display with clear, easy-to-use menus and also includes a selectable Status Bar that shows input source, volume level, DSP mode and audio format.\n\n1080P-COMPATIBLE HDMI WITH 3D AND AUDIO RETURN CHANNEL\nImprove your home cinema experience with 105 watts per channel of powerful 7.1-channel surround sound, with the latest HD Audio format decoding: Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio, Dolby Digital Plus, and DTS-HD High Resolution Audio. The 1080p-compatible HDMI (6 in/1 out) supports Deep Color (30/36 bit), x.v.Color, 24 Hz Refresh Rate and Auto Lip-Sync compensation, as well as the latest HDMI features like 3D and Audio Return Channel.\n\nCINEMA DSP DIGITAL FOR ENHANCED SURROUND REALISM\nConventional multi-channel audio reproduction systems base their sound on Dolby Digital and DTS decoding, using matrix and steering technologies to create surround sound effects. Yamaha CINEMA DSP is much more advanced, actually creating richly realized independent sound fields that envelop you in an unmatched surround sound experience. With dialogue, music and effects ideally located in these separate sound fields, you will hear sound with accurate placement, smooth movement, exceptional clarity and richness, and startlingly realistic presence. It will seem as if the walls of your room have disappeared and you are in the middle of your own immense theater.\n\nSILENT CINEMA AND VIRTUAL CINEMA DSP\nSILENT CINEMA, a variation of Yamaha's CINEMA DSP technology, makes it possible to listen in private to movies and other multi-channel sources for hours without listening fatigue. Virtual CINEMA DSP lets you enjoy the effects of CINEMA DSP surround sound without using surround speakers (handy for use in custom installations where some rooms don't have surround speakers). It can be used with the front / center / presence speakers or even with just the two front left and right speakers.\n\nADAPTIVE DRC (DYNAMIC RANGE CONTROL)\nYamaha's Adaptive DRC technology automatically adjusts the dynamic range of the sound according to the volume that is selected. Adaptive DRC refines the dynamic range parameters to make low volume sounds easier to hear (narrower dynamic range) while retaining the massiveness felt during high volume (wider dynamic range). And because our ears lose sensitivity to low and high sounds as volume decreases, it continually adjusts these frequency ranges according to the volume and to the input signal level.\n\nCOMPRESSED MUSIC ENHANCER REFRESHES YOUR MUSIC\nYamaha employs sophisticated digital signal processing with exclusive algorithms to enable playback that improves the performance of compressed music formats, including MP3 and WMA. With the Compressed Music Enhancer, highs and especially lows are richer and smoother, bringing music back to life to be as close to the original as possible.\n\nSCENE: A NEW LEVEL OF OPERATING EASE\nFour SCENE buttons make operating the receiver easier than ever. They are initially set to default settings for DVD Viewing, Disc Listening, TV Viewing and Radio Listening. Push a SCENE button to automatically launch play of the preset source. Other SCENE settings are also available, such as iPod Listening, XM Listening, TV Sports Viewing and Action Game Playing. Browse and select the settings quickly accomplished by rotating the Input knob and watching the on-screen display. The settings can be selected for one-time use, or they can replace the original default settings. You can even change the SCENE names for convenience.\n\nAUDIO DELAY COMPENSATION KEEPS YOUR EXPERIENCE ON TRACK\nThe latest display devices perform complex internal processing, causing time lag in the video signal. It is a small difference, but because the audio arrives first, the viewer may feel that something is not natural. The Audio Delay function for adjusting Lip-Sync matches the audio to the timing of the output of the video on the screen (0-240ms).\n\nIncluded microphone designed for YPAO helps you easily set up your speaker system YPAO SOUND OPTIMIZATION\nYPAO sound optimization for automatic speaker setup lets you set up your surround sound speakers simply and easily. An included microphone designed for YPAO will help you set up your speakers for optimal performance, no matter the room.\n\n\nAuto Power Down after 4, 8 or 12 hours (selectable) and extremely low power consumption.\n\nEXPAND YOUR YAMAHA SYSTEM WITH CONVENIENT CONNECTIVITY\nThe optional YDS-12 Universal Dock lets you connect your iPod or iPhone to the receiver. And the YDS-12 is \"Works with iPhone\"-certified, so you can get the most out of your iPhone music library with zero hassles.\n\nThe optional YID-W10 Wireless Dock System for iPod/iPhone ensures that you enjoy maximum sound quality and no lip sync (AV matching) problems.\n\nThe optional YBA-10 Bluetooth Wireless Audio Receiver docks to the receiver and supports A2DP stereo audio streaming, so users can enjoy music wirelessly from Bluetooth-enabled smartphones, Windows PCs, and Macs.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\n * Power Output: 105W x 7 Banana-plug Compatible\n * Frequency Response: 10Hz - 100kHz +0,-3dB\n * Total Harmonic Distortion: 0.06%\n * Signal-to-Noise Ratio: 98dB\n * Standby Power Consumption (HDMI Off, Standby Through Off): 0.1W\n * Dimensions (WxHxD): 17-1/8\" x 6-3/8\" x 14-1/4\"\n * Weight: 23.1 lbs\n\nWHICH RX-V SERIES RECEIVER IS RIGHT FOR YOU?\n\nRX-V371 \nRX-V471 \nRX-V571 \nRX-V671 Power Output 100W x 5 105W x 5 105W x 7 105W x 7 HDMI Inputs 4 4 6 6 Front iPod Connection Graphic User Interface (GUI) Video Up-conversion Versatile Zone Control Network Control\n(Incl.
