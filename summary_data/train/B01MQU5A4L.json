They don't blend too well in my opinion and they just don't have that nice, smooth feeling like some other pencils have. The colors are decently pigmented and the pencils themselves feel odd in my hand because they are a larger diameter than all of the other pencils I have used. Overall these are decent pencils and a step above say Cra-Z-Art or Crayola but definitely not the best.",
