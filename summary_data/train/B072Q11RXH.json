However at full retail price they are a good, but average cycling shoe. If I could give half stars I would say these are 3.5, not bad, but not great. These are geared for casual cyclists, or cyclists who want a casual look. On that note they hit the mark, walking in them is easy, they look like normal shoes. They are also lighter than other casual SPD style shoes. However if I had to pay full price... there are better options for less then the $110 price tag.",
