We usually buy one of these every 4-5 years after we've run the other one into the ground. We already shoved some heavy camping gear on top of this and crushed a leg. No worries. Just pulled it back into position with a bit of elbow grease and its good as new again. We always come back to these little Webers when we abuse the last one a bit too much so we'll be back again.",

      "text": "Works well, and the charcoal dies out quickly when you close the top and bottom vents. You can grill chicken on this unit if you leave the lid on while cooking. If you want to grill steaks or burgers it's better to keep the lid off in order to get a nice hot fire while cooking. Works great for roasting marshmallows too. The size makes it just right for sitting atop the grate on those old school park grills. This unit is very portable and the lid can be secured to the bottom with a bungee cord and clasping underneath.",

I would recommend this grill to anyone looking to start out or with minimal storage.",

Can easily BBQ 6 burgers or 4-5 large chicken breasts, so it serves well for small parties or small families. Space constraints? This Smokey Joe will make you NOT miss the big Kettle as much.",
