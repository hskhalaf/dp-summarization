Different brands seem to work better with different dimmers, even if they're all specified for CFL/LED bulbs. They were very helpful in working with me, and they refused to give up until I had a bulb/dimmer combo that worked and that I was happy with. That's far more than I can say for most companies, especially a light bulb company. I would definitely recommend them on that fact alone, but if you get dimmable bulbs just make sure you have one of their specified dimmers and you probably won't have any issues anyway.",

I'd say they go down to about 30%, nowhere near the 10% that some other LEDS go to (even with old dimmers).

I realize that color perception is a personal thing, and it's no surprise that the buying public apparently has 'spoken' to the LED bulb manufacturers regarding their preference for LED bulbs with a golden yellow (2700 Kelvin) appearance. But I prefer lights with a more accurate color , particularly important when the LED is 'dimmed.' These bulbs are being utilized in wall sconces that we frequently set at less than full brightness (e.g. low room lighting for watching TV at night), and we're much happier with their more natural color while dimmed.",

I tested them side by side in a kitchen light fixture and noticed they did not dim as low as the other brand but since these are not destined for a dimmable lamp, that doesn't bother me. What I do like is the quality of the light. At 3000k, it's bright but not overly yellow or blue. Colors in the room appear more vivid. It's also good to know Hyperikon has great customer service and stands behind their products.",
