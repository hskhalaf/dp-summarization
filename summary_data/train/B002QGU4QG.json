I'm a beginner player and I wanted a good sounding guitar and yet I didn't want to play on an instrument that would be a discouragement. I'm sold on Cordoba and will be buying a higher priced/quality one for my next guitar. If you can afford more money than I would buy the next few steps up than this one, but it is a great guitar.",

It's easy to hold, easy to play (even with my very old fingers), and sounds great. I'm very pleased with the low-gloss finish on this model. The colors of the wood are darker than they appear in the photo's, but it's still a beauty. No surprise, new guitar strings stretch. Clip on your Snark and give it a tune before playing. It's quick and easy to do. Although it sounds like it, I have no connection with Cordoba other than now owning one of their guitars.",

The only thing that comes close to con is it seems to go slightly out of tune much more quickly than my electric guitar, so I have to tune it a lot, but I suppose that gives me even more practice since I am only a beginner still learning the ways of the guitar. The soft feel to the nylon strings are very different from my electric guitar's steel strings, but I am getting used to it. So far, I am happy with this guitar and love the sound that it produces.",

The tuners feel very smooth and tuning is easy. The action is more than acceptable to me, no buzzing issues, clean warm sound.",

I got this guitar because of the glowing reviews and now owning it as well as playing it for 5-6 months, gives me better perspective to review this product. For the price, this classical guitar produces phenomenal sound. I've played other classical guitars before at my local Guitar Center and this one is comparable to other more pricier classical guitars in terms of sound. The sound gets better as you play more so I think the wood ages well with time. Overall, for the price, this is a great guitar that you can purchase.",

Ordered a different new guitar from amazon and it was in used condition so I looked really hard at this guitar and discovered finish imperfections that look like finger prints or popped bubbles in the matte finish at the neck joint. I will never buy a guitar online again. Plays really good and I like this guitar very much.",

I can't say that I can rate the guitar all that much just because I don't believe it was sold in \"very good\" condition. They didn't send me the saddle and when they did it came broken. To top it off the nut wasn't even on. I HAD TO GLUE IT ON! Per the guitar though....it seems good enough for me. I would recommend in the buck fifty range maybe 2 because of the truss rod (love the truss rod). Buy it if you can find it 2 or less.",

I wouldn't recomend this to anyone with small hands and you have to keep the Humdity at 55%, here in East Texas in the summer with the air conditioner running at 72 degrees the humidity is 70% in the house.
