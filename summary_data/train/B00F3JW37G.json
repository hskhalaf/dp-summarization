Made sense to just get this deal since it's only a minor facelift on the new edition. I highly recommend this. Expect to replace your tv speakers with a soundbar but don't expect a full on home theatre with bass and whatnot. It does sound a WHOLE LOT better than the tv speakers. This klipsch sb 120 also offers some bass to the room, but just not powerful. This is okay and what I expected because the whole main reason was to replace the tv speakers. Cant go wrong with a Klipsch quality sound and product.",

Always turning to volume up and Down to compensate for unbalanced sound tracks and TV commercials. Speech comes through okay and overall sound, especially with music is fine. Would not have purchased if I had realized the limited number of inputs. Have already purchased an optical switcher, an analog switcher and a universal remote to help the system function more smoothly. The Klipsh is the only component that is difficult to work with my Harmony Universal Remote. I own a Yamaha sound bar that far exceeds the Klipsh in quality; however, at a much higher price.",

My only other complaint is that I have not been able to sync the volume control to my Samsung remotes. It's plenty loud for our average sized den with a ten foot ceiling.

Even turning the bass up the the highest level it is extremely faint. If I could go back I would have purchased a soundbar with a seperate subwoofer. A simple solution would be if the unit had a seperate subwoofer output where you could attach a powered subwoofer. If bass isn't an issue for you then I would recommend it.",

Forget the little clicker, just turn your TV speakers off and your TV or SAT remote controls the volume, mute, etc. It will crank when you want it with ease. One tip, choose your input cable, either optical or RCA, but do not leave both plugged into the unit. If you do, the unit gets confused and will not turn on automatically when you turn the TV on. It took me hours to figure that out. Once I removed the non used RCA jacks, bingo, works perfectly. Highly recommended, especially when it was going for $249!",

What's interesting is that I didn't realize how amazing the sound quality is until I started playing music. Of course, it makes my movies more dramatic, but the songs that come out are so crisp. I sat in front of it, just listening to music for half an hour and could hear background instruments that I'd never picked up on before. It's a hefty piece of equipment, but if you want to get a quality soundbar without paying absurd amounts of money, this is the way to go.",
