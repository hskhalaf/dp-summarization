I can't use any deodorant because there's an open wound on my armpit and when the skin sticks because there's no deodorant, it rips whatever's healed back open. Save yourself the LITERAL pain and do not purchase.",

It says it can also work in water but to not submerge it. Needs 2 AAA batteries (not included) and is about as loud as an electric toothbrush. I\u2019ll update later after I try it on my legs and in the shower to see if that changes how well it works.",

I'm not ready for her to use razors with sharp blades so this was a perfect compromise. If you're looking for a discrete shaver for yourself or a first time razor for your pre-teen, this one is it!",

Of course a manual hand razor gives a smoother shave, but this little hand held shaver can be used in a pinch and for touch ups. I'm very happy with it.
