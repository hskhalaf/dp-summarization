Once you've got the tire on the wheel, get a 5-gallon bucket and do this: 1) Put a thick, sticky tape on the rim of a 5 gallon bucket. I used gorilla tape (see picture). 2). Tape off the wheel hub so air can't flow through. 3). Place the tire and wheel on top of the 5 gallon bucket 4). Stand on the wheel hub while inflating the tire! Pressing the tire against the tape on the bucket will create a seal. Pretty soon the bead will set and you can inflate the tire to the correct pressure.",

If your tire is old and dried out you will have to cut it off the rim. then you will have to figure out how to heat the tire to get it installed on the new rim, because no tire shop installer can install a tire on a rim this small. THEN you will have to take the tire to another tire shop that has an industrial air compressor because no civilian air compressor has enough pressure to set the bead even if you manage to get it to inflate.",
