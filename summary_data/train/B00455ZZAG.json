Unit that is broken then will be returned. Contacted me within 3 hours to advise of new shipment. Outstanding customer service, moved my previous eval from 2 to 5 stars.

I only use this product a few times a month, so it really should have held up longer. It is too late to return this so I want to warn others who are considering buying this to think twice.

The pourer without the black stopper tip is useless, but I can find no way to contact the company to request a new one. Just be careful when you remove the stopper. UPDATE: I found a number for customer service and they answered promptly. They took my information and today I received a new stopper/pourer in the mail. That's great customer service!",

I LOVE that there are NO batteries involved and after opening about a dozen bottles, it still appears to have enough juice to open a dozen or more.

I will say the cork motor the is a little underpowered, mixed with the cheap feel, on some bottles we thought it was going to quit or come apart. That stated for the money, it's not a bad buy for the seasonal or occasional sipper. However, if you are a bottle a week or high hosting family I'd recommend spending a little more to get an opener with improvements in the mentioned areas.",

Easily releases the cork as well. You will wish there were multiple bottles lines up needing opening when you first get it - so fun!

To the specifics, it says it opens 40 bottles of wine before needing charging again, I just know that out of the box, it opened one without any charging. Love this device.",

If it does last longer, I will come back and update it. I will do so yearly.",

Once removed you reverse the screw and the cork pops right off. VERY STYLISH and we leave it on our granite counters as decor.

I emailed the company directly and they courteously and promptly sent a replacement. This one only worked a couple weeks then the same thing happened... once again emailed the company and they are sending another replacement. Hoping we get it right this time. Ozeri honors their 1 year warranty fully and impressively. Word to the wise do NOT try any electronic openers on artificial / plastic corks its far too much strain on them... just know this from years past.",

Anything that makes it easier to get that glass of wine is a hero in my book! :-)",

I find that being able to see the cork coming out as you're using it allows for easy use and is a real crowd pleaser (along with the cool blue light). The foil cutter is also a hidden gem that seems to be quite simple and easy to use. One charge lasts a really long time. It's one of the best purchases I've made on Amazon. Cheers!",
