I was having a hard time trying to find a kitchen that would be big enough for our 5 yr old. This set is the perfect height and size, even my husband enjoys playing at it with our son! Christmas morning was a huge success! We unfortunately did receive a broken piece within the set that will hopefully get replaced by the manufacturer. I have not reached out to them yet. One of the handles could not be screwed on properly because of the broken piece. Minor issue, but will need to be addressed.",

The stove top has a blender and popcorn maker than when you put on the stove pops the popcorn (which is so funny to a little one) and the blender spins the inside in circles just like a true blender.",
