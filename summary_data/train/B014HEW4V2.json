I really with there was some instructions and that it was tied this way. I am completely in agreement it is my fault but I think they should add some zip ties and also some instructions.",

Worthless now and didn't have the time to figure out what went wrong. I immediately grabbed my real Danforth anchor and deployed that instead. Also of note is that the foam floater promptly got ripped apart by the rope as it came set up. You will want to redo the line routing so that it doesn't loop on itself or get a real pvc float. If it hasn't fallen apart, it would have gotten a 4 star rating from me.",

We sat in our kayak for quite some time just enjoying the water and the sun, and all the while we remained in place! This will be great if I want to go kayak fishing and stay in place. A great buy in my opinion.",

I used this anchor for beach trips tie down my oversized floats (unicorn, flamingo... you\u2019ve seen them on amazon and other sites for sure...) so you can lie on them and not get carried away by the tide.

It won't stay put so I have no use for it. It's also starting to rust on the hinges after being in the water only twice- this is surprising because it's supposedly galvanized underneath.
