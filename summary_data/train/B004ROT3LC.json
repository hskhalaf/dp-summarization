You can go out a buy a ultra quite cycle ops trainer for a heck of a lot more money but i dont see the point if you are only using this during the winter months to stay in shape in cycling season come back around again.

Not comfortable for pedaling hard There is a guard around the contact area for the tire which rubs really bad with mountain biking tires inflated to anything under 1,000psi.

Local bike shop had extra rear axles that fit the trainer for under 10 dollars. It is just a generic quick release rear axle. Both our bikes came with a nicer rear axle which did not fit the trainer but this appears to be common even with the expensive brands. Get a front wheel block of some kind.",

They added one or two nuts to each end of the back tire's rod. Set up was then extremely simple. One note - be sure to use a level to verify the stability of the unit. Our basement floor is NOT level so additional carpet pieces were needed on one side of the trainer. I highly recommend this trainer if your circumstances are similar.",

Just make sure you turn when you turn your stereo to what you think is going to be \"loud enough\" .... crank it up even louder. Unless you have earbuds. Then you will alright.

Buy yourself a slick road tire or \"home trainer tire\" and you shouldn't have any noise complaints.

I'm sure with a different magnet design, the developers could decrease the noise, but it is far cheaper than purchasing an exercise bike or other exercise equipment, so I will take the noise over the cost.",

Since then i have gotten myself another trainer which was about double the price but the difference in noise and vibrations is worth it Overall ok for low speed spins on a budget but nothing else.",
