The fist day I wore them I was on my feet for 11 hours and could not believe my feet felt so good! Huge bonus that they are super cute as well. AND they are waterproof. Perfect for a wet fall and snowy winter.",

      "text": "These are great boots, but definitely order up 1/2 size. They are very narrow in the toe box region, but going up a 1/2 size took care of this. During the coldest days this winter in Ohio, as in below 30 degrees, they were not warm without wool or lambs wool socks, and even then, not for long. They are water resistant, however, and extremely comfortable. Good in snow as long as it isn't slushy or icy. I try to walk outside every day except in the extreme cold, so I just walked down the street instead of on the sidewalks. Our street has very little sidewalk anyway. Hope this helps someone!",

      "text": "A little on the narrow side, just like most Keds, but I knew the might be so went a half size larger and the fit is good. They are also a lot more comfortable than I remember Keds being....not that they weren't comfortable before, but these have some sort of extra squishy, marshmallow insoles that make them feel like I'm walking on fluffy little kittens. The suede is good quality, soft suede and seems like it will stand the test of time, especially with the Scotchgarde treatment. I would recommend these.",

The shoe/bootie is very comfortable and easy to slip on quickly when the dog tells me he wants to go out. In the rain they are indispensable. The fabric used is a velour of some kind that has worn very well and after six months of regular use still looks quite new. I love Kids and couldn't be more pleased with the new fashion look to some of the shoes.",
