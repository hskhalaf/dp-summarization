Our magnet broke the moment we got the kit, it was so brittle. The compass is useless, except to show that it reacts to magnets, which I suppose is it's purpose. As a homeschooling family I found the booklet to be lacking lots of information and did not meet my expectations for what projects we could do. You can easily create a similar kit with better products that will last a lot longer and are more fascinating.",

But I think for the price, it could have included a few more accessories besides the magnets themselves to sustain interest.",
