During its first use and while pouring the second glass of red wine, there was a cracking noise---------- a hairline circumferential crack developed in the neck about 1-1 1/2 inches from the top. Initially it was about 70% around the neck but after standing overnight the crack is completely around the neck. Amazon promptly handled the refund.",

Plus they are both in my bar at home, so no unncessary unitaskers. There are a lot of things around the house that will accomplish the same thing - a vase maybe?",
