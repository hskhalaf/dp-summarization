I think it's because the pipe connecting the suction motor to the pipe that the handle uses is such a cheap plastic that it jams and doesn't transition from Upright vacuum to suction handle. Therefore, I can only use this for carpet, and can't use the tool itself. Trying to call Dirt Devil support is useless and they rarely ever answers. When you do get someone the call magically \"disconnects\" when you start explaining your problems or they just suggest you spent 100$ shipping an 80$ vacuum back for service that can take up to 6 weeks to get back.",

I thought,what the heck,i'll give it a shot. Got it today.Unlike some amazon buyers,i did not have any issues with it.Works great! Now,i vacuumed a couple days ago and couldn't believe how much stuff was coming up.The canister was filling up pretty fast. I swear to god the rug in my kitchen got brighter! Newer.Yeah, i'm glad i didn't get the other brand. Paid around $90 and some change.",

My carpet has never felt cleaner, it definetly gets pet hair up, & it works well on my laminate floors too. It's super easy to maneuver. Of course it makes noise because it's a vacuum but it's not overly loud & just does such a good job. So far I am super happy with this purchase.",

Literally half the canister was hair by the time I was done. It was also super easy to empty, and the long suction attachment was very helpful in vacuuming under the bed. Updated after some time: still a great vacuum despite us not using it a ton anymore. We ended up being gifted a robot vacuum so we use that. I do occasionally still use this for deep cleans and areas that the robot can't get to. Honestly no problems to report.",

So brush will not turn and they want me to drive FORTY miles to a repair shop so THEY can verify that it is broke and THEN dirt devil will then consider if it warrants a replacement vacuum...good product otherwise but call and verify before you consider this one!",
