That product was worth endorsing, it was thick enough, wonderful clean scent and was terrific for my dogs coat and skin. Don't know what happened but I'am suspicious of the distributor 'Pet Wholesalers', with suspicious advertisement of discounts on multiple sites and Facebook. This was not the original product I bought from Amazon, Looks like the same bottle but it is a different product. Its thin, and will not last as long. Does not have the same scent either. Ok can I have my favorite dog shampoo back!!!! Whose is messing with the formula....",

    "description": "Soothe \n\nIf you\u2019ve ever had a bout of poison ivy or a serious sunburn, you know just how irritating and itchy your skin can be. \n\nYou also know the immense relief Aloe Vera can bring. \n\nGive your pet the same relief with Oatmeal Aloe Vera Pet Shampoo from Nootie. \n\nOur non-soap formula promises to bring your pet relief on contact without the need for harsh chemicals that can cause more problems than they solve. \n\nPlus, the deodorizing effects of Ordenone combined with Oatmeal and Coconut Oil create a nice, mellow fragrance that won\u2019t overpower your pet\u2019s sensitive nose. \n\nLather, Rinse, Relieve: Relief from your pet\u2019s constant itching is just minutes away. Simply wet your pet\u2019s coat thoroughly, lather up and massage the shampoo into the coat, then rinse thoroughly. The Aloe will go to work right away, and you should see a vast improvement in behavior. \n\nNo Strong Odor: Dogs in particular don\u2019t like it when all of a sudden they don\u2019t smell like themselves. That\u2019s why we used gentle fragrances combined with a deodorizer to impart a subtle, clean fragrance that won\u2019t irritate your furry friend. \n\nManufactured With Care: We decided to manufacture our products here in America rather than overseas. This costs a little more up front but results in a higher quality product far less prone to defects and harmful substitutions. From where your pet is sitting, this means the same soothing feeling after every application of our premium, non-medicated shampoo. \n\nPet-Pleasing Guarantee: Test our claims; try this anti-itching shampoo for yourself. If you don\u2019t think your pet is receiving the relief he deserves, simply return the unused portion for a full refund. \n\nSay Goodbye To Constant Itching and Discomfort; Order Your Pet Some Relief Today!",
