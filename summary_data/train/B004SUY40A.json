In fact, my Amazon purchase was to get another tube, as my first was running out. I use it - without fail - every night. I have had no cracked hands since the end of December. It is a heavier cream than Ahava\u2019s regular hand cream, but it absorbs quickly and is not at all greasy. I love the product and will make sure I have it every winter. I highly recommend it.",

I use this cream and instantly my hands are soothed. If I don't use this cream my hands become cracked again. I highly recommend this product, it might be a bit pricier that other ones, but if you are suffering from severe cracked hands, it's a small price to pay.",
