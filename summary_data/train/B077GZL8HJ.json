Amp to power it. The subwoofer is not broken in yet and already louder and deeper than the Rockford PD3 using 2.65 cubic square box..specs say 3.25 ported. Rockford weighs like 16lbs vs skar 50lbs. For $50 dollars more get the skar vxf instead Waaaaay better Sql/spl. Killer Value. Impressed!! Good job Skar!!! Now get me a Taramps 5k or Md 5000.1 next!!!",
