They still get -1 star for that, but it is normal behavior and will go away with use. As long as its not blue or black smoke, you're fine.

The switch has a rubber cover over it to prevent I assume moisture from getting into the switch. It has a stand on the handle allowing it to be placed so that it is aimed directly up, useful if you need both hands to hold something.",
