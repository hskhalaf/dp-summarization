      "verdict": "People rained praise on the Topo Athletic Terraventure 2. This trail companion worked well for them. They welcomed its spacious toe box, its grip-ready outsole unit, the confident performance on rocky and soft surfaces, and the accommodating sizing schemes. It\u2019s apparently a step up from its predecessor. The noticeable aspect that didn\u2019t sit well with some consumers was its weight as it apparently dragged the foot. Still, the sequestered concern wasn\u2019t a deal-breaker as shoe enthusiasts still flocked to this product for their off-road adventures.",
      "pros": [
        "The forefoot section of the Topo Athletic Terraventure 2 was lauded by consumers for being wide enough to accommodate natural toe-splay",
        "Some testers commented that the outsole unit was able to provide reliable traction over rocky and muddy surfaces",
        "People felt that the sizing scheme of this running shoe followed their usual preferences",
        "The firm midsole unit was considered by several purchasers to be an excellent platform for rough topography",
        "Mud was able to slough off quickly because of the evenly-spaced gripping lugs, a handful of people reported",
        "According to a couple of runners, the heel section of the upper held the foot sufficiently, preventing any accidental shoe removals"

      "cons": [
        "A few people noted that they were able to notice the weight of this shoe, stating that it was heavier than their usual fare"

      "text": "Wow. I confess, I am a running shoe nut. I have a massive rotation of shoes, and have tried many popular models. However, this is my first Topo. I am super impressed. I used these to hike in Moab as well as light trail running. They\u2019re not racing shoes, but they\u2019re comfortable and confidence-inspiring. The overall fit and feel is superb. Midsole has a slightly soft feel that really matches the overall character. Not springy, not spongy. They feel like they fulfill on all the Altra promises, better than Altra does. I am definitely going to try more Topos in the future.",

      "text": "I've taken these shoes on a large number of hikes and trail runs in California, Washington State, Norway, Spain and Portugal. They are lightweight and super comfortable. The main problem is that the soles don't feel as grippy as other hiking shoes that I've had in the past. I was slipping and sliding around on rocks in the Cascades last weekend and just felt less confident on technical terrain. Overall, I do like these shoes - if the terrain isn't too difficult.",

This site is good but not as good as Altra and just as expensive. However it seems a little more durable as far as outsole and appearance. But the missile seems to degrade quicker. Saw the same thing with topo road shoe as well. Very good but there are potentially better choices depending on your goal/situation.",

My 2nd pair was the MT-03, which was a good looking shoe, did well on the trail, but I missed the rockplate from the Terraventures. After I put those through hell, I found the Terraventure 2's and couldn't pass them up. I'm a 9.5 and these fit just perfect. Love the rockplate, comfort, and everything else about them. I don't do as much hiking, but they're still solid! Can't really find a negative about this shoe.",
