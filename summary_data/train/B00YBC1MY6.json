When I put my camera in my sling and stuff the strap in with it, the strap adjusters scratch the camera. Would have been better with a rubberized coating on them or maybe velcro tabs to cover them. Love the strength and industrial look of the quick adjusters so a love/hate situation for sure.",

When I bring the camera to my face in the vertical position, I no longer have the strap dangling over the shutter or viewfinder. Worth the price.",

The \"grip\" has already started peeling at the top of the strap and I have only had this for a week. Looks very nice overall but the gimmick slide mechanism they are selling you on is not as functional as you are lead to believe.",

So far, love the color and the quality of the strap itself. The locking mechanism had me worrying as I read a blog where the writer mentioned that it failed and he dropped his camera as a result. However, I feel that it's a solid mechanism if you make sure the clips engage. That being said, we'll see how it fares in Japan over the next two weeks! Stay tuned!",

Quality of this strap is also amazing, overall I would highly recommend this strap.",

The padded area is slightly stiff but I believe that because it\u2019s brand new and needs to be worn in and seasoned to me. This a really well build strap.",

      "text": "Great strap overall. Nice hardware makes it easy to adjust; very aesthetically pleasing; and it does slide well, allowing you to move the camera around without struggle. I haven't needed to use the sticky side to secure the strap, but I think if I need to secure the camera, I'll use other means; Capture, probably I was disappointed that when leaving the strap hanging on a chair overnight, the internal padding separated where the strap was bent. Now the strap has a thin section in the middle of the padded area that folds easily, changing the way it lies over my shoulder. It's not uncomfortable, but it *is* annoying.",
