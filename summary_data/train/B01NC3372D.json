I think these measurements might help someone, because I had to go through a lot of comments to get an idea if this bike had the height that suited me better. It is heavier than I was expecting, but I can lift it without too much effort. I will probably change the seat because I would like one that feels more cushioned. I will be updating this review...",

It seems like a sturdy enough bike, but it is NOT fitted for a big person. I suggest going to your local bike shop and talking with the professionals... the amount of money your will save here is just a pain.",

Not for long rides. Highly recommend it. Got a discounted one, from a party seller, like new. It looked like new, came with all original packaging and wrapping.",

We've used tire liners, extra thick tubes, extra thick tires but can't use it more than one day without getting a flat. We love the frame, suspension etc but it's useless with flat tires. Unfortunately it's too late to send the 2nd bike back. Our theory is that the spokes are poking the tires even though we couldn't feel them when changing the tubes. Very disappointed in Schwinn.",

It also damaged the paint trying to dislodge the chain. I ordered a replacement and this bike had the same issue. If this chain does ever come off when riding theres a high probability that the chain will get wedged b/w the frame and front crank.
