Resolution adjusts for best picture and life-like colors and skin tones. Much better than built-in cam on a friend's Toshiba lap top. Microphone is unbelievable. I am 1/4 mile away from railroad tracks and train horn is clearly audible to person receiving my broadcast. One small complaint is that owner's manual could be more complete. Installation tip: turn off all automatic virus/malware/etc software during installation. After, cam works fine with these programs on. A definite winner, buy this one.",

The problems are that whenever I turn off my lappie or unplug the camera, the camera is no longer recognized on my lappie until I restart it. It also just stops working in the middle of a video call. I'm not sure if it's just getting old, but I really don't use it that much so it's frustrating and disappointing. The final thing is that it is an MSN camera, and any time you adjust the camera you have to be careful because there's a button on top that initiates MSN webchat.",

The installer doesn't give any time estimates, and the progress meter fills up and resets probably a dozen times during the course of the installation, so you have no idea how far in you actually are. Once installed, though, the camera and software seem reasonably simple. Press the button on top of the camera and it launches MSN Messenger and asks you which of your contacts with whom you'd like to initiate a video chat. Quick and easy.",

I might be asking for too much, but it would be cool if it came with a better interface software to do more with it. I would recommend this webcam to anyone on any budget.

The audio is also clear, and cancels out most background noise. Recommended for people on budgets. Don't get this if you want HD quality.",

You're not going to make professional videos with this but for the 30 dollar price point you really cannot go wrong. Say what you want about Microsoft's business practices but their hardware offerings are usually quite solid. This is no exception. Buy with confidence!",

The picture is not cinema quality, but it is good for having paid $30 for it. The stand is a little awkward, but it balances on my laptop screen alright, although it wouldn't last long if I was moving around alot. Overall, this is a great webcam for the price.",

My daughter LOVES the special effects that are easily accessible and drives her fiance crazy making silly faces. Having this really helps keep her closer to all of us until her deployment is over.",

Easy installation-i'm really not tech savvy but had no problems with installation. Picture quality is great and sound is fine. Perfect for my uses. For Christmas I purchased a Kodak webcam for a gift-Black Friday special. When we SKYPED the other night I was very disappointed in the picture quality of the Kodak camera-Microsoft is much, much better. Wish I had purchased Microsoft as gift. Great camera at a great price.",

I suppose this low-quality camera would be a great buy if you don't want to feel self-conscious when you are webchatting.
