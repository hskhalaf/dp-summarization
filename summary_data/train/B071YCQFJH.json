My chairs were very high (39\" ) and they fit perfecty to bottom. Excellent price and better made than more expensive and less quality ones I've seen out there. Don't know how such a great quality product can be sold at such a very reasonable price, but I'll take it. Quick delivery. Will definitely buy Utopia Brand again, and strongly recommend this poduct for any person or business looking to protect their outdoor furniture from the elements .",

Upon opening, I could feel that it was a significantly heavier weight and the seams were noticeably more durable. In addition to all of these positives, it fit! I even had room to leave the decorative pillow underneath for winter storage. Although this cover was a but pricier, it was worth every penny as I feel certain that it will last many seasons. If this should prove to not be the case, i will update my review.",

The covers are very heavy duty and stiff (at first) when using the drawstring to secure the bottom, we also use the clips to secure the cover to one of the chair leg braces. The covers have been used in rain & high winds and didn't blow off. They easily wipe clean from lots of flower blossoms one of our trees shed this time of year.",
