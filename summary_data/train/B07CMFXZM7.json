    "title": "Table Bar Top Clear Epoxy Resin - ProGlas 1000 - 2 Gallon Kit",
    "description": "ProGlas 1000 Bar Table Top 1:1 Epoxy Resin Coating - 1 Gallon Kit\n\n1000 is an extremely clear, tough, high gloss epoxy coating formulated to produce a deep glass like appearance in a single layer on a sealed surface. Two or more layers are often applied for added depth and protection.\n\nProperties\n\n55 Minute Gel Time\n3500 cps Part A\n1400 cps Part B\nTensile Strength, psi: 3390\nTensile Modulus: 261.500\nFlexural Strength, psi: 6752\nFlexural Modulus: 197,848\n\n\n\nProcedure :\n\n1. Resin must be between 75 and 80 deg.Pour equal parts by volume of the Part A and Part B into the graduated cups. \n\n2.Mix the resin with a stir stick. Stir steadily, scraping the sides and bottom. The resin will appear hazy but will clear up after 3 or 4 minutes.\n\n3.Apply the Seal Coat: Pour some resin on the surface and spread it around with a foam brush or squeegee until a thin layer covers the whole surface. Allow the resin to cure for 4 hours before the flood coat is added. The seal coat will prevent most bubbles from forming during the flood stage. \n\n4.Apply the Flood Coat: Pour the mixed resin down the length of the surface. The resin will self-level and tools are not required. Allow the resin to rundown the sides. If additional thickness or layers are needed, allow the previous layer to set up before adding more (typically 4-6 hours).\n\n5.Eliminating Air Bubbles: Once the flood coat has settled into place, take a torch or heat gun and wave the tool 6 to 8 inches about surface. The bubbles will instantly start to pop. Repeat the process until all bubbles are gone. ***If bubbles are not rising to the surface, the resin was too cold to start with. The resin is too viscous to allow the bubbles to rise.***\n\n6.Keep the room between 75 to 80 degrees during the curing process. It will take about half a day for the resin to become tack free, but full cure isn\u2019t complete for another 3 days.",
