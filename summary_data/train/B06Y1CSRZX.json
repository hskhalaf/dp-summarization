The OnlyKey also has an auto-self destruct option in the event that it falls into the wrong hands.",

Save yourself time and get a device that is secure even when someone has access to it. I think anyone who wants to use a secure password but is tired of making them up and remembering them needs one of these.",

SSH and PGP key functionality is a bit weird. From what I've been able to tell it will store the keys, but using them requires Onlykey specific software.",

Windows app appears to be unable to save any key configuration value other than the Label, regardless of checkbox/radio button selections. Tried to configure a basic website's login on all keys; Windows app would not save any key config beyond Label value. Probably wiping and returning the device tomorrow. Also the downloadable PDF of Owners Manual is borked, page size too big to display in Acrobat; had to use docs on website.",
