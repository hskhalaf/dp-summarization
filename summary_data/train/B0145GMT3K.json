The controls fell off the base during play regularly. Batman's arms are much bigger than Superman's, so it is hard to even get Superman to punch Batman. I would say, at best, this is a frustrating game for kids and not a lot of fun for adults either. Wound up just leaving the guys off the stand to play with separately. Pretty hefty price for some cheap plastic action figures.",

Also, it is way easier to pop Superman than it is Batman. We still enjoyed it as it was still fun to laugh at the constant loser.",

The looser flies off his stage as opposed to the head flying up on the robots. Definitely better for younger ones. The are really sturdy also, a plus if your boy breaks things easily.

This gives Superman advantage as the game is about who pushes the head of opponent back. When head of opponent is back, it gets out of groove. Since Superman is relatively shorter, there is higher probability of knocking off Batman. With hours of play, I could observe this. Other's opinion might differ from mine. Its their thought. :)",

You only end up kicking the other player's toy off if you move your toy and actually punch the opposing fighter with your entire toy.
