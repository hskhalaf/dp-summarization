But the seller intentionally withheld this information - as others have said there is a sticker on the box obscuring the region. And as others have said, this means that for service it'll have to be shipped to SA. Would've been 5 stars if it had just been advertised as being from the SA, maybe 4 stars if it was from the SA but there was no sticker on the box. But intentionally trying to deceive buyers by placing a sticker on the box is 1 star.",

Just looking at the system makes me happy. The colored buttons contrast the yellow system marvelously, and the Pikachu design on the exterior is perfect. I bought a few cute Poke\u0301mon themes in the theme shop (Pikachu Party, Onemuri Pikachu, and Poke\u0301mon Radiant Collection) to accent the system soon after transferring my data from my previous system. Needless to say, I'm more than satisfied with the final outcome. TL;DR - The system is gorgeous and is more than worth every penny.",

While, it is not in fact a USA one it still works perfect and can still play US games. i have not noticed any issues with the charging, or anything else. Works as well as i would expect a brand new 3ds would. thanks again",

These are the non-IPS screens so they don\u2019t looks as good from extreme angles, but they work fine and they\u2019re definitely bright enough. The 3D is really cool and I wish more devices used this technology. Love the pikachu design on the shell. No charging cable so make sure you pick one up, as well",

Imagine my surprise when this arrives, and it's a UAE version. Which is fine -- it works with all NA games, and you can use it in the US; but if you ever have any issues, you'll have to ship it to Nintendo of the United Arab Emirates to be fixed. Disappointed and misleading, although the console is great.",
