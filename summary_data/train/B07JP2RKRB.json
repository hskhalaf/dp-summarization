Playing Red Dead Redemption 2 on this set is and that alone was worth the purchase price. This is my first 4K TV and I am very satisfied with the purchase, really the only complaint I have is that the speakers on this TV are kinda on the average side. Though nothing a decent sound bar can fix. You won't have to take out a second mortgage to buy this, so that's always a plus",

The only little thing I dont like is if you want to use the casting features or the streaming features of the tv, you have to agree to let them track your watching habits. If you are ok with that, and I think all tvs nowadays do this, then it's amazing for the price. Other then that, which can be bypassed with a fire stick or something, then it is a perfect buy.",

Once I got my new 4k Blu-ray connect I put in a calibration disk and started on that process only to find that selecting the \"Calibrated Dark\" picture mode on the TV appeared to automatically calibrate the TV correctly. I walked through all the calibration tests and found no significant deviations except for needing to reduce the contrast slightly. This is a great TV right out of the box.",

Its a little better. But. You can't zoom on Netflix. This tv won't let you. I watch a LOT of Star Trek and like zooming in so it's not in letterbox mode. But this tv doesn't allow it. Thank god the picture qualilty is mind blowing (if you pay the 4k upcharge on netflix). Watching blue planet in 4k is absolutely fabulous. Itd be nice if more content was in4k.",

Privacy settings are controllable. Once you are used to the remote, all works very sensibly. Very glad we made this choice. Also considered Samsung and LG models before choosing this Vizio.",

The picture is amazing and hdr content is even better. It also looks stunning with it's red accents. If your buying this TV for the smart TV functionality then don't. It's slow and awkward. There is no gameing tv under $1,000 that even comes close to this set. Definitely buy the red one if u can.",
