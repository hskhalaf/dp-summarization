The Remington PF7500C with 2 foils and 1 cutter is a superior razor. I've got a thick grey beard and shave every 2-3 days. It takes me half the time to shave compared to the old razor and the result is a great close best shave. I fully charged the razor when it arrived and so far I've shaved 6 times and still haven't had to recharge. The only thing I would ding Remington on is that they don't include a small travel bag for the razor and charger.",

The foil cutter does a great job, leaving no whiskers at all. It's easy on my skin, much less irritation than a regular razor blade which I simply cannot use.
