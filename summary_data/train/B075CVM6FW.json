However, after receiving the product and testing it for a week, it didn't feel the same as the sample I received. It had the smell of corn oil and didn't sink into my skin as well as the sample I received. Not sure if I got a bad batch but I'd purchase this again from an authorized retailer.",

It's a bit more expensive than other oils, but a little goes a LONG way and it takes a couple of months for me to run out so it's totally worth the price.",
