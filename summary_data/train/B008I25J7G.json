I was looking more for a towel material, so to wear right after taking a shower. It's a little more furrier than a towel, but somewhat of a towel-like feel. It is warm to wear around the house. I should have also opted for a longer robe. If you're looking for something to just lounge around in the house, it would be good for you. I wouldn't use it though right after taking a shower, in my opinion.",

      "text": "Incredibly soft, comfortable and very pretty color. If it were a clothing item that I wore in public I'd give it 2 stars for poor sewing quality because one of the inner ties came off the second time I tied it (Easily sewed back on), and one of the shoulder seams has developed a large hole after 2 months of daily wear and many washes (easy repair if you sew). Because I only wear it at home, I'll give it 3 stars for its extreme softness and comfort, despite the poor sewing quality. The price was right, but you get what you pay for.",

Definitely invest more of your money in those 30-60$ robes if you want some really good quality cause this ain\u2019t it. Also the comments about the shedding? It does shed A LOT. Beware if you have white carpet/rug/comforter.",

Ya, so it's really soft and cozy, perfect for lounging around the house in. So glad I have a robe I can easily throw on and can finally stop making my roommates uncomfortable by always traipsing around the casa in just my underwear! 10/10",
