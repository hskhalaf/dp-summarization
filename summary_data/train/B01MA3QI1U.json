The tiles are easy to read and clear. The only slightly weird thing is that only one of the tile boxes has a cover, so I guess they are meant for the covered one to sit on top of the other and then placed within the sleeve. Not a big deal.",

The carrying bag is also nice and light. I love the set and would highly recommend it. Great quality and value for the money.",
