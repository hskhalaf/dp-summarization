This one has better cable actually stiff wire built in to aid in pushing through a pipe etc. The clarity of the camera is good not, HD but color and good enough for viewing obstructions. It will fit in any 1/2\" tubing as long as there are no tee's or 90's in the way. I was able to make it turn a 90 in a 1\" pipe fairly easy. so far I'm impressed with this scope for $20.00. Thinking of grabbing another one just as back-up if something goes just when you need most, I funny that way. Definite good buy!",

But it has to be an inch or two away from things to focus, and that's kind of exactly not what's likely to be happening down in a pipe. Controlling where it's looking is very hard, but that's not its fault I guess, but the long focal length makes it almost impossible to find your way around the pipe. But, it worked, and was simple to operate - just connect your phone to the endoscope's internal wifi, and use the app mentioned here to view.",
