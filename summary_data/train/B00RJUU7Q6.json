Size / sizing: I have long, narrow, flatish feet (size 11 women's) and the LARGE fit well. I wear them on both feet since my \"good\" ankle gets extra pressure. I expect to wear these by themselves in summer and over socks in winter for the foreseeable future since they help support my ankles. One heads-up: they are most comfortable when standing and walking -- they can feel constricting when just sitting. Also, if you have bunions you may need to slide the front back behind them.",

They are tight enough to offer good compression while still flexible enough to be able to easily put them on and take them off. They offer good support and reduce pain in my feet and ankles and they still allow complete range of motion. This is a good product.",

I can wear them for 4 hours and they are great; but any longer I must take them off.",

The only times I've had to put a small effort into getting them on was when my feet were already swollen. I developed plantar fasciitis from triathlon training and just bad genes. These really sooth my tired feet. I've noticed my swollen ankles are back to normal after wearing the socks to bed. I highly recommend.",

      "text": "I bought these as I am an older person, with fluid retention and plantar fasciitis, that likes to wear flip-flops. They have good compression, and are easy to put on and take off. The band at the top was more narrow than I would like, which meant that as my ankles swelled, I got the \"rubber band\" constriction feeling and had to take them off. They were good for 6 to 8 hours before they got uncomfortable though. They wash up nice, and dry fairly quickly. If your only problem is plantar fasciitis, I think these work well. If you have swelling ankles like I do, I prefer a sleeve with a wider top band.",

My marathon-running cousin recommended them as he is knowledgeable about sports injuries, having had a good number of foot issues himself. Instead of re-wrapping the ankle with tape, I put on the foot sleeves and found them nicely supportive and comfortable. They gave me just enough compression on the ankle. Since I have also suffered from plantar fasciitis in the past, I'll be getting the benefit of that aspect as well. Other ankle supports didn't look comfortable in terms of fitting inside my shoes. The Foot Sleeves are thin enough that they fit perfectly. I've ordered 3 more pairs and I intend to wear them most days.",

I fee that my pain has gone down by 50%. I ordered a small size - since I wear a 6 1/2 shoe and it fit comfortable but a little snug. Better to be snug than loose in my opinion.
