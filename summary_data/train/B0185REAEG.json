Absolutely every print is garbage. I spin knobs, tweak settings, read forums, read manuals, switch filiment, you name it. I've tried every suggestion in the book and it doesn't make a lick of difference. The institution replaced the extruder with the smart extruder +, doesn't matter. The prints are awful. They're not even just stringy, I could cut that off, they are an intangible, amorphous cloud of spaghetti mess at any setting. JUNK! DO NOT BUY!!!",

Poor print quality. 2. Limited software settings 3. Filaments tangled a few times causing print errors. 4. Poor customer support 5. Bad return policy, they will charge you a restocking fee! Avoid at all cost!",

Makerbot sent replacement parts that did not fix it so they decided to replace the machine. Here we are going on over 2-3 months without being able to print and the new machine right out of the box printed terribly, even when printing their internal test prints with their filament. I would NOT PURCHASE another one of their printers.",

In the last 3 years, I had 3 replacement printers because each failed in a different way. Extruder fails often. The filament feeding mechanism into the extruder isn't the best so it tugs on the extruder often. I often get messy prints that don't seem to get better even when I change the settings. Would give 0 stars if possible, but giving one for the support team..They have been responsive and troubleshooting but even they cannot fix or understand some of the issues I have.",

The new smart extruder plus also added some improved quality and reliability to the printing process. This unit is very well built I have moved it many times and taken to different sites with no reset up needed. I plan to add another one to my lab this year. Highly recommend the Z18.",
