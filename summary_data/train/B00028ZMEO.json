It also says on the bottle that its not safe to ingest which is exactly what your dog is going to do when they lick whatever furniture you sprayed it on.

The primary area we used it was on a rug that they had deemed their new bathroom. It didn't really help. We also put it on baseboards that they chewed once. They didn't chew them again, but I don't really think it's because of the spray.",

I'm guessing on some surfaces, the gratification of chewing it is worth the bitter aftertaste! It is a moderate repellent at best.",

I also suggest putting it in a smaller sprayer if you have one. The 16oz is pretty bulky to carry around for training.",
