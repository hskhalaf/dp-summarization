The problem is that the torque generated by the countersink encountering even soft pine will overcome the friction of the set screw trying to hold it in place (this is a bigger problem on the smaller bits ... like the ones you would probably want to use for wood screws). If you try to gorilla tighten the set screw to keep the countersink from spinning, you strip the allen head. Should've spent more money and gotten something with a better design.",

I tried out the smallest one and it worked well. One of the countersink cutting piece came off of one in the box and I had to reposition and fasten. It seems that the bigger the drill bit the deeper the hole will be drilled since the countersink cutting bit sits at the top of the drill bit. I suspect that if you have a short screw you might have to use the shortest countersink drill bit to get the countersink part without drilling a deep hole.",

Bottom pocket seams are reinforced with rivets and look like they can take a lot of abuse. Straps tighten easily and hold the apron close to the body for the entire length, important for safety to ensure that neither clothes or the apron can get pulled into nearby machinery.",
