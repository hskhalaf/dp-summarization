These navy blue curtains are definitely perfect for what we needed and I'm grateful that they don't look or feel like motel/hospital decor",

And our neighbors have fairly bright lights that stay on all night long. The first curtain worked so well that I ordered another. They block heat and light. A great combination and these curtains are relatively inexpensive. We should have bought these years ago!",

I was iffy about these because of the price but HONEY! the room is PITCH BLACK when these are closed! I have the gray set and am about to purchase the white set for my bedroom. It blocks out every speck of sun, street light, etc...You will not be disappointed! Trust me!",

The only light, as seen in the picture, comes around the top and edges, which can be dealt with (eg, by using a valance, proper positioning). My only complaint is that these (2 different sets) arrived VERY wrinkly. I got these to deal with a concussion and was not about to wash and dry these before hanging. So they're hanging a bit unevenly due to the heavy wrinkling. Otherwise, the quality is nice.",

      "text": "We have had blackout curtains in the past but they were always black. We recently repainted our rooms and wanted new curtains and saw these. My husband didn\u2019t believe they could be white and still blackout. It blocks 90-95% of the light, it\u2019s only at the top and bottom and that could be the rod I\u2019m using holding it to far away from the window. I\u2019ve also noticed the rooms stay warmer with these curtains so they are helping insulate as well. Some reviewers said they look gray because of the black inside liner, but to me they look white.",
