I strive to do 10 reps spring up, switch hands same thing, then 10 reps spring down and switch hands same thing. This counts as one set.

I was able to close it one time (touching end to end) after a few weeks of using it. However, not consistently and it felt like a little too much for a good workout. So I downgraded to the 200 and I can click this one 8-10. Ill typically do another 8 or so as far as I can and get a great burn. Hopefully with more training I can transition at some point up to the 250!",

All 3 150's had quality issues (first 2 arrived already opened and appeared to be \"fixed\" since there was visible glue at the top). Decided to break down and get CoC grippers, as they seem to be more consistent and reliable in the manufacturing process. Its a shame because I have no issues with functionality and finish of the 100's. YMMV.",

      "BREAKTHROUGH YOUR PHYSICAL LIMITS \u2013 As most athletes know, if you want to improve your overall fitness you MUST train your weakest link. But there\u2019s a difference between knowing this and DOING IT. If you\u2019re looking to take your power lifting or other feats of strength to the next level then this is how you succeed\u2026 you TRAIN YOUR GRIP.",
      "DESIGNED TO INCREASE YOUR GRIP STRENGTH \u2013 There\u2019s nothing in a typical gym that compares to these hand grippers. Just think about it. Nearly every piece of equipment you touch wasn\u2019t SOLELY created to target and isolate your forearms, fingers, and wrists. Meaning there\u2019s no chance they\u2019ll be as effective as these grip strengtheners.",
      "ON-THE-GO HAND EXERCISES \u2013 Unlike most training, you can do these exercises just about anywhere. You can use these while you\u2019re at the office or even in the car if you travel for work. They\u2019re basically a discrete training tool that transforms your job and downtime into productive workout sessions.",
      "CREATE HANDS OF STEEL \u2013 Just like in life, you\u2019re going to have to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. We mention this because our grip handles weren\u2019t built for dainty little hands. They were built to toughen you up and that\u2019s how finger exercises should be. Trust us, your hands will get used to it and, afterwards, you\u2019ll be grateful for it.",
      "THE PERFECT PROGRESSION \u2013 No matter where you\u2019re starting, and how strong you want to get, there\u2019s always room to grow. That\u2019s why our grippers increase at 50 lbs increments: to help you stay physically challenged. Thus, if all 6 grippers seem like too much then just start with the first 3 weights (100lbs, 150lbs, 200lbs). Whatever your needs, we\u2019ve got you covered"
