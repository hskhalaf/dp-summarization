Has a removable face guard for alternate amounts of protection and visibility. Easy to remove and replace the face guard. 4.) Breathable with lots of ventilation for hot environments. 5.) Certified. Con's: 1.) Very expensive. 2.) Hinders the sense of hearing to a very small degree even with the face guard removed, this may also be a negative style point for some people.",

The matte Dazzle looks really cool, just like the battleships from WW1 that had dazzle camo. The perspective might look odd in the picture, but that's due to the dazzle pattern. Comes with replacement pads, an extra visor with a mount, and a thin bag. Helmet itself feels like it could survive a major accident. I'll update my review if I have any problems or insights down the road.",

      "text": "Extremely well made and offers incredible protection. The reason for only three stars is that it is too heavy for me to wear and the (very clever) removable chin guard is impossible to put on without a mirror or other person. Maybe it was designed with the idea of removing the helmet every time you want a drink or being used only with a water tube, which I don't use. Since taking off the helmet entirely is an ordeal given all its extra safety snaps and if you wear glasses etc., it means that I no longer use this very expensive product",

Overall this helmet has held up pretty darn well with the water. Not a DOT helmet, but that was not the purpose of me getting this. It was to protect my head in the event a jet ski fell on while doing flips. I like the removable chin piece although I use it just to make taking the helmet on and off easier. I typically do not ride without it.",

But after receiving this Giro Switchblade, I cannot but help comment on how the Switchblade is so much lighter, and significantly smaller, than the Remedy. The Remedy looks like a diving bell helmet in comparison (and probably weights as much). The Switchblade in black pairs the best with silver mirrored goggles, in my opinion. Air flow is restricted on this, and any helmet, when a goggle is used in conjunction with a full face helmet for cross country mountain biking. But that's okay, will monitor my heat index.",

I don't have the chin guard attached while doing this. Taking the helmet off feels like re-experiencing birth going feet first and ears are definitely sore afterwards. I guess this is a good problem to have when you are \"wicked smaht\" with a big brain to protect.",
