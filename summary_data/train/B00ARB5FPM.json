Now it has a permanently flashing green LED, my computers and router can't see it. I did the restart, new cable and secret reset button routines, no change. Their online help is as slim as their product documentation. A backup is something that needs to work with NO DRAMA and for years, not months. At least it was cheap! Sadly, it looks like Seagate is attempting to Astroturf the Amazon reviews by responding with kind condolences, but how about on their support site? Nothing - not ONE CLUE is provided for my symptoms, which seem to be pretty common.",

I took it apart and learned that the HDD was ok, so I pulled that out to use as another drive in my PC. Seagate makes a good HDD, but these network units are less than par. Would I buy another, probably not. I opted for a QNAP 231+ and 2new Seagate Ironwolf 4TB drives to run as RAID1. Much more money, but recoverable if the unit dies. Live and learn....",

Additionally, based on what I read on the WEB there is very high probability that the second one will crash soon.

Only one user name and password should be necessary. The drive itself seems to work fine as expected although a little slower than I had hoped it would be.

I am able to access it from my office, however I haven't still tried any upload or download. Secondly the Dashboard is supposed to help to control the power settings, but I can't find any settings for that. The drive seems to be primarily designed for Windows and not far iMac.

I got some better transfer times after reading some suggestions from online forums and Seagate's site. Several months in, the drive works with no problems. It works in the background without making a sound. Everyone needs a backup plan for your data and I have no problem suggesting this drive as an option.",
