Carried two water bottles in the mesh pockets, a larger bottle in the interior compartment along with a second pair of lighter shoes and plenty of snacks. The straps distribute the load quite comfortably. As a carry on, I was able to carry my iPad, Kindle, snacks for the 4 hour plane ride, plus everything that has to come out of your pockets to pass through security. A small lap top would also fit in the storage compartment for the electronics.",

It has held up really well but I wanted something more streamlined. I was SHOCKED that all of my gear, laptop included, fits into this smaller pack with room to spare. On top of that, the weight distributes across my shoulders and chest in such a way that I can barely tell I am carrying anything. All the same gear, but it feels 15 pounds lighter than my old backpack. Kudos to Osprey! I will be a customer for life. Super impressed",

When I put it on, for the bottom of the bag to rest on my lower back and the chest and waist strap to hit where they should, the top part of my bag has to ride up so that it is about 3 inches taller than my shoulders. Therefore, the extra bag was digging into my neck. Bag is also pretty stiff and the laptop pocket area felt very cheap. Material overall also feels cheaper than most Osprey bags do. Only thing I liked about it was the color.",

Even if I could have gotten over the useless water bottle pockets, I wouldn't have kept them. I wore them around town for a weekend, but they never felt comfortable because of the the way the straps connect at the top of the pack.",

The fitting for the side pockets is also different depending on the color. The Petrol Blue has deeper pockets which allow for a better hold of longer water bottles. If you use wider ones, like the Nalgene wide-mouth, this is not a problem. All-in-all a great travel bag. Very lightweight and really holds a lot of stuff.

I've found the side pockets are best for drying socks or something similar; those pockets wont hold a bottle. It has a waste strap that is thankfully removable, but it is a nice touch for some people is assume. The pack is pretty water resistant as well. I took it on a float trip recently and it repelled the water that landed on it. All in all, it's a well built pack backed by the best warranty in the industry.",

My wife really hated that the pack could not be stood up on its bottom, even when leaning against a chair. The bottom contour does not allow it to sit flat. The water holder nets were poorly shaped to hold a water bottle--it constantly fell out. The two compartment zipper were on top very close to one another so we were always opening the small compartment when we wanted the big one. The small upper compartment needs to be deeper. We will not be using these packs again.",

Overall: Backpack seems better suited for a day hike or for a cyclist. I ultimately decided to return it because of its size.",

Lean just slightly too far forward and you'll be picking your bottle off the ground. Not a big deal for most people but I enjoy geocaching and that involves looking around on the ground quite a bit. It's very frustrating to have stuff falling out constantly. That's just nitpicking, to be honest, and this is a solid backpack. Don't overfill it. It quickly gets uncomfortable with too much in the main compartment.",

I have found Osprey products to be of the highest quality, with thoughtful designs that offer more storage options than expected.

The configuration of the water bottle pockets isn't ideal, and I do wish there were more attachment points (especially an easy way to connect trekking poles to the pack), but otherwise I'm quite pleased. Perhaps the most important facet: the no-questions-asked Osprey repair/replacement policy. Cooling mesh on the back panel and the hydration sleeve are also big benefits.",
