      "text": "Started with yellowed, blurry, almost opaque thirteen year old headlamp lenses. The process involved two hand buffering passes with 1000 grit and then 3000 grit pads simply moistened with water. This left the lenses uniformly milky yellow so I was not expecting a great outcome. However, the drill bit inserted buffering pad when used with the liquid formula turned out pretty good. I'd say the lenses are close to 90% clear. The whole process took under an hour. Oh - the final step is a clear coating of some sort that I found to be very sticky afterwards on my hands. So next time I will wear thin gloves.",

Didn't have much to loose so I figured go with a brand I knew provided good products. Received the package, read the directions, then watched a youtube and figured why not. First cleaned the headlight with glass cleaner. Then masked it with painters tape. Did the first sanding until the plastic looked frosted. The next sanding got them kind of clear again. Finally polished them until they were clear. But then used the wipe in the last step and was amazed! They looked new again. Took about 30 minutes from start to finish.",

Many people said the clearness will go away in about a year. So I also bought some ceramic coating to top it off. Should last about 3 yrs with proper care.",
