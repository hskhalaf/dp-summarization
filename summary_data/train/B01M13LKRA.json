I would not have written a premature review but I was pushed so hard that yielded. I actually already played with it. And I have to say it is not good. It makes slippery, the grief, and also quite thorny on the palm. In general for this price I should have not expected much, but it was recommended by Amazon and the sellers seemed so excited with their product so I was surprised to discover how poorly it works for me.",
