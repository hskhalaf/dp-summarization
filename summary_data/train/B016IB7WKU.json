When open, your head does stick in the cabinet a little but not enough to bump your head when you raise up. Mattress seems very comfortable. I was amazed at how it puffed up after unwrapped! One person can open and close Bed-love that! Used regular Queen sized sheets on queen bed and it fit fine. Makes room feel bigger because isn\u2019t very tall. Makes a small room multipurpose.

They stayed in contact with me so I knew when they would be here. I love the piece. It was exactly what we need in our guest room which is also my craft room. Since the piece is more like a dresser, I can set stuff on top of it when it's not being used as a bed. The under bed draw is great for storing the linens I will use with the bed. It seems very well made and so far I couldn't be happier with this purchase.",
