This game is especially fun to play when the PSP is hooked up to a TV to get a bigger picture, but the PSP screen is more than effecient for this game.",

    "title": "God of War Chains of Olympus - Sony PSP",
    "description": "In God of War, Kratos, after being deceived into killing his wife and daughter, denounced his service to Ares. In order to seek absolution from his past sins, the Ghost of Sparta pledged himself as a champion to the Gods for the years to follow. These brutal crusades, in the name of Olympus, became legendary throughout the ancient world. In God of War: Chains of Olympus, Kratos will journey to lands that no mortal has ever walked upon. With the world plunged in eternal darkness and the Gods rendered powerless, Kratos will face the most feared creatures of Greek Mythology, and ultimately be forced to choose between his own personal redemption and saving the ancient world from certain destruction. Developed from the outset as an original story, God of War: Chains of Olympus delivers highly detailed graphics, incredible animation detail and yet another adventure in the dark and brutal world of Greek mythology that fans of the God of War franchise have come to know and love. Critically-Acclaimed Franchise - Brought to you by Sony Computer Entertainment America and two award-winning development teams - Santa Monica Studios and Ready At Dawn Studios\n\nAMAZON.COM\nBefore he waged war on the gods...he was forced to serve them\n\n\n\nThe third game in the God of War franchise, God of War: Chains of Olympus for PlayStation Portable is a prequel to the first two games in the series published for PlayStation 2, and true the high standards of God of War and God of War II, not only does it equal the efforts of its predecessors, in some ways it may even surpass them.\n\nKratos? Story\nThe God of War franchise tells the tragic and violent story of the warrior Kratos and his dealings with the gods. The ancient world would eventually both praise and damn the infamous ?Ghost of Sparta? as the mortal who slayed a god, but long before his battle with Ares, Kratos sought absolution from his past sins by pledging himself as a champion to the gods. These brutal crusades in the name of Olympus became legendary, but would have far-reaching consequences. In Chains of Olympus Kratos is pushed to the edge as he is ordered by the gods to journey to the very depths of the underworld after the world plunges into darkness. There he must face the most feared creatures of Greek mythology and is forced to choose between his own personal redemption and saving the ancient world from certain destruction. It is a choice that will shake the immortals from their perches on Mt. Olympus.\n\nGod of War's Epic Gameplay Comes to the PSP\nPlayStation Portable has always been head and shoulders above its competitors in the handheld market when it comes to processing power, and in God of War: Chains of Olympus the PSP platform may just have reached its highest level to date. Packed with features like dramatic camera angles, epic set pieces, cinematic cut scenes, stirring audio and seamless fast action gameplay, formerly only available on console platforms Chains of Olympus binds players to the game?s epic adventure, regardless where they are when they join in the action.\n\nCombat Moves, Both Old and New\nNearly as defining as the name of Kratos itself, the trademark sweeping attack moves of the ?Ghost of Sparta? using his weapon of choice the ?Blades of Chaos,? epitomizes all God of War games and Chains of Olympus is no exception.\n\nAlthough overall the PSP has fewer buttons than the PlayStation 2 controller, developer Ready at Dawn Studios has managed to incorporate nearly all of the attack moves and combination moves from previous games in the series into this new project. This continuity in gameplay not only provides a seamless intro into the game for veteran players, but a gentle learning curve for players new to the series. Add to this new brutal combat moves and an additional upgradable weapon and you have a combat system that will engage players at all levels.\n\nExploration and Puzzle Solving\nFrom the bright gates of Attica to the darkest dungeons of Tartarus, Kratos? journey and your own will take you through the dark and brutal world of Greek mythology. Here not only will your skill with the Blades of Chaos be tested, but your wits as well.\n\nAs you explore the dangers of the ancient world, players must be prepared to use their navigational skills as they press on through labyrinths of challenging puzzles. Some may be simple tests at manipulating the game?s environment to your advantage, while others much more difficult also requiring precision timing of moves, but each will be different and test you in new ways.\n\nAn Evolution in Franchise History\nMore than just a missing piece in the history of the God of War franchise, Chains of Olympus also serves as an evolutionary link between the origins of the God of War franchise and its future. Originally developed for PlayStation 2, the future of the franchise is slated to make its arrival on PlayStation 3 in the form of the highly anticipated God of War III in the not too distant future. Not only is PlayStation Portable designed to work in unison with PlayStation 3 in many ways, but both long-time fans and newcomers to the series who choose to watch and play Chains of Olympus carefully may very well pick up clues as to the direction the franchise will be heading in with God of War III.\n\nRegardless, whether you find yourself playing for the current chapter in Kratos? saga or preparing yourself for the battles to come on the PlayStation 3, God of War: Chains of Olympus is a must have title for any current owner of a PSP or those considering getting in the handheld game with one.",
