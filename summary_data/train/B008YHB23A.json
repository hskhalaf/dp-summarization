When i have my window open the scent of oils is not as strong for obvious reason, but when the wondow is closed it is so relaxing to go to sleep to it. Sounds like a tiny little bubble bath next to me and i love the light change even though i leave it off at night bc it is really bright, when i transfer it to my bathroom and leave the light on its prettier than a candle. Oh and it came with one bottle of lavander oil. Awesome!!!",

Yesterday I spilled water and oil all over my office after fighting with it to open. I have a similar diffuser that has a larger capacity that I use at home and never have this problem with it. When it is on it works great and love the colors. As a write this it isn't on because I can't get the cover off.",

The chemical ones tend to create a lot of buildup. It still works, but you'll have to clean it really thoroughly before putting something else in or it gunks it all up. The lighting options are great as well. I only wish it had a color-cycle option, but otherwise, I just tend to pick blue (my favorite) anyways. I like that there is a dim and bright option with the light as well. I'm very happy I bought this item.",

It also has a light choice if you like. So use it as a night light, or just a room hi-lite. The scent is diffused gently along with a small amount of steam. Good buy.",

Note: because I see some people asked, each light color has a high and low setting, but I don't see that it cycles randomly through a color change mode, meaning, once you select a color, that's the color you get unless you select another. There is also the option to not have any light/color. Now my only thing is that I'll need a 2nd for another room.",

I went to fill it brith oils tonite and the light comes on but the mist does not work. Very expensive and disappointing to get only 3 uses out of this. When it worked it was very nice!!! UPDATE! I emailed the company and had a response back almost immediately. I was given directions on how yo clean the unit and it worked perfectly!! I would buy from this seller again. Even though my purchase was 5 months ago they stood behind the product! Very pleased!",

Perfect for a small bedroom or bathroom, not really suitable for large rooms if you want a lasting aroma without sitting right next to the unit. Maybe if you got two it would be good for a larger room. Would definitely recommend for its price! UPDATE: So it's been 7 months and the unit no longer works - the lights come on and it sounds like its working, but it no longer diffuses - the same amount of water will be in the unit for days. I guess it can be used as a really expensive night light. :-(",
