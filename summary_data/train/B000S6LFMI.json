      "text": "Our wheelbarrow was about 25 years old, and the front tire had to be aired up every time I used it. I had put new handles on it a few years back. I ordered this flat free wheel and tire, it took less than 5 minutes to install, only one side of the axle carrier has to be unbolted, slipped in a spacer on each side, and it was good to go. It makes some scrunchy noises with a heavy load, but works fine. Rolls pretty easy, even with a full load of landscaping rock. And no more flat tires!",

      "text": "Excellent retrofit for my wheelbarrow. It's a bit narrower than the tubeless tire it replaced, but for my application, that's not a problem. It comes with enough different spacers (and two sizes of bearings) that it probably will fit virtually any wheelbarrow. I wondered whether the lesser \"spring\" in a flat-free wheel (vs. a tubed or tubeless pneumatic) would be a negative. Actually, in my opinion, it's not. Much of my use is for hauling bark mulch. With the more springy pneumatic wheel I once used, going over bumps tended to toss mulch out of the wheelbarrow (sort of like over-active shock absorbers). This doesn't happen with the more rigid, flat-free tire -- yet it's not too rigid. Highly recommended.",

Also, although slightly larger diameter than my original wheels, it works fine. No noticeable difference. Bottom Line: Slightly expensive, but well worth it...Highly recommended!",

With the spacers that arrived with the tire, it fit perfectly. My grandchildren will be pushing that wheelbarrow along 50 years from now. I'm happy. My money was very well spent.",
