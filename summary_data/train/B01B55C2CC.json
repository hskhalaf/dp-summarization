Someone suggested opening the box and counting your pieces immediately to make sure you have the correct number. Also, not throwing your shipping box away. We learned the hard way. I hope Knex is easy to work with and will replace the missing pieces.",

The plastic is a pliable nylon blend that should stand up over time. Many parts would be tough physically for small hands to put together so its a good project for a child and adult to do together, but don't plan on it being something they can play with while you do laundry or dishes, cause you're going to get asked to put every other piece together for them. It's pretty fun to watch, currently its a christmas decoration on the mantle...",

Needed little guidance for putting it together, but instructions are actually pretty nice (pictures), only a couple times we had to literally try out different things to see what fits. Missing 4 little green brackets for the merry-go-round projects (that was the first one he built), but we took them off other part that seemed to be ok without them (secured with tape). He's been playing with that merry go round for days now, and it works great. Nothing catches the parts, it flows smooth. So the only complaint is that some brackets were missing. Not sure if any more will be once we dismantle this one and try the other two projects.",

    "description": "Watch kids turn your living space into an amusement park with the K\u2019NEX Education STEM Explorations Swing Ride Building Set. \n\nChildren can build a working swing ride with this educational building set. Each package contains 470 brightly colored pieces, including variously sized connectors, and multiple styles of rods: short, long, straight and curved . Parts can be connected together to create constructions that actually move, thanks to a battery-powered motor that uses two AA batteries. This engineering set can also be used for building two other rides \u2014 a boom ride and a Ferris wheel. Playing with this educational toy will unleash children\u2019s imaginative skills by letting them build amazing structures with their own two hands. \n\nThis toy also promotes growth in STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and math) subjects, thanks to its complex and cognitive approach to entertainment. Not only does it offer kids a fun playtime session \u2014 it also helps develop their natural curiosity and creativity, and lets them learn not only by thinking about concepts but through hands-on experience as well. \n\nThis set can also be used in schools, allowing students to find solutions and turn parts into whole constructions. An experiment guide walks children through the process of building the amusement park ride models. The manual contains complete details on the three inquiry-based engineering projects that are easy for kids to follow and implement. This STEAM toy is specially designed for children in grade levels 5\u20129, ages 8 and up. It is best used by one to three children at a time, promoting camaraderie, teamwork, and social skills. \n\nLet children have fun while learning with the K\u2019NEX Education STEM Explorations Swing Ride Building Set.",

      "EXPERIMENT GUIDE \u2013 The three included experiments contain complete details on conducting the hands-on, inquiry-based engineering projects based around the models and include information about the different parts and pieces. Parents can assist their children in the beginning until kids get the hang of it.",
      "PROMOTES TEAMWORK \u2013 Specially designed for children ages 8 and up, this engineering set is more fun when constructed with friends. Students in grades 5\u20129 can create the models alone or with two other classmates. Through teamwork, students will learn how mass affects speed, how to gear up and gear down, and much more! The set promotes camaraderie and the development of social skills, too.",
      "STEAMagination : It\u2019s the connection of STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts & math) with a child\u2019s natural curiosity and creativity and it powers the fun of each and every K\u2019NEX building set. Building with K\u2019NEX puts children on a path towards a fundamental understanding of STEAM/STEM subjects.",
      "LESSON PLANS AND EXPERIMENTS: All K\u2019NEX Education sets come with either a comprehensive guide for teachers or an experiment guide for student-led learning.
