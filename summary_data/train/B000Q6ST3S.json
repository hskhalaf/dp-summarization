My work bench is sturdy so I prefer to have it at waist height. I like how simple the design is and with it mounted to a separate 2x4 I can remove it when it is not in use.",

When a can is crushed, its center of gravity moves in a random pattern, so there's a fair chance the can will fall out the front of the crusher as you're mashing on the handle. (I don't recommend holding the can in with your other hand, as you might injure yourself.) This doesn't happen too often, though. Other than that it's a nice accessory in my home - frees up a good amount of space in the recycle bin.",

I use it on the floor of the kitchen, which requires two hands but also means that I don't have to worry about holes in any walls. For speed's sake I dent each can before crushing.

I planned on keeping my other crusher up, however after using the Crusher on a couple of cans, I pulled my old can crusher down. I am now in the process of crushing all my previously crushed cans. The Crusher does such a great job I was able to 40% more cans in a bag. I would recommend this to anyone serious about recycling and crushing cans.",
