      "text": "Great toy for baby into toddler years! Only complaint is the balls are a little flimsy so they crush when my baby grabs and chews them. Only suggestion would be to secure the bottom mat to the unit itself because the string attached to the mat is not tight enough to hold it securely (I actually attached it with some small zip ties.) Love bright colors and the toys are cute, mine loves the mirror. Can\u2019t wait to see her continue to play with this as she gets bigger!",

      "text": "This is a fun toy for our 8-month old. She's just started sitting and likes to sit at this toy and play with the toys hanging from it. The toy comes in a few pieces: The main \"frog eyes\" and then the two arms which just snap in. The yellow track is snapped together in two pieces and then snaps to the frog. The yellow track doesn't stay together great and doesn't stay attached to the frog well either. But it doesn't really matter - she still has fun. The balls go in the frog and roll down and around the track. The toy also folds flat. We've used this feature to take it in the car to the grandparents.",

Nieces and nephews love it too. We use to have a cat and I bet he would have loved it too. For moms with lots of kids, this is a life saver when you need to get lunch made.",

The frog takes them in and they go around the track. The toys are cute and easy to get to and play with. This is steady and doesn't tip even if tugged on. The little mat is easy to wash. It does have the ability to be made into a toy for older babies too.",

      "text": "My baby nephew has been using this for months. He is now 8 months old and still likes using it. The assembly was a snap, literally it snapped together. The items hanging above have provided lots of entertainment and tactile stimulation. Now that he is starting to stand (with help), he really enjoys putting the balls on the top and seeing them come down the sides. The mat is very easy to clean. This toy has grown with him and I think he will get more use of it in the months to come.",
