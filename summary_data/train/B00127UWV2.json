It has some sort of display on the top, but where I have it, I can never see the display - so I have no idea what it says.",

Nothing has changed on my network and there have been no environmental changes where the router is located. I contacted DLink support and their suggestions have been less than helpful (reflash firmware, relocate to another location, ect..). I followed their advice and downgraded the firmware and also upgraded to a beta firmware found on the site below and it made no difference. Apparently others have been having the same problem: [...] I am hoping top get DLink to replace or refund my money.",

It's great for short range environments. I tested the Belkin N+ and the range outperformed the Dlink 855 by far.

    "description": "D-Link DIR-855 Xtreme N Duo Dual Band Draft 802.11n Media Router\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nThe D-Link Xtreme N Duo Media Router (DIR-855) is the latest addition to the Award-winning Xtreme N product family. The Duo technology in the DIR-855 supports dualband (2.4 and 5 GHz) wireless signals at the same time. This allows you to check e-mail and browse the Internet using the 2.4 GHz band while simultaneously streaming High-Definition (HD) movies and other media on the 5 GHz band. The DIR-855 is designed for users looking to get a true HD wireless connection that can handle multiple HD video streams throughout the house, while being backward compatible with your existing 802.11g and 802.11a products.\n\nThe D-Link Xtreme N Duo Media Router (see larger image). \n\n4 Gigabit Ethernet ports in the rear (see larger image). KEY FEATURES\n * Wireless N connectivity for superior wireless performance, clarity, and coverage  \n   \n   \n * Dual-band Wireless N connectivity for enhanced throughput (2.4 and 5 GHz simultaneously)  \n   \n   \n * Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) for secure, simple 1-button setup  \n   \n   \n * Intelligent QoS technology prioritizes both wired and wireless Internet traffic to enable enhanced gaming and phone calling (VoIP) experience  \n   \n   \n * Capable of streaming audio and video to compatible UPnP-enabled devices  \n   \n   \n * Active Firewall protection  \n   \n   \n * 4 Gigabit Ethernet ports for ultra-fast wired connectivity  \n   \n   \n * Secure your wireless network using advanced WPA or WPA2 encryption \n * Backward compatible with 802.11g and 802.11a devices including game consoles and digital media players \n * Supports Good Neighbor Policy--will not interfere with other wireless networks \n\n5 GHZ TECHNOLOGY\nThe DIR-855 utilizes the 5 GHz band, which is the best technology available for wirelessly streaming multiple HD videos across your network. It achieves this by operating in a clear wireless band to avoid interference that may slow down and limit the range of current wireless technologies like 802.11g**.\n\nSHAREPORT\nWith SharePort technology you can connect a USB printer or storage device to your router and allow users to access them from anywhere on the network. Conveniently turn your existing USB printers and storage devices into network devices for everyone to share.\n\nWHY INTELLIGENT QOS IS BETTER\nWith some routers, all wired and wireless traffic, including Voice over IP (VoIP), Video Streaming, Online Gaming, and Web browsing are mixed together into a single data stream. By handling data this way, applications like Streaming Video could pause or delay. With the D-Link Intelligent QoS Prioritization Technology, wired and wireless traffic are analyzed and separated into multiple data streams. These streams are then categorized by sensitivity to delay, so applications like VoIP, Video Streaming, and Online Gaming are given priority over Web browsing. This enables multiple applications like Streaming Video and Gaming to stream smoothly to your TV or PC.\n\nDelivering best-in-class performance, network security, and coverage, the Xtreme N Duo Media Router (DIR-855) is the ideal centerpiece for your wireless network in the home or office.\n\nGET READY FOR THE FUTURE: IPV6 EQUIPPED\nWith the growing number of Internet-enabled applications requiring IP addresses, the supply of IP addresses under the current Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) system has already been exhausted. The IPv6 protocol solves this network addressing exhaustion by creating more IP addresses, but migration from IPv4 to IPv6 is not necessarily automatic. No worries--this D-Link product is IPv6 Certified and ready for the future.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\nXtreme N Duo Media Router, 3 detachable antennas, CAT5 Ethernet cable, power adapter, CD-ROM with installation wizard and product documentation\n\n* Requires SharePort Client Utility installation on the PC. SharePort upgrade is available for the hardware versions A1, A2.\n\n** Maximum wireless signal rate derived from IEEE Standard 802.11g, 802.11a, and 802.11n specifications. Actual data throughput will vary. Network conditions and environmental factors, including volume of network traffic, building materials and construction, and network overhead, lower actual data throughput rate. Environmental factors will adversely affect wireless signal range. Wireless range and speed rates are D-Link relative performance measurements based on the wireless range and speed rates of a standard Wireless G product from D-Link. Maximum throughput based on D-Link's 802.11n devices.\n\n\n\nSee more",
