Not the best tripod out there, but definitely best option under $100. No complaints regarding manufacturing quality. Smooth head movement and the whole tripod feels sturdy for it's weight.

You can remove the ball mount, leaving a 3/8 screw, or you can use the ARCA-compatible 1/4 plate ball mount on top. The tripod is well made. All parts move smoothly. I like the use of thumb cams on the legs to extend the legs. I like the positive detents to lock the legs at specific angles. My one critique (why 4 rather than 5 stars) is that the the choice of fixed angles for legs misses an intermediate angle between having too narrow and too wide tripod stance.",

All of the clamps are well built and they hold good. The screw knobs on the head are very easy and smooth to use, it does not take much tightening to hold the ball head steady in place. Also, this tripod has more features and was cheaper!",
