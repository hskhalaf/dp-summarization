      "text": "This product top is so curved that my husband and I could not get the top on- as this is more than halfway through the construction we did not discover the problem until an hour into putting this together and then proceeded to spend another 2 hours trying to figure out what was wrong. My hands became bruised and has micro cuts. My back hurt so bad that I couldn\u2019t fall asleep. I have put together other furniture before and this was the first time I\u2019ve ever received a defective piece so shame on the Walker Edison company for sending out products they know are defective.",

I bought two, and for one of the two, we were given screws of an incorrect size. If we had a power drill, it would be no big deal, but we do not. It took 3x the amount of time to assemble because we ended up using nails to hammer them in. The other table had the right size, but still hard to screw in. GET/USE A POWER DRILL! The assembly is literally my only complaint. I\u2019m going to go order a drill now.",
