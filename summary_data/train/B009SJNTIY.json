        "The E1i-A3's picture can't match the black-level performance of some competing LED TVs, and suffers from some uniformity issues",

My serial number is not listed, but the problems with the set are the same. I have reached out to Vizio and will update this review based on my experience there. Recall Information:",

They offered discounted replacement pricing on a new E70u-d3 for $1200. I passed for obvious reasons. $1600 on a new tv should last more than a 1 year warranty. Do not buy a Vizio. There's a reason they are the cheapest. High hopes but utter disappointment.",

After owning it for awhile though, I've begun to get spots on the screen where light fades through. It's not the biggest deal in the world, but I'm a person who can't help but to focus on those type of things once I notice them. The Smart aspect of the television could be quite a bit better. Very slow/clunky to use. We just use an Apple TV through it and ignore it all together now. Overall, would recommend at a good price. Otherwise, there are better out there for the money.",

I find that motion blur in some Dish Network high definition channels is much more annoying on this TV than my smaller TV's. The motion blur is caused by Dish Network compression, not by the TV. One other issue is some non-uniform backlighting along the bottom edge of the screen. However, this is only noticeable with a solid white background. Overall, I recommend this TV",

Great size (measure 62\" wide and 69\" or so diagonally), but you will need a good tv stand if you aren't mounting this thing. Yes, do as it says and have another person help you.

      "text": "I bought three of these for our conference rooms. They are monsterous and delivered with care. Over the years I have had TV's that do not want to sync when 40+ft HDMI cables are used. This model seems to work perfectly fine with a wide range of computers / laptops. Plenty of inputs... bright... thin for it's size... pretty solid. Con - The initial setup is a PITA. The remote isn't intuitive and you are forced to jump through some hoops before the TV can be used. I can't speak to the \"smart\" features of the TV... don't use them.",

The picture controls work well and once I had it dialed in I was quite happy. I have 4 Vizio's in my home (yes we watch a lot of TV). All of them have worked well.
