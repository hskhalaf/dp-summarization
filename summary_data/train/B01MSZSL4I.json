The headphones are light, extremely comfortable and fold up quite small. There is a basic but perfectly usable carrying case. Overall I am very happy to with these headphones.",

I had one problem with them in that when playing with certain apps, the volume controls behaved strangely, and as those apps worked perfectly well with other bluetooth devices I can only summise that the problem was with these. I'm dropping a star for that, but the problem does seem to have gone away with some software update.",

The inline controls only work when the headset is powered and operating wirelessly. The built in EQ would only work with tracks played through their app, which was pretty terrible. The EQ on the Android OS wasn't compatible with them. Seriously, I have a \u00a330 pair of SoundMagic ear buds that sound infinitly better than these.",

As you realise once you purchase these headphones, the ear cups are really small and look embarrassing; however if you slightly crumple your wider, flimsy part of your ear into the cup so that all the ear fits in the cup, you are wearing it appropriately. This allows your to experience the actual ANC aswell as the high sound quality which other reviewers do not experience as they place the headphones ontop of their ears ( the ANC is much more pronounced when worn this way).",

The noise cancellation is very weak, it cancels only background noise, so if someone is speaking near you, you can pretty well hear them. The Bluetooth connectivity was alright, they always say they're disconnected even if they are, but they work so that's alright in the end. The sound quality is on point, what I'd expect. They are also pretty comfortable to wear, especially on the top of my head, where I typically get pain after many hours - well, not with these. My ears fit alright under, but if someone has bigger ears, they might not find them as comfortable.",

The mic quality is average, it's acceptable but really, it's not great. You will also feel your face or ears getting a little hot after long usage sessions. Not much air can escape and therefore you do heat up. This isn't a problem for me as I usually take them off for a few minutes break every hour or two during long sessions anyway but if you do plan on wearing them for 4-5 hours you should expect to take them off for a few minutes.",

Noise cancelling is ok on trains and planes: but if you're on a long haul flight, or listening to a Wagner opera in a single take (or indeed both) I wouldn't recommend them. They are too heavy, and prolonged use is bad for the neck. And if you are planning to use them for regular commutes (if such a thing exists nowadays) you will need to buy a sturdier case than the one supplied.",

      "text": "Very disappointed. Considering the price, and generally positive reviews all over the internet, I expected great sound, but the sound is tinny, unclear, distant, has no base, and lacks detail & richness. It sounds like I'm playing the music out my phone's speaker, or those cheap aeroplane headphones they give you to watch movies (especially after owning a pair of Beats headphones for years, which now sound godly in comparison). The fact that my old apple earphones sound considerably better than these, apparently, 'top of the range' headphones (for their price) is laughable. I'll be returning them as soon as I get the chance.",

For most classical/soundtrack or other instrumental music, including lo-fi/beats it sounds great. Also works nicely for spoken audio/podcasts.",

A reasonable price for what they give would be in the \u00a360 ballpark. Overall, dissapointed I didnt go for another set.",
