Pros- - 5 slots for credit cards including a hidden one - hole in the ID slot makes it easy to slip out my ID when purchasing items -Magnet for the money clip is extremely strong. It will attach to a car if I am wearing basketball shorts which I think is funny. Cons- -I was worried about the magnet demagnetizing my credit cards but I haven't had a problem since I got this wallet a month ago. All in All I would recommend",

Having recently been a victim of bank fraud while traveling abroad I wanted to get a wallet that blocked scanning well. So as soon as we returned home I ordered this. Unfortunately as far as the RFID blocking capabilities it left much to be desired. I tested this with a few cards and readers at work and I could scan every single one. Tried different pockets and they all failed. A coworker has a different, hard shell wallet and it worked perfectly. I will have to go for function over form I guess!",

This simply isn't a practical wallet for a man who doesn't want their cards erased in the wallet. Better luck next time",

Only complaint is that it says \"full grain leather\" in the description and it clearly is not. Full grain leather is super thick - not sacrificing any layer of the animal skin. Because of this, the edges don't typically need to be folded and stitched. This leather, while appearing durable, is anything but thick and is folded and stitched along all edges.",

I'm hundreds of miles from home, so I'm going to know really soon if the wallet wiped all my cards... will report back soon...

Other then the amount of space, if you are someone that keeps it simple then I would recommend as it really keeps everything so tight and organized. I mainly bought this because the ID came out so fast, which works great. No complaints in my position.",

It is as slim as advertised, and holds everything inside very snuggly. It's actually a challenge to get a card out sometimes, but I'd rather have it be too tight than too loose. It's very comfortable to have in any pocket. The build quality seems sturdy so far, I suppose time will tell on that front. NOTE: This is NOT a wallet for the person that carries 26 different cards at once; you'll need to pick your top 5 or 6 and perhaps rotate them out, because this wallet won't hold more than that .",
