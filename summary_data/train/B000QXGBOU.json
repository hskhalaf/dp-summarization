I have normal to dry skin and my face is very sensitive to certain face lotions. Some face lotions make my eye lids puffy and swell up but I can put this lotion all over my face and around my eye without any problems! By far the best face lotion I\u2019ve ever used",

Not only did it come quickly (other products, I can't say the same unfortunately) but it was exactly how it was presented-untampered, functional pump, fantastic on the skin and packaging that was appropriate and protected it well.
