It was an easy install and the instructions were easy to follow. I put my seasonings in the shelves and the cabinet looks more organized than it ever has. Now I'm going to get more organization in my kitchen with the rev-a- shelf items that I've been looking for and not to pay the expected $500 for the caninet that would've come from Lowes or Jericho companies. Thank you so much for alleviating my money worries for the things I really want in my new kitchen!!!",
