And because they have extra padding, they tend to be a little bit bulkier than some of the cheaper skinny flash drives. But they feel good in your hand. I have never experienced an issue with their functionality. With regard to value, I have to say there are some cheaper ones out there, but the reviews on them are less than stellar. I haven't had any issues with these and therefore I can recommend them without hesitation.",

It's common for that number to be off a little on all storage drives, but this one only has 12.2Gb of space available. Almost 4Gb is NOT a little bit. That's a fourth of the advertised memory that isn't there! Since I had to use this for a OS recovery backup for my laptop which required 11.8Gb of space, I had barely enough room for it! Corsair/Amazon needs to point this out for customers who actually need the space advertised. Otherwise, you'll be in for the same surprise as me!",

It allows me to back up all important data and photos, which is not only a good idea for backup purposes, but enables my data to be completely transportable without taking a laptop. The rubberized unit is attractive, water resistant, and apparently indestructible. The data transfer seemed somewhat slow when I received the unit...noticeably slower than my 4GB Apacer drive. But I reformatted the Corsair Flash Drive using Windows Vista, and it sped things up. On a 2GB test, it sped up the transfer rate by about 35%. All in all, this is a good value.",

Once removing the rubber cap and inserting into my XP based PC, it's recognized quickly as an external drive. Transfer rates are quick. The drive being fully housed in rubber appears to have additional protection from dirt and moisture, although I havent put it to the test. Based on my experience, I'd purchase one again.",

I sent Corsair an e-mail and they sent me a new cap. The cap on the 32Gig Corsair Voyager I purchased this past month seems to stay on much better.

      "text": "This product works great. It does what it is supposed to do. However, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because its design makes it less convenient with plugging it in next to other USB devices. It comes with an extension USB cord to solve the problem, but it's just less convenient to have to use this cord every time. Also, the cap falls off very easily. I wanted to give it only 3 stars because of its design, but the most important thing is its functionality. Bottom line: it works. It just has design flaws.",

The Voyager has been a reliable, problem free tool for transporting my life between work and home. 8GB, 16Gb, same reliability, same ease of use, same lack of overhead. Downsides are few. The cap that covers the USB plug can wander at times. It would be useful to have it attached. Also, I have found that save times for Word documents increased when going from the 8 to 16GB versions. Quibbles. This is superior, simple technology and I do not know how I survived without it.",
