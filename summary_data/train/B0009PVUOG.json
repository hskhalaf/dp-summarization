This one weighs no more than a 4 person tent bag, which is awesome. I have 10 of these for our volleyball club, and we use them for our tournaments with AA, club level play and they hold up year after year. Very very good nets for amazing price. The bad -- order a set of professional 2\" boundary lines, as the ones that come with it is just a thin string, which you COULD use, but its definitely not the way to go.",

      "text": "First, if you are a grass player it's 5 stars. But if you play in sand it's missing the mark. First, there needs to be a base for the poles in sand. Every time one tightens the net, the net net gets lower since each pole sinks deeper into the sand. Second, if you get one grain of sand in between the collapsible poles they will not move. There needs to be a plastic bushing between the two pieces which allows for sand. At this point, I'm on the fence to send it back to Amazon for a refund.",

    "title": "Park & Sun Sports Spectrum Classic: Portable Professional Outdoor Volleyball Net System",
    "description": "The Park & Sun Sports Spectrum Classic portable outdoor volleyball net system is our flagship set for professional, tournament-level volleyball. This set is a perennial favorite of tournament directors and competitive players alike. This volleyball net system is designed with premium, powder-coated telescopic aluminum poles that measure 2\" in diameter. These 2-piece poles feature a push-button locking system, allowing you to easily adjust the net to men's (8'), women's (7' 4\") and co-ed (7' 8\") playing heights. The Park & Sun Sports Spectrum Classic volleyball net system features our regulation size Spectrum net, which measures 32' L x 3' H, and is pre-attached to the poles. This nylon net has 3\" top and bottom tapes with reinforced corners and is equipped with convenient 6\" side sleeves, which distributes the net tension evenly from the top to the bottom of the net. Nylon netting is superior at withstanding harsh weather compared to lower-end polyethylene (PE) nets, so you can enjoy the game for years to come. The 5/16\" double guyline with padded pull down handles allow for quick adjustments that ensure the net remains taut, even during rough play. For added stability, (4) 12\" forged steel ground stakes are also included. Define your court with the 5/16\" diameter, pre-measured boundary (60' L x 30' W) which is firmly secured to the ground with corner anchors. When not in use, the cord winder keeps the boundary wrapped up without tangles. This entire set fits inside a heavy-duty 1800 denier polyester zippered equipment bag with carrying handles; making transporting and storing extremely convenient.",
