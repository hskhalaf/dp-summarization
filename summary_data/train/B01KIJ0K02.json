The sound quality is crystal clear sometimes, but the bluetooth seems to struggle keeping a good connection. Most of the time the sound quality sounds like you've been put on hold after calling some cheap customer service phone line (scratchy and low quality). I've seen this same problem pairing to both my Macbook and my phone. I do like the magnetic clip though. It can be used to store the headphones without them getting tangled in your pocket.",
