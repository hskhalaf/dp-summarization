Only complaint I have is they darkened my boots slightly, it says they should return to their original color in a few days but it has been 5 days and they are still darker.",

Our Leather Oil is a quick way to revive the natural shine of your leather with a deep-conditioning combination of flaxseed oil, vitamin-e, and our proprietary blend of all-natural essential oils. Finally, use our Boot Wax for an added layer of protection and water repellency.
