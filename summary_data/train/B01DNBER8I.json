      "text": "I am new to infusing and decided to get a pitcher that would contain the fruit in one place so it wouldn't go pouring over the side of the container and making a mess. This pitcher does the job, and I appreciate that it is glass rather than plastic. The only drawbacks are that I wish the pitcher were larger overall and that there was a little more room for fruit in the infusion compartment. I had been using a gallon glass jar, but I cannot find a glass pitcher even approaching that capacity. So, aside from having to refill quite frequently, this pitcher works well and looks nice.",

The handle of the pitcher is placed perfectly, and it is easy to grab and hold while pouring. Made a strawberry, lime, cucumber infusion and in the pitcher it made an elegant presentation. Really like the additional strainer at the spout to clear out the little fruit bits before they reach the glass. It is also easy to dismantle and wash. I do hand wash, but it is worth it to keep the glass pretty and clear.",

There are only two aspects that bother me so far. First is the size. This pitcher is a decent size and gives me 3-4 glasses, but it'd be nice to have more volume in case I entertain or want to have something for a family for more than one meal. Second is pour rate. It doesn't dispense fluid that fast, something that may be a result of the tall, narrow design.",

Cut tags off of the bags and put 6 of them in the infuser and after an over night brewing had a pitcher full of tea! I know that the glass is supposed to be safe in terms of hot water in making tea, but am a little leery of the infuser standing up to boiling water over time. Consequently I will stick with cold water brewing and will be happy with the pitcher as long as it continues to function as it has after this first usage.",
