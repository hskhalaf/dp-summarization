The #1 was exactly 32 degrees exactly. #2 was off, it registered 35 degrees. I am fine with this because I normally use only one probe at a time. I do wish it had a calibration mode, but it doesn\u2019t. You just place the probes in iced water for 10 minutes, then make sure the probe isn\u2019t touching any glass for at least a minute. The temp should be at 32 degrees if correct.",

Just use your high end instant read thermometer probe and get consistently cut steaks from your butcher/grocery store and know your grills hot/cold spots.

The manufacturer has a responsibility to me - their customer - to insure I can use it with relative ease.",

It is super accurate, it's easy to care for (just don't get the top sensor thingy wet) and it makes a nice ruckus when the correct temp has been reached; I can hear it anywhere in my small house.

Pellet smoker use is great to have cook temp and food temp on same gauge and magnet mount is perfect. I will keep it and just subtract 8 degrees from the readings or have an additional device when temp gets close. The temp alarms are very annoying as you have to reset them to silence and there is no way to turn them off permanently.",
