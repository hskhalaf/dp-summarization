      "text": "About 30 miles from DC. Flat 50-mile antenna could pick up 30-odd channels, but not all by facing the same direction unless I hung it outside. I'd also have needed tacks or Velcro as it could not hang flush on the window/wall and kept falling. Solved the issues with this unit that claims 10 more miles in range and, perhaps more importantly, has a dedicated VHF receiver for the few channels using it. It's sitting indoors and I don't have to move it. NOTE: Co-ax cable not included, and I screwed it to a wooden bookshelf. The mounting design really doesn't secure it well in this position, but it balances with enough friction to stay upright indoors.",

      "text": "I had trouble picking up a station that is broadcasting a mere 13 miles from me. It is one of the few broadcast stations in my area that went back to digital transmission on its original VHF frequency. I tried all sorts of antennas, indoor, outdoor, directional, multidirectional. You name it, I tried it. All of them picked up the channels broadcasting in the UHF range, but none of them would pick up the VHF transmission of WMC-5 from Memphis in Millington -- until I installed this antenna on the roof of my mobile home. Not only do I now get Channel 5, I also picked up several new stations I did not even know existed.",

Looking closer, about half were Spanish, not something I speak, and half he remaining were very weak signals that would probably prove irritating to try to watch.

I was both amazed and surprised at the results I got with out even \"fine-tuning\" the antenna positioning. I just guessed at the right direction by eye, then locked it down. wOW!",

I got the 35 mile one and it was enough to reach the nearest towers. I do live in a major city, and the nearest towers were around 20-30 miles away. (3) It's been reliable so far. No major hiccups.
