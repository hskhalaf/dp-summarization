      "text": "So far, after 10 days of using, sitting in my back pocket with about 10-15 bills clipped, all card slots filled to the brim ( I have about 10 cards), it seems like a great product so far, I'll update it if an issue arises. Unlike the cheap versions of these wallets, there is no wrinkling of the leather, no cheap adhesive holding the compartments together to cause residue on your cards, and best of all, I can actually slide out my ID card easily. This wallet is great if you need a minimalist wallet and you don't carry many cards, just the bare essentials like credit cards, insurance cards (for emergencies), and some gift cards!",

I thought that it would be more rigid, not as flappy (see picture). The only use I see for the magnet is for cash, which, I do not have most of the time. If you happen to have a lot of cash on you most of the time this I would reccomend this wallet.",
