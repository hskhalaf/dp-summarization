We have been working on a family history photo project for several years and have always used the HP printers and been pleased with their performance. I purchased my Sony DPP_FP30 to try something new (since HP's don't like refilled cartridges anymore). One photo printed and I am hooked and will never go back. The clarity and quality of the print is far beyond any I have ever been able to produce in the past. I wish the paper was a little less expensive but will look for a sale and stock up. Hands down and no questions asked I am thrilled with my new printer.",

I've tried cleaning the print head, checking for visible loose/broken parts, and replacing the ink cartridge and paper several times to no avail. It's past the 1 yr warranty, so it'll be going out in my trash soon.",

The utility that they used to clean it is impossible for the consumer to access, so you have to send it in. I've purchased two printing packs which were supposed to produce 80 pictures each. I only have 90 pictures to show for it. I'm waiting for Sony to resolve the situation. My husband bought it for me for Mother's Day, so I could print our baby's pictures easily.
