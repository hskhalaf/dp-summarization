The tongs being able to hook onto the side kept them out of the way and the garnish tray was nice for our limited space.",

Anyway, I\u2019ve been sneaking this thing out onto the back porch in the evenings to hold some extra ice for my sippin bourbon. I love sittin on the back porch in the evening and enjoying a glass or two while watching the cattle from a comfortable chair. Don\u2019t judge! Usually, all of my ice melts from the South Texas heat, but this little ice bucket holds the ice up pretty darn nice!",

There's no condensation on the outside thanks to its insulation and opening the lid to remove the ice it very easy.
