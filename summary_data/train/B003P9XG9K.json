I've suggested that Amazon add a photo of the back of the bag as they have for other Blue Buffalo treats so that pet owners can check the complete list of ingredients before purchasing. Otherwise, I am certain that the Health Bars are an excellent product as is everything from Blue Buffalo. They just didn't meet our dog's dietary requirements.",
