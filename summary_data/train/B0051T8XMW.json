It takes about 15 minutes to heat up a full tank. TIP: dampen the pad before you use. This will prevent pad \"sticking\" to the floor and help it to glide easier. Well worth the money.

Be careful though, if you take too long of a break, the steam will cool in the hose and your next press will be a stream of water, so have a little bucket handy to do you initial shoot.

I almost look forward to steaming my shower and bathroom - notice I say \"almost\"; it does make cleaning easier. I highly recommend this steamer.",

In the past Ive used the Swiffer Wet Jet and went thru three of them in under a year because I kept braking the handle/wand, so I think I'm a bit aggressive with wands and I use too much pressure. Otherwise it's a great steamer and I love it! I highly reccomended this steamer.",
