It is self propelled. My older model is not. The canister is easy to dump. This design is great because the dirt and dog hair does not wrap around the filter as it does in my older model. I may end up buying another one for my house. Highly recommend.",

This vacuum is great, it has lots of suction power, I mean it will easily lift up area rugs. It maneuver easily between table legs and furniture and it was a pleasure to use on both carpet, tile and hard wood floors. The only con would be when you extend it while vacuuming, it actually lifts up off the carpet slightly which reduces suction. This just seems like a design flaw. Other than that I think it's an all around great performer. Andre",

      "text": "So far, so good. After a month, I like the adjustable length wand, which helps with the ceiling. The head lays flat to go under the bed. The dust canister is easy to empty. The beater head works well. The hose is long enough to move about easily, but not too long as to get tangled around the furniture. I have not yet needed to clean the HEPA filter, so i guess most of the fine dust is being captured before it reaches that filter. The \"3-in-1\" upholstery brush is poorly designed. It's not going last. I anticipate needing to replace it with a sensible set of tools.",

Gets into small spaces easier than wider ones, and the smaller head concentrates suction for a better clean. The bagless system is good, it does kick up some dust when you empty it, so you do have to be mindful of how you are dumping and where if that is a concern. The container is easy to rinse out as well if that too is a concern.",

I'm used to an Oreck upright... use it over and over and just wrap the cord and put it away. This bagless WindTunnel needs cleaning after each round of the house. Cannister needs dumping, filter need cleaning, and the brush that works well getting the cat hair out of the carpet needs cleaning also. That must be the trade-off for having a bagless vacuum cleaner. If I were to rate it against other cannisters, I may have scored it higher. P.S. The cord is too short.",
