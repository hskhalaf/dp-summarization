The one I received isn't \"30 x 20 x 8 inches\" as listed in the \"Product information Technical Details\" section; it's 22\" from back to the front, and a 2\" difference is excessive. There's also a very small difference in the length, but it's a variation expected for handmade. This particular sink may take up too much extra space and possibly require a cabinet modification. It has a couple of tiny flaws anyway. Otherwise, it looks amazing, like a nice piece of art. It's heavy and beautifully shaped.",
