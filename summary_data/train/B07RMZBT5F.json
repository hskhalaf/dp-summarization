      "text": "This particular shoe felt good while running on a track (gravel surface) with minimal impact on each stride. If you reference my picture, you can see where the issue with friction occurs. The outside ankle bone is irritated by the low design of the shoes material. This might be isolated to certain runners with particular feet, I\u2019m not sure. It\u2019s not a manufacturer\u2019s fault that one shoe can\u2019t accommodate the vast types of feet. So I would frankly pay attention to details in design and make your own judgement. I am deciding to keep this shoe and make slight adjustments (cutting) to that particular area. Thank you!",

Just walking around the house made my feet hurt. I am extremely dissapointed with this garbage shoe and will have to switch brands again.",

Since they've had this fit issue since arriving, I have to assume they arrived broken. For a $150 shoe, this is unacceptable.
