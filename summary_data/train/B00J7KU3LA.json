As a result the suction is not nearly as strong as the Nose Frida which has a wider nose tube. We have been using the Nose Frida since our baby was a newborn and now in retrospect I wish I started with this instead and transitioned to the Nose Frida now (after 12 months). This isn't a bad gadget but it should be advertised as something for newborns to 12 month old babies.",

The tip to this one seems much softer and she hasn't cried once or rejected it like she did with the one from the hospital. And it works! Her boogs went right into the little container thing (not in my mouth!!! No worries there haha). It was still a pain to suck them out, which is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5. But I feel infinately better using this for my baby than the other one and am very happy with it! Great purchase",

Obviously no baby is going to like this at all but this item has definitely been life changing for our newborn. It also comes apart very easily and is very easy to clean and put right back together!!

Next time I'll try to figure out how to put tissue in it as a filter, but it always backs into the tube. If you've ever used an open system breast pump, if you tilt it a certain way the milk will go back in the tube.... same idea. We both have the same cold right now, so I can get past it for now. Cleaning wasn't bad. Soak in soapy water. It doesn't hold as much as the snot sucker, but if your baby has tiny nostrils you'll get a better seal.",

      "text": "This is now in daily use. It's frustrating when your baby is still too young for medicine and they have a bad cold. He couldn't breath and the doctor recommended a humidifier (which we purchased) but that wasn't clearing his nose. I tried a couple of other products and nothing worked. This came up in my \"recommendations\" and I purchased it and put it to use the second it arrived. It's the only thing that allowed him breath through his nose and get some relief. He was able to breath and sleep. I love it! Highly recommend this product.",

Only reason i docked 1 star is because the case broke when I just had in her diaper bag.

Baby who is 22 months, isn't terrified of it as he thinks it's kind of funny (I showed him how it works before placing it against his nostril).
