I love how compact they are and that they use a regular AAA battery (Which you can put a spare one of in the included pouch) instead of having to charge a battery that may die on you. The plug adapter for the two-prong earphone jacks on some planes is great. Are they as good as Bose full headphones for noise canceling? No. But they do make a HUGE difference on those long flights. Note - if using as normal headphones, the sound will not be as good as when you put on the noise canceling feature.",

If you ever fly witout a spare battery you will understand how this is useful. Battery life is good. Well worth the money.",

The foam tips might cancel more of the noise out but hurt my ears way too much so I only tested them with the silicone tips. I have very small ear canals.",

The problem is that the pack is placed too far from the ear buds to clip onto sometime like your collar or breast pocket, and too far from the jack to clip onto the pock where you have your phone/audio device.",

There's a little bag for storage, but that doesn't help with the wires-every-which-way issue. The wires are also pretty flimsy.

I would never wear these while walking or moving, but I'm hoping they're okay for a flight where I'm relatively stationary. I would recommend spending the money on something nicer.",

Audio technica is known for their sound and their noise canceling tech is almost up to par. The only reason I deducted a star is because the pair I previously owned crapped out after 7 months. Not bad for headphones, but still pretty crapped for a product that costs $55.",

      "text": "Maybe I have too high expectations; I've used both Bose QuietComfort and several aviation noise reduction headsets. These did just about nothing for noise reduction. My \"gold standard test\" for noise reduction is to turn on the kitchen range fan, stand a couple of feet away with the headset in place, and then turn the noise reduction on. Result with these: Just about no change in the noise. With my over-the-ear headsets, I get tremendous reduction. So...back to Amazon they go!",
