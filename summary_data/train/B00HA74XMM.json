The brand name has been trusted for burns and scrapes for many years; so, I thought I would keep tubes in several locations for quick relief. Soon, the first mosquito bite I got; I grabbed the tube. Well, I was still itching an hour later. No relief! I went back to the best method I know - very cold water with some bleach and a cotton pad to apply. Ahhh! Quick results! I don't like the danger of causing bleach spots somewhere; but, the itching needed to be stopped ASAP.",
