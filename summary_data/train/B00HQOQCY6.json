It does what it says it will. Keeps the garage clean and dry. Very easy to clean, just vacuum if dirty, rain water drip from the car evaporates quickly so I've never had to squeegee the water out.

The mat is a good barrier atop the cold concrete floor in the winter. It looks great also. Well worth the money.",

I don't have an opinion on \"Easy to clean\" yet because I haven't needed to do so. With proper application of the right floor tape, the floor mat does not pull up during slight turning of the front wheels while in slow motion. Obviously, fast and sudden movements will pull the floor mat. This is a great product if you rent a place with a private garage and you vehicle leaks a little oil etc.",

I have used the other type of mats available, thick plastic with the locking plastic edging (effectively a car sized plastic tray). These also work well but the downside is that they hold the water in the plastic tray and are hard to move and or empty in the winter because they are not very flexible. I would recommend the Armor All product based on its flexibility and weight.",

    "description": "Size:17' x 7'4\"Whether you want to give your garage a new look, expand your living space or showcase your ride, the Armor All Garage Floor Mats are an easy to install and affordable floor covering option. These mats work great in the garage but also can be used in a basement, exercise area, laundry room or greenhouse. The mat has a carpet-like look and feel, It is soft to walk on, it hides unsightly cracks and stains and installs in just minutes. Dirt, leaves, mud, excess water and other elements get trapped on the mat and help to reduce tracking into your home. The mats are lightweight and extremely durable. Patented Drymate material absorbs and contains liquids and wicks away moisture. The absorbent top layer of our mat is made from a non-woven polyester fabric that easily contains melting snow, water, and other fluids. The bottom layer of our mat features our liquid bonded waterproof backing made from polyolefin. Our waterproof backing stops liquids, motor oil, brake fluid, gasoline, and coolant and prevents these liquids from soaking through to damage or stain the surface below. The waterproof backing also works as a moisture barrier and will protect your vehicles, antique cars, motorcycles, and other equipment from rusting during storage. When installing the mat ensure the surface is clean, roll the mat out, place the mat fabric side up, pull the corners tight and affix Drymate Double Sided Tape to adhere the mat to your surface. The mat will have some wrinkles at first from being packaged but over time these will relax out. Please note that our material can be easily cut to fit with scissors and the edges will not fray or split. Combine multiple mats to cover your entire garage surface. Unlike heavy rubber or vinyl type mats, the Armor All Garage Floor Mat is easy to move and clean. Simply vacuum, hose off or power-wash with a mild detergent. Or just spot clean as needed. Do not bleach. If your mat becomes oversaturated by excess rain, water or melting snow, just squeegee off excess water or wet vac and it will air-dry faster. Armor All Garage Floor Mats are proudly Made in the USA, made from 80% recycled fibers and are Phthalate and BPA free. In the box, we include a 20FT x 1. 5-INCH roll of Drymate Double Sided Tape, Heavy Duty Adhesive. The benefit of our tape is that it allows you to secure the mat in place. WARNING FOR PAINTED OR SEALED FLOORS: Some types of epoxy, paint or sealers may react to waterproof backing causing the mat to stick to the floor or leave a residue. Refer to your epoxy, paint or sealers Manufacturer\u2019s care instructions for precautions or interactions. Allow at least 72 hours after application before installing the mat. Check the flooring under the mat periodically to ensure that the sealed floor and mat are compatible.",
