This book gives me an easy resource to suggest to my patients who want ideas on delicious, quick and healthy recipes. I loved the honey-rosemary almonds as a delicious snack (by themselves or with a cocktail), pastina chicken soup with kale for warming comfort food on a chilly night, roasted broccoli panzanella salad as a hearty, satisfying yet healthy starter, and roasted red pepper chicken with hummus for a seemingly fancy yet easy and delicious dinner. There are lots of vegetarian and gluten free recipes, also delicious!",

They have a recipe for a fruit, veggie, and cheese board. The recipe lists washing and cutting the veggies, fruits, and cheeses and placing on a board.
