Over time (now on my 14th year), I've needed to replace the simple things - grates, flavor bars and even, just recently, the ignition kit. These flavorizer bar replacements are great. They fit perfectly and continue to reflect the same durability of all the Weber-made products. I immediately christened them with a porterhouse steak and a rack of St. Louis ribs. I look forward to many more years of grilling pleasure dripping flavorful fat and sauces on these bars to keep my BBQ recipes tasty!",

To avoid returning the wrong size, make sure you order the bars that fit your model. In a different matter, despite Amazon's push to reduce excess packaging, the outer (Amazon) box they shipped was about 4 or 5 times the size of the inner (Weber) box. No filler padding, so the inner box just slammed around in the huge outer box. Keep trying, Amazon.",

Once every five years or so, replace these to keep the grill making tasty flavor and delivering even heat.

The replacements fit just right; I hope they last a little longer than my other sets. I don't use this second weber that much so I expected better.",

Since these replacement parts carry the Weber name, I expect the same quality and service life. The replacement of burners was straightforward and instructions well written, but did require removal of the flame control knob panel, and gas manifold.",

Since amazon has every order I've ever made available (and there have been a LOT of orders through the years), it was easy to know exactly what model I had and when it was purchased. I didn't have any problems with anything being too short or too long. Not sure why others had so much trouble but I thought I'd document what model grill I have so if you have the same one, you'll know it's going to fit.",
