As a grad student now, I especially print A LOT. I don't use the wireless feature, although I did use bluetooth once in a pinch. I replace the toner maybe twice a year, with low lost recycled toner. Almost always print double-sided. Tip: Avoid loading the paper tray too full; its best at 3/4 or less, or else it may grab multiple pages at once when trying to print to one sheet.",

We also have an HP Photosmart All-in-One which makes great color copies, but we do not use it for any of the black and white copying. HP was extremely smart because their ink ends up costing more than the printer. HP could give the printers away free and HP would still make a fortune off their ink. The negative about the Brother HL-2170W is it is almost impossible to hook up wireless so I have it wired direct to my computer. My HP is also wireless and it hooks very easily.",

It never loses its wireless connection to my home network and it prints pages quickly and quietly.

Having one \"efficient\" printer rather than $50 Lexmark or hp w/ ink cartridges that are very expensive and inefficient connected to each machine is a big bonus. Love to be able to have the laptop connected in the kitchen and print to the printer with no cords or wires. Would buy again. Great quality, and once you figure out the setup, works how it should.",

      "text": "I recently purchased the Brother 2170W from Tiger Direct through Amazon. I purchased it because I was tired of paying $50+ for inkjet ink every couple of months. I am very pleased with the printer. It was easy to setup as a wireless printer (I connected it to my router via cable for setup as recommended). I can print from any computer in my house and it prints very fast. The only drawback is that when they start printing, laser printers are power hungry and the printer caused my computer to shutdown when it saw the power dip. Once I connected the printer to a different outlet, everything was fine. I would highly recommend this printer.",

The built-in network card connects directly to my switch, saving a USB port on my computer, as well as allowing others to print without slowing my machine down. Built in wireless network card is very nice, also. The toner cartridge looks a bit small, and the quantity of pages has yet to be determined. Print quality is good. Set up was easy with the provided CD. A Windows 7 CD is also included. Overall, this small laser printer is a lot of bang for the buck.",

The only downside is that you have to manually feed the paper if you want it double-sided, and it can be kind of tricky to get the printer to pull from the manual feed. Also, there is no manual feed tray, so you have to hold the page in the slot until it pulls it in. Other than that, this is a great printer for the price!",

I had a Brother 2070 printer and loved it, but Amazon is not selling it any more, so I thought I would buy a 2170 and I expected it to be better than 2070 or at least have the same quality. However, 2170 is extremely disappointing. The toner ran out quickly. The printing often went wrong and came out with some nonsense text on the paper. Paper jam is not unusual. I just wish I had returned the printer earlier. So disappointed.",

I am pleased with this light weight laser printer that prints several pages a minute. It does not have color, but the consumables are available at a reasonable price (I believe a $50 cartridge will print 3000 pages).",

I followed the instructions precisely, going through all steps including factory-reset after each failed attempt. Just could not make it work! I have given up for now, and am using it through usb cable. Overall, I'd rather recommend its junior instead, model HL-2170, that seems identical to HL-2170w just w/o the wired/wireless capability (which is NOT functioning at all anyway.)",
