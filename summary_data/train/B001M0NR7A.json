I purchased the medium size which is the color Rhubarb. The sizes are color coordinated hopefully this helps you if you get confused which one to buy. It fit nicely and I did not have any issues with it. Over all I am happy with. Going on my first backpacking trip with this sack and hoping it will last through. I noticed people wrote bad reviews of it ripping but I think they most likely bought the wrong size and over stuffed it. Thanks Kelty!",

      "text": "I recently purchased this for a few backpacking trips I will be taking in the next few weeks. It is working perfectly. I needed to be able to minimize the size of my sleeping bag to fit it into my pack and it was just the right size with a little left over for a few more compressible items. Without this stuff sack I was looking at having to find an alternative way to transport my sleeping bag. I am very pleased with the quality of the product as well. I can tell it is well made and can't wait to utilize this stuff sack more in the future",

      "text": "I got this for 16 weeks of field work with living ranging from tents to camper trailers. I love the storage and compression my only complaint would be that one of the clips for the compression straps stopped working (actually locking against the strap to hold the compression on that side) about half way through. It simply have been that the sack was used and in constant use for almost 4 months. Note it is not water proof but darn close as long as you are not talking about submerging it in a river lake or large puddle, I would not take this one on the water with anything that would be destroyed etc.",

One of the straps ripped off of one of the bags the first time I used it -- yes, I was pulling on it pretty hard, but a compression sack should be able to handle a fairly robust yank. The other bag has held up so far. It does compress the sleeping bag much better than the crappy sack that came with the bag.",
