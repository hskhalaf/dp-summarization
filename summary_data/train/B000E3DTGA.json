There are some useful \"recipes\" printed, but only one scale. Oz's. There should be Cups and Tablespoons as well to be truly useful The lids make this suppliers product a very bad idea.",

Flip lid seals water, but doesn't latch very securely. You'd have to hold it shut if shaking dressing to prevent a mess. VERDICT: Leaks below the cap. Useless. Returned for refund.",
