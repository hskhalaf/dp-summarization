      "text": "So, this product does exactly what it sells to do: 5 stars. However, I had a negative reaction. Large amounts of vitamin A affect serotonin production in the brain and can lead to feelings of depression, lethargy, etc. That was the case for me. I still squeeze this stuff on my skin for some night treatments, and it does help, but I wouldn't recommend taking it orally. I took a vitamin D supplement alongside this to supposedly help with the side effects, but it was generally ineffective. Please be cautious when taking any kind of supplement and do your research beforehand. We all react differently to substances.",
