I'm not a heavy user but I only ever managed a day on my old 6P...I was concerned about moving from native android to Huawei's UI but I needn't have been..its very intuitive, a lot of the pre installed apps are what I would have installed anyway...great camera, great value..Recommended!",

Also, it's a fraction of the price of an iPhone X and Samsung S9, so that ultimately made my decision as all it came down to was screen resolution and pixels. Still a great camera and I'm really enjoying the overall experience of this phone. It's Apple's way or the Huawei and I'm going with the latter!",

Sent it back again and came back OK with power consumption, but with fingerprint problem. Sent it back again for repair but was informed that it is out warranty because of broken/physical damage. The phone was never dropped or damaged by me and I can't see any physical damage. So, I haven't got the chance to actually use the mobile. It has been in the process of repair and now it is out of warranty!",

      "text": "I got this phone as a replacement to my Huawei P10 plus. It's very similar to my previous phone with regards to screen size/sound quality etc. It does have a better feel in terms of build quality but I think that can be expected from a newer and more expensive handset. The camera on this phone is superb. I think the hardware isn't much different to that in the p10plus with the duel camera on the back, but camera software appears to have improved considerably.",

Also love the camera takes excellent shots, video is ok at 1080p but 4K has no image stabilization. I would recommend the Razer Phone USB-C to 3.5 mm Adapter - THX Certified USB Type C to 3.5 mm Jack Audio Adapter, for better volume and sound quality.",

Not sure what it is but coming from a samsung, I'm having a hard time getting spaces between every word when writing at normal pace. Might just take a bit of getting used to. Otherwise phone seems great",
