I've tried new batteries and in multiple computers to eliminate variables. The issue is the buttons, both left and right, are either failing to click or unclicking themselves when I am holding it down. As you can imagine clicking and dragging is infuriating with this issue. I have to \"double click\" things that only require a single click because it didnt engage or just fails to click. This was my favorite mouse style but, I am extremely skeptical of buying another one. Maybe its build quality. Maybe it was a lemon. Either way, I'm disappointed. Lame.",

I didn't buy another M705 because users complained that the latest versions were manufactured with sub par materials and there were missing features. If Logitech is going to change the product then they should change the name. Other than the fit this mouse works fine. I bought and like the red one.

Noticed the new receiver had a much tighter fit in the USB port than the receiver that came with this mouse. Putting this out there in case anyone else experiences the same problem.

It is also fairly jerky and does not scroll smoothly (not much resolution).

I paid more for the Logitech brand, and I'm very disappointed that it didn't last long. Today I purchased the VicTsing to replace it. Yeah, it's an off-brand, but it's half the price and has great reviews. So even if it lasts only eight months, it only cost half as much as the Logitech.",

I've tried every USB port on my computer, different batteries, updated drivers, nothing works. Really ticked off I wasted a notable chunk of money on this crap.

I've only used logitech mice my whole life and unfortunately all of them have issues after 1-2 years (I used to use their $80 gaming mice and stopped after they kept dying randomly).

Boy, what a difference. Very smooth motion, smooth scrolling, and no more mis-clicks. Also, Logitech provides software to not only customize the behavior of the mouse, you can tailor the settings for individual applications.

(last one about 3 years) \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f That said, this mouse is responsive and comfortable. I've only used it a short while, but I know I like it. I got a good sale price on it, so, there's not much to complain about, so far. \ud83d\ude2c Even at full price, the mouse is probably worth it. Well made. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",

      "text": "My desktop computer came with a wired mouse and the cord was always getting caught on something. It's a pleasure to use and is the same size as the mouse that came with the computer. It can be set up for left or right-hand use with software you download from Logitech. I don't care for gaming and don't know if it has a sleep mode but it can be turned off but they claim the batteris provided will last 3 years so I leav it on.",

      "text": "I've only had this mouse since March ( approx 8 months) and despite after changing the batteries 3 times with brand new batteries from Duracell, Energizer, and Kirkland the mouse continues to malfunction. It will stop moving the pointer. I'm disappointed that this mouse has given me problems vs the cheap mini Logitech mouse I bought 5 years ago (small and portable, but not comfortable if you have big hands). I purchased this mouse for my office. It is comfortable and seems to be made with good external materials. The internal components can use some work.",
