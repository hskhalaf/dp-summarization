      "text": "I purchased these spoons after seeing them as part of a display at the Container Store and LOVE them. This is odd to say about a wooden spoon, but these are quality, have a great thick handle that feels good in your hand, have a deep indent on the head, and look great. In traditional Oxo fashion, they feel like a high-end kitchen utensil should. I read other reviews about cracking and splitting, but I simply treated mine with a light amount of mineral oil and they look better and will hold up even better. I rate a perfect 5/5 and would definitely purchase again!!! Thank you for reading and rating my review!",

Even leaving one of the wooden spoons in a chicken stew filled with turmeric for an hour for periodic stirring didn't cause a stain after washing!",
