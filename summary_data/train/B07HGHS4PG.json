When shopping, I was looking for a frame with a superior supporting system as the \"typical\" frame was inadequate. He is a teenager and does not treat much of my furniture gently! I would definitely recommend this product for any individual requiring a frame under similar circumstances. Set up was easy with pictures to assist and I actually did it myself, which is not the way it normally happens as my husband usually does this kind of thing. It's only been a few weeks since set up but nothing appears to have \"loosened\".",

I put an anti-skid rug rubberized pad between mattress and this frame. It's not so much that the mattress slides it's that it's a bit more challenging to make the bed with the wires. That could be solved with some kind of a piece of ply or something else or simply the under pad for a rug. I do like the height as it allows for plenty storage under the bed.",

Instructions were very clear and I was able to put it together within an hour. There was two tiny parts that were cheaply made, but they will not affect the sturdiness of the frame.

However, this is a very sturdy frame, fairly easy to put together, and sits right. I'd just suggest a thicker mattress, or maybe placing a board between mattress and frame. As sturdy as it is, I do feel that if you use this frame daily, it will eventually develop \"squeaks\" as there are a lot of screws and moving components that connect together. That is just an assumption as mine does not squeak, but we bought it specifically as a guest bed that will be used maybe once a month... All-in-all good frame!",

      "text": "I'm not sure if i misunderstood, This was supposedly an EXTRA sturdy bedframe. However six months into using it i rolled onto my elbow one morning while on the edge and the metal strut bent, therefore causing a permanent dip in the frame. When I unpacked it i was suspect by the flimsy feel of the metal, but i was so excited because we've gone through boxsprings and this was supposed to be better. I'll keep using it until i find or build a truly stable platform for a bed!",

I also like the height of it - it is higher than my old frame and I can store stuff easily underneath my bed.",

I've been using the bed for around two weeks now, and there's no complaints from me regarding it. Being a student living on an apartment and a tight budget, this platform bed was the ideal equipment for me. And it was totally worth it. I highly recommend it!",
