      "text": "Like most first-time parents, clipping my LO's nails can be nerve racking, but after a few careful tries, I have to say the window really helps a lot! What I do is look in the window and position my LO's nail (palm face down) into the clipper section. I then position the nail onto the bottom clipper so that the finger is flushed against the outside bottom part and only the nail is within the clipper part. That way I know I won't cut any flesh. It also helps when my LO is not moving so I tend to do this when he's asleep. The filer is a good final touch in making the cut smoother.",

Very gentle and safe. My newborn only objects to me immobilizing their hands to clip nails; I swear they don't event feel the actual clip.",

Because of the way the two blades overlap (instead of connecting at the center like traditional nail clippers) all they did was bend my babies soft flexible fingernails. They did not cut at all. The nail file is a nice feature but what is the point of the nail file if the finger nail clipper doesn\u2019t work.",
