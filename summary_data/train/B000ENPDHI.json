      "text": "Took a chance on a used camera at 25% of new, with repackaging done by Amazon. The camera looked like new - close scrutiny was needed to find even 1 tiny scratch! The Sony battery supplied was completely drained and initially appeared to be unrecoverable junk. It turned out that the brand new universal charger supplied by Amazon was junk, but the USB port on my computer did the job. Everything (else) seems to work! The Memory Stick Pro Duo Adapter w 32GB microSD that I bought and added also worked! Shipping was very fast - customary Amazon excellence.",

You can edit pictures before you even print them. Zoom in on a picture already taken and save it that way, and so much more. I take pictures of everything! I charged the battery when I got the camera, which was about three weeks ago, and it's still going. I have 7/8th of battery life left. I haven't had to charge it again. I am so happy with my purchase! I hope this helps you.",

      "text": "Before buying online, I tried all the leading brands in B&M stores. Sony felt best. I was looking for a small lightweight camera that could easily be put in a pocket or hung on a belt. After six months of usage I am still impressed: * Modes are easy to select using the thumb wheel. * Zoom is right next to the shutter button. * Movie mode allows good 640x480 MPEGS to be shot. * Picture quality is excellent * Using the ISO mode you can shoot in low light levels with the penalty of grainier images with less color. My only complaint is lack of zoom while recording a movie. Just bought the W100 for my wife!",

The only complaint I have is that when taking pictures with a flash, it has a long delay making action shots basically impossible. However it does have a Burst & Super Burst mode that will take multiple frames without a flash. The battery life is okay but I would invest in a second battery if you're planning on using it a lot. A memory stick is a must because at 7 megapixels, it will only hold 10 pictures on the internal memory. Sony makes the camera very easy to operate and it's size makes it great for taking anywhere!",

    "title": "Sony Cybershot DSCW70 7.2MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom",
    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\nWhy Sony? Because Sony keeps raising the standard of excellence in digital photography, introducing more high-quality features at affordable cost--and enhancing creative possibilities as well as expanding technology horizons. For superior value, the compact Sony Cybershot DSC-W70 provides 7.2-megapixel resolution for big prints and photo cropping, large 2.5-inch LCD screen, advanced optics and the appeal of traditional rangefinder shooting--so photo enthusiasts will have a camera that's equally adept at saving their memories and capturing their vision.\n\n 7.2-Megapixel Super HAD CCD\nWith higher megapixel resolution, you'll have more detail for editing and cropping your images and making large prints. Sony's advanced Super HAD (Hole Accumulated Diode) CCD design allows more light to pass to each pixel, increasing sensitivity and reducing noise.\n\n Extra-Large 2.5-Inch LCD Screen\nThe DSC-W70 has an extra-large 2.5-inch LCD screen for setting up and viewing images--with a one-touch \"Play\" button that makes it quick and easy to view your photos.\n\n Function Guide Text/Icon Display\nAn on-screen Function Guide text/icon display makes it easy to learn the camera functions that give you greater creative freedom to adjust color mode (including \"Natural\" for subtle colors and \"Vivid\" for more intense colors), sensitivity, brightness, and image size.\n\n High Sensitivity Mode\nA new High Sensitivity Mode (ISO 1000) lets you shoot without flash for more natural results in low-light conditions and shoot at higher shutter speed to minimize blur from unsteady hands or fast-moving subjects--and Sony's original Clear RAW NR (Noise Reduction) image processing technology helps suppress the color noise that can accompany high-sensitivity shooting.\n\n Carl Zeiss 3x Optical/2x Digital Zoom\n3x optical zoom helps the DSC-W70 bring distant subjects closer and lets you frame shots for better composition; Sony's precision 2x digital zoom provides an additional 2x magnification to enlarge details without jagged edges.\n\n Stamina Battery Power\nA powerful Lithium Ion rechargeable battery allows the DSC-W70 to capture up to 2902 images--and the compact BC-CSG battery charger is also supplied for battery recharging on the go.\n\n 14x Smart Zoom Feature\nSony's Smart Zoom feature intelligently \"crops into\" the central portion of interest in your photo--avoiding the image degradation of other digital zooms. Depending on picture size, you can extend 3x optical zoom to 4.1x (3 MP), 5.2x (2 MP), or 14x (VGA).\n\n High-Capacity 58 MB Internal Memory\nWith built-in 58 MB internal memory, the DSC-W70 allows you to capture images without a flash memory card--then transfer your images to optional Memory Stick Duo media, upload to your computer or make prints on your digital printer.\n\n Memory Stick Duo Media\nThe DSC-W70 has a built-in slot for optional Memory Stick Duo or higher-capacity Memory Stick PRO Duo media--the ultra-compact media for shooting, storing and sharing your photo images. \n\n MPEG Movie VX Fine Mode\nThe DSC-W70 can capture VGA (640 x 480) audio-video clips at high frame rate (up to 30 frames per second), with length limited only by the capacity of your media.",
