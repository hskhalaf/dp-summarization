My old pair does a much better job at keeping the moisture out. In short, product quality has degraded significantly.",

Now the extra padded protection is coming off and one of the fingers has opened up showing the waterproofing layer/ thin rubber... This is my only issue, and its huge.

      "text": "Good glove with very good insulation for outdoor winter activities. The rubber (palm side) of the glove is also very grippy and is durable. However, the fabric interior starts to deform after getting wet - which is troublesome for a \"waterproof\" glove. Once this happens the glove becomes very tough to put on and requires some interior maneuvering of the fingers in order to fit properly. Not a huge issue but enough to knock down the total stars for this review.",

Very Very disappointed for the price.",

When I removed the gloves the liner pulled out, and I had a hard time putting the gloves back on. Still happy with these for colder weather, but I won't use them on a warm day again.",

When I am in the snow they never get wet, cold, but not wet. I would not take these skiing or temperatues below 0\u00b0 F(-17.8\u00b0 celsius). I would buy them again but not for snow ball fights as they are not as good a keeping your hands warm as other gloves.",

Activities typically include handling and throwing hay, operating the snaps on gate chains, snaps on horse blankets and halters, and removing ice from troughs. I had a lot of difficulty with the snaps, and often had to remove the gloves. My fingers were also cold, even though my chores last about 15 minutes! They kept my hands dry when I fished ice out of the troughs, but it accelerated the feeling of cold in my fingers. They kept my hands warm when it was about 40 to 50 degrees, and they were fine for handling large items like boxes and stuff.",

The XL were still too tight around my palms even though the fingers were very long. The XXL finally fit around my palms and were OK for my finger's girth but were so long that I could barely use them. I'm not sure what proportions a person needs to have to fit these gloves. They seem to be meant for someone with small palms, and skinny, very long fingers.",

Also the finger tips have extra fabric on the tips making it really hard to work on anything small; I had to remove them when hanging Christmas light hooks and adjusting the volume on a car stereo can even be tricky.
