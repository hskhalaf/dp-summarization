Do not go cheap, other reviews say this doesn't work and they had to format it and all that and I don't know what they bought but it wasn't this product, this came preformatted to the Xbox One and again it works perfectly. I am Highly recommending this for your Xbox One. Happy Gaming Peeps.",

Seamless set up, just as described. The seller got it to me on time, so I'm happy. Truth be told, I was about to spend $400 on a new X1 - 1TB version, not realizing (being a fuddy-duddy) that this was available. My son pointed it out to me and it's the best $140 I ever spent... or maybe I should say the best $260 I ever saved.",
