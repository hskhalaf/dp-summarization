Apply a light layer and let sit for a minute or so, then wipe off the label/goo with a paper towel. I usually don't need the scraper because the remover has soaked through and loosened the adhesive, but it's nice to have just in case. The citrus scent is light, so whatever you apply this to will smell orange-y for a bit and then back to normal.",
