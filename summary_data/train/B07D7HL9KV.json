Sure some development is needed to improve picture quality and function in some apps , but the creative skill and imagination of the VR artists already producing work out there is mindblowing and you can experience it all from your own sofa. A great way to relax and disengage the mind. I say lets welcome this addition to the VR world, support and encourage its development .",

I'm so glad I did my research and discovered it. I'm extremely happy with it. So simple, easy and fun, to set-up, following the on-line instructions. I've already been on a cave journey featured on the National Geographic Channel and a roller coaster ride in cartoon land and in Italy! Best of all, it's light and comfortable to wear and wireless, enabling you to move around anywhere. I highly recommend this product. It will keep me occupied all the time. \ud83d\ude00 Thank you very much indeed, Amazon.",

Cons - it\u2019s not something that I use everyday.. I actually prefer others to use it so they can experience it so only comes out once or twice a week. The price of some of the games is far too high. Once you\u2019ve played a game you don\u2019t tend to go back and play it again.

Lots of material available Cons:- Not truly VR - there are no external sensors so cannot detect walkabout movement. Simple control device, can limit scope of games etc. .",

He has found the resolution generally good and has enjoyed watching films, you tube and engaging with friends during the Coronavirus lockdown in the uk. It has been a great purchase in these difficult times and only missing the 5 star due to the fitting. Although my grandson is a tough reviewer.",

I love it! The interface is a joy to use and the quality is pretty good (especially for what it cost). I do think that VR is still somewhat in it's 'infancy' in terms of the sharpness and clarity of the display (which is where I suspect Apple will be concentrating).

Cons: Awful battery life* (not helped by its twitchy not-really-off mode), mostly GearVR type software, crappy (ie no adblock) browser, prefer the Rifts elegant controller, the thumb touchpad on this feels flaky in use. Missing but should be required: Google Earth and Youtube apps. * Seriously bad, like watch one movie and it's done bad, even less time if you're playing games, 1.5 - 2 hours (officially recommended to not use whilst charging) and charging isn't fast.",
