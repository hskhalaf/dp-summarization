The company certainly seems to stand behind their product, which I definitely appreciate. Another thing to note is that these socks are thicker than the REI-branded pair that I bought from REI, which cost $15 for a single pair. I would definitely recommend these over the REI ones.",

They kept his feet warm in the 15 degree Connecticut winter weather today, and feel great.",
