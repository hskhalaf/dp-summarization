      "text": "Pleasantly surprised by how much we enjoyed our pool so far. Its a good size, not too small ,not too big, you can still swim in it as an adult( in circles of course) and my 7 year old loves it. Its very sturdy and the lining it thick. The top ring had to be inflated more, the day after set up, as the sun seemed to soften it a bit. We filled it with more air and it has stayed firm. Next summer, I plan to go a size up, by this was perfect thos year, as we rent and share a yard and did not want anything too obnoxious.",

The Intex Easy Set pool is extremley easy for parents to sit up and just the right size for younger children to injoy their first 'big person' pool . Care - All filter pump units must be placed 2 metres away from the pool. We recommend that filtration is turned off when the pool is in operation. We recommend a smooth concrete slab as a suitable base- contact a reputable local builder for advice on local soil conditions. Failure to set up the pool on a flat, level compact ground could result in the pool's collapse or the possibility that a person lounging in the pool could be swept out. Do not lean, straddle or exert pressure on the inflatable top ring or top rim as injury or flooding could occur. Do not sit on, climb or straddle the sides of the pool.",
