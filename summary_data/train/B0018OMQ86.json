I bought 2 new pair, washed them as I always have, and the button holes are shredding and catching the buttons and fraying and are already not closing. My 4 year old jeans seams are in better condition than the brand new pairs. OBVIOUSLY Levis has lowered themselves to the modern world of crappy construction. It's a sad day for me. I never thought they'd change--I thought Levis would be the one constant in an ever-changing world of companies lowering their standards and changing for the worse. But nothing is sacred. I will never buy Levis again.",

      "text": "Denim is heavy, course and rough. Always buy 33-32 yet this pair is too short and way too tight. An issue with Levi's and their inconsistency with quality and sizing. If you purchase, hang on to all the packaging and if it doesn't fit right then, pack it up and return it. These new jeans are being donated to a mens transition house and I sure hope some skinny, short guy can get some use from them. They certainly were not 33W, 32L. Will consider long and hard about purchasing Levi's in the future. Sizing issues with the 501, 511 and 505's. Try them before you pay for them! Wood 38",

When you first get them, soak them in a tub with the water as hot as you can get it. Make sure they are inside out first. After an hour or so put them between two towels and step on them, hang to dry overnight. Let them dry first before wearing them or you'll get uneven stretching.
