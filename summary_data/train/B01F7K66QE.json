I have a treeing walker coonhound so he has a nose like a blood hound. So, I sprayed our water house in our backyard because he\u2019s chewed off about 15 feet in total. When I sprayed it on he went nuts and started running around the backyard like I was upsetting him. So I thought I was in the clear with this stuff, I was very wrong. He ended up chewing off another 5 feet of hose \ud83d\ude44 maybe it\u2019s just my dog it doesn\u2019t work for, idk \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
