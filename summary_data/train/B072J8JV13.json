Not sure how this could have happened but my seven year old granddaughter found out how to chip the corner of the white side of the mallet while pounding in a kids croquet stake just the second time of use. Completely disappointing to also find out that the seller only has a 30 day return policy. Hoping they will just replace the item.",
