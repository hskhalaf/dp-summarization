This shoe is so cool, he is saving as good shoes...lol DVS goes above and beyond with the quality of the interior foot bed also, they are not advertisedoing as orthotic but I believe they should. We have a pair that is about 5 years old...I slipped them on to do something outside and I thought my son had put a insole in them...no, original that held up after so long. I definitely recommend these!",
