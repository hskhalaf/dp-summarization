I just pray she won't get tiredbofnit like she's done in the past. Few things are different though. 1. She's not just licking off the gravy she's eating her entire meal! 2. No vomiting! She's been a notorious vomiter when she eats wet food. 3. No diarrhea! Besides being the worst picky eater she also has a super sensitive stomach. Over all I'm very happy. I just wish cost would be a lot less. The cost for this toppers is the same as buying 5-8oz cans",

The packet size is nice because it stays fresh, I have little dogs so big cans of wet food are hard to get through. This would also be great for travel. You can have this food topper on trips with no mess. Great product!",
