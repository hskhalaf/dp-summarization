      "text": "This item is horrible, poor-quality junk. Do not buy it. I suggest you go to CL and look for a second-hand \"good\" router instead of purchasing this product. The Wifi connection is unstable and the signal drops constantly. Normally, upon losing signal, the device resets itself and the connection is reestablished. However, after a few times of crashing, the connection drops and something happens to the router's configuration. At this point, any attempt to connect to the wifi network is futile -it issues an error message saying the password is incorrect. Then, the only alternative is to reset the router to default configuration. This happens often. Don't waste your time.",

The firmware update process is also a bit complicated, and it's required to support the initial authentication to the hotel's WiFi. That was especially annoying the first time I tried to use this and I couldn't update the firmware with the supplies I had.",

Other devices (iPhones, iPod touch, Kindles, and iPads) don't require login as frequently, so I am assuming theTripMate is the culprit.
