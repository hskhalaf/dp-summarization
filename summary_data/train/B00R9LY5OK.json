I'd recommend to anyone who has little storage room but still wants a quality bike not to hesitate to order a Cyrusher. \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\udc4d",

I've taken it on rough trails and jumps, expecting it to fail, but it just keeps running like a champ. The seat is a bit uncomfortable, but that's an easy swap. I also changed out the wheels for something not as heavy. If you have a car with limited space, it'll be perfect for you. I can fit this in a Corvette, so if you can't install a bike rack on your car, no need to worry. I highly recommend it.",
