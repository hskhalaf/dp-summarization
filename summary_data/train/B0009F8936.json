Re-thread, pop, repeat. Eventually the soft aluminum gave out and I'm not talking about 100 tubes of caulk, I mean 1. Returned and may pick up a competing brand for future projects but did the remaining dozen or so for this project by hand.",

When you are using an extremely viscous (thick) caulking, it is really hard on the hands to squeeze the trigger on a standard caulk gun to get the product out. This air powered caulk gun is the hand saving answer. Easily squeezes out OSI and mechanically mixed epoxy caulking with ease. Let's you concentrate on a smooth application of the caulk material. Highly recommended!",

The rubber seals are to hard so they don't conform to the caulk tube to make a right seal. When I was able to get a fairly tight seal the the unit did work fairly well.",

This is a really great tool for anything but the smallest caulking jobs. It can push a dried plug out the tip of a tube of caulk with ease, so it will handle even the thickest goop you've got the shoot. Good price, solid metal construction, dispenses evenly and predicatbly once its adjusted properly. My only complaint is the trigger is a little too close to the tube body. Just not perfect ergonomics, which costs it one star. Other tip: wrap the first five feet of your air hose in masking tape to keep it clean.",

The proper pressure is not clear as it says max pressure is 90 psi, I used at 10 psi and was the rate I wanted. At 90 psi it would have shot out like a SuperSoaker. Unlike a mechanical gun you don't know how much is left unless you disconnect the air and take the cartage out. Would have given 5 stars but trigger could be better.",

      "text": "I was worried the product might not be able to push thick construction adhesive (PL Premium). Temperatures were in the 40s, and it pushed the stuff out no problem, using about 30-35 PSI. I like that the gun has no moving parts. Like others have said, the trigger is a little wacky, being hinged on the bottom, you have to be careful not to catch your finger. But, given the price compared to other tools of this type, you can not go wrong.",
