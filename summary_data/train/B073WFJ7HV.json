It doesn\u2019t show, and it reached with about 18\u201d to spare. I made an aluminum bracket to mount the camera because it is designed to mount under something.

Front camera video quality is great. For the price, it's an awesome tool. Records front and rear cameras simultaneously along with audio. If you have anything larger than a small car, you will need the extension cable for the rear camera. Also, if you have a large mirror, this will not cover the whole thing (this straps onto your original mirror). I had to swap a smaller mirror from another car into my truck.

The image and picture quality is great. I'm very impressed with it. I only wish it had two positions to set the camera. If I position it to hook up the trailer, I can't see farther then my trailer hitch. If I position it to see images when backing up, I can't see my trailer hitch anymore. So I plan to customize a two position braket to allow me to switch back and forth.",

I compared the video quality before andd after the cable modification and I did not detect any signal loss or interference. This review is not yet based upon an extended period of use of the camera. The backup camera is getting permanently intalled tomorrow.",
