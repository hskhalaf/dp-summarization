You get a better value for your money with this one, since it comes with 3 pots vs the 1 with the Wilton warmer. It doesn\u2019t take long to heat up and melt your chocolates. Granted, the pots are a little small but honesty, not a big deal at all if you\u2019re just dipping strawberries or cake pops or anything like that.",

Great way to switch from one scent to another, quickly and without a mess! No matter what you are melting, heating, etc. - this is perfect for those smaller amounts of different flavors, scents, colors, and anything else you can think of. Pull out one pot and put in another. It really is that simple and easy!",

The machine comes with three pots which is soo convenient for decorating with different candies or colors. This melts the candy fast and keeps it warm without burning it. I just wish it was a bit bigger and could hold more, but it's easy to add more as you go since it melts so quickly. Great great product!",

The handles are very flimsy, and it's not unimaginable that they might break off. Even that I wouldn't mind so much, if I knew where I could get replacement pots. So far, none of that has happened, but I would like to know if there are options to purchase more pots, just in case. It has been worth every penny I spent on it.",
