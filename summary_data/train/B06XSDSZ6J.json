Customer service is a nightmare. In the meantime, I am stuck with this product and cannot even return it. Extremely unsatisfied.",

I opened up my Prynt app and there were more instructions that were more clear on how to use the Prynt Pocket. Now, it's so simple for me to use and I love printing out lots of photos with my Pocket! The photo paper is also about 50 cents a piece so it's a lot cheaper than Polaroid.",

The shutter button and the clamp mechanism to hold the phone make it feel like a vintage camera. Using the app, the setup is easy even though there is quite a few steps to follow before printing your first picture. The print quality is decent for this kind of printer. It's instant photography after all. I was asked by the app to update the printer and the quality seemed better after that. I hope that more updates like will come! Overall I like this product because even though it's not perfect it brings something new and fun to your photos.",

My daughter has been having so much fun and giving everyone pictures from her phone. It won't fit in a wristlet, but it does fit in small purse.

I actually liked that they had darker tones, but they came out more cartoon-ish with the outlines being too harsh. It works a lot better for scenery pictures instead of portraits though, and I still would use the product often. Wish there was a way to connect my phone without taking it out of its case though.",

It basically brings you the best of both worlds, the old fashion photograph that definitely has an analog feel to it, and the little twist with the videos that you can embed in these pictures. It's a very well done product, both the software and the hardware and I'm having a lot of fun with it.",

Now, I know that you are probably thinking that something else must of happened in-between the first time and the second time. It just broke. Wow!",

I installed my pocket on my phone and printed my first photo in less than 10 minutes ! I also really like the graphic design or the pocket as well as the app, and it's very small so easy to bring with you for a trip or vacation. The only thing I think could be improved is the quality of the photos when applying a filter from the app... I recommend it, it can be a very fun present !",

If they are selling paper for their product they should specify the paper to use and then have a place to order that paper.
