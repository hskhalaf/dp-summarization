We discovered this a few years after they started chewing them, and they both had to have teeth extracted (they didn't chew anything else that was hard). Our veterinarian said they are too hard for some dogs. We bought the small ones for aggressive chewers... we bought them regularly because they chewed a lot. I threw all of them out after the 1st discovery, never again. It's a shame, they really liked them. I was told these are the best, not true. Buyer beware. I don't know what is a good option now, I won't use rawhide either.",

They last a long time (about 1-2 months each), which is great considering she is a heavy chewer. She is small though (~8 pounds), so maybe if your dog is bigger, he or she might get through the toy faster. Either way, I think these are great.",
