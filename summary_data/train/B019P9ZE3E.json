I checked where it gets warm during a charge. - Warm at the receptacle where it plugs into the wall socket. (not hot) - Warm where it connects to the Chevy volt charger. Again not hot just warm. - The cord itself is cool never even warm. So it appears some current loss only at the receptacle ends and not the cord.",

Previous 14 gauge wire extension cords could not handle the start up of the dust collector or shaper.

I will say, it seems heavy duty. Does not look cheap, and I like the updated lit plug. Always handy to let me know I have electric running through the line. That is all I can say about it for now, other than it was not expensive.",

Cable is thicker and heavier than a normal 16/3 extension cord, but still very pliable and soft to reach around building corners without kinking. The lighted plug is a perfect safety feature to have as well. Recommended!",
