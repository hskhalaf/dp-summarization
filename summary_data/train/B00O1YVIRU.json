My husband and I live alone and we rarely use these chairs. I think we have used them a handful of times, so we were really disappointed. Will be replacing with another chair.",

The holes line up if you make sure you have the legs in the right side. They are marked A,B,C,D. The legs are zippered in under the seats. Do not force the screws. That\u2019s what splits the leg and that\u2019s probably why some people have had legs break. If you have to force the screws then switch out the legs until you get the screw to fit. These are beautiful chairs. I did not have any indentions in my seats. Great buy!",

They do not match my table, my kitchen/ dining room theme and stand out. I have thought about returning the whole chair but instead I am researching ways to either get new legs or change the color myself which is a hassle.",

Of the 8 chairs, 2 had a leg that was shorter than the rest but the wobbling isn't noticeable when you're sitting in it. They do take some time to unbox and assemble, so I did 2 each night (~30 minutes). Also, pleased with the seat cushion, it's nice and thick, pretty comfortable!

These chairs are just as or more comfortable than the Pier 1 chairs, but actually the style and color of these are superior. The legs are zipped inside the liner underneath each chair. Super easy to assemble and look fantastic. I had to reread the price a few times- yes, you get two for the price listed!!",

The chairs are very light dove gray color that I was looking for to match my de\u0301cor. They are soft and comfortable to sit in and hug you at the back with velvety to touch fabric. I'm getting a dining room table soon and might purchase more of these chairs for more sitting.",
