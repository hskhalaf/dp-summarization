Good punches usually have a moveable guide that you can move up and down so all hole punches are property aligned. A 'work around' for this punch is slightly fold your paper you are about to punch with a crease at the half-way point on the edge you will be putting into the punch. Align the crease with the center black guide, then punch. All you sheets will be identically punched.",
