The setup is consistent on all devices that you attach but can be a little clunky sometimes. The additional items that Wink offers like lightbulbs and door switches are much cheaper than going to other systems after you purchase the hub. These devices can then function robots similar to IFTTT to trigger events which is downright awesome.",

They initially gave me three days to pay this extortion fee. In my view, this company is circling the drain, and this extortion attempt is a way to get some money in the door. I wouldn't touch this device with a ten foot pole now. I have transitions to a Samsung SmartThings hub, which has no monthly fee.",

To connect the hub to your network, all you need to do is plug the hub into an electrical outlet, go to your phone, select a device to connect (hub) and move through the app until it gets to the page where you have to enter your network password (your network name or SSID should be visible on the app). Enter the password and although it'll take a few minutes, the hub will connect to your home network. Then add the lights or whatever product you're trying to add using the app.",

Wink customer support is worthless and can't/won't answer emails. Even the automated response to my initial request for help took 3 days!! I will be returning this waste of a resource.",

Despite several calls to a very friendly customer support crew and multiple different attempts to pair devices to the hub it still does not work. In my last call with customer support they thought it was a time stamp issue on their server and they would investigate and call me back. That was 4 days ago and nothing. Do not waste your time on this until they figure out how to make it work.",
