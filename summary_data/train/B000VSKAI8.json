      "text": "I recently purchased this table and assembled it yesterday (quite easy to do yourself). I've used it 3 times since then for short durations and have already felt significant improvements in my back. I have moderate issues with scoliosis and back pain, and through my work I sit for much of the day causing compression in my spine. I plan on using this daily for pain relief and overall care. If you're considering purchasing an inversion table for any similar issues, do it! Highly recommended",

Assembly was very easy (30 minutes) and unlike most products requiring assembly, all the pieces were there. Follow the instructions on how to use it because if you body is not accustomed to be upside down, it could be counter productive. After using it for four or more weeks, I have seen a dramatic difference in reducing the pain in my lower back. You could spend 3x this amount going to physical therapy that yield little results, especially for lower back pain.",

I do suggest you set the foot-pegs about 2\" taller than you actually are, as once you rotate backwards you tend to slide up a bit and you'll be out of balance. I set mine at 6'5\" and the balance is perfect. Very sturdy and folds up nicely when you want to store it against the wall. Hanging upside down and doing sit ups is great work, and I find it helps get those last few kinks/pops out of my back.",

Being inverted just relaxes you and it's quite an experience. I have to admit though that we haven't used this much over the last few months, but will probably use it more consistently to alleviate minor back aches, or if we just want to get the zen flowing.",
