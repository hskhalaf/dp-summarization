It's done a great job of keeping everything safe, and there's plenty of room for all my pictures, games and other files. The transfer time is pretty good considering what I put it through. It is a rather sleek and attractive device too (if that matters to you at all). I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needed a storage solution of this nature.",

Not to worry, as soon as you plug it in your iMac will recognize the drive and will reformat it for you. Time Machine then boots up and runs automatically. Couldn't be easier to use. Not only a small form factor but it makes no noise whatsoever when doing backups. My old Toshiba would make a noticeable whirring sound. If you are looking for a backup drive for your iMac look no further, this one is fantastic.",

Initial backups took 63 minutes, or about 1.6 GB/min over a USB-2 interface. No disk chatter, Acronis does a good job of sequencing disk access and compressed data to about 65 percent of the original on average.",

Cons: Larger than a thumb drive, uses a harder to find MicroUSB 3.0 cable. Bottom Line: If you want a USB drive that can hold a lot of data and not break the bank, this is the drive for you.",

Having to carry around the cable and remember to have it makes for the drive to be much less portable and another thing to remember.
