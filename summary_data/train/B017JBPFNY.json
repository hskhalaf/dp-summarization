They arrived and upon first glance they were very rough in texture and not soft terry cloth like I had anticipated. I thought if I washed them they would fluff up and look and feel better. After washing them, there were loose threads from the poor quality of fabric and the edging on one was actually torn away from the ribbing. I would like to return these. My husband threw away the shipping box when he saw me put them in the wash thinking we would not need it.",
