      "text": "Bought this as a gift. It was smaller than I expected. The music was very cute as well as the squirrel. I loved how it went in and out of the acorn. My one issue is you pull the squirrel, it plays the song and plays as the squirrel gets pulled back into the acorn. The squirrel had some trouble getting back into the acorn on its own and would kind of lag and I would need to help lift it up for it to go keep paying and go into the acorn. Not a huge issue but babies aren\u2019t necessarily going to know to do that and may be stuck with the squirrel not playing the music :(",

      "text": "Cute, but too large to be a stroller toy, its half the size of my baby. He loves it, its soft, plays nice music, but the outer shell is too soft and floppy, so when you pull the squirrel out of the tree, the tree collapses enough to prevent the squirrel from returning all the way back up, and cutting the song short. If the squirrel were able to complete the cycle, it would buy you a couple minutes of peace and quite - at least my baby is fascinated. But because the squirrel gets stuck, it's only good for half the time. Very disappointed.",

I gave it 1/10th of a pull and it kinda made its way back into the acorn, as long as it wasn't touching the fabric and I was guiding it. Gave it a full pull, got 2 notes and then nothing. Aside from that this thing seems pretty great. It appears you have to undo stitching to replace the battery.",

I might see about fixing it myself or I'll just cut off the elastic and make it a squirrel that can be placed into an acorn.",

I thought it was getting caught in the acorn, but as far as I can tell, the mechanism just doesn't pull hard enough to completely retract the squirrel. This wouldn't be so annoying if this didn't cause the song to end prematurely as well. So basically the toy fails at doing the one thing it's supposed to do. I generally like this brand, but this was an overall garbage product.",

The only problem is that, as I read in other reviews, the squirrels doesn\u2019t go all the way up, because it\u2019s head gets stuck at the base of the acorn. This makes the lullaby stop. From then on I think the squirrel is too heavy for the mechanism to lift it, so you have to help it the rest of the way up. Besides this issue, I think my daughter will enjoy playing with it when she\u2019s a little bit older",
