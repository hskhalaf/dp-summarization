Hint: as most shampoos do, the tube says to wash, rinse and then repeat. I've found it works even better when there are three wash/rinses. Also, I didn't give stars for moisturizing since that's not the purpose of the shampoo, but I also want to note that it doesn't leave the hair dry either.",

Yes, Fekkai smells great, but that alone does not make me want to spend all that extra money. (If you want sexy smelling hair, spritz a bit ( not a lot) of your perfume on wet hair, comb through, and blow dry or not. The resulting fragrance is nice and subtle.)",

      "text": "This product did what it said it would do - my hair really did look and feel fuller and thicker. But, the heavy perfume smell coming off my hair was SO strong that I had a headache less than an hour after using it. Because of that I only used it once then I gave it away. I was sorry to have to give it away but I couldn't endure a daily migraine for thick full hair. If they had a fragrance free version I'd try it again. If you don't mind strong perfume smells (and many people don't mind) then you would probably find this to be a great product.",
