The first few days of adjusting were hell but I know it would have been much worse without this product. The package seems small but a little goes a long way. I literally only need a pin sized amount for each nipple and I apply right before and after pumping. I have not tried it with direct breastfeeding so no comment on if the taste upsets my baby. I have had absolutely no cracking, soreness or pain since faithfully applying before and after a session. Yaaay! Will definitely continue use.",

I've been using this for a few weeks now and can say it stays put, isn't greasy after a minute and doesn't stink.
