The cleaning algorithm is superior as it covers the whole pool reliably, and does it faster than the others. It climbs the walls easily, and does not get stuck. I really like the remote control option too - not super easy to use, but far better than trying to drag it to the debris spot. If you appreciate my review, please click the Yes button below.",

I especially like having it programmable. We came home from 9 days of vacation to a perfectly clean pool. With prior robots, that never was possible. I also like the way this one is lighter weight. My favorite feature is the basket inside that collects the debris. It's a rigid plastic basket that you just spray off and place inside without having to stretch the wet elastic over the square holder on my prior Dolphin robot and so much easier than handling the smelly cloth bags.",

The part was $600+ at the local pool supply, so we decided to purchase a new one of the same model in case we needed parts in the future. I received a call within a week from Zodiac offering to replace the unit. Wow. That was an amazing call. They discussed the importance of maintaining a good relationship with their customers and standing behind their product. I am sold! I rarely see this effort in corporate America today.

Has trouble with our stairs that are higher than most, but stairs were not the problem. Picks up leaves, pollen, and leaves a clean path in its wake.

The filter it came with had very small holes, and it picked up the smallest particles (pollen) and clogged easily - we have A LOT of pollen. So we purchased a filter with slightly larger holes and it's perfect - picks up everything and does not clog. We would definitely recommend this.",

The entire control panel was replaced. Brought it home, put it in the pool and within 10 minutes of cleaning....ERROR 10 and it STOPPED working AGAIN.

The additional cleaning power, picking up the fine sand that blows in to the pool from around the foundation work that was done last year, is invaluable. I highly recommend both the Polaris F9550 Sport along with the ultra fine mesh filter sold separately.",

Only the lift and plus/minus buttons work, the rest start/stop, cleaning cycle and pool shape do not. I have contacted their Tech Support line by email and phone. No response yet... Very disappointed and upset. This is a $1500 unit; I expected it to last at least 5 years.",
