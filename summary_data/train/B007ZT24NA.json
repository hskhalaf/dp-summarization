Saving apps to local 16gb storage without option of saving to SD Not the tablets fault but there is no online forum presence for these models, which is helpful for hacks and tweaks and updates. Not many choices in cases , doesnt fit into common 7\" cases Overall the best tablet money can buy",

Quite disappointing to spend $500 on a device and then spend another $25 to send it in for repair under factory warranty! That is when all the other manufacturers I had to deal with send you the prepaid box for free. Amazon was kind to compensate me for that, however beware of Toshiba. So 5* to Amazon, one star to Toshiba.",

However, after I disabled \"javascript\" and \"plugins\" in the browser setting, it became very fast and responsive. I also got a docking station but returned it immediately. If I charged the tablet through the dock, I needed to reboot the tablet every time and the battery drained from 100% to say 80% in a few minutes. Maybe I got a defective docking station but I can do without it. Overall, I am very satisfied with this tablet.",
