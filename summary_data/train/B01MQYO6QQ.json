The design is not good. Orange stripes look cheap. PROS. Nice display Very powerful performance Beautiful keyboard and backlit Also want to warn you that not all new heavy games can be played on max. settings, but it\u2019s good.",

      "text": "To get the performance you paid for you MUST DISABLE \"SUPERFETCH\" in Windows 10. Before I did this, I noticed the hard drive was at 99-100% all the time and ran really poorly. After I did so, the system runs really well. To disable Superfetch, simple go to Start and type \"cmd\". Then type \"services.msc\". Press \"s\" and scroll down to superfetch. Stop Superfetch (you will notice you hard drive light goes out now, like it should). Next, change the \"Startup type\" to \"Disabled\". Enjoy your much faster system PS: If you like the tip, feel free to send me an Amazon.com gift card ;-)",
