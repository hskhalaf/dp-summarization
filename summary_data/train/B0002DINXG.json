      "text": "My red-eared slider who has been with me for 45 years will only eat one kind of food stick which is the Wardley Reptile Sticks. There have been times when I ran out of Wardley sticks and could not find a store that carried them so tried another popular brand, and he would not touch them. Since my little green friend has lived well beyond his expected lifespan and has been with me through every important event in my life I think he deserves to always have the food of his choice. I'm grateful to have found Wardley food sticks on Amazon and have added them to my Subscribe & Save account, so we never run out.",

He's about 7\" shell length and almost always swallows them whole so there is little waste and little residue, so it helps to keep the clean tank in that way. Although it's pretty cool when he catches one in the side of his mouth and it sticks out like a cigar before he crunches down on it and it snaps.",

Note that the sticks are very small - ideal for little turtles but ours is now about 10\" in diameter so had to give him a bunch of sticks -- not a problem though",
