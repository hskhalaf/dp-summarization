PS. it's made in PAKISTAN, and everyone knows that PAKISTAN is renowned for their fine craftsmanship. My excellent Pakistani dip belt broke after THREE uses. WOW. You'd think with all the aid we give them, they could hire some decent workers. Bravo to HARBINGER, great job on ruining your name, will never buy anything produced by that company again.",

I purposely bought it because of the short chain comments for ground clearance reasons. The only issue I have is the clasp. It doesn't look like it will hold up long term(bad spring).
