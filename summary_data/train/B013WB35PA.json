      "text": "There's not many fully locking affordable jewelry armoires on the market so I was happy to find this one which is not only functional but also cute. I like that the drawers are inside of the cabinet and you need to open the doors to get to them. They won't open unless the lid is lifted. This helps me keep my toddler away from my jewelry. My only complaint is that drawers are not on rails so they hang down when you pull them out causing jewelry to slide down. Also two bolts on the lid don't align perfectly so i have to pull the door slightly to properly close the lid. Overall however, I am happy with the purchase.",

I looked at multiple websites and pictures and did not see it. So if you like the pictures you will love it. The insides are beautiful with lots of space. They also have nice costumer service along with Amazon. I am giving it four stars because it is sturdy and the company was really nice to deal with. I like everything about except how it is distressed.",

Had I known about the material and how the drawers are not well supported I would not have purchased it, but I do love the color of it. See pictures.",

They are locked in place so they don't fall out, but I wish it were a little better made so the drawers opened flat. Small price to pay for something so good-looking and useful. It even has a lock. Also keep in mind, it's big. This is not a jewelry box. It's a piece of furniture.",

It is not nearly as blue as in the photos and has a muted matte blue-green finish that goes very well with the Caribbean colors of the room. It was super easy to assemble and everything works perfectly. One small details is that I need to give one door a little jiggle to get the locking mechism to line up with the holes in the lid.

It holds all of my jewelry with some room....which means I can get more pieces!!!! The cubbies in each drawer work well to organize all your treasures.
