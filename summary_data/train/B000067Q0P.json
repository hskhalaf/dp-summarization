When we went to get the bolts we found there were none and we all agreed that it would be far too dangerous to use without bolting it together.

Once I go it together the two piece frame is unstable and causes the legs to bounce around as much as you do. I have tried to adjust the legs but the thing just won't be level. The good news is that aside from legs slapping the ground as you bounce it is quiet.",

You are supposed to have two dudes stand on one end and pry the other end down into place. Not complicated, but not acceptable as a consumer product. And like others said - there's no springs; just rubbery elastic bands instead. Avoid this, and buy something fully assembled.",

The construction is such that the legs are inclined to move inward, from the pressure of completed assembly maybe? To ignore the legs moving inward would ultimately result in one of them getting tucked inward, eventually breaking, and well, you try hopping on something that has one less support leg. If there were more weight on it the situation would be ore severe. Would not purchase again, would recommend you not to purchase at all",

It took three small females less than 6 minutes to pop it together, so it was not hard at all like described in other reviews. My kids and I love jumping on it. You dont go very high, but it is a great workout. The best part is we can use it in the living room or outside. It is very easy to tote from one place to another.",

It has cloth straps going around the frame, with the protective padding that you put around the rim. The legs skrew off so you can store it under the bed, etc. The instructions aren't kidding though, when it says that you need 3 adults to put it together. Atleast you need 2 (with very healthy muscles).",
