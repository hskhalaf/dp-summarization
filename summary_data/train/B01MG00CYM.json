I'm about 5'10\" and I have to say if I was any taller I'd be a little worried about space, but I was able to fit my 65 liter pack down by my feet at night, and my morning clothes and shoes up by my head. You certainly don't want to sit around in this tent for anything other than sleeping as it's pretty small, but it kept me dry and warm even through rain. Overall a good tent for backpacking.",

What didn't work for me is that it's not self supported. The tent needs to be pegged down for it to be upright. Second. I felt a but claustrophobic with the roof of tent right on top of my face. It got cold in the tent and there was moisture inside. Most importantly I couldn't sit up at the peak of the tent. I do some meditation before going to sleep and need to situp in a yoga posture.

However, it's important to note a few things: 1. This is not a free-standing tent. The stakes are necessary to give the tent its shape, so you may find it difficult to use this tent in places where the ground is hard or rocky. 2. I know it's obvious, but you really can't do anything inside the tent but lay down. 3. Condensation can drip onto the tent off the fly, if the fly isn't externally supported with the provided lines somehow.",

However, a few negatives include a cheap bottom that could rip easily without a tarp and the lack of it's ability to become taut when fully staked in. It's already tiny to begin with so having the \"ceiling\" mesh drape down is a little frustrating. Went down to 20 degrees in Aspen at 11,000ft and this tent did a great job with heat conservation, as long as you have a decent sleeping bag.",

I was totally pleased with the tent, but I don't know how it will perform in the rain, since the weather was clear. I can't sit up inside, but it's easy to get in and out of the tent. There was plenty of room for me (5'6\") and all of my gear. I left my shoes under the rain fly right outside my door.",
