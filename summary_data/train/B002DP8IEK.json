The sound fidelity, neutrality, and clarity is just unstoppable from these headphones. Prepare to be super uncomfortable the first few times you use them though. But don't worry, after those first few times these headphones are comfortable and nice to use. Overall for the price range, these can't be beat, seriously. Look no further if you want the best sound fidelity for the buck.",

Very happy about that, but no pockets in the bag to keep it from slipping out. Pull strings tight. - Comes with extra ear cushion/pad for replacement. Very Nice! - Owned for 3 months",

I can wear them for hours without any problems. Music playback is a treat as it is pretty solid throughout the range. The only drawback is the coiled cord. While I don't like it, it is an improvement over the cord used by my last pair of headphones. For anyone choosing a pair of headphones under $200 these should be on their short list.",

      "text": "I read professional reviews of this headphones before buying them. I am so glad that I did. When I initially heard them, I was not so thrilled by the sound. Now that I have been hearing them for some time, the sound quality is amazing. The sound is very true, with no extra bass, though the bass can be heavy for bass heavy tunes. In my home, I use these headphones more often than my Shure SE530 (which are themselves excellent). I would not say that the SRH840 are very comfortable. I do feel them no my ears, but the sound makes up for any discomfort. I recommend these headphones and for under $200, they are truy exceptional value.",

I've tried Shure's earbuds and didn't like them, so I didn't expect to like these much either. But as soon as I put them on, I was sold. Fantastic sound. Strong and crisp over the full range. Nothing too over-emphasized. Comfortable (though not as comfortable as Sennheisers). Convenient folding design with pouch. Great coiled cable with mini plug for portable use. I can't find a weakness or flaw. Makes those twice-the-price headphones that are so popular (Beats, Bose, etc.) look like a joke. HIGHLY recommended.",

(like 300kbps+) what a great purchase. i haven't had any other high end headphones, but these are just amazing. they sound great. the only downside is that they are a tad bit heavy. the bass is not as \"boom\", but it is present. i don't have a problem with either.",

Not due to lack of \"spring\" in the headset itself, but because of its weight. 2) The cord could have a long straight part to it as the cord is too short; I had to get an extension for mine.",
