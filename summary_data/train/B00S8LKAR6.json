I also like lightweight, somewhat less supportive soles, which these are great for. Don't get me wrong though, these soles do have a lot of bounce, just not as much as really thick ones. I'd probably buy these gain. This is my first time buying Altra and I really liked it!",

I thought it wasn't a big deal until after the 2nd week in them, I started getting serious pain in my big toe joint. Since the shoes are the only thing I have changed I decided to go back to my old shoes for awhile and my pain decreased significantly. But by the time I figured it out that it was these shoes, the return window closed (yesterday!) I am so mad. I will not recommend these to anyone and make sure they know my experience.",

Usually I take a size 6 but in the Altras, I take a 6.5. I love the wide toe box and even though this particular model felt too narrow when I first tried them, they felt awesome during my run and are one of the most comfortable pairs I own. Sometimes I'll use them for training but these are my go-to shoe for an event.",

I was already used to \"barefoot\" type footwear as I love the New Balance Minimus collection. I like to feel the ground beneath my feet. The Altra Impulse doesn't have as wide a toe box as my New Balance, but it's wide enough and also provides some cushion where the New Balance does not. I love them both, and am tickled to have great running choices :)",
