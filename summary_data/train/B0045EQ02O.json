Saw this and I thought ... \"I could modify that to work as a floor rack.\" Before I get into the modification details, I should say that this product arrived in perfect condition and appears to be a sturdy unit. Now for the modification (see pics) ... Inverted the rack (such that mounting tabs were horizontal) and attached the tabs to two 2x4 skids. Additionally, added a 1x1 piece between the now upper area of the rack (to add some extra structural rigidity). Final outcome: Looks good (imho), appears functional, and is very solid (e.g., not at all flimsy). Works for me!",

Also disappointed in slop between mating tubes should be tighter toleranced to reduce deflection. In addition replaced two inch long lag screws with three inch screws and put flat washers on lag screws to increase surface holding area. 1 1/2 inch engagement in to stud did not seem sufficient. Overall not a bad product. Will four large pick up tires now in rack that 40 pounds each. Appears to holding its own. Nice looking unit. Will repost if any changes. Would recommend product.",

The expandable tubes used for the back and to hold the tire seem very weak (they flex with small car tires) and make installation a pain (they spin and slide when installing). The lag bolts are a pain, but I knew that going into the install and had the proper tools to assist. If I'm ever in the market for another one, I'll be shopping for something besides this one. Just hope it holds up to the annual winter / spring tire swaps.",

Then instead of a 3rd bar across the back, I used 3 of the adjustable bars in 2 places across the bottom instead of 2. I did have to use a pipe cutter and cut the threaded end off one of the pipes.

DO NOT over tighten or strip upon installation. If you do, stop, run to the hardware store, and purchase the next size up in lags.

The integrity of the rack isn't impacted for now but it may be in the future. I'll eventually sand and repaint but it works very well for the intended purpose. Instructions could have been more helpful if they included suggested mounting positions based on tire sizes for the cross bars that hold the tires as well as the back bar that keeps them from hitting the wall. Trial and error works but is unnecessary as the optimal mounting positions for the cross bars is defined by the tire size.",

I'm also not fond of the sharp corners of the frame. With a normal sized car tire, 225/45/17, there's no need for 5 or 6 inches of the width from the wall so the corners are sticking way out unnecessarily. I may cut and weld more forehead-friendly ends on the frame or somebody's gonna get hurt in my garage. Rich",
