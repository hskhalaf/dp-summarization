I can't say that it does much to existing DVD's regarding the up convert though. When turning the player on, it's a little slow to boot up to open the door. I've got it connected to my network and did all of the updates for it over the internet instead of having to order a cd from Toshiba...great thinking Toshiba. I would definitely recommend this player. This player has exceeded my expectations.",

Perfect HD-DVD right out of the box and in minutes! Although I did hit up the Toshiba website, download the latest firmware, burn to CD and install that...didn't take long (no where near the 30mins it says it takes) and now it's running perfect. Buy it..it's the best deal out there! I know, I've researched for months before pulling the trigger last week on this!",

For a few hundred bucks I could afford to be on the loosing end of the format war (which may drag on for years) and enjoy HD in the meantime. I purchased the Planet series with the player and have been truly impressed. As I say posted with some of the reviews, the player takes awhile to turn on, read a disc and start playing (a good 2-3 minutes). But if you can get past that the player is inexpensive and produces.",

Pros: Cheap, great image quality, ethernet connection for downloading firmware upgrades and for online content, HDMI output, upscales your old dvd's. Cons: Not 1080p (1080i), slow to boot up. Got this and the Samsung 1400 Blu-Ray player for around $525 combined. A great way to be format-neutral for high definition dvds. My friend got the 1080p version (for $300 more), and I can't tell the difference, although he swears he can. Looks great on my Pioneer plasma, especially with \"Planet Earth\".",

There is nothing bad to say about this well made product except the lethargic response. It takes a while to come to life and then more time to accept the DVD. It's also slow turning off. With that said I still give it a 5!!! This is a must have if you want to jump into the HD DVD realm with taking out a loan. I play all of my DVD's and limited HD DVD's on it and I'm hooked.",

The Hitachi support insisted the projector support 1080i and it was the fault of Toshiba player. I'm confused but I am not worried. In 720p, the picture is much better than regular DVD in approximately 80-in size projector. It also upconvert DVD resolution better that my DVD player (also from Toshiba). Beware though, HD-A2 can not read DVD+ format.",

From the onset, the player provided some of the best upscale standard definition DVD playback as well as excellent feature ritch HD-DVD playback. The load times of DVD discs is quite respectable from the previous generation player, thought not quite as fast as the traditional DVD players. Understanding the complexity of the content now being played back helps to understand why the delay, and the excellent picture quality over HDMI makes one forget all about the slow load times. All in all, the player was excellent and purchasing it through one of Amazon.com's supplier was the way to go.",

The only drawbacks I've found are: (i) you sometimes have to hit the eject button several times before the tray will open; (ii) the upscaled signal is output ONLY via HDMI (since I can only use component output I can't take advantage of this otherwise great feature); and (iii) neither 5.1 nor coaxial audio outputs are provided, so HDMI is the only way to get the full benefit of this player's audio capabilities. Sounds great via optical anyway, though.",

It's questionable whether or not the HD format will prevail or if BluRay will replace it, but I, like many others, am watching my pennies and will opt for the HD DVDs rather than BluRay based on the price difference. The Toshiba HD DVD player was also easily recognized by my Harmony Universal Remote, so I can control the TV, Home Theater, DVD, and Satellite DVR with a single remote.",

Also, HD DVD uses a superior codec than Blu-ray and has internet access on every player for firmware updates to make your player run better and add features. Trust me, HD DVD all the way!!",

    "title": "Toshiba HD-A2 HD DVD Player",
    "description": "Toshiba HD-A2 HD-DVD Player with HDMI output.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nHigh definition playback delivers 720p/1080i resolution at a transfer rate higher than DVD or even HDTV, resulting in a more detailed, realistic picture. Advanced audio, including Dolby\u00ae TrueHD, Dolby\u00ae Digital Plus and DTS\u00ae HD (core only), along with legacy formats including Dolby\u00ae Digital and DTS\u00ae bring an increased sonic realism to movie soundtracks. Backwards compatibility means you can enjoy your existing library of DVDs and CDs, and through the process of upconversion using HDMI, your movies are scaled to match the resolution of your HD display. An interface suite includes an abundance of audio/video connections as well as an ethernet connection for firmware updates and future internet delivered features. \n\n \n\nKey Video Features  * HD DVD playback (including Combo. Format Discs), DVD and DVD-R/-RW: High Definition video requires a tremendous amount of space on a disc, so a new Blue laser (versus a Red Laser for DVD) is utilized for HD DVD. The blue laser, with it\u2019s shorter wave length, allows for information to be stored more densely on the disc, improving storage capacity by over 3 times that of a red laser technology. Additionally, more accurate and efficient video compression like MPEG-4 AVC and VC-1 (based on Microsoft\u2019s Window Media) compress information to achieve file sizes that are less than half of the current standard DVD\u2019s MPEG2. \n * DVD upconversion via HDMI\u2122 Video Upconversion - 720p/1080i: HDMI\u2122 can support uncompressed digital video up to HDTV resolution. The HD-A2 player makes use of this conduit by up-converting the standard DVD picture resolution of 720p or 1080i. This makes a DVD player with an HDMI\u2122 connection the perfect match for today's digital televisions. And because this conversion is performed in the player, the signal remains free frome excessive digital to analog artifacts. \n * Video Output: 1080i/720p/480p/480i \n\nKey Audio Features  * Built-in Dolby\u00ae Digital, Dolby\u00ae TrueHD, Dolby\u00ae Digital Plus, DTS\u00ae, and DTS\u00ae HD (core only): The HD-A2 has built-in processors to handle the multi-channel decoders for Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby TrueHD , DTS and DTSHD. It employs the use of four DSPs to decode the multi-channel streams of the wide array of audio formats. These 32-bit floating-point DSPs are world renown for their high accuracy and are employed in many high quality audio solutions in the home theater market. \n * Advanced high-performance 32-bit SHARC\u00ae Digital Signal Processing: Realize the benefits of new generation high-definition audio to complement high-definition video with 32-bit floating point SHARC DSP.

Every DVD-Video disc is mastered in MPEG-2 progressive scan (480P). By preserving DVD's progressive scan image, the ColorStream PRO connection provides a new dimension in total picture quality, delivering a more film-like, three-dimensional image. The progressive scan image is flicker-free, with virtually no visible NTSC line structure or motion artifacts, and offers better resolution than standard interlaced images. These outputs allow the video signal to be sent from the DVD player to a component video equipped interlaced or progressive scan TV. When this connection is utilized with today's HD-compatible sets, typical NTSC artifacts-like video noise, dot crawl, and flicker-are virtually eliminated, resulting in a low-noise, highly detailed picture with unequaled color purity. \n * Composite Outputs -- 1 \n * S-Video Outputs -- 1 \n * Component Outputs -- 1 \n * HDMI Output Version 1.2 -- 1 \n *",
