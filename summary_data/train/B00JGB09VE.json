The blades seem a bit expensive, but time saved in getting a flush cut is worth it. my only complaint is the Allen key needed to switch blades has no way to store it on the power cord or on the machine itself. Since there is no case for it, I'm going to have to buy an after market allen key holder so I don't loose it. If it had that feature included, it would be 5 stars.",

I chose Dremel just because I know that they are a brand that will stick around that will always be easy to find parts for. It is simple to change out the tool attachments, and I love the little half-circle saw blade. I like how portable it is, and that I can do lots of small jobs around the house even though I don't own full-size saws or sanders. The small size makes it easy to control.",

The oscillating Dremel is overall easy to use, sturdy and is great for cutting outlets in back of cabinets and other uses when a rotary tool or router will not work. You can get in close and make clean cuts. The only issue I have with it is you really have to tighten down the nut as it will back out when tool is in use. Even with torqueing it down well you still need to check every few minutes to make sure it is not coming lose. However that aside it is a great tool and value for the money.",

I'd definitely up the amps if I were cutting tile. Again, should have bought one of these a long time ago. Really handy.",
