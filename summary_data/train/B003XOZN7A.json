Works well right out of the box and not noisy at all. Seems to put out good heat for it\u2019s consumption; didn\u2019t seem to raise our electric bill much at all, maybe added $20 per month for each heater. Definitely beats any gas heater we\u2019ve tried, especially in terms of cost of use. Using 2 of these in a non-insulated 1200 square foot, 14 foot tall metal shop with great results. We bought a 3rd one just in case and unless it dips down into the 20\u2019s at night, the 3rd one is not needed.",
