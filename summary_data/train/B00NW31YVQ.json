      "text": "I love my Canaries! They keep an eye on my home and my puppies when I\u2019m out so if there is activity anywhere I get a notification and can instantly check what is happening. If the puppies are restless (or having an argument) I can talk directly to them which calms them down. I can\u2019t imagine life without these invaluable security cameras. If anyone enters my home who shouldn\u2019t, I have the option of sounding the alarm and calling for help, right there on my app. It is an anxiety preventative, a useful spy and it\u2019s so inconspicuous that no-one ever notices it\u2019s there. The perfect watch dog. Get one, or three, you will love them!",

Each update adds items that only make it a better camera. This camera is built solid, not cheap plastic like others, the craftsmanship, design and feel is comparable to that of Apple products. I have also used this camera for other uses, inspecting wall cavities, underneath the house, and last but not least capturing the entry point for unwanted visitors (check out the attached picture). This camera just keeps getting better and better.",

I am assuming they were hoping for a higher monthly subscription conversion rate, but this decision will probably be the being of the end for the company. The user base is revolting and negative reviews will continue to impact future customers acquisitions. Ring seems to offer a better product with cheaper operating costs.",
