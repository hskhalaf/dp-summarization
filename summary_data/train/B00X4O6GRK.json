The machines run 24/7 remotely at client sites and have done quite well for a machine that costs about $100. Just got my first defect in Oct. of 2019...not bad for a machine that has run nonstop for nearly a year and a half. Hopefully I won't be getting 29 more over the next few months, but even still they have been great little machines. Light on horsepower of course, but quite sufficient for a lot of applications. Thanks Azulle.",

The Amcrest surveillance DVR taps into my Wi-Fi network and allows for live viewing via a computer on the same network. What's the point of having a viewing station in your office? I had a spare monitor, plugged this baby in, and it works like a charm. My only complaint is if I run the surveillance streams at 720p, the little stick gets super hot. When I dropped it to lower resolution, the temp dropped to normal. I'd suspect prolonged use at any HD resolution would result in a similar experience. Perhaps not the optimal HTPC solution.",

It does get quite hot at times when watching hd video but it has never shut down or showed any artifacts on the screen. The SSD storage does get used up quickly also but all you have to do is pop in an SD card for extra room. I would say it is a good buy if you can get a used or refurbished one at a lower price point.",
