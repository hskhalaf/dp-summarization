I\u2019m mostly a back sleeper and I toss and turn throughout the night and wake up with extreme back pain. It\u2019s more of a medium soft feel rather then the medium firm as stated.

(Foam mattress can be made from petroleum or from the natural rubber of a rubber tree. They are both called latex but have very different properties.)
