      "text": "As for looks and attention to premium quality appearance, these are impressive, from the packaging to the overall looks and thought. HOWEVER the actual functionality lacks as the temp sensors built in are useless since they are heavily impacted by the airflow temperature. More importantly there is an annoying noise when air flowing through between 20%-100% opening, a rattle that woke us in the middle of the night followed by the cover falling off (magnet held.) Another issue is that they don't really fit flush, there is a bit of a gap against your ceiling. Watch video for rattle",

    "description": "Size Name:4x12 Inch Smart Vent\n\nWe believe your home should be your sanctuary and not another source of stress. Our products ensure that when you get home, your home gets you. The Smart Vent was designed to increase comfort and reduce energy costs by regulating your home\u2019s temperature room-by-room.\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\nMeet your Smart Vent Now you can heat and cool your home the intelligent and efficient way\u2014room by room. The Smart Vent creates an intuitive room-zoned system that proactively balances your home\u2019s temperature. The average sized home only needs a system of 4 - 8 Smart Vents to ehance both comfort and efficiency.\n\nIntelligently connected The Smart Vent retrofits existing floor, wall, and ceiling air vents in just a few simple steps, then wirelessly connects to your home network. The vents communicate with each other, as a Smart Vent System, to regulate airflow in rooms too hot, too cold or not in use for most of the day.\n\n\nTemperature Sensor calculates individual room temperature to better regulate airflow\n\n\nPressure Sensor measures air pressure at the vent for system protection and diagnostics\n\n\nBattery Advanced control algorithms enhance battery life, extending it for years\n\n\n\nMore comfort, more efficiency Strategically placing 4 - 8 Smart Vents throughout your home, in rooms that are over-conditioned or rarely used, creates a balanced home temperature system that enhances comfort room by room.The Smart Vent\u2019s built-in temperature and pressure sensors wirelessly communicate with each other\u2014as well as other smart devices\u2014to regulate and redirect airflow when needed.\n\nAbout the Startup \nDescribe your product in 3 words.\n\nRoom-by-room. Intelligent. Zoning.\n\nWhere did you get the inspiration for your product?\n\nNayeem, Ryan, and Will all grew up in homes with central air. They all suffered from the typical hot and cold spots that many homeowners deal with on a daily basis. In early 2013, Ryan was lying in his bed, with hot air pouring on him from the air vent above his head. He thought how much more comfortable he\u2019d be if he could control the airflow from his phone, which was lying on his bedside table. Ryan brought the idea to Nayeem and Will and all three began running experiments in their homes that winter. They observed that selectively closing certain vents enhanced both comfort and efficiency of a home\u2019s central HVAC system. The Smart Vent was born.\n\nWhat differentiates your product from similar products out there?\n\nCurrently, there are no truly intelligent air vents on the market. Our product installs in a few minutes and a system of just 4-8 Smart Vents can achieve much of the benefits of a multi-thousand dollar professionally-installed damper system. Moreover, our Smart Vents are wirelessly connected and can work together to make the smartest decisions for your home\u2019s airflow. Finally, the Keen Home app gives users the ability to take control of their airflow and also gain insight into the health of their HVAC system.\n\nTell us about the best and most challenging parts of the creation process.\n\nBuilding a connected device presents many of the challenges that software companies face and combines them with the difficulties of hardware manufacturing. Thankfully, we have built an excellent team that has a wealth of hardware and software development experience. The entire team is motivated every day by the fact that at Keen Home, we\u2019re building products that will truly enhance the way people live in their homes. With our technology, we want your home to take care of you\u2014not the other way around.",
