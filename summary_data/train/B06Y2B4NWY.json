As it's true to a certain extent, i'm confident Norton will continue to develop firmware updates to balance speed versus security. The range of this router is great as well. Place it somewhat in the middle of your home and you should be plenty covered. Key Points - Setup via app versus webpage - Not a modem/router 2-in-1. You will need to purchase a separate modem as this is purely a wireless router. - Looks great in the home. Does not look like the Kylo Ren ship Netgear Nighthawk router.",

      "text": "I purchased the Norton Core Secure WiFi router to replace the Comcast router I was using which was known to constantly slow down my internet connection to a dramatic stop on my various laptops and FireStick TV. I have a business and a home office so I appreciate the added security that the Norton Core Secure router has provided. I get notifications from the app that I downloaded informing me of any suspicious activity that was blocked. I have to say that I am very happy with the purchase of this router and was pleasantly surprised to see the difference with the speed.",

      "text": "Set up should be simple, but after an hour on the phone with tech we're still not set up (reminded me of early 2000's tech support). The only resolution was to have level 2 call me 'within 24 hours'. The inability to schedule a time... or range of time... with support is unreal given the clientele who are buying this are A. busy and B. used to service. I have not been able to connect with Level 2 during their random mid-of-the-day calls. Will update the review upon successful completion or return of the product.",

The power supply plug is designed in the wrong configuration as to take up 3 plugs on an APC UBS battery backup unit. It also takes up 3 plugs on a surge protector cord. Those who have their WiFi devices, Modems, Switches etc on a UBS system will experience this problem. I cannot comment on the actual functionality of the device as I did not even get that far, for without it being on my APC UBS I would loose WiFi in the event of power drops and losses. One last issue, it does take up a great deal of space.",
