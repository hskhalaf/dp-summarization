I took it to a repair shop to replace glass and they told me that it was clearly a refurbished phone, insert anger! I am so irritated that people can do this, sell something as NEW that is NOT! We paid NEW price and get a refurbished phone. This is so wrong and quite frankly pisses me off! Make sure you research and know who you are buying from and what you are actually paying for!",

The ability to replace battery is not that important. I googled the issue, and it seems to not be rare.",

That;s probably it since my brother's phone still works great to this day. But I can't in good consience recomend this phone anymore. I ended up sending it back and buying her the LG K10 instead. The build is very similar and the size is opretty much the same. RIP LG G3, you were a great phone.",

The phone will restart to the extent where you are not even able to unlock the phone to make a call or send a message - all you see is the phone restarting. This is very inconvenient - I definitely don't think I got what I paid for. I am extremely disappointed. I do not recommend buying this phone from this seller.",
