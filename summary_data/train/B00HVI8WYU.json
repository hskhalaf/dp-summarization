It should fill in where you need, but still feel like you have nothing on before you add your foundation and makeup. Sounds too good to be true? Well, this primer nailed it! It's not only light and does it's job, it's refreshing! A smooth, cool, satin feeling that disappears instantly. I nearly forgot I put it on, until I looked in the mirror! Wow!",

Would recommend for use for light wrinkles and pore coverage. A little goes a long way, so it's cost effective also.",
