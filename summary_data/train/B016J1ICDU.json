Definitely nothing like what I've heard abojt juicers. The trick is to clean the juicer as soon as you're done juicing and to use the included brush on the mesh filter!",

I got this new redesigned model for another apartment because it had a better looking jug - which it does but otherwise it doesn\u2019t work nearly as well as prior models. This re design has a weak motor and cheaper components and does not expel pulp properly so if you\u2019re making a lot of juice it all gets caked in the centrifuge. I\u2019m hating this model after loving many others. Try to get the one with the bigger motor and smaller jug.",

So far carrot juice has not stained the plastic like my last juicer. My only complaint is the plastic parts seem fragile. Time will tell.",

    "description": "Get into juicing with this no nonsense dual Speed juice fountain cold. Ideal for first time juicers, this juicer runs on 850 watts and has two Speeds, 13,000RPM or 6,500RPM, for hard and soft ingredients. Fruit is largely composed of water, but its selling point is its nutritional value. How do you extract the juice from fruit, without leaving the nutrients behind? Breville's Nutria Disc and patented juicing system extract more nutrients than other juicers and transfers less than 1.8F of heat to protect enzymes and maximize nutrient absorption of select nutrients. The uniquely designed juicing system features a feed chute that is centered over the shredding disc. This allows for more efficient juicing than systems that introduce ingredients on the side of the shredding disc. The dual Speed, 850 watt motor allows you to juice hard fruits and vegetables like apples and beets on high Speed at 13,000 RPM, while the low Speed (6,500rpm) is optimal for softer fruits and leafy Green vegetables like cantaloupe and spinach. The Juice Fountain Plus cutting disc is so powerful that pineapple can be juiced in large chunks with the rind on. In addition, this juicer features an extra wide 3 inch feeder chute that accommodates large chunks or entire pieces of fruit or vegetables, eliminating the need for chopping vegetables. The BJE430SIL is not only easy to use, but also easy to clean. It is pulp ejecting and comes with a large capacity pulp collector and most parts can be cleaned on the top shelf of the dishwasher.",
