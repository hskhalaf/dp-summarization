Also the fabric can become pretty saturated fast during a light rain and cause the umbrella to slump while fully raised... Overall a little costly..I ordered 4, . took me about 2 weeks to get an adjustment on 2 I had to return, I kept the other two out of frustration... the pic shows the fabric after 10 min. of light rain...",

The \"metal\" button that controls the tilt feature is made of a material that could never withstand the shearing forces it is subjected to---it failed miserably, rendering the whole product useless. Until the manufacturer improves the quality of this important part, the product should be removed from the market. It is a sham that has basically stolen $65-$85 from the pockets of many. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!",

Kinda odd other colors are cheaper then the deep purple. I only paid the extra money cause it's my favorite color. I would recommend this umbrella",

The lights provide ambient lighting at night, which we prefer to bright light. The only thing keeping it from a 5, would be the density of the fabric. It isn't as thick as our other umbrellas have been in the past, but it does the job providing shade with the extra benefit having lights to enjoy an evening under. If the fabric was thicker, it would probably cost more. This product fit what we wanted to spend, so I really can't complain.",

The solar powered LED lights are rather nice, but the quality of construction is quite low. Not sure how long the lights would have worked. If your umbrella is in a location sheltered from strong winds, this might be good enough for your purpose (and is quite cheap).",

Last thing was the cable inside that runs the lights snapped, so no more led lights. My deck isn't that windy, I can only imagine that this umbrella is overpriced. If it was priced at $30 I would have known it was cheap and avoided it. But since it was $100 I thought it would be decent. Apparently not.",

Now, I take it down and keep it in the shade when not in use. Luckily, it's very easy to do that. Still, it's a great value and I've already recommended it to friends.",

Extremely disappointed and upset we cannot return for a new one that is not broken.",

Brought it out this season set it ready to enjoy again but cranked up and it slid back down within 5 minutes. Obviously not going to work this season. The fabric also faded badly although not that noticeable on the tan color that I had purchased. Should have given the negative reviews more merit. Hope to find a better made product with the same solar light feature.",
