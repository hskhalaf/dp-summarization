I can safely state this slip cover looks fabulous, feels fabulous & is not a thin cheap material. I have a very dark brown oversized loveseat. I purchased the Silver. It is actually a off white which was exactly what I was hoping for! I love gray but did not want a gray loveseat. It goes on easily no straps or ties, just slide it over match up the lines and tuck! I wanted easy on & off due to having a misbehaving 10 month old Rottweiler that loves to jump on furniture . I definitely ordered the right cover!",

The combination of velour and spandex made for a good fit and it stays in place, transforming my outdated print loveseat so that it looks good and is comfortable as well. We got a light color so I was very impressed with how easy it was to spot clean. 9/26-We decided to order a second slipcover in the Zinfandel red. A great color for the room and probably a better choice for a loveseat that gets a lot of pet use. Also, threw the silver cloud slipcover in the washer and it came out great!
