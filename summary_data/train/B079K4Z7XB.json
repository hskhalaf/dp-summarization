Lucky for me I purchased the Square Trade Warranty. The repair bill was $291. I only use it around my home so maybe it had 10 hours of use time on it. If you are going to buy one don\u2019t get the electric start, the part was impossible for the repair center to locate.",

It was super easy to assemble, 5 mins max, added oil (included) and gas, plus the 3/4 full battery, and got going in less than 15 mins. The machine has a LOT more power than my old electric pressure washer. As others mentioned, it seems nicely engineered, with no cheap plastic parts (it does have plastic, but seems high quality). Great machine so far, hope it will last. If anything changes I'll update the review.",
