For sizing, I'm 5 ft 2 in, 145 lbs, apple-shaped 50ish woman, and the large fits me without serious tugging. I tried the Lido style by the same company, but it felt smaller with much less room in the chest. Ladies, whether you are snorkeling or doing water arobics, this is a very comfortable way to go -- coverage and warmth in one low-cost package. Extremely high quality, too.",

I am 5'7\" and the length was what I expected but was a bit too tight. I normally wear a large or extra large depending on the manufacturer so the sizing isn't far off but I had to return this one and extra large was not an option. I would however; recommend trying the suit but I cannot speak to the ease/difficulty of pulling it on and off the shoulders.",

It really has extended her stay in the water from a comfortable 30 minutes and getting cold to not getting cold for hours. A beautiful suit and the front zipper was huge in my decision to purchase. The quality so far is great, the zipper large and smooth operating, easy to get in and out of. Honestly, she never wants a rear zipper unit again, as I always had to help her out of it. We get out about every weekend and this has been a great purchase.",

Furthermore, it is difficult to find in bigger sizes. I ordered this suit because it had a front zip and came in a size 16, that I needed to accommodate my 38DDD bust and 170 pound frame. I did not like the fit or look on me. I also ordered a size 16 in another style that fit well and was quite figure flattering. So I know such wetsuits exist. I will be returning this suit. This wetsuit might fit somebody else just fine.",

The zipper in the front makes it easier to remove and no fear of the zip breaking this century, it\u2019s an industrial sized zipper!! Well worth every penny.

I haven't had a chance to use it in the water, but I will update my review as soon as I do. As for fit, I was nervous ordering it after reading the reviews, but I followed the size chart and it is a perfect fit. For reference, I am 5'5\" 145lbs, athletic build, 36C/28in waist, and the Large was perfect. It is a tight fit, but does not hinder movement at all and I am able to get it on and off by myself :)",

I saw someone wearing a similar Cressi and she liked the looser v-shaped neck that actually let's you breathe. Front zips are a little harder to get in and out of, but no biggie. This suit fits okay -- not great, but whatdya want for 60 bucks? I'd prefer 3 mil, but this is fine for warm water diving and snorkeling. I have to tug it into place now and then, but I'm hoping it will adjust more to my form over time. Satisfied.",
