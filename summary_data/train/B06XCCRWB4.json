It was not broken off, it was just not manufactured correctly. I did a prompt return, but will not have to source my beer faucet locally as this was for the July 4th party. bummer....",

Easy to clean and reassembled with some food grade lube solves that issue. Consider buying some plastic caps to seal the opening when not in use to keep it clean and free from fruit fly etc.",

The things I like are: One piece construction, there is no nut and barb to connect to the beer line, it is machined from one piece, so no possibilities of leaks. The collar and shank both have a gasket, so you don't have to torque the collar nut onto the faucet to prevent leaking, finger tight is fine. The faucet shuts off cleanly at the end of the pour, no drips. If I expand my keezer beyond two taps, I will be getting more of these faucet/shank kits.",

This tap mounts tightly on the fridge wall after punching a similar size hole for it and it fully disassembles for cleaning without having to remove the shaft from the fridge. Handle even unscrews in the event you want to put on a custom handle. No complaints here",
