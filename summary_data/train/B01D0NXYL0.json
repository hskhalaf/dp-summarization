I have found all the nickels I have missed in my yard. After I master this I'm going to buy the At Gold. Great service from the seller as well",

It seems to pick up targets as deep as my AT Pro under all conditions except in salt water. I suggest you limit your looking with this machine at the beach to dry sand.",
