When we placed the smooth pieces under the furniture, I could move them by myself. Once the new floor was in, we placed the felt pads under the furniture to keep from scratching the flooring. The pads stayed in place very well. If we ever need more, we will definitely be ordering more.",

These have been perfect. I've used the felt ones to move our new appliances onto the new wood floors that we put in our kitchen. And the plastic ones are equally great for moving furniture around on the carpeted areas of the living room. Some of the furniture would be too heavy for me to move on my own, but using the movers has made it possible in most cases.",

They are very level and durable, so moving my pool table doesn't cause the pool table to become uneven and they aren't crushed but it's weight. I've also moved my sectional couch and a bed and these are just all around great and O-mazing pricing for quality and how many you get! Thanks!",
