They have sales pretty often and then after you spend a certain amount, you get free samples or a free Deva Curl towel. The towel that comes with this set is marketed as the original Deva Curl towel (grey, bigger than a hand towel, and very nice microfiber), however what you get is a dumbed down version for Amazon that is smaller than a hand towel (see picture) and is cheap like the microfiber cloths you can use to wash your floors. I\u2019m disappointed in the deceiving marketing and Amazon accepting such a cheap product replacement.",

It is gentle enough that it does not irritate my extremely sensitive skin (other products have caused break out and rashes). I'm very pleased and would order again.",
