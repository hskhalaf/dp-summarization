I recommend the standard size unless you have a giant dog with crazy thick nails. The standard size is perfect for our 80 pound GSD.

      "text": "Works great, fast quick cut with good control. We used to have the guillotine style and they never worked well, often shredding our dogs nails. These cut the nails sharply with no shredding. We use the safety stop and on both of our dogs they haven't had trims for some time so we had a little bleeding but on the nails that were shorter the safety stop was spaced fine. I'll give this 5-stars as any trimmer w/ a safety stop probably would have resulted in the same situation so I fault us for not keeping the nails trimmed not the product.",

This nail trimmer was effective and swift. The trimmer has sharp blades. The nail guide prevents over clipping, and the trimmer handle allows for a secure slip free grip. Pooch was antsy, agitated and resistant initially, but once I got her on her back as if I was going to rub her belly, the task was completed without blood or pain for the pooch. Thank you Safari for making a dog nail trimmer that makes a difficult task easier.",

They were it! Cut her nails on all 4 paws in one sitting, less thank 15 minutes. These things are strong. Will be purchasing a second pair to put up, in case we lose these.",

I cut all of her front nails (two snips each nail, because they had gotten so long while I found and ordered these) in less than a minute. My Alaskan Malamute/German Shepherd mix got his nails cut for the first time today, and he did wonderful because of how fast these are! I love them and will recommend to everyone!",

I don't use the guard that comes on these and if I push it to the side it doesn't get in the way at all. As a reference: I am currently using these on a 5 month old Collie puppy.
