We currently have it in the babys room and it is super quiet which is very nice. The smart phone control capabilities and settings are a very nice feature to personalize it for our specific use. I am a chemist and I love that it is constantly measuring particulates to provide an air quality reading, very impressive. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a new purifier that is smart, quiet and easy to use!",
