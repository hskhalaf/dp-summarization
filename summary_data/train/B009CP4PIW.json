When I saw a co-worker using one, and watched him \"turn it on\" by bending the mouse, I was hooked. Then when I realized how thin it was and how it was what I was looking for as a travel mouse, I was doubly hooked.",

When you are storing it, you un-arch-it so it lays flat. To use it, flexit in a curve, or archit. The design takes a little bit getting used to. The way it fits in your hand is not what you normally have with a standard mouse. I have used it many times and in very happy with it. To use with my laptop when traveling it is just fine. I have had people notice its design and ask what it is which makes me smile. Happy that I bought it",

The frequency with which this happens seems to increase with age. Finally after about 3 years mine started malfunctioning in all sorts of ways. It's an interesting concept, but I'm not sure it really provides much advantage over a small laptop mouse for travel--neither is particularly ergonomic. And, I've never had the scroll wheel on a normal mouse stop working. As Microsoft never acknowledged this as a software or hardware product defect, I won't be buying the \"newer version\".",

The solution is either to keep the nails short, or to scroll with your fingers slightly turned sideways, that is not always comfortable.",

Not only is it annoying if I am working my myself, but is unacceptable in a group setting working next to others.

      "text": "I really like having a mouse that folds flat, as it is one less thing to hold when moving around the office. 3 things I don't like 1. Battery life: after about 3 months of 9-5 use the batteries die. Not a huge deal, but I'm used to getting 1 year+ out of a wireless mouse. 2. At times it seems to 'disconnect' moving the mouse doesn't move the pointer. hitting the trackpad on my laptop or turning off/on the mouse fixes it. 3. The scroll wheel sometimes stops working, but a quick, off/on fixes the issue. Those 3 things don't bother me at all, and I doubt everyone's mouse does that.",

I've tried it on multiple surfaces, multiple computers, and with multiple people. Same results every time.",

Another major feature missing from this mouse is backwards and forwards buttons. I am going to see if I can return this to Amazon.com for a full refund and go back to a wired mouse.",

I returned the item as defective and a replacement was sent. The replacement is 75% better than the first one, but still glitches out here and there.
