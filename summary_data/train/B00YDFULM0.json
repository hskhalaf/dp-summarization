      "text": "This piece came in a small box with protective wrapping around the shower head as well as bubble wrap. It was super simple to install, though I didn't notice a change in water pressure, it seems to last longer without the water pressure lowering between cleansing. The waterfall feature is something I'd never experienced before and is quite neat, but I prefer the regular shower feature instead. It's a good, wide range that the water sprays out and the water pressure is definitely better than what I expected for such a small piece.",

Most shower heads are tiny and pierce skin with their pressure and the big rainfall ones just have too much spread to be good...this one, at about 5 inches is perfect.",

My only complaint is that you have to be very careful with where you start spinning the neck into place because you may find that the shower head is off to the left instead of standing directly over you. I got it pretty close to midline.",

There are two buttons on the head itself, one for streaming and the other for a sheet of water the flows from the slit in the shower head. It's a great feature for getting large amounts of soap off quickly. The flow restrictor is under the mesh screen. The screen simply pops out and the restrictor is a small white plastic object. It will be obvious what it is. Once removed, put the mesh screen back in place and you're ready to go.",

I got fully wet in less than 15 secs and had a lovely bath after long while. Kudos to AKDY for such a quality product. Highly recommend to anyone who don't want to waste 50$ like I did last time.",
