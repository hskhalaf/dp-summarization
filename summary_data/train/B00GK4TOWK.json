The Boss bucket will not slip over the standard DIY 5gal bucket, but does fit perfectly if installed as stated below. 1) turn Bucket Boss inside out 2) insert top INTO bucket 3) fold Bucket Boss over sides of bucket 4) slip one side of Boss Bucket under bucket handle I ended up buying 3 more, one for each of my commonly used carpentry, electrical, plumbing and gardening tools.

Well thought out spaces for hammer, and bucket handle can be used or down. It has a lidded pocket for smaller items, and I love the hooked strap for holding a roll of tape. Canvas is heavy enough that it feels like it will last for many years, not so stiff that you can't easily get your tools in and out. I might buy another one to keep around the house. I can see all types of uses for this item. Keeper!",

Much easier than running back to the garage when I forget I need the stud finder or whatever other need. Much lighter than my old steel tool box. Also does double duty as a kids toy to keep your infant and toddler entertained while you knock out your project.* *Parental supervision required",
