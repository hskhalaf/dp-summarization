People had loads of fun chatting while each made their own combination of foods. Tip: cook the potatoes ahead of time (to put the cheeses on) but they tend to cool quickly. Also, don't bother with skewers on top grill - not all food will hit the cooking surface equally. We also made 's'mores' with graham crackers and marshmallows and chocolate melted below.",
