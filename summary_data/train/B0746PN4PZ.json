The XBox Elite controller is the most ergonomic and good-feeling controller I've ever held in my hands. This PS4 controller is a very close second and the closest approximation available for PS4. My one and only complaint is that the vibration function is too much stronger than the standard PS4 controller.",

The overall shape makes it so you frequently hit the L1 and R1 when you didnt mean to. Also the extra top buttons might as well not exist, since they are so hard to press. Also this thing is extremely expensive. I prefer the staggered stick design but I think there must be better options out there for a fraction of the price.",

This doesn't always resolve the issue, as in my case. Nicon said that a future firmware update will address this issue, this was 8 months ago. I am returning this controller in exchange for another new one. I'd like to note that the rest of the features on the controller work as intended. I had no further issues.",

      "text": "I purchased this controller after burning through 2 Dual Shock controllers for my PS4. The quality of this is outstanding. It allows for excellent customization as far as button layouts, stick sensitivity, controller weight, and vibration sensitivity. The wired connection reduces input lag and offers an extra long cable. It allows for different button layout profiles which are easy to switch through. The price is steep, but worth it for those that want a lasting, quality controller.",
