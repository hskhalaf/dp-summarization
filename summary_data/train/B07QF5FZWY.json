      "text": "My wife and I were in the market for a queen mattress to replace our older spring mattress. We opted for memory foam to try something different. I thought it would be much firmer, but it is a nice medium firmness. the mattress was well packaged,It decompressed in a few hours and was everything they said it would be. Great deal.We bought this mattress after staying at the hotel,Our hotel room had a great cool firm memory foam mattress. This one is definetly comparable to the mattress we slept on at the Hotel. This bed doesn't put pressure on my joints. It supports your body, and allows your muscles to relax. I love it!",

I tend to be overly warm at night but I have been more comfortable since I got my new mattress. As in much more comfortable. I love, Love, Love my new bed and feel like it was a terrific value.

Highly recommend, as well as the great value of the price.",

That is good for back sleepers and stomach sleepers, but less so for side sleepers. Still, a quality mattress for a very convenient price. I used the queen size on a Nomad Plus frame (narrow gap slats) and it worked fine--although the mattress is very slightly wider than the frame. I let the mattress come to life for a few days while I assembled the frame, then stained and poly coated it. No chemical smell at all from the mattress. Overall, quite happy with the purchase.",

It took a couple of days to completely return from compression to its normal size. There was no bad odor. I forgot, at first, that one side is softer; lying down, I thought it was much too soft, but upon reading the instructions that came with it, I flipped it over ( which is easily done by one person) and now get good support from the preferred firmer side. It is also apparent that there are different levels of support in different areas. I am well satisfied with this mattress.",

I can be used on both sides as it's flippable. It retains its original position even after multiple use. You will definitely need an alarm to wake up due to the peaceful sleep you'll have.
