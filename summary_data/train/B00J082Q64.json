Something has to give and that weak link is literally the links in the band on this watch. They just don't feel right, they feel cheap. I cant emphasize it enough its the only negative I can think of about this watch. Otherwise I love it fully functional, big and bold. It looks good just when you feel the band you know it couldn't be expensive. If that sounds okay with you than you'll love it, picture is accurate just be aware what case diameter refers to and what you already wear.",

This gold colored timepiece is a good blend of macho and classy, but since it's brushed gold finish versus the shiny and sparkled one, I think the Aviator does a good job. This one looks like it will be a good casual or work business casual item to trot out to the office or to some Christmas parties coming very soon. The jeweler, who adjusted and removed a few links, commented on this in the positive manner. Amazon gave a very very good price on this watch.",

I read a couple of reviews and one said the red second hand fell off, ok out of how many thousands of this style watch is manufactured, just like new cars and other new items you can get a lemon, they warranty it for one year so that should ease the pain of a defect. I collect Invicta watches, I have quit a few of them and not one has malfunctioned yet ! Their watches are well worth the money, they keep excellent time and are very good looking. I just ordered another one with the black dial, Invicta Men's 17206 \"AVIATOR\" Stainless Steel .",

Overall I am very disappointed, the watch is outside the return window and I am sure warranty repair will not apply since it will cost me more to ship it back to manufacturer for repairs.",

It is heavy for a watch but seems to be well built.

    "description": "With its most inspired creations yet, Invicta demonstrates its technical and design prowess, offering timepieces of style for extreme value.\n\n\"We have long held firm to the belief that supremely crafted timepieces can be offered for extremely modest sums. It is the founding principle of our flagship and the radical notion that still drives us today. By being true to our convictions, we will continue to turn the balance of power, and deliver true Swiss luxury to anyone who desires it. Let all those who possess our timepieces and pass through our doors witness the quality, value and care in every piece we create, and the spirit of never-ending possibilities in everything we do.\"\n\nThese are the words that greet visitors and motivate team members inside the Invicta Watch Group's new worldwide headquarters. Emblazoned in stainless steel, it has been the Invicta message since Day One.\n\n With each new timepiece, the company sends up a flare for those looking to be defined not by how much they spend, but how wisely they spend. With its strong collections, the gutsy Swiss brand is guaranteed to keep attracting followers. \n\nIt takes years of training and a great deal of pride to achieve glorious Swiss timepieces by hand.
