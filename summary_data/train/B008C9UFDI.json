Only negative is that it is like looking at the sun while it is on, and you can't turn off the light (part of the toasting element).",

Although it is an odd shape in comparison to our previous ovens it works very well. We use it to reheat frozen pizza and vegetables, make toast, toast pine nuts, and even to bake salmon and cookies for the two of us. It has a pullout tray that captures crumbs, making the oven easy to clean. One little glitch is that crumbs also collect on the front lip of the base, but it is pretty easy to wipe those into the pullout tray. So far, very good.",

Over time this will rub away the finish and lead to rusting. Dumb flaw. Also, read the fine print. It isn't meant to be exposed to rain, which is really dumb for a mailbox! I will certainly have to replace it after a year or two. Finally, it would have been nice if they included screws for mounting.",
