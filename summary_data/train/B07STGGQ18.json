However, having 6 cores and 12 threads really make video editing a better experience, on top of having the huge IPC bump compared to Zen+ (I've used a 2600 on a different setup) really makes a difference in games. The 3600 isn't really the \"when in doubt buy this\" CPU anymore IMHO, but as someone who edits code and videos and games on the side, it's still the best general-purpose CPU for the price.",

FPS difference in CS:GO is roughly 100 FPS. ~250 on the 1920x, and ~350 on the 3600. The system has 32GB DDR4 3000 MHz ram (overclocked to 3200MHz on the R5 3600 due to better ram compatibility), and a GTX 1080 Ti with a morpheus II GPU cooler. Your results will vary depending on your hardware. Most games, and tasks feel much smoother/snappier. Overall the 3600 is easily the best bang for your buck CPU out currently.",

I would highly suggest investing in a good cooling fan (NOT AIO!) and it took temps down 10C. I have no idea why HANDBRAKE would max out my CPU to 95C but it did. lol, eventually I switched up to a 3700x, and I have had zero complaints on anything. Including temps. All in all, great CPU for the price, but if you have the choice to get the 3700x, make the jump!",

I've heard Premiere Pro might be better optimized, but I don't use it myself. I play my games at 1080p 60fps max settings with an RX 570, this thing rarely needs to go over 40% usage. Your GPU will bottleneck before this. OBS while streaming PC games bumps my CPU usage maybe 2-3%, super good chip. Overall, extremely great buy and very inexpensive.",
