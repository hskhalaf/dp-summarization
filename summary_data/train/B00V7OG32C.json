The medium seemed a little dark (and I do have a tan on my face since it's summer). The one complaint I have is that the cream can look a little cake-y, so you need to use it sparingly. Also, because of the cakiness and the darker color, I mix it in with a regular white moisturizer cream, and that solves the problem. The color works better for me and it doesn't look caked.",
