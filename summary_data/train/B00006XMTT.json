As always with these types of bits, when doing the rail ends, you need to watch for chip out. I recommend routing a backer that you will use behind the piece as you move it through the router, to prevent the chip out.",

He just needed to move forward the plywood with the rollerblade wheels to move it closer with each pass. It is going to be used for wainscoting for a 400 sq. foot room. We would definitely buy from Freud other bits because of it working so well.",

I unknowingly purchased the Rockler set up gauge as part of the package which while being great for setting the height doesn't work for the over-sized front depth of cut. This has to be set by a trial and error method depending upon the reveal necessary. I'm very happy with the performance of the bit!",

The Freud sets are my favorite because I can tweak the dados to match ply for flat panels. The longevity is on par with any other industrial cutters I use, and I can usually get it sharpened once without losing much fitment quality. I generally get several hundred doors worth of use out of each set so you really can't beat the value.",

I may have been foolish, but I assembled slideouts for my kitchen with no glue, just these joints and the slots for the drawer bottom plus two pins at each corner. The assembly is remarkable stable and square. This interlocking features of this joint are inherently strong.",

This bit set does take some training and some practice runs but once you're set up it goes smoothly. My recommendation is put it in the router table and make some test cuts first, you will get more out of the video and instructions that way.",

I have a very small gap when viewing the joint from the end. Because of tear-out the feed rate needs to be fairly slow, especially when cutting the tongue on a stile (using a backing board helps). I found it easier to cut the tongues first, then the groove. For me it was easier to adjust my router depth in this order.",

The jig put the bit height at .998 ... the math put the bit height at 1.02 ... that is a great tolerance.

Also allows you to set the tightness of the joint to your own preference.
