The handle did not rip, the material it was sewn to did not rip, it looks like the stitching from the handle disappeared???? I want to try and hand stitch it with a thicker thread though it may be difficult due to the thickness of the handle material. The other hamper i have is still fine. Honestly it probably let loose due to the over packing that these hampers get on a continuous basis. I put so much clothes in it that i push the close down like garbage in your kitchen garbage pail. Still use them all the time.",

(Aren\u2019t so many things like that though?!) Kind of nervous to buy these without seeing them in person, but they are so much more well-made than what I\u2019ve been seeing in stores!! Love the reinforcements, and the side pockets are a great feature!!",
