They were ecstatic because of this trail companion\u2019s durable construction, precise outsole traction capacity, and lightweight build. Yet the part that got the bulk of the praise was the broad design of the forefoot section; people felt that it permitted the foot to relax and assume a natural position during the run. But there were complaints about the irritating upper aspect, as well as the water-magnet of an upper.The Altra Lone Peak 4.0 is a product meant for trail running enthusiasts and those who have neutral running gaits.",

        "Many people commented that the upper unit of the Altra Lone Peak 4.0 was sturdy and secure",

        "A majority of those who have tested this shoe claimed that the sizing scheme followed their regular anticipations",

Had them for about a month now and am very pleased. Impressed with the grips having been up and down some muddy Yorkshire peaks this weekend too. The mud doesn\u2019t seem to cling on to the grips as much which keeps them grippy. Will probably use these for every surface now. I use a half size up for all my running shoes",

The Lone Peaks are lightweight, zero drop, huge toe box and comfy out of the box once I'd pulled the laces out of the top lace hole. You feel like your bouncing along with enough grip that it feels like you're pushing the Earth backwards rather than moving yourself forward! The laces are rubbish but I replace all my laces with elastic ones anyway.",

    "title": "ALTRA Lone Peak 4.0 Low Mesh Trail Running Shoes - AW19",
    "description": "Altra Lone Peak 4.0 Low Mesh Trail Running Shoes With fresh updates to its predecessor, the Altra Lone Peak 4.0 Low Mesh Trail Running Shoes provides durable support and comfort to the feet, an ideal companion for the challenging trails you take on. Mesh Upper An update on previous versions, the mesh used on the upper part of the shoe is not only more breathable, but it has improved durability and security. The Footshape toe box allows your toes to spread out more naturally, offering greater comfort and stability in uphill climbs and downhill descents. Thicker material coverage and support is offered to the toes and the heel, protecting it from bumps and downward forces. Should any liquid enter the shoe, the improved drainage hole system will remove it efficiently and effectively. The laces run up the foot, and a padded tongue mean that you will always be able to find a comfortable fit. Heel loops make transporting muddy shoes indoors is quick and easy. A four-point Gaitertrap is a hook and loop tab that allows you to attach a strapless gaiter, which would prevent debris and grit from entering and causing irritation. A-Bound Midsole The EVA midsole contains many areas with features that provide the shoe with extremely responsive rebound and cushioning, as well as the standard EVA that also protects and rebounds. A-Bound, and energy-return compound sits directly underneath the foot, which reduces ground impact, returning the energy as a spring for each step that you take. The feet sit on the midsole on a zero drop platform. This means the heel and the forefoot are the same distance from the ground, encouraging proper low-impact form throughout your trail run. Found inbetween the A-Bound and the EVA midsole, there is Altra's Stoneguard. This is a shield that offers flexible protection by deflecting rocks into the midsole, making the ride feel smoother and more stable. Maxtrac Outsole Staying in complete control is crucial on the trails. With the Maxtrac",
