The only reason I give it four stars is the clicky button would stick almost every time I would use it at first...had to work it and put a dab of white lithium grease on it before it would work flawlessly. The Write in the Rain ink cartridge works great, I do prefer gel ink over ballpoint but this works great. The best part is the pen is made in the USA!!!",
