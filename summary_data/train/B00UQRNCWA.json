Struggled a little getting the OS to recognize the Buffalo Drive, but it now works fine for both reading and writing, at least so far, as I have only been using it about two months. Have not tried M-DISCs in it yet, but plan to later. The mechanism is a bit delicate, but the functionality for the price appears excellent.",
