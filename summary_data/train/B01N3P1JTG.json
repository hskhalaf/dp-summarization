When I went back and reviewed the unfavorable reviews, it was clear that the people that complained about the product simply did not understand how to assemble and or use it.

    "description": "The Hoont cobra water jet blaster animal repeller - motion activated the Hoont cobra water jet blaster animal deterrent drives away unwanted \"visitors\" to your garden or property with a harmless jet of water. When the built-in sensor detects movement within a range of up to 30 feet, the jet of water is activated for approximately 5 seconds. Animals are frightened by this jet of water and immediately leave the monitored area, and learn to avoid this area in the future. Also, the clicking noise of the distribution valve that sounds when the jet of water is activated frightens the animals and helps to drive them away. The jet of water is only reactivated when movement is once again detected. This ensures high effectiveness with very low water consumption. The Hoont cobra water jet blaster animal repeller is the most humane method for keeping animals and pests out of your property. It doesn't kill or harm the animals, it just sprays them with an annoying squirt of water, thus forcing them to leave the area. With no messy traps, chemicals or pesticides, it's absolutely safe for you, your kids and for your pets. Repels birds, dogs, cats, squirrels, skunks, deer, wild animals, etc. Easy setup connect the hose, stick the garden stake into the ground and adjust your water spray preference. The device is ready to protect your garden and property. Package includes: Motion detector water sprayer hose connection stake owners manual. Scares away all animals, such as cats, dogs, squirrels, skunks, deer, wild animals, birds, etc. Animals are startled and quickly leave the area and will avoid the area in the future.
