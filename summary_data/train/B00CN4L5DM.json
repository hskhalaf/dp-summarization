Extremely easy to travel with- when I travel it holds my blow dryer, flat iron, shampoo, conditioner, skin care regimen, hair brush, blow drying round brush, and my daily makeup. It's large and perfect for what I wanted.",

As a freelance makeup artist I'm constantly needing basic things while working, and sifting through bags looking for specific items is a hassle. This bag solves that problem. I found everything I needed in seconds while working on set, and there's so much space. FYI for those who are planning to buy this bag, since it's plastic it comes flat and is hard to shape into place. Use a blow dyer on the lowest setting of heat and mold it into place. Took me about 15mins to do this.",

Also, there are 2 full-length pockets inside, one with a zipper! The ONLY con to this bag is having an end pocket only on one end of the bag. Not only does it look odd, but it also weighs one end of the bag down more than the other, so that carrying is off balance. And it is the only extended-height exterior pocket. I will have to change a few things around so that the contents of that pocket are lighter. Other than this one con, it's the perfect bag!!!",

When I purchase a product brand new, I expect it to have all of its parts so that was a bummer. I can fix the button by going to Michael's but it's not that urgent. Also, the buttons are magnetic but not strong magnets, rather weak. I think for $30 it should have stronger buttons. Overall, it seems like it will do the job and if it gets dirty which of course it will, it's easy to clean.",

      "text": "I LOVE THIS BAG... I could have bought a pricey bag cause yes us MUA love our stuff. But I love that I can see quickly where everything is.. organize the deep/large side pockets... tissue holder and work faster and more efficient. the handle is really nice and I was able to buy clear pliable pouches so it looks like a set... people give me compliments on it all the time... Also it being clear means when you are looking for something you are not staring into a dark hole... love it.. love it love it..",

      "text": "Took me so long to find a bag that was efficient and that I actually liked. As a professional makeup artist, organization is key. And this bag certainly delivers! I love the simplicity and the fact that you can see where everything is. It's also very easy to clean and to keep looking like nice. With any cloth or even leather bags I've had in the past, they start to look ugly as soon as any makeup residue or liquid accidentally even touch it. This one is perfect. I love it! Thank you.",

      "text": "I really like this bag, made of nice heavy plastic, no plastic smell, nice pockets with good snaps, roomy, came really fast but---- it was mailed in a too small priority mail box it has major creases and folds because of it. I'm working on getting them out since I like the bag so much- hard to due since the plastic is so thick, but I think it will be worth the effort. Hope I can fix it to look good, if not, guess I'll just use it wrinkled.",

      "text": "Yes, it's amazingly roomy for all my hair supplies, including even my two sets of large rollers, brushes, combs, triangle net, clips, mousse, styling and finishing sprays, styling creme, root lifter, and shampoo. And I think there would still be room for my hair dryer if I wanted. It's nice to have everything in one place and be able to see where each thing is, because the bag itself is clear. The plastic of this case is thick enough to be strong, durable, and stand up on it's own even when empty. and yet it's flexible, too. I am so glad I ordered it!",
