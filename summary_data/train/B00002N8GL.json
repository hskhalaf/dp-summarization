It wasn't an open box, it just wasn't packed from the manufacturer. I immediately called the company, and they sent me a handle; 5 days later, of course. It holds water like it should, and doesn't leak through the axle. It's priced right, and very functional. The tow strap and pin can be used, or not. The picture suggests its connected to the handle, but it isn't. By the way, Agri-Fab was cordial about the missing handle, but the delay threw me off schedule about a week.",

I left the hitch \"U\" off for manual rolling, which made it clean and injury-free. Did it solve the bumps in the lawn? Well, it will probably take several uses to get the lawn as smooth as I would like.",

    "description": "The Agri-Fab, 18\u201d x 24\u201d Poly Push/Tow Behind Lawn Roller #45-0267 will help restore a lawn to its smooth appearance after flooding or eliminate frost heaves caused by freezing and thawing. The drum can hold up to 250 pounds of water or sand. Water is the preferred choice when filling the drum as you will be able to empty the water out at the end of the rolling season, which makes storing the unit easier. For users who prefer to fill with sand, Agri-Fab recommends filling the drum only halfway full. The drum has a removable one-inch plug, which makes filling and draining easy. The poly roller comes with a scraper bar that removes any debris stuck to the drum. The roller\u2019s drum is made out of a sturdy polyethylene, which resists dents, rust, and weather damage. This roller will last you for years to come with proper care and use. All Agri-Fab, products come with a 3-year limited .\n\nAMAZON.COM\nThe Agri-Fab poly push/tow lawn roller is ideal for flattening uneven ground caused by moles or frost-heaving, and for packing down newly sown seed or sod.

It features a removable hitch for push or pull operation and a removable drain plug. A well-designed channel bar right above the roller knocks off excess dirt. The roller is made of smooth-finished plastic for even and consistent flattening. The poly drum resists rust. This push/tow lawn roller comes with Agri-Fab's 1-year warranty.",
