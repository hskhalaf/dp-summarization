This product only has a low quality elastic string to close the top of the gaiters. Not only does it not close the top completely, but it is clear the elastic string will wear out quickly. 2. The fabric on these is simply one layer of woven nylon. It does not seem very durable. There are other products which seem to offer more than one layer of fabric. Go with a different product-- there are superior products at the same price (or even lower price). Don't buy these.",

When I'm done trimming, I simply use a whisk broom to brush these off, remove them then wipe off the straps and they're nice and ready for the next time I need them.

I ended up ordering a M (figured I would have gotten a S), but this size works great over snow pants or regular hiking pants.",

They kept me dry and fit pretty well, especially when I was descending and posting into the snow for stability. For the price, you can't beat the performance of the product. I'd buy these again for sure. -John",
