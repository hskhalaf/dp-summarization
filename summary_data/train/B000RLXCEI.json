This is what Yolanda Foster from the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills wore on the last season's reunion show and I loved it! Fortunately I was able to find a blog about her and what makeup she was wearing for that show. Can't find the color in department stores online for some reason. Found here on Amazon. Love it!",
