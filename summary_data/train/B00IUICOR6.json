      "text": "Actually this is a very nice headset. Lightweight and pretty good sound. The problem I have is the audio cord. Bose has changed the connectors on both ends (from the previous model (\"Quiet Comfort\"). The end that attaches to the headset is now small and a strange proprietary size (not 3.5mm) and the other end is no longer has the 45 degree angle coming out of your phone to prevent the cord bending and eventually shorting every time you use it. THE HEADSET CORD IS RIDICULOUSLY THIN! My CORD DEVELOPED A SHORT after 5 months. Replaceable for $30.",

      "text": "P-H-E-N-O-M-I-N-A-LLLLLLLLLL Just arrived via Amazon Same-Day Prime (gratis).....bought these to replace some cheap low end trash I was using on my desktop. These Around-the-Ear Style fit perfectly with NO excessive pressure.....easy to wear for hours. Audio is excellent, highs and lows nicely separated with none of the bass muddy lows that many \"trendy headsets\" are notorious for. Cable has mini controls mounted to it for iPad and iPhone useage. Comes with a very nice Bose case for traveling or storage. This is NOT a noise cancelling headset but the great fit of the over ear cups shut out most noise in the home environment...... This is a great Amazon priced entry level headset into the Bose world.......!!",

They tend to block a lot of sound when you are listening to music, although they are not noise-cancelling, you will definitely be separated from the outside world.

The case is pretty basic, just enough to hold the headphones and nothing more. The sound is impecccable, nearly noise-cancelling for half the price. The headphones themselves are incredibly light, but are sturdy even though it might not look as such.",
