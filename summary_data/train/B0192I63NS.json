It has two rocking chairs on it, so it won\u2019t blow away. If it didn\u2019t, I would be concerned. It has a nice feel underfoot and because it is thin, you transition easily over it to the other part of the deck. Also, it dries quickly after a rain storm. I would buy this again.",

      "text": "For an inexpensive outdoor rug, this 4' x 6' rug is almost perfect. It fits exactly in the area I wanted it for, and the brown version looks as it does in the product photo. It arrives tightly rolled in plastic -- unfortunately, with the good side facing out, which increases the likelihood of damage in transit-- but takes only a couple of days to relax to flat or almost-flat. Like my other outdoor rugs, it doesn't dry as quickly as I'd like, but I have to remind myself that it *is* a rug afterall. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",

Seller answered immediately that it was red. It is indeed! Rug came folded but the creases areny too bsd. The price was unbeatable for this size.

I didn't have much shedding like some talked about and it only had a light odor but nothing unbearable. It unrolled perfectly and I didn't have to use anything for the corners to weigh it down to help flatten out. I could of maybe gone with the next size up but I'm happy overall! I do think it's a little pricey which is why I ended up with the smaller size. The jump in price is a little much and the teal seems to be more expensive than the rest due to popularity.",

By the end of August, the rug had faded to almost beige from the original color, red rust. Cannot recommend this product. Perhaps another color would not fade as badly, don't know.",
