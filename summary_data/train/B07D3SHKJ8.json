People complaining about lack of card drops don't seem to understand that drops are, by design, random. That is how random drops work, people. Buy cards to play and have fun, not because you are expecting some high-value drop. That said, I bought this booster box for my 11 year old and he pulled some pretty good/expensive cards.",
