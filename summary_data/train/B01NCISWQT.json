      "text": "I\u2019ve always been curious my ancestry but have been a bit skeptical about the whole DNA analysis kit things. I finally decided to just try it out and I can say I\u2019m honestly really happy that I did. The kit was simple, organized, had extremely easy to follow instructions and the collection process only took a few minutes. I really enjoyed that the provide you with details on the testing process and the results and that you can track the process online with your own personal code. I went it skeptical but came out super excited, so much so that we are ordering another test for my husband.",

I wasn't so interested in the ancestry aspect of it as I was the health aspect. It gives some detailed information about caffeine, blood sugar, the types of foods that work best for you and so much more. Some of the information was a little off in comparison to what I actually experience, but again, it's not a medical diagnosis in anyway. Most lined up with what my doctors have already told me - I'm healthy. It's a great place to start in continuing or getting healthy. Loved the recommendations, especially in regards to vitamins.",

This is a basic analysis of how much protein you should eat based on your calorie count they give you. If you know your general ancestry, and you know your approximate BMI, there are no real insights to what you could or should do. It's really about selling their supplements so don't be fooled that you'll get much value out of this. Even their exercise comments are vague, \"you may be less responsive to weight loss through exercise than others\".",
