I\u2019m 5 feet tall and wear a 14 to 16 pants and was unsure of what size to order. After reading all the reviews, I settled on a medium. The pants fit perfectly. There\u2019s a lot of stretch. I like the fact that they fit high above the waist and at the back. I wore them for the first time today and was comfortable in the water for 40 minutes. The fit allowed for maximum movement and I was able to do my entire exercise routine. Very pleased!",

As it turned out, the weather was mid 70's, but I was so happy to have worn these pants, as I remained totally dry, despite water getting inside the kayak, warm (not hot), and comfortable. As well, I was also able to pull the pant leg up to my knee to wade in and out of the kayak. These fit true to size, feel great, and are well made.",
