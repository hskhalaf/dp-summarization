I've been using these on a 29+ hardtail for aggressive trail riding. So far, they've performed as well as the Race Face Chesters I have on my enduro rig.

Riding off road it's barely noticeable, but I ride in the rocks of southern Utah, so it's really bumpy which probably dulls the noise.

Lots of pedals have some kind of studs to dig into a soft sole shoe but all of those are slick sided studs. These studs are hex screws mounted thru the pedal and they are jaggedly ribbed in machine thread for super bite! Big platform supports an adult foot very well. My size 13 Sketchers never slip. Well made and perfect for MTB. I used these to replace the stock pedals on my new 29er.",

If you are buying them for a young rider, they will have to learn to keep their legs clear of the pedals, or else their leg will be impaled by the studs.",

      "text": "I recently ordered these pedals to replace my temporary medal pedals on my new mountain bike. I was continuing to scrape my shins when I mounted and dismounted my bike. These pedals definitely resolve that issue. For the price the quality is exceptional and the more I use them the more I can further tune the pegs for the perfect grip on my shoe. I would highly recommend these pedals and plan on buying a second pair in the future!",

      "text": "Out of the box they seem to be of decent construction for the $20 price tag. These are made in China so don\u2019t expect them to substitute RaceFace Chester\u2019s. I purchased these as cheap grippy pedals for my single speed beater/commuter. I won\u2019t be taking these on any trails but they are great as a cheap alternative to other more expensive platforms. Only came with two extra pins. Nothing particularly impressive about these but hopefully they are more durable than my stock pedals.",

The ones on my other bike are still great a year later and about 1500 miles of singletrack later. They have been hit, rained on, hosed off, ran through mud, bashed off rocks and have never so much as lost a single screw. They take a beating and hold up well! Half the price of comps and they seem equivalent in style and durability. Highly recommend!",

IT was pretty dissapointing. I tried to contact the seller and never got a response. Hence I am leaving this bad review. I would stay away from these pedals. Also, the install was not great. The pedals went on crooked and do not have a great easy fit.",

Although, I must say that I ride pretty hard and have probably put about 1,500 miles on these pedals. But mostly on the road as I don't think I did any trails with these pedals. The ugly: See the picture that shows the missing threaded end of the pedal. The shaft broke about 3/4 inches into the pedal. As my last pedals of a different brand only lasted 6 months, I think I need to start buying more expensive pedals.",
