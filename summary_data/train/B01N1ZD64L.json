It's very sturdy and solid...and to be honest, we're big people and it supports heavy weights with no problem. Most importantly, it looks GREAT and all the storage is neatly tucked away and not visible. It's perfect for what we were looking for for the back door where our two dogs go in and out--room for leashes, towels to wipe their feet, shoes for us, etc. Highly recommended!",

The baskets are handy for storing the grandkids shoes and toys. It is durable, as my husband weighs 240 lbs and it holds him. What I didn't like were the instructions. There's a certain way the divider pieces had to fit in order foe the back piece to fit. The directions weren't clear and the pieces weren't clearly marked as to front and back. Once the piece has been screwed, and then unscrewed, it wasn't as strong. But, overall, really pleased with the product.",
