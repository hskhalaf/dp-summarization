      "text": "All Bosch products are great, this is a really nice random orbit sander, at a great price. However, their marketing claims are exaggerated: - It is noisy like any cheap orbit sander. - The cartridge filter does not work, there is dust anywhere. In other words, it works as bad as any other cheap random orbit sander, do not listen to their features. Now, considering Skil, Porter-Cable, DeWalt and this, this was more attractive. It is nai\u0308ve to expect anything better for that price, a truly gem such as Festool cause a fortune. So, I hooked up to a vacuum with a hose and work that way. Nothing else to expect.",

The cord is nice and long, and the adapter that's included for the Shop Vac hose is actually the right size.

None the less, I'm returning it. I have used several brands of orbital sanders over the years with mixed results. This particular unit is absolutely horrible. When you near the edge of the board being sanded it just pulls right off the the edge. I was hoping this sander would deliver the swirl-free surface it advertises but it is one of the worst sanders I've ever used. It's going back ASAP!!!",

Even after sanding for 2-3 hours straight, this great sander doesn't get warm....it just keeps on working. I love it! So why didn't I give it 5 stars? The adaptor, which they claim fits a ShopVac, does NOT work with my name brand ShopVac hose. Luckily I had an assortment of adaptors, and one of them works. Unfortunately, the one that fits is 16\" long, which makes using the sander slightly awkward. I recommend this sander and would buy it again in a second.",

Except for this one behavior, it seems like a quality build. Also, the little dust collection box seems to really work. Anyone experience the grabbing and jumping around? Any thoughts about whether that will go away?",

The dust cup does a decent job of minimizing the dust from sanding as well. I often times do some of my less intense sanding inside my house and this has made that possible without a total mess. There's still some dust in the air but nothing like there would be without the dust cup catching most of it. Very pleased with this purchase.",

Even after fairly prolonged use there is no haze of dust in the air -- most unusual.",

Honestly, the thing I like the best about this is how quiet it is when running.

I don't care if there are bigger, better sanders because this one gets the job done and quietly (I didn't notice my earplugs weren't in until I fired up a different sander for the same project). This sands redwood so smoothly with 320 grit discs that I almost hate to stain it afterwards. Square single-speed palm sanders have their place, of course, but this one adds a finishing touch you'll admire as it's being applied.",

Not the best to use around nooks or crannies or sanding baseboards if they are still at the bottom of the wall - the design and shape and size makes that a difficult task. Does as advertised.
