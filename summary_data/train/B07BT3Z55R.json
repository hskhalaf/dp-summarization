I don't like using the old fashioned crimp style curler because I loose a lot of lashes. This little device is just perfect. Use mascara that doesn't clump immediately upon applying. Just a thin coat is all you need and the Acavado does the rest. Lasts all day!!!",

It's easy to use to get close to the root of your eyelash, easy to hold, and instructions are clear. I followed everything I was supposed to, but it wouldn't curl my lashes. I was so disappointed. Maybe if someone had very fine, long lashes? Mine are just normal and it wouldn't do anything to them. I will stick with warming up my regular eyelash curler with the hairdryer.",

I use it on the bare lashes first then apply a light application of mascara. I only apply one coat and my lashes have a natural curl to them. Lashes stay curled all day.

However, the white plastic tip/cage part that surrounds the heated metal part opens up by itself after about 2 weeks of use and even if I protect it with the cap, it's very fragile. The backside broke off in the middle. I'm still using it but it's more dangerous now. Maybe this is something to look into fixing for a new model?",

Overall, I'd say that I spent more time cleaning the curler after using it then using it to curl my lashes. I used it according to the directions and didn't really see a difference from my normal lash position. Also, it made my lashes clumped together and look more spidery, which I don't like. This product isn't something that I could easily incorporate in my daily routine so I'm planning to either return or get rid of it.",
