      "text": "Bought this for my son. Unit is light and seems durable enough. However, I noticed immediately that the view was becoming obscured when trying to look through the eye cup. Turns out the eye cup rubber is deforming with even slight pressure and obscuring a large portion of the eyepiece. So you have to hold the unit against your eye with absolutely no pressure to be able to see the full unobscured image. While I appreciate the comfort associated with the eye cup, it really hurts the usability of the product. Considering this unit costs roughly double that of the cheaper Chinese models, I expected better quality control in regards to such a sensitive component.",

There no hand strap or way to attach one. And the case that comes with the Monocular does not have a strap. It is easy to focus, it is lightweight, and it powerful and I do get a clear view (with and without glasses) but it's a pain getting it in and out of the case ... So for the lack of extras - I can only give it 4 stars",

There is less searching around before you see the object and can focus on it. I guess its because you have the other eye to provide the visual point of reference. I agree with others in that it needs a cord or lanyard for the front eye cover.",

I like to watch birds from different windows in my house. So, I purchased a second one for a second window. I can see purchasing another of this monocular again in the future.",

It was easy to focus and helped me to see some fantastic birds. I liked that the cover for the front lens was attached and wish the cover on the eye piece had also been attached, but that was a minor inconvenience. The carrying case that comes with it is also very useful.",

It was great for that! This is just the right size to slip into a backpack or wear on a belt while hiking. I only wish we'd had the budget for more powerful optics, because of the distances often involved in that park. Still, without this tool we would've missed a great deal more.",

For pros I'm sure you will have your cons but for the field grunt these are plenty good Enuff! Money well spent for what I will use these for.",

The quality is excellent, with a very good field of view. For serious watchers, this one will fit the bill.",

Yes, a little harder to find your view compared to the binoculars, and yes, a little more prone to shaking, but all in all, these are a nice addition. Definitely more powerful than the binocs. I have one bad eye so don't miss the binocular view at all. The tripod is worthless, need to find some larger and more stable tripod. But now tempted to buy 15 X 70 binocs on a a stable tripod.",
