The dual core that I was using before would regularly run at 100% and eventually overheat, this one stays cool and I've yet to use more than 70% of its power. If you're looking at this CPU, you're probably in the same boat that I was, well, the claims are accurate, these are awesome. Arrived in pristine condition and fired up right away. No complaints at all.",
