Two measured pumps is enough to cover my entire neck and chest area. The cream absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft and not at all greasy. I can get dressed right away and the cream doesn't transfer to the neck of my blouse or dress. There is no noticeable scent so it doesn't compete with my perfume.
