I wish I'd compared this one to one from Target earlier so that I could've returned it. I've hated this thing from day one. The tinny, rattling sound makes me grit my teeth every time it comes on.

He used to do the sign for \u201cplease\u201d to me so I could push it for him. Once his fingers were strong enough to push it by himself, he was listening to it non-stop in our car. I love the fact that it plays classical music and not baby songs.",

It does not play continuously without stopping, but part of the fun and learning process for him is pushing the button. We have yet to replace the batteries and it is played constantly.

Things break down. So i bought it again, and several days after it arrived, i notice black paint markings all over my daughters face/mouth. I dont know how much of it she ingested, but thankfully she is fine. I\u2019ve attached a picture to show the old one i bought, where the paint is still intact, versus the new one where paint came off. This is completely unacceptable. I am returning this product.

Little one is so delighted with it, the toy nips brewing meltdowns in the bud.
