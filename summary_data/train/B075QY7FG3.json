Lastly is the awesome selection of new minifigures! I really liked how Batman and Wonder Women have a retro/new type of look. Overall I would highly recommend this awesome set!",

I especially like that we have several female characters that my daughter loved to play with (especially Wonder Woman, of course). The set is fairly easy to construct and then quite fun to play with. Of note is that the mech shoots very tiny weapons that will be instantly lost, especially in any kind of carpet. I wish Lego would stick with larger projectiles because these are just waiting to be stepped on or eaten by the dog when we can't find them. But in all, a great set with a cool set of figures that make for great play scenarios.",

It is a big project but using the instructions you can break it into at least three sittings because they have separate bags of legos for separate sections of this project. It is really cool looking when it is complete. There was nothing difficult about building this. It was simply time consuming. I would highly recommend this to any legomaniac or just any parent who wants to bond with their kid over a big lego project.",
