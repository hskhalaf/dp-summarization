      "text": "I have 7 kids and have never been able to find a broom that can hold up for more than a few months. The handle always got bent and then broke clean off. This broom is the first one I've found that addresses the major weaknesses I've seen with brooms. The handle is reinforced steel and is the strongest handle I've ever seen. I love the cushioned support that is placed in exactly the right spot. The supports on each side of the broom head keep it from coming off which was another problem I struggled with. This mom is very happy that my search for a broom to meet my large family's needs is over!!",

The bristles apture minutia, while the very trong but light pole makes easy work for the user. Thickly padded handles reduce effort and friction. The design rinses in a garned hose very well, and dries immediately. We live on a farm, and this is one tool that gets used fast (and sometimes doesn't return) due to great performance. treat yourself today. We bought this at full price and so this is an honest review.",

It's a tad bit heavier then most brooms (not much) but the handle is solid which makes the whole thing sturdier to work with. And the bristles are compact with enough rigidity to sweep just about anything yet pliable enough to not stir up the dust.This would be a broom I would expect to be used everyday or quite frequently. Even if you only sweep once in a while, I'd have a hard time believing that it won't be around for many years.",

I mention the first handle as this one was made to have a tighter tolerance and makes over tightening (which can snap the plastic threads on the handle) near impossible as rotating the handle to over tighten is difficult.
