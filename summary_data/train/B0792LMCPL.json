If you are into wood carving, whittling, and/or bushcraft, this is the draw knife for you, i.e., it's compact, it's sharp, will be easy to maintain, and most of all it works. Above I posted several pictures of two quick tests I put the draw knife through. The first image shows the tree before the use of the BeaverCraft draw knife. The second image shows how well it debarks a conifer. It took only seconds. The third image demonstrates how well it shaves layers off. I piled the shavings for view. I hope this helps.",

BeaverCraft even includes bandages in the box which I find awesome, too. PROS: Affordable, Sharp, All-Inclusive Kit, Durable, Great Value CONS: I only need to buy one :-) (In other words... NO CONS!)",

The in-line handles threw me off at first. I got used to it pretty quick and now I think I prefer it. The inline handles allows me to not only draw it towards me but also push away if I desire too. It has good polished harden steel and keeps an edge. Finding quality hand tools of this nature has been somewhat frustrating. Nice to know someone is paying attention.",
