They are a Godsend at our fire pit. Highly recommended.",

However, the curved grippers at the ends tend to catch under logs, making it difficult to get out from under the wood when it is time to withdraw the Tweezers. I flattened the curves into a slightly angled configuration with a mallet, which has improved performance dramatically. So, if you buy these things, order a mallet as well if you do not have one...",

I used a hand cleaning product for grease removal bought at an auto parts store which cleaned the tongs well enough to keep. These were a good price, had they been more expensive, I would have been high annoyed by the issues requiring my attention.",
