The straps are extra strong and thick enough to be comfortable when carrying wood from the woodpile into the house. Wide enough to carry even the 24\" wood we use in the deep stove we have. I have absolutely no complaints about this log carrier. It is large enough to carry in an armload of wood at a time, yet leaving your other hand free to open the door, or hold onto the railing if you happen to have stairs, thus it is much safer than struggling along without it.",

He used to bring wood in from the woodshed in a big plastic tub which was awkward, but he says he can get just as much wood in this one than the tub and so much easier to handle. Very durable material and handles.",
