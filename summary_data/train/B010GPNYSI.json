      "text": "I had to stop using it after two loads... because I ran out of dirty dishes. And after I had bought this, I stopped doing dishes until it came. Holds a lot, and coming from someone who is very lazy about cleaning off dishes before putting them in, just get the real big or solid things and leave the rest the the dishwasher. I am so happy that I don't have to do the dishes any more. Oh and also the front and sides (probably the top too) are magnetic so I use mine like a fridge. Now I need one of those dirty/clean magnets.",

Adapters that are for potable water that fit between the quick connect on the dishwasher to my sink have been difficult to find and when found have not been suitable for use. It sucks because I just really want to be able to use this in my apartment instead of having it sit on the floor and take up so much space. Will update this review if I ever am successful at finding a viable adapter.",

      "text": "Probably one of the better dish washers I've had in my life and that's kind of sad really. Definitely love it and had no issues with it so far. One good note like some others have pointed out is that when its done open the door and let the dishes air dry for 15 minutes. The dishes will be so hot right after its finished that any water/moisture will be gone within 5 minutes of opening the door. There is no vent on smaller units like this to let the moisture out so you must do this unless you don't mind wet dishes hours later.",

Monitor the drain connection when you first turn it on as it leaked a bit the first time I used it and one other time about a month later, but now that I've made the adjustment to the washing routine I have no fear of leaving it on in my apartment when I'm not home. 5-Stars though because it really well even though it has slight limitations.",

Didn't drain properly which ended up causing a flood on my counter top. It happened just after the warranty ran out of course. Support made suggestions on how to clear the problem which did not work at all. The factory which shipped it to me does not do any repairs. Parts were available for somewhere else to replace them, but the cost was far more than the original unit and the repair shop did not recommend even trying. Will not be buying this again..",
