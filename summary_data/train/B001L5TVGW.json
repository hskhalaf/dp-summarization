While it worked -- and I used it almost every day -- it worked very well. I used it for everything from morning toast, to roasting veggies and meat. It performed these tasks well. Until today, when it just died -- probably something in the fancy electronic control system burned out. Even if you could find someone to do it, most likely not worth the time and cost. My advice, buy something much cheaper. Then, if it does in a year or so, you wont feel as cheated as I feel today.",

It dissolved the finish off the door frame, and any overspray also dissolved the finish wherever it went. While we thought the unit was stainless steel of some sort, it appears it is not. In the trash it goes. Thought purchasers should know, and the manufacture should be clear about not using cleaners other than 'non-abrasive'.",

This Smart Oven is like a second oven in our kitchen. We make everything in it...cookies, brownies, toast, pizza, bagels, chicken, lasagna, chicken nuggets, reheat meals, pretty much anything you would bake/reheat/toast in a toaster, regular oven, microwave, or toaster oven. It is the most accurate toaster oven I have ever owned. Toast and poptarts have never tasted better and I love using it to reheat leftovers. It also has a temperature setting, so you can bake or reheat at any chosen temperature. Seriously, worth every penny!!",

The oven could still function, but without the convection feature. Breville was unwilling to replace the entire unit, since it was out of warranty.

      "text": "Excellent oven, we use it daily. Update: I purchased this oven (6-24-2016) it worked great up until now (2-4-2018). While trying to use it today it flashed inside the oven and now it will not heat at all 7 months after the warranty. Not very durable. Update: I ordered a heat sensor from (Ereplacement parts) on 2/19/18 since Breville does not supply parts i just got an email 3/26/18 from Ereplacement Parts that Breville has not yet sent them the part. I guess Breville does not stock replacement parts or there are so many ovens that are broke they can't keep up. Don't buy this oven !!",

Hard to tell if the heating elements have failed or the thermometer. I give it 3 Stars as a compromise between 1 Star because it has become unusable to 5 Stars, which I would have given it for the first 5 years of its life.",

    "description": "Attribute BOV450XL: Mini Smart Oven BOV650XL: Compact Smart Oven BOV800XL: Smart Oven Dimensions 16x13x9 inches 16.5x15.5x10.25 inches 18.5x16.25x11.25 inches Capacity 11 inch pizza, 4 toast slices 12 inch pizza, 4 toast slices 13 inch pizza, 6 toast slices Element IQ?

The Breville Smart Oven began with the simple fact that different foods require different methods of heating: some, like baked goods, need to be cooked evenly; others, like meats, need to be seared on top. Most toaster ovens fail to distribute heat in a consistent way throughout their interiors, let alone change heat distribution to suit the different foods being prepared. This is how the Breville Smart Oven stands apart: whatever the food, it adjusts its heat distribution for perfect results.\n\nFor toast, high heat from top and bottom evenly crisps the outside of toast but doesn't dry out the inside (left diagram), while for baking 1500W are distributed among four elements for gentle heat and even cooking (right diagram)  AN OVEN THAT DOES THE THINKING FOR YOU \n The Smart Oven is equipped with Element IQ cooking technology, which adjusts the power of the five individual quartz heating elements to cook food more evenly and quickly. This sophisticated heating system distributes heat throughout the oven when and where it is needed, to guarantee more efficient cooking. Nine different menu options allow users to choose the best setting for the food they are cooking. In addition to dynamically distributing heat to different areas, the Smart Oven can adjust the wattage of its heating elements for even more cooking flexibility. Most ovens have elements with fixed wattage that can only switch between ON and OFF, but Element IQ functions much like a dimmer on a light switch, increasing or decreasing element power with a simple turn of the knob.\n\nThe Breville Smart Oven comes with 3 acccessories: a pizza pan, baking pan, and broil rack.  For example, broiling requires high heat from above in order to melt and brown, so the Smart Oven activates 1500W of high heat from the top elements of the oven. On the other hand, toast needs to be cooked evenly on both sides without drying out the inside, so the Smart Oven uses high radiated heat from above and below (1800W distributed between four elements) to crisp the outside quickly.\n\n Baking utilizes another feature of the Smart Oven that contributes to even heating: convection heating. Convection cooking uses a fan to circulate hot air so all sides of the food cook at the same rate. This is particularly important for baked goods, such as cookies and cakes, which need to be cooked evenly all the way through.\n\n Each of these nine functions is preset with recommended settings, taking the guesswork out of cooking. However, each can be customized according to recipe, volume of food, or personal taste. Customized settings will remain in the memory of the oven until changed or until the oven is unplugged from the wall outlet, streamlining your cooking process.\n\n DESIGNED WITH THE CONSUMER IN MIND\n The Smart Oven is carefully constructed from the most durable materials. It is attractively housed in Reinforced stainless steel, a striking addition to any kitchen. The elements themselves are composed of quartz, rather than the metal elements found in other toaster ovens. Quartz responds more quickly to heat change, which results in more even heating throughout the oven. The roomy interior is coated with a non-stick material that can safely withstand high temperatures, making cleanup easier. A crumb/drip tray that is accessible from the front of the oven (rather than the back, like many other toaster ovens) also makes it easier to clean between cooking sessions. In addition, the oven includes a patented magnetic auto-eject rack: small magnets embedded on the sides of the oven door pull the wire rack halfway from the oven when the door is opened, making food easier to remove and preventing burns.\n\n GOLDILOCKS PROPORTIONS\nAt 18.5 x16.25 x11.25 inches, the Breville Smart Oven is not too small but not too large. It is larger than most toaster ovens, with space to comfortably fit six slices of toast, a 13-inch pizza, or a whole Chicken. However, as a countertop convection oven, it is more space-efficient than a conventional wall oven. A smaller oven means less time to heat up and less time to cook, perfect for preparing a meal in a hurry (or for cooks who like to create in the heat of the moment). This also translates into a cooler kitchen (particularly convenient in the hot summer months) and less energy consumed.\n\nClick on image to view larger PRODUCT FEATURES\n\n\n a.
