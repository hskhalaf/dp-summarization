I am a Honda small engine fan, but I\u2019ve had good luck with Kohler engines as well. For a $400 lower price it was an easy decision to get the Kobler powered model, which is identical to the Honda unit other than the engine. I haven\u2019t been disappointed. The Kohler runs strong and generally starts on the first pull.",

I'm very happy with this purchase. It will pay for itself many times over vs. renting a plate compactor.",

Most importantly The Tomahawk after-sale representatives went far and beyond with helping us with all our questions , concerns and issues we encountered while using this machine... really worth every penny! Definitely recommend.",
