      "text": "I\u2019ve had this router for almost 4 years now but, although it has served its purpose, it is inferior to other routers in the market. For one, it is very limited if you\u2019re an advanced user. For example, it is not capable of crating static routes for LAN based segments. One annoying feature is the timeout when administering the router. It is about 60-seconds long and will LOG YOU OFF unless you click some link. It also has limitation on the number of DHCP reservations you can make as well as port reservation. If you are an advanced user, rethink your purchase and look at linksys or Asus routers.",

      "text": "I replaced my 5-year-old wifi router with this one and experienced a significant gain in wifi coverage, so much so that I unplugged my repeater. I am very impressed with the performance. For me there are two design drawbacks. One, the thing is huge. I call it the \"red beast.\" Two, I mount my router on the wall and the way this one mounts the cables enter from the top. This makes for a bunch of cables coming up, over and around the thing to plug in on the top, including the power. For me, coming in the bottom would be much cleaner. But overall I am happy with this purchase.",

It was fairly easy to set up using the wizard that launches when you connect to it, the instruction manual was decent, you can manually change some settings fairly easily after it's all set up without using the wizard, and so far it's providing excellent coverage in all the areas of our house with blazing fast Wi-Fi speeds.",

DLink Technical support says the firmware updates that fix them (2) actually drops the internet connection worse, yet they have been on their site more than 9 months. Load balancing must be turned off since it doesn't work, again per their Technical Support. We feel that these were the PRIMARY reason we purchased these 'high end' routers. We're trying to figure out a way to get a refund or exchange for another product from another manufacturer that works as advertised. D-Link Case Number can be provided.",

Range is better than Nighthawk too. So, so far, I'm pleased.",

It can be mounted on a wall though. The \" SmartConnect\" technology seemed confused the whole time I had it up and running. It would randomly drop devices. One device would hook right up and while on another it would take 3 or 4 tries at entering the passphrase. I manually turned the \" SmartConnect\" off which seemed to help with the apparent confusion. Still, some devices wouldn't connect in a timely manner. I sent it back. Amazon was great to work with though.",

Many of our devices, though only a year old, won't connect to the 5.0 bands. Thus we have a cluster of devices all trying to use the 2.5 band and slowing it down. It also made it impossible for us to split the bands into 3 servers to password control access for our teen users.",
