I wish I could return but it would be too much hassle to send it back after assembling. Update: January 2019 The thin cardboard caused an abrasion on my son's face. Right above his nose. It has now been over a month and clearly it's going to leave a horrible scar. DO NOT BUY! I will be contacting the manufacturer.",

That is what my 2-year old daughter was playing in before I purchased the house. Ha! It is a bit of a pain to assemble...I would definitely recommend doing it with another person. Makes it a lot easier. One other thing to note is that it doesn't have a floor. But I have a little bath rug that I bought for it...BOOM....wall-to-wall carpeting. LOLOL. My daughter LOVES it. I bought metallic alphabet stickers and put her name over the front door. Just a little something extra : )",

It was definitely worth the money for all the fun he's had. It could be put together by one person but it's easier with two people. Some of the little tabs are tricky, but if you stay very methodical and careful, you can get it together and sturdy fast. It took us about 15 minutes total to get it done.",

      "text": "Let me start by saying we loved this cheaper alternative to the known brand plastic house. It cost a fraction of the price and is just as fun. However, the house should come with a warning label. The edges are sharp and could cause serious cuts. My two year old was playing in the house when suddenly she ran to me with blood dripping from her toe. I asked her what happened and she pointed to the house. Weeks later I went to pick up the house and accidentally cut my finger on the window. Please take precautions when letting your child play with the house. I recommend using tape or a hot glue gun to shield off the edges.",
