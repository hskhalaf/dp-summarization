But a co-worker told me it takes a few days to get use to it. Now, I'm wondering where this nifty device has been all my life! Makes holding my phone so much easier. Definitely notice a different in how my thumbs and wrists feels after a long day of work. One thing to note is to not press it down until 100% sure it's in the right spot. The adhesive is very strong.",

I know this probably went into the diminished life of the sticky back. However, I intend to super glue this bad boy to my case, so I\u2019m not too fussed.",

It is well made with sturdy material, easy to apply and it has been holding to my phone case without any issues.

The socket doesn't open as far so it's harder to get her fingers between it and the phone. Also the plastic used to make it is flimsier and when pulled isn't strong enough to hold the phone as a stand, and falls over. They have made it even cheaper that it was.",

It keeps falling off resulting in me dropping my phone every time. The extension part of it doesn\u2019t open the full way. Very disappointed in its manufacturing.",

    "title": "PopSockets: Collapsible Grip & Stand for Phones and Tablets - Golden Silence",
    "description": "A PopSockets grip is more than a stylish phone accessory. It\u2019s an opposable thumb for your phone. It lets you take selfies like a pro and share with your circle of fans, friends or embarrassing family members. It lets you text things you may or may not later regret with the greatest of ease. It lets you stand your phone up on an airplane tray table to watch a movie. When you\u2019re done, it collapses flat like your bangs in a rainstorm. PopSockets grips are repositionable and stick to most devices and cases but may not stick to silicone or waterproof materials. The product includes a special 3M adhesive disc for attaching your grip directly to a glass-backed phone. You may also buy a separate \u201cmount\u201d to attach your phone to your dashboard, mirror, refrigerator, air conditioning vent or wherever you snack on content. Mmm\u2026content. And now, a little something for all you specification geeks: Diameter: 1.56 inches, Height: .9 inches when expanded, .25 inches when collapsed. PopSockets offers its customers a limited, 3-year warranty on its products. Full warranty details are available on PopSockets\u2019 website.",
