I'm an electrician and I've worked on diesel-electric locomotives which have a dizzying combination of AC/DC as well as hydro-electric generation which is mostly AC. I've used several different Fluke's in my career and in my humble opinion I could have used this 115 in any of the situations I found myself in. It's rugged yet small and portable. I've used this particular Fluke to troubleshoot power issues in my home, to install fans, outlets, and upgrade a breaker box in my buddy's house. As with all Flukes, it's compatible with every upgrade on the market.",

They offered me a slight discount on a new purchase but this is only $15 less than the retail price.

It would have been a bit more helpful if the dc and ac ranges could have been a bit higher (say 750 to 1000 volts ) since I restore old radios and some have slightly higher voltages than 600 but this is a very minor problem.

After years messing with less expensive brands crapping out in various ways, I ponied up and got this Fluke a couple months ago. Money well spent - Great feel, sturdy, dependable steady display - Really, a pleasure to use. And from all the other reviews read here, which led to this purchase, I'm looking forward to years of reliability.",

I particularly like the longer test leads, the louder buzz when using the continuity function, the AC cycles function. The unit is solid, the dial positive, the functions layout logical. The back light and min-max function very useful. I'm glad I spent the extra money. I hope it lasts a while.",

Instead on needs to look at an angle to get decent contrast with the LCD display. Not too big of a deal but it's the largest weakness I've seen with it.",
