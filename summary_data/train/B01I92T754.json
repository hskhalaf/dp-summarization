No need to spend thousands on a rear seat entertainment system when you can spend $100 on this router and a few reconditioned Fire tablets to give each member of your family their own personal entertainment experience.",

It runs a customized version of the the open source OpenWrt firmware, so it has many features and good support. Setup is relatively easy for anyone with router experience. My main use has been as a wireless repeater and vpn client to my home network running OpenVpn. Configuring the repeater function and vpn client was straight forward. Devices connected to the router without issue and all traffic was routed through the vpn as expected. The price is right, and features are just what I need. I'd highly recommend it as a travel router.",

I was impressed with the ease of the return process and the quick refund of my purchase price. Overall, I think this has the potential to be a great product. Maybe make the unit a little larger to make room for additional heat syncs or even a small internal fan. I plan to watch this product line for future improvements.",

I can confirm that after the new firmware was installed, they do indeed save your settings! The update also allows you to program the switch on the side to nothing/router or bridge mode/vpn on off.

    "description": "GL-AR300M is a mini travel router for working professionals and a programmable gateway for DIY hobbyists. \n\nLarger Storage and Extendibility:\n\nThe router is with storages of 128MB RAM and 128MB Nand Flash, which can be further extended using external USB sticks. There are 2 Ethernet ports, 1 UART, and 1 GPIOs available for hardware DIY. It is an ideal portable gateway for IoT development. \n\nWiFi Converter: \n\nWiFi is extremely popular but still may not be available at anywhere. If you are still using a wired network at hotels or cafes, this mini router is able to convert it to a wireless network for sharing the WiFi with all your devices. \n\nEven in places like cafes or restaurants with WiFi, it is not good to expose your devices to the public network directly. This router converts a public WiFi to your own WiFi with a firewall and then works as an agent for securer surfing. The agent connects all your devices when switching to a new WiFi. You don\u2019t have to input password for each of your devices. \n\nThe router is also able to convert your phone tethering, or 3G/4G USB modems into a private Wi-Fi. \n\nPortable Travel Mate: \n\nThe router is lightweight, pocket friendly, and portable. It can be plugged into any laptops, power banks, or 5V DC adapters for power supply. \n\nOpen Source and Programmable: \n\nOpenWRT is pre-installed and backed with a repository of 4000+ software packages. Pre-installed with an OpenVPN client, it works with 20+ VPN service providers. \n\nFor more details, please check our online docs at http://www.gl-inet.com/docs",
