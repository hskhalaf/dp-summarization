And then to top it off, I discovered that it took all of 15-20 seconds of sawing at the loop with a hacksaw to cut through. Due to the box's design, once the loop is destroyed, the box opens right up.",

This version by Kingsley, however, is a true combination lock, meaning there are far more combinations someone would have to try in order to open this (assuming that inputting the correct code is the only way to open the lockbox).

It's a great design, but when unlocking and attempting to relock, if the arm is turned the wrong way, it will not lock. I struggled with it for some time before I realized the issue. I ended up getting a different lockbox for our team's supplies, though I like this lock very much. If you are using this for yourself, then go for it. If you have a bunch of people using it, there will be issues with relocking.",
