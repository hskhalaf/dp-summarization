With our first set of lamps one of the bases was broken. With the second set, one of the bases was broken and the both lamps were crooked and one was taller than the other. The packaging was terrible which contributed to the condition. I was told that Amazon would pull these lamps off the shelf and check the packaging but I see they're back. Maybe Amazon fixed the problem. I also noticed that they raised the price.",

I had to order a replacement set, and out of both boxes I was able to get enough good parts to make two decent lamps. Both times there was the piece, that connects the shade, bent beyond repair. Also, the shades were wrapped well but three had dirt inside that rubbed off onto the shades. Overall, the quality of the shades is very poor. You have to be very careful handling them as they are so flimsy and easily damaged. The only reason I kept them is because the base is very unique and fit my bedroom perfectly.",

Might want to purchase the recommended bulbs when ordering the lamps. 50/100/150 wattage is needed. I'm using the lamps for a guest bedroom. The height of the lamps is perfect for reading in bed. Very satisfied with this purchase!!",

At first glance the lamps look very nice, until you notice that they both sit a little crookedly. Maybe I'll try to fix that at some point.
