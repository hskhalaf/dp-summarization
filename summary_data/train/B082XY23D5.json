Its extremely fast. The camera is not as good as I thought for $1000 phone. My LG v30 photos look more crisp. Photos taken with my S20 look very noisy with grainy edges. I expected crisp and clean edges. Battery life is decent, but not great. Work day, moderate to heavy use gets me down to 30% by 3pm. Overall, a decent phone but to expensive for what you get in my opinion.",

I thought the larger battery would give me more time between charges, but it's about the same. The S20 seems to capture weak cell signals better than any other phone I've had. The voice comes through nice and clear without breaking up.",

My friend contacted her provider, and was told \"This is not an AT&T phone and can't be used\". I returned both to Amazon, and two replacements should arrive tomorrow. I'll provide an UPDATE.",

Using this phone I feel like a prisoner inside Samsung's corporate prison.",

The speakers are also really good, I believe it uses both the bottom and the top speaker for all audio as well. Fingerprint reader is great BUT you can't use those cheap $10 glass screen protectors on this phone. Either you have to settle for plastic film or buy an expensive special uv glass protector so the fingerprint reader will still work. Other then that I have no issues with the phone.",
