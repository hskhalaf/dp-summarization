It's dust magnet, the keys stick, and the biggest issue is that the audio jack has stopped working for no reason. I want to reiterate that i used this lightly - no moving, banging, and only used indoors. I'm disappointed that it hasn't held up. The ram also wasn't enough - when all i did was have itunes and a browser open, it would freeze. Next time I'll go more powerful.",
