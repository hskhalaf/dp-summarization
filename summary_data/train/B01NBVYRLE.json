This would drive me bonkers on windy days. Would be great in a protected location.",

It comes with a cool looking bulb that you see in the promo photo, but I didn't use it because the illumination is weak compared to other bulbs. I used my Feit LED 100watt-comparable bulb that uses 15watts and it works great. I plan to eventually buy two more and install them on the front of my garage. I like that there aren't many obstructions from the design of the product so you get all the light coming through instead of seeing shadows like other designs.",
