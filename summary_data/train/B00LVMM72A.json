Not only has it seized several times and needed to be fixed but it is wobbly, loud, and I believe unsafe. I called customer service and they simply told me that they won\u2019t support the product because their warranty is only 6 months. Baby Trend could\u2019ve cared less about my children\u2019s safety while in the stroller. Complete waste of almost $200- should\u2019ve bit the bullet and bought a stroller that is more expensive. At least then maybe my kids would be less likely to be hurt.",

It lays flat and i put the wheels on it. So we can load grocerys or anything else on it and still know we have room. Highly recommended if you have a small car trunk space.",

Requires two hands to fold and is a little heavy which can be problematic when taking care of two little ones. But honestly still really worth it for what great qualify it is. Mobility is super smooth and easy, even on uneven surfaces. Highly recommend!",

It maneuvers well, sturdy,stores easily, and is comfortable and smooth enough my 15 month old passes out every outing. I am just shy of 5 ft and I find the height perfect.",
