Begin drilling on high speed AT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE to start the hole. 4. Once the bit has started on an angle, tilt the bit slowly to level to cut the rest of the circle. 5. Every 5 seconds or so, DIP THE TIP into the ICE WATER, then go back at it with gentle pressure. Drilled six holes in less than 15 minutes PERFECTLY with NO SLIPPAGE to mount a handicap grab bar in the shower. YAY me. :)",

So please do not waste your time trying to use any other brand except Diamond. Again we wasted a whole weekend using non diamond. So in an effort to save you time and running around purchase a diamond hole saw. Remember to have someone hold the hose over the drill and tile to keep the hole saw and drill from getting too hot.",

The marble pieces were somewhat fragile and I was worried that a cheap carbide bit would destroy them. You have to know to start the bit at a 45 degree angle and dip it in water every five seconds or so. That may sound onerous, but it's not when it comes to tile. It only took about 4 dips to make one hole in 3/8 inch marble. And the timing is easy to figure - just dip it when the dust starts to look a little dry. You want it to look like a slurry at all times.",

You can't drill the hole very deep without hitting the center starter, so I had to drill a pilot hole through the concrete a little larger than the center starter, which was a lot of extra work. It would be better if the center starter was retractable the full depth of the hole saw.",
