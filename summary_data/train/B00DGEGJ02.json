Several times a month one of the Wemo devices would disconnect and restoring the connection would require anything from cycling power to resetting and reprogramming the switch.

Our porch lights are recessed and the dusk/dawn option just isn't available. These light switches solved those problems and were a breeze to install. Our boxes are a bit crowded, but we were able to safely tuck all the wires back into the box mainly to the side of these rather deep WeMo switches.",

The geo location recipe between my iPhone and the Wemo switches works every time; I couldn't be happier. I liked these devices so much I purchased the wall switch as well, so the Christmas tree will finally be on a reliable schedule when the time comes.",

I moved it to another location with a single switch configuration and it works GREAT. I use with my Alexa and I love it. I do however wish I could find something to control my gameroom light which has two light switches at opposite ends of the room. Maybe WEMO can make some suggestions. :)",
