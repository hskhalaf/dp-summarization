It does put some pressure on your knees. I had both knees replaced 5 years ago, so only have minimal discomfort briefly when I get up. Not a problem",

This velcro addition keeps it 100% secure and allows me to be active and not worry about any accidents! Otherwise, I love this product!

Shorter lifespan of the product and a point of discomfort for me. Also - the clip that should link the two knees is frustrating to use. It only slides over; doesn't actually \"clip\" which means that more often than not - any larger motion I make will undo the slide. Otherwise - the padding this is MUCH better than other same/similar supports. I like the materials. They seem like if you get a correctly constructed piece they'll last a long time.",

Because it removes all tension from a sitting position, it makes one able to focus more on work (for example if work involves much sitting at a computer). It also is ideal for closed eyes sitting such as meditation, contemplation, prayer or Reiki, etc.. The letting go of all muscle tension is a similar experience to sensory deprivation float therapy, yet without the need for a water tank. All you need is you, the Better Back and a chair!",
