This one instead penetrates and hydrates instantly without leaving a sticky sensation. Another Plus is that it doesn't have all those useless and irritating ingredients like alcohol, lavender oil, witch hazel, parabens...thus it's perfect also for very sensitive skins or after cosmetic procedures. I am only giving 4 out of 5 though because it came without a seal.",

It worked on a dry elbow and, best of all, worked a miracle on my nails, and the skin around them -overnight stopping drying and splitting -a surprise benefit! On the face, it gets very warm for a short time after application, but that means it\u2019s working. Good purchase!",
