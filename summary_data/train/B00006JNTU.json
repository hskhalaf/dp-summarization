This stapler stinks. Although it is rated for 20 sheets, it jams ALL THE TIME. Basically, you are taking the life of your documents in your hands if you try to staple more than 10 pages at a time. I wish I could return it, but I am stuck with this inferior contraption and the sweet sweet memory of the stapler was taken from me too soon.",

Then, the staple arrives too far from the corner where one wants it. This is extremely flimsy, and feels like it would easily break, if it fell from the height of a standard desk. I suppose it is my fault for not checking to see if there is a way to manually drive a staple, as with other similar staplers. The capacity of staples is also much less than one would expect, given the size of the stapler. I'm very disappointed with this purchase.",

I loaded the staples. I loaded the batteries. Without being asked the stapler stapled continuously until all the staples had been used, and then continued to work without staples. I ignored the recent reviews. I was not very smart about listening to others. Now I will spend another $40 for a stapler that has good reviews.",

We did notice it has to be reloaded more often because the chamber is much smaller than manual stapler (the motor takes up the space.) For the amount of work that is required, it suffices.",

      "text": "Got this for a co worker since we staple a LOT..... It has worked for 7 months so far and withstood many many reloads of staples, and no jams when you use the correct staples for it. It's louder than mine, but still a good investment. Mine is the Swingline Optima and mine only jams when i knowingly try to staple a stack of more than 20 papers, just in case it might work.....",
