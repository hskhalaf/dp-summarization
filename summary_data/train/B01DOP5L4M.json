Before purchasing these, I use to buy generic cheap ones at the store every few months because they would tarnish, look faded, or just didn\u2019t smell right. Ever since I purchased these bowls, I have yet to buy another pack. Fantastic product, great price, and long lasting. I would definitely recommend buying them.",

She managed to get the rubber off once to flip her bowl and now she tries to get the rubber off all the time. They stay down as long as she doesn't get the ring off. Happy with the purchase, I wish the dog would just leave the dang things alone.",

It is rounded at the bottom so when the dogs step in the dish they push food out of the sides. Their old bowls were flat on the bottom so this was never an issue.",
