I have made so many batches of ice cream this year (coffee, chocolate, black cherry chocolate chip, plum, banana cream, etc.). I don't understand the bad reviews on here and wonder if people are caring for the attachment as needed. Put it in the freezer about 24 hours before you want to use it, take it out and make your ice cream, leave it on the counter to thaw for 12-24 hours, then wash it. I've had zero problems with mine, and the ice cream recipes that come with it are fabulous :)",

I made a regular batch of ice cream, held it in the fridge overnight, and went to churn it after dinner. After twenty minutes you couldn't tell it was frozen at all. When I gave up and put the cream mixture back into a regular bowl there were only a few frozen pieces in the whole bowl. What a disappointment!",

The ice cream will still be very soft; plan enough time to put it in the freezer for a while. And it does expand while freezing, so you will eventually be able to gauge how full to fill it (or try following the directions at the onset :-) ). Fill it and walk away. I love it.",

I like to put the ice cream in another container and put in the freezer to harden a little more. It doesn\u2019t get very solid but it\u2019s still fine to eat straight out of the ice cream maker. Brilliant idea. And no salt or ice to contend with.",

It's a little awkward to pour the base into the bowl while the dasher is turning and the bowl is lifted; make sure you use a jug with a good pour spout. The adapter that fits onto the Kitchenaid is a little picky, it only goes on one way round (varies depending on mixer model) and doesn't grip well. That isn't a problem as it's really only needed to hold until the dasher is in place, for that the little rubber friction fingers do an OK job.",

Now that I have made home-made ice cream, it's hard to go back to store brand ice cream - because nothing tastes as fresh as ice cream you just made yourself. My only wish is that I had two of these attachments so I can make more ice cream; but it's probably for the best, because I need to lose weight anyway!",
