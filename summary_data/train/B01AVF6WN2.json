That will keep people from needing to copy the utilities off to reinstall on another machine. Good thinking!",

Because of intense backup activity, the traditional hard drives typically do not last more then 18 months. This SSD is likely to last much longer, consumes less battery than the traditional hard drive, and is significantly faster. I am very happy.",

Now the only other reason would be the upgrade to the Retina but my eyes aren't that good to see the big difference.",
