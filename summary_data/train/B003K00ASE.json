We cooked some small red potatoes (whole) to make whipped potatoes. The beaters could not grab onto the potatoes but skimmed over them splatting small chips of potatoes all around. The beaters just couldn\u2019t dig into the soft potatoes. Maybe the silicone made the beaters too slippery(?). In any case, in the future I will buy items like this locally where returns are easy.",

It hadn't been used much but it was covered inside with what we'd been mixing. If the fan was reversed it would pull air in from the back of the mixer where it's not close to what you're mixing and blow it out the front keeping the insides clean. Poor design.",

      "text": "Beaters are too tall, and won't fully submerge in a large size bowl unless the bowl is almost full! Slings stuff EVERYWHERE when trying to mix! Even put in the sink to try and avoid a mess, but it still got e everything all dirty! The power is insane! The low setting is as powerful as my old mixer when it was on high... not suitable for my needs at all. I'm not a fan of this messy mixer",

Also I did agree with other reviews that the speeds on this mixer is extremely high. Even on the lowest setting, the potatoes were flying everywhere. So I am disappointed with the purchase. I'm glad that I still kept my other mixer.",

If you use stainless or any other type of metallic mixing bowls, it removes a LOT of noise from the equation. My other favorite feature that stands out is the clip-on case/base that attaches to the bottom of the mixer when not in use, although it takes a bit of work to fit all the attachments AND the cord inside of it. I would buy this again in a heartbeat.",
