Overall I\u2019m so happy with my Pasonomi Bluetooth wireless earbuds. Thanks",

First thing I noticed was that they didn't have any different sized ear plugs to swap out, but that wasn't a big deal as the ones that came standard seemed to work. The charging case and everything else was great. What was odd was that then I used them, my wireless signal would degrade and my connection would drop. I think, but I can't prove, that the earbuds were emitting RF noise that would degrade my wireless. As soon as I disconnected them and put the earbuds in the charging case, everthing was fine. Vendor was very good about the return.",

Right side wont take a call at all and gifts me with a horrible squelch in my ear before it freezezs up. For just music, when they do work, I am lucky to get 3 hours.

I really don't have any issues with these considering the price, but I think in the future I'd just spend more and get a nicer pair or Bluetooth earbuds. Update: Occasionally they inexplicably drop their connection and then attempt to reconnect, but can't until they're powered off and back on in the carrying case.",

They are designed for you to tap on the ear piece to pause/skip tracks. Simply adjusting these in my ears created inconveniences.
