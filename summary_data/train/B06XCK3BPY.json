I'm a security guard, & it's comforting to know that if one or more persons approach me in an aggressive manner I can blast them with light, & not only see better what's in their hands, but with their night vision affected, I can react as needed, & do it more effectively. If it turns out that there's no serious threat, there's no permanent injury to them or me. Kind of like pepper spray, but from a distance.",

After emailing Eastshine, they said that I should send back the light and reorder it. I did send it back and recieved a good working flashlight . Eastshine did respond quickly to my email and problem is solved. Now I can say \" I do recommend\"the T25 flashlight. Works well and is very bright with good amount of throw. I cannot measure throw or lumens or candela but it beats my other name brand flashlight.",

I especially like the fact that it remembers the last power setting when it's turned off. When you turn it back on, you don't need to cycle back through all the levels to find the one you want. I suppose a zoom feature would make it better, but to be honest, I doubt I would use it much. At this point I don't miss it.",

If you turn it on during the day you won't know it's on. But low is great for that late night trip to the outhouse without blinding your eyes. The highest setting will blind you. I like it.",

      "text": "I am a heat and air service tech, I depend on a good pocket flashlight everyday. This light is hands down the best light I have bought for the price. I absolutely love this light!! I just wish it would have arrived with batteries. Either regular ones or a rechargeable battery. That would have made the deal great. But the light itself is great, I would recommend it to anyone needing a flashlight.",

      "text": "To be honest I've never heard of this brand of flashlight before, so I was very skeptical about this light until I turned it on. Super bright and can throw really far! This light illuminates far away objects much better than my Fenix UC35, my Nitecore P12, and my Atactical A1S. I would gladly trade any one of my more expensive flashlights for another of these.",

      "text": "I received my flashlight yesterday, I work nights and it arrived just before I had to leave which was perfect. Within 5 minutes of use the flashlight holder attached to my belt had broken and my flashlight fell down multiple flights of stairs. There was no force involved I was simply just walking. The flashlight seems to work fine, however the rest of the items included seem to be for novelty, they are poorly made and could cause you to damage your flashlight. I highly recommend you don't use them and definitely don't buy this product because it comes with 'extras'.",
