      "text": "I ordered this just for creating YouTube videos however sent it back within an hour of receiving it. The touch controls are so terrible it was almost impossible to adjust the settings and use the camera at all. Once I finally got it setup and recording I noticed the LCD doesn't even show the entire recorded field of view which makes it difficult to make sure everything you need is in the cameras view. I would not recommend this camera at all until they correct the controls and ensure everything that is displayed on the LCD screen is actually in the recorded video.",

Great little available light camcorder that has interchangeable batteries you can buy off amazon for $4 aftermarket- brands that work great-read the reviews. Compared to other brands, this camcorder was the best for available light and hd video quality on my sharp LED tv. Very happy with purchase and size (small) of camcorder and ease of keeping it on hand when I need it with a couple spare batteries so I know I will always be able to capture what I want. Has a 1/4 thread on bottom to attach to a bike or tripod. Purchased a leather case that fits this camera and protects it well.",

To sum up my experience so far,,, all the bad reviews are just out of line. As far as no software for editing, most computers have software that functions fine with the VADO. There is also a ton of software available to buy on-line for about 30 dollars. The touch pad is NOT too sensitive. The photo quality was better than the reviewers. stated. In Summary,, the bad reviews are just whiny from spoiled brats. It was an excellent product and very affordable!",

Chasing down the warranty for my Vado has been an absolute labaryth of broken links and unclear proceedures. I have just managed to get this product registered, in order to get a RMA number, but the serial number is not being recognised! This should be simple! Registration and waranty should be linked and International Warranty should mean International. I whish i could rate the product itself, my research indicated that it should be good if not great, but so far I am dissapointed with 1) reciving a non-functioning unit, and 2) really poor warranty service.",
