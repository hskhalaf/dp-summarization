Once I was able to get in contact with them, Suunto went above and beyond to replace my broken compass. Their replacement shipped from Finland and arrived in California in about 4 business days. Wow. They also sent me a Metric version and USGS version just incase, to make me extra happy. Very high quality customer service. I am very satisfied.",

Thats great customer service and can definitely recommend them. For that i give 4 stars",

Heck, you might even be able to start a fire with it with sunlight. \"Made in Finland\" mark is nice. Good purchase, highly recommend.",

    "description": "Professional mirror Compass. The advanced navigation Compass. When venturing out into unknown territory, these sighting compasses offer precision navigation with a variety of carefully engineered and dependable features for challenging conditions. Sighting tools for accurate Direction. Rugged construction.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nHailing from Suunto's A-Range of recreational compasses, the A-30L is a compact, well-designed compass for hiking and orienteering, with a luminous bezel and markings that are ideal for navigating in poor visibility. The highly accurate instrument is made of durable, clear, scratch-resistant acrylic that's been ergonomically designed to fit in the palm of your hand. More significantly, the compass employs Suunto's two-zone system to achieve precise, accurate readings regardless of where you're traveling. Previously, most compasses functioned well in only one of five geographic zones. That's because the compasses were balanced differently based on the zone's inclination, i.e., the vertical intensity and direction of the Earth's magnetic field. However, as people began to travel more, it became clear that globe-hopping adventurers needed compasses with a greater geographical range. Suunto's two-zone system, by contrast, considers only the northern and southern hemispheres. In practice, this means that a Suunto compass designed for the northern hemisphere--as the A-30L is--will still work for a fair distance into the southern hemisphere and vice-versa. Suunto is one of only two compass manufacturers to offer two-zone compasses. \n\n The lightweight A-30L compass also features a fixed declination correction scale, a jewel bearing, marking holes for drawing control points, a magnifying lens, and a patent-pending snap-lock that detaches easily from the lanyard. The compass measures 2.2 by 4.3 inches and is backed by a lifetime warranty.",
