The brushed finish matches the iMac quite well. My camera also uses Compact Flash cards, so having an additional reader has been nice. You do have to insert it upside down, but so far it hasnt failed or corrupted any cards. My only complaint with this is that the LED light is on so long as the computer is on, even when the computer is asleep.",

I've struggled with others because they were more concerned with compact size than usability. This little unit is perfect. And, while it's larger than all the others, I'll take usability over space every time. It's great. It's quiet. It's affordable. And, it works. What more do you want...?",

Also, you cannot simultaneously put a microSD and a standard SD in it which is kind of a bummer.",
