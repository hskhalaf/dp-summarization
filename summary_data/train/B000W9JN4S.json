Moreover, the stench of gas in my garage is pretty bad, as the gas can obviously not sealed. Be advised that even my car ride on the way home from the gas station was a fume-filling experience.

Also, it is the same color at the spout, making it too easy to forget to remove the spout. Then you have a spout full of gas that's going to leak all over your hands when you remove the cap.",

This one, however, you perch it on top of the opening and hold on to it by the nice handle at the back, press the button and hold it down, and it fills very quickly and stops on its own when the tank is full.

The No-Spill spout is fully user controlled so you tip the can vertical, insert the spout into the vessel opening, then press the button to begin and control pouring. To stop pouring simply release the button. Practically eliminates spills and overflows. The only Spill-Proof spout with thumb button control that does not push down on your tank's filler neck to pour. More control, fewer tip-overs of your small equipment. The fastest pouring Spill-Proof nozzle available. At up to 3 gal/min, compare to other brands at 1.5 to 2.0 gal/min. Meets California Air Resources Board requirements for sale or use in California. Autostop removable nozzle, single opening for filling & pouring, treated can body for low permeation. Rear handle for pouring makes it the most user friendly CARB compliant 5 gallon can available. 6-inch Flex Spout Extension (sold separately) allows filling of on-road vehicles, boats and many other hard to reach tank openings. No-Spill Gasoline cans are tested and certified to ASTM F-85299 Standard Specification for Portable Gasoline Containers for Consumer Use and our Diesel & Kerosene cans are tested and certified to ASTM F-97602 Standard Specification for Portable Kerosene and Diesel Containers for Consumer Use. 5 Gallon CARB cans feature rear handle for well balanced pouring.
