Reading online it appears mixed if this will work in a US Wii U, so I am returning mine. I would rather buy used and know it is a legit copy of the game than have a new disc that may not work in system and then can't be returned. There as no mention on the detail page about the region disparity, barely even noticed when I removed from the package. On other hand it was delivered well and came in good condition. The game itself is a cool take on Mario with simultaneous multiplayer.",

    "description": "Nintendo Selects highlights a variety of great games at a great price, including this one. For the first time ever, Nintendo has created a four-player Mario game set in a 3D world. The game, developed by the same team that created Super Mario 3D Land for Nintendo 3DS and the Super Mario Galaxy games for Wii, lets up to four players play as Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach and Toad. Each character has his or her own unique characteristics, and people can play cooperatively or competitively. The new cat transformation turns characters into adorable felines that can scratch enemies and even scamper up the flagpole at the end of levels. Clear warp pipes add some new puzzle elements to game play.",
