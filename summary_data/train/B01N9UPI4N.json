I had a 2 year old drill and impact that I upgraded to the 3.0 ah batteries and was looking for a set that had the charger for the 3.0 batteries. 30 min vs 90 min in charge time. Sets ok all seems to work not worth returning but wish it would have had the batteries as stated with a matching charger for mentioned batteries. Would not have purchased if I had known it had the 1.5 ah's.",

The blade locking device on the reciprocating saw is great because no Allen wrench/hex key is needed like older recip. saws. Also works with all brands/manufacturers' blade types= a big time-saver and nice convenience. Def. recommended, especially at this price ($199- end of 2018).",
