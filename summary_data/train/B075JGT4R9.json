So if you have bigger hands it's a bit of a pain. The other reason is with the Breath Right strips if I was exhausted and put on on without washing my nose, it would stick. These will not. Huge plus though for these strips. Almost no sticky residue when left behind when removed. I also feel these work slightly better as well. Well work trying these out. I will also be purchasing them again.",
