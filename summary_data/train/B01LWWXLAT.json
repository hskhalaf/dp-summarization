The Apps you can install are not guaranteed to have screen rotation supported, so unless you like looking at your Instagram sideways you have to turn the giant heavy screen now 17.3 inches tall instead of wide. Also Alexa is not able to do certain skills like playing music. If the screen times out then Alexa is not accessible. The camera is a joke. The problems start with the connecting, quality, App and the manual is no help. I am going to return for a Google tablet.",
