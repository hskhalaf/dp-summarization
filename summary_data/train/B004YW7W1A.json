While this does work, it does not achieve the desired speeds as advertised. I think the only way this is possible is if all of your circuits are on the same run. It it goes through a circuit box then the speed is greatly decreased. Also note that this can not be behind a battery backup, surge protector, GFCI circuit, or any other protective device or it will not work properly.",

I run Netflix on my LG 47 inch flatscreen through this with minimal problems. I think I could move the adapter that my BD-220 LG Blu-Ray player plugs into to any recepticle in the house re-establish a connection to the sending unit by the router by pushing the button on the side of the unit and I would be good to go.

Ended up going back to the old one at my client's location and now using the d-link model at home where it works great, much faster than the wireless extender I was using before, 4x the speed! I was transferring files between computers at 1mb/s or less. now it is around 4mb/s or greater, hit almost 7mb/s.",

I usually speedtest my internet at ~80Mbps down at my router, but I needed a way to get those same speeds on the opposite side of my apartment, in my room, without running an ethernet cable across floor. Plug these in, connect your ethernet cables, and they just work. I get the same download speed to the router as I do in my room and it's MUCH faster, and more consistent, than Wireless N or G. Streaming 10+GB media files across the apartment via wireless just wasn't cutting it, and this solved my problems.",

As with my review of the D-Link PowerLine AV Network Adapter Kit (DHP-307AV), the units are so big that they'll occupy both sockets of a typical 2 socket outlet. I knocked off a star for this slight problem. My solution to this to buy a socket adapter with a flat top and two prongs. This adapter also serves as brace to keep the rather large units properly seated in its socket as well as allowing a powerstrip or surge protector to access the bottom socket. The DHP-501AV kit is compatible with the aforementioned, not to mention slower, DHP-307AV kit.",
