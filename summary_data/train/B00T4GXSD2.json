Battery life is good, though I do intend to buy a battery grip soon. Great camera. No issues. (Though Canon should update their iOS software)",

Canon states that this is a gray import as it was not destined for the European market, this is a disgrace people know what they sell I wonder if I get a reply this looks like a real rip off what do you think?",
