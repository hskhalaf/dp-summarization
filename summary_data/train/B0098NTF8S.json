A chip to activate the mouse and keyboard is in the mouse???? The screen tells you what to plug in but if you do not know the technical words, it takes some trial and error. Took help from 2 fairly sophisticated young adults and quite a bit of time but we are enjoying it now. Just do not buy from Amazing Lightening Deals-they are unresponsive, have vague return directions, do not directly answer questions and charge huge fees and hassle to return an item. Windows 8 is dazzling.",

The picture quality is also very nice. I am very pleased with this purchase so far.",
