The ecosystem seems to be overpriced compared to its value: At $75 for a room thermometer and $50 for a switch, it's too cost prohibitive to do too much with the technology.",

First, Siri integration doesn't work well. I ask her for the humidity, I can see the BT connect, and then it says it can't connect. Not the end of the world, and probably the fault of Siri more so than Eve. The second complaint is that the data is only accessible if you are near the device. So no remote monitoring, which to me is a big part of the whole smart-home experience. So in short, I give it 5/5 because, for what it was designed for it works great!",
