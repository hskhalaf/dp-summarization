I needed to get a cover for the Voyage because it was so light, especially compared to the Kindle Keyboard, I forgot that I was holding on to it. Definitely worth it.",

I am not disappointed, it really works as advertised. I think it was worth for waiting, thanks a lot!",

The Oasis may have been the better choice but as I had no access to the physical Voyage or Oasis chose purely on size and weight. I will continue to use a Kindle device as my e reader.",

I like that it remembers wifi passwords and stays connected without losing battery life rapidly. Touch screen works well. The only thing that may be a little off is the touch screen page turner. If I want to go back or forward several pages quickly, it seems to go forward when I wanted to go back, or vice versa. Maybe I am doing something wrong, but I miss the old school page turning buttons that were very straightforward and functioned perfectly.",
