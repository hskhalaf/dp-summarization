It was nice and lightweight, easy to fold up (ok, maybe not easy to fold back into that nice neat circle it came in, but I could fold it down enough to stuff between the seats), and certainly blocked the light. It's frustrating that seemingly none of the sunshades that call themselves \"jumbo\" are tall enough to accommodate my 32\" tall windshield. The company was extremely easy to get the refund from, so thank you for that!",

Ordered the standard and is plenty big with a nice square shape to fit up and down and across windshield with no sun getting in. Very lightweight and absolutely worth the price. Great buy!",

The other is the overall build quality. After only about a year of occasional use the spring tore through the material. I know I shouldn't complain since this was very cheap but honestly I wished I'd spent more for a better quality one.",

Most of the time the shade slides down and the sun is exposed on top. Very poor design I do not recommend. Way too much work",

When I ordered I decided not to measure my window even though it was recommended (since I have a car). Upon getting my shade I found it was too small. I emailed the company immediately and they instantly gave me the larger size. Super customer service which rarely happens these days. Thank you!",

The sunshade will protect the car from the sun or UV rays, just not completely due to its inability to cover the entire windshield and its inability to stay in place.",

Comes with a nice nifty bag for storage. 4. Does the job!!! Especially if you are like me and have to park the car on the street under direct sunlight. I Have used it everyday since I got it.",
