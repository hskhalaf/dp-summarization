The way they have the roller keyed means you can't reverse it - which you need to do to keep the band spinning DOWN to stay on the spindle instead of UP to pop off. Once it's jammed back onto the spindle, it pops right off instantly when you power on the vacuum. The included 'tool' is worthless. I had to use a heavy screwdriver to put enough tension to slip it over the spindle. I need something that doesn't fall apart.",
