I have only had it a few days so i can not attest to its longevity, but it feels very sturdy so i am hopeful. I took the advice of others and omitted the wine rack, since I didn't need it. That allowed me to put taller appliances on that shelf. You will probably need two people to put it together, it gets kind of tricky getting it flipped around at times.",
