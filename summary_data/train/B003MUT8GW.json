Mere soap and water does not remove them. I particularly do not like the pressure control \"jiggler\" and the way it operates. I will no longer buy any Mirror products.",

I am sure it is just me, but you have to have everything lined up just right and I have trouble getting it just right. Other than that it works great when you follow the directions. I love how many jars it holds. I was also pleasantly pleased to find out it had 3 pressure knobs (knowing me it probably said that in the description and I missed it.) I already can't wait until the garden starts growing next spring so we can start canning again.",
