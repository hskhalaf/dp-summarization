      "text": "I ordered this, and then returned it and got the Makita XRH03Z. The XRH03Z and XRH04Z are the same tool except for the placement of the handle. If you are drilling primarily straight down then you won't have as far to reach with this tool because the handle is at the rear of the motor rather than below it, and thus it the XRH04Z longer than the XRH03Z. However, that length comes at a compromise in comfort and ergonomics for other tasks. I found the the XRH03Z much more comfortable to use for chipping and drilling at various angles.",

Works great for setting anchors in block and concrete, as well as chipping brick.",
