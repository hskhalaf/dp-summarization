The suit fit me well but also kept me warm in the ocean as we snorkeled. I tend to get cold easily so I was very happy to be able to snorkel for a long time without feeling cold. It also protected me from the jellyfish (o stings) as my oldest daughter who opted to skip out on her wetsuit the first day of snorkeling ended up with 12 stings and chilled. Highly recommend this suit!",

However, once I got in the water, the suit began to expand, and I got a lot of cold water running through my body for the next four hours of surfing. Not fun at all. I recommend to size down.
