(If only under light load, it's not too loud. However, the engine really revs up and gets much louder if running an appliance drawing lots of amps. Don't know if this dramatically increasing noise level is also true of the much more expensive Honda and Yamaha generators.) Be careful to check for manufacturer recalls due to risk of fire. That research also influenced me to choose the Westinghouse generator (no recalls in place) rather than the more expensive but perhaps quieter alternatives.",

Rare to find a product like this. Just got mine and it started up on the first pull. Highly recommended--and I previously owned the Honda 2000i which was great, but this is even better.",

When I turn mine to the off position, the generator keeps humming along with no problem.

I ran 2 TVs; portable camper AC, 3 lights and charged my phone and I was still only at 50% on amperage light up meter. I'm glad I went with this one that has a bit more power than needed for the extra hundred bucks. Now we have a generator to run things if power goes out at the house or when camping. Wish I would have got one of these sooner and it's several hundreds dollars less than Honda. Runs fairly quiet with very easy start. Happy with purchase..",

    "description": "Style:iGen2200The Westinghouse iGen2200 Portable Inverter Generator produces 2, 200 peak watts and 1, 800 running watts, making it perfect as an emergency backup for home use or for recreational use. The iGen2200 can simultaneously power most refrigerators and large appliances as well as any home necessities you may need while traveling. Powered by a 4-Stroke OHV Westinghouse engine, the iGen2200 is engineered to automatically adjust its engine speed to produce only the amount of power needed for enhanced fuel efficiency. It\u2019s lightweight and convenient, weighing 46 lbs. with a built-in carrying handle for easy portability. The iGen2200 has an ultra-low tone for community-friendly use, operating as low as 52 dBA which is quieter than the average conversation. Unlike traditional generators, the iGen2200 safely powers sensitive electronics like plasma/LCD televisions, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices by producing clean, stable power at less than 3% THD. If you need more power, the iGen2200 is parallel capable and can be paired with another Westinghouse Inverter Generator using the Westinghouse WHPC Parallel Cord (sold separately). The iGen2200 has built-in safety features including low oil shutdown and overload protection while backed by 3-year limited service, labor, and parts coverage with lifetime technical support.",
