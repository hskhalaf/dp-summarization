Assembly was easy and the different height options were a big plus. Overall excellent headboard!",

We did not use the adjustable wooden upright supports because we knew we would be mounting the headboard to the wall \"hotel style,\" using a French cleat/bracket (also purchased on Amazon) and it worked out beautifully! Supports are sturdy, seem to be well constructed, with a dark wooden finish; wall mounting was just personal preference. I don't write very many reviews, but chose to in this case because I am so pleased with the quality of this purchase.",
