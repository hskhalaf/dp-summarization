Nothing too insane here Build Quality: 10/10 as i said in the video, the charger feel pretty solid to me and weight like 1/2 of my PS4 controller. The look: 9/10 okay look, i prefer it all black but not a big deal tho. Function: 10/10 Charging as fast as the PS4, nothing too special here. I personally like to plug it in the PS4 since it just work the same for me. I would rate this product an overall as 9.5/10. Would buy this again if i have another pair of PS4 controller.",

It even prevents you from \"breaking\" the connection on the controller because of how it holds the controller on the stand. I highly recommend these!

No real benefit to the tower - it takes up as much space as 2 controllers next to each other. My next solution is going to be a simple 4-port powered hub and 4 short cords.

I have two PS4 controllers, both with skin coverings and stick pad enhancements, and they fit perfectly into the charging station. Each slot has red and blue back lighting - red for charging in progress, blue for fully charged. It looks very sleek and cool. I have my charger connected to a standard AC power strip using a USB charging adapter, but you could just connect it to the USB port on the PS4 console. Highly recommend this, glad I bought it.",

The only issue I have with it is that the controllers don't feel very stable while docked; there's just a little bit of 'droop' that I'm afraid might impact the power connection after a long period of use. This is the reason for 4/5 instead of 5/5 stars.",

Great device that quickly charges 2 controllers without issue. LED lights are blue when done and red when charging, very straight forward. I bought an USB to Wall hook up so I do not have to leave the PS4 on to charge, nor take up a USB slot on PS4.",
