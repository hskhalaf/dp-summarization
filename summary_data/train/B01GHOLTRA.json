Not large enough to hold more than three (at least for me), but that is a small issue (no pun intended). Three month update: I have down graded my vote by one because of the scratches it leaves on your knives. I have what was a new knife (8\" chef's) that was scratch free, until it went into this holder. Now with three months of use, it has fine scratches down the length of both sides. Since I wash and dry the knives BEFORE inserting in the holder, I'm not near as happy with the result.",

We have a few CUTCO knives that we use everyday and a random collection of others. This fits them all and we have room for more if we'd like to add. People ask about scissors in the questions (I had the same question) so I tested it (see 2nd & 3rd pic). If the scissors are thin enough, they will fit in. Typical kitchen scissors with wider handles won't fit well. You'll need two hands to get them out though (which I would recommend using anyway). While the product will most likely not tip, it's not that heavy.",
