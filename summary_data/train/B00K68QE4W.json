      "text": "So far so good. Installed on a 2006 Rancher and use it to raise/lower snow plow. Installation was fairly easy and straightforward. Operates in and out smoothly and works on command as expected. Comes with a snatchblock as well which is a nice thing to have if you ever get really stuck and need to double line winch yourself out. I also really like the free-spool option. Being able to reach in, turn the dial to free-spool, and walk away with the hook to let the cable out is very convenient instead of having to press the \"out\" button the whole time. Great feature!",

I would suggest splicing and installing a in line fuse block on the power side from the battery just in case something goes wrong down the road. I used a 25 mini amp fuse and works great.",
