As an HVAC technician I have to crawl into dirty old attics as well as under houses at times, this soap scrubs off all the dirt like nothing and leaves me squeaky clean. I stocked up as soon as I saw it was availabe on Amazon and will continue to purchase in the future.",

If you sweat a lot like I do, you need a soap that's going to lather well and scrub off the caked on dirt. Other brands I've tried just couldn't get the caked on dirt washed off. If you want a real effective exfoliating soap, I would give this a try. Some of the other \"scented\" soaps smell like a bottle of Old Spice was dumped into the soap. Luckily, this is fragrance free. Also, the price for a 7oz bar is about 40% less than other brands. Good price, great soap",

Tbh it almost is painful so be a little gentle when wiping sensitive areas with the bar, it feels like I'm rubbing lubricated sandpaper all over my body, and that's exactly what I wanted.

Dry skin will scrub away easily especially in tough spots like your lower legs, feet and back of your arms. If you've never used an exfoliating soap before, this might be too intense of a scrub for you, start with kiehl's or jack black. I prefer the scent of the kiehl's soap but that won't affect my rating of Marlowe. The Marlowe scent doesn't linger so It doesn't bother me.

After doing washing my chest, arms and armpits, I have a fair amount of hair on the bar mixed in with the exfoliating particles. It doesn't seem to diminish the soap's ability, just might be unsightly to someone other than the user. Doesn't bother me, just wanted to put it out there.",

Not a manly woodsy smell tlike the description leads you to believe. If you like squatch cedar citrus or crate 61 alpine and spice, due cannon campfire or their pine scented one, do not think this is anything like that. This is a soapy smelling soap. Almost feminine. \"no sir! I don't like it\"",

I break out from too much moisturizing, and also if I dry it out too much. This is a great between. It smells like classic potpourri with a hint of Christmas. But is not fragrant afterwards if that's what your looking for. Bar soap is back and this is where you should start. I am looking forward to more of this products' releases in the future",

My only complaint is that the smell is amazing, but faint. Doesn't linger. No biggie. For serious blue collar work related dirt, one bar lasts maybe two weeks. Worth the buy!! Makes Gojo hand cleaner look like water.",

The 1st shower is like washing with sandpaper but you quickly learn to love the pain. I have mildly dry skin and after a week of using this soap I hardly need lotion. I've noticed that my face looks healthier, has more of a shine, and I feel fresher throughout the day. A properly stored bar is looking like it will last me about 2 or 3 weeks with every day use. I figure it'll cost me an extra $8-$10 per month but it's well worth it.",
