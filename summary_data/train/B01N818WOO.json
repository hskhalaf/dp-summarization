EZVIZ has the best app user interface and by far, the best customer service. Excellent quality product, excellent HD resolution and an app that actually works! Combine your indoor and outdoor camera's in the same app, and best of all, use an SD card to record and don't pay a monthly fee. Did I mention that you can call customer service and talk to a smart person without having to wait for an hour?",

Then the device showed as offline, and had a flashing red light and beeping noise every 30 seconds or so. The device was also hot, even though it is located in a cool location with plenty of space around the device. Have tried resetting and unplugging/plugging back in but the end result has been the same - a non-working device. Have reached out to product support, will update review based on the results",

I own a small security integrator company and bang for the buck this product works well. I currently operate more than 20 cameras on my house of various manufactures, most being commercial grade products, for a low price point camera, this would work well for many. Pros Easy to set up Small Easy to mount Good video quality Easy to understand configuration Cons Micro USB power only The rotation is limited when the base is mounted on a wall",

The image in encrypted and everything is either fingerprint or password protected, should you choose.

It considers everything in nature such as movements of tree branch to shadows from tree branches on the ground as a motion to record and alerts you. It is definitely not a smart camera. However, this camera does have awesome lens that adopts very well in low light environments that IR night vision is almost not even needed but what good is it if camera is not smart enough to detect viable only motions and flood your notifications and micro sd card with non viable (useless) alerts & video clips.",
