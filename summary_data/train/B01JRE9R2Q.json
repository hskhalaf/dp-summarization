I really love this suit! Its adorable, easy to zip on and off, and protects his skin from the Texas sun. He hates the rash gaurds that go icer his head and I hate that they bunch up, so this is a really great solution bc he is zipped into it and it stays on! Great quality too. Highly recommend!",

Granted, I\u2019m guessing that whoever sewed it probably isn\u2019t getting paid to turn out fine work but is instead incentivized to produce a high quantity of garments. That\u2019s the global economy. So that\u2019s what ya get, a nice design with poor quality sewing. It\u2019s semi-affordable, and I can\u2019t sew, hence three stars.",
