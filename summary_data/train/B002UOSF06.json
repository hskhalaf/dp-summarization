It made a good difference in the back pain and leg pain I was experiencing. I purchased one so I could use it at home. It works very well. I recommend that when you are using this, you make certain your back is pushed down to the surface you are laying on and your core muscles are tightened. This will give you an extra benefit from using it.",

In one day I was able to not only get my leg straight but was able to touch my heel to the floor. As of February 25, 2019. I was not able to achieve this with in hospital rehabilitation, outpatient physical therapy, or in hospital rehabilitation. In two days I went from no weight on my leg to weight bearing b cause my leg was finally straight enough to walk.",
