I tried downloading the HTC Sense Gallery, Mail and Calendar apps (which a like a lot better than Googles apps) but that is not possible since the apps is \"not compatible with your device\" according to Google Play Store. I find that hard to believe since HTC has manufactured the actual device it would seem plausible that the would be able to make their apps work on the tablet. But other than that it is an awsome tablet.",

      "text": "Even though I love HTC and Android, I bought this tablet and have already gotten a third replacement with no success. All of them show huge amount of lightbleeding which is disappointing for a 500EUR tablet. This is highly noticeable when watching films as the screen borders turn black. Three times... Been almost a month that I don't get to enjoy a device. Now the Amazon support recommends me to refund and not return the device... Quite disappointing experience overall. If you're one of the lucky people who bought this and got no lightbleeding, enjoy it as its a great device itself. However, out of 3 I got none of them with less than 50% of the screen bleeding...",

I had to receive 3 units before I got one with decent buttons on the top right. There is a general clunkiness when navigating around. The Android 5.1.1 OS is the only real saving grace. I bought at \u00a3210. Not worth more in my opinion.",
