Quality components, looks good, and most important for my needs it was the right size for my small concrete patio. Only minor cutting made it fit, and the aluminum cut easily. Since the entire structure is very lightweight, I will purchase concrete screws and anchor the 4 corners down, soon. I am looking forward to being able to ENJOY the shade on my patio. Took 2 people 2.3 hours from start to finish to install. Not bad at all. Thank you Amazon",

A rubber mallet is necessary. It is great quality and super cute, especially considering the price. I have always wanted one and I really shopped around for one that appeared to be inexpensive. I am so glad I decided to get this one. It really transforms my yard and I enjoy it.",

      "text": "Love it! Before purchasing this item, I did a lot of research on similar pergolas from the big home improvement stores. This one was quickly delivered, easy to assemble, and true to size. The frame is more dark charcoal or steel than black. Nevertheless, it is attractive with terra cotta canopy. New Jersey can have harsh winters so I secured the four posts to my concrete patio using wedge anchors. I was new to using a hammer drill on the concrete. Otherwise, the assembly required only basic tools.",
