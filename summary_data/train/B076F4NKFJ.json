We are happy with the purchase. I looked a long time for the perfect size. This is it. Just big enough for your needs but doesn't take up to much space due to excellent quality and design. I would recommend to airstream and RV owners.",

It is slightly larger and accommodates bottles like champagne, rhone or burgundy without difficulty.This wine tote I will have to add additional padding before I would put this in a suitcase for airline travel. The tote is lined with reflective material but the size of the openings are 3 inches by 3 inches. That is fine for narrow bottles but champagne, chardonnay, burgundy are 3 3/8 to 3 1/2 inches and will stretch the compartment. Buyer beware.",
