It required minor assembling and it didn\u2019t contain any instructions but I managed to assemble it quickly (5 min work) just using my intuition. The packaging was not great. The box was broken in multiple parts and the ring had some minor scratches but I didn\u2019t care since it\u2019s going to get scratched anyway. I put it inside my paver-made fire pit to protect the pavers and it looks great. In order to fit it into the paved fire pit I had to hammer down two hooks (which you would use if you want to anchor it to the ground).",

When I have logs in it it is very hard to try to cook anything as the logs sit high enough I usually have to swivel the grill out from the pit.",

The cooking grate requires some seasoning prior to use, washing it with soap and water, then brush on some cooking oil. I cover up the pit with a tarp to help prevent moisture from getting in.
