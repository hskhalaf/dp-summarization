I might have to buy a second, as one box of chips seems to char too quickly to cook anything longer than about 30 minutes. I like the product, but I'll be soaking my chips from now on.",

Because there are no holes on the bottom the chips never receive enough air to catch fire and instead sit there and smolder (as they're supposed to!). The problem I had is with longer cooking times I ran out of smoke before the meat was done. My solution was to buy another one of these wonderful boxes and rotate them. As the smoke is slowing down from the first box, I put on the second box. The second box will then start smoking just as the first one finishes. by doing this I have smoke the whole time the meat is on the grill.",

The amount of smoke is insignificant. It really did not smoke at all and I am used to smokers. I waited 15 minutes on high and did not see anything that would make a difference. By the time I got my steaks off the grill (another 10 minutes on top of the 15) and turned it off, I saw that this little box puts out about enough smoke as a burning cigarette if that. Nice idea but don't waste your money.",

The lid is hinged, so you don't have to worry about a hot lid falling off and burning someone or something. Makes reloading the box easier and safer. I've used it several times and it is not discoloring. There are no holes in the bottom, so wood chips last longer and you don't need to soak the chips.\"",
