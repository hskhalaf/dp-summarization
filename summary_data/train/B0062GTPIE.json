I will say that it's quite difficult to hang this up yourself. I live alone and found myself really struggling to untangle it and put it up. I can't attach anything permanently to my walls or ceiling in my apartment, so I threw some command hooks up on my ceiling and it works perfectly. It's heavy enough to give some great draping, but not too heavy that it pulls down the hooks.",

I actually hung it off my canopy bars, so it was ackward and droopy in places. But I worked with it and used black zipties to pinch close the saggiest areas and it looks super sexy.",

BUT it took me a long time to get it up (high ceilings) and then it was really hangy so I had to use my creativity to make it look good. I didn't like how much it fell in the middle, so I pinned the middle to the ceiling. Be creative and it will be a perfect room statement!",
