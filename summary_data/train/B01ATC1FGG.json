The rule in our home is that you have to to say the number aloud when you're placing the tile down. We've made copies of the back paper and have colored the evens and odds, 5s, each row, etc. I took off one star for the 6s and 9s. You really have to look hard to identify 6 versus 9.

I know this type of toy greatly helps with learning numbers from my experience as a kid. It helped me see patterns and get ahead in math because I had a better understanding of how the numbers related to one another based on seeing them this way.",

My kinder age boy became too frustrated (and I did as well) with the numbers sliding all over the mat when he placed them or slightly bumped the board. This detracted from his ability to persist through the task or focus on the actual numeracy work. His fine motor is very typical for a child his age.
