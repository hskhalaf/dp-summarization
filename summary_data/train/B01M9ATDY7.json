Hoping other people who buy this will spot my review rather than spend hours like I did trying get the device connected. The device once connected works great with the Honeywell app and the Apple Hope app.",

I have set up a scheduler for weekdays and weekends, utilising the custom set up... which is just as good as the cm921. Only drawback is the unit needs to be plugged in. The cm921 took batteries.

    "title": "Honeywell Home T6R Wireless Smart Thermostat \u2014 W-iFi App-Enabled to Save Money and Improve Efficiency \u2014 Compatible with Apple HomeKit, Google Home, Amazon Alexa and and IFTTT, Black (1 Piece)",
    "description": "Improve efficiency, save money, and integrate with other smart home devices. The Honeywell Home T6R Wireless Smart Thermostat lets you take control of your home comfort and upgrade your functionality. Made like Honeywell's popular T6 thermostat, the T6R is a wireless version that allows for a freestanding, versatile thermostat. For best results, place the thermostat controller in a room that adequately represents the temperature of your home. This innovative thermostat adapts to your schedule. And when your schedule is unpredictable, it allows you to control your thermostat via smartphone, tablet, or anywhere. The Honeywell Home app and your smartphone uses geofencing to take care of everything at home. This system uses your smartphone location to determine when you're home or away. Saving energy when you're away, ensuring the temperature is just right when you return. Honeywell Home knows how long it takes to get your home to the right temperature, removing the guesswork and saving you money on your energy bills. Ask for 21 degrees at 7am, no problem, the T6R works out how to get there, whatever the outside temperature. The intelligent comfort control helps maintain the desired temperature when you need it. So your home will always be comfy and cosy, whatever the weather. With geofence capability through the app, the T6R uses your phone's location to know if you're home or not, and sets the temperature to \"away\" so you're not needlessly heating your home. This capability also lets your home heat before your arrival, saving you money and keeping you energy efficient.\n\nThe T6R Wireless Smart Thermostat also works with Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, Google Home and IFTTT to take care of your home comforts and keep your home connected, now and in the future. (Note: Amazon Alexa is not compatible in ES, FR, or IT). \n\nEasy to install and intuitive to use, this thermostat is compatible with most home heating systems.
