This company totally backs their products. My unit needed to be serviced after long-time usage. I paid only to ship to Air Water Life and they completely serviced and refurbished my unit to new condition. I am back to using it again. I am completely satisfied and impressed with this company and their 5-star level of service. Thank you Air Water Life",

      "text": "I have had this unit for 5 years and it has performed flawlessly. I replaced the internal filer twice for over 8000 gallons of water and the taste is still very good. Really like the auto-shut-off filter so that you don't have to turn the water off to change. I have the same thing on my pre-filter so it's a really easy maintenance task. I got the extra sink mounted faucet so it is really convenient and we can run both faucets at once with no problem and the unit is out of sight.",

I'll not but another MLM product for my health, I understand why they refused to give me the filter price during my first initial purchase. Everything seems very transparent with this product and company.
