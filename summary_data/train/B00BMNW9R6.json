After investigating it looks like bolts are not threaded directly into the aluminum block. there is an extra component that is inserted into the aluminum block that acts like a thread for the bolts to screw into. Well... this little piece came out and good luck getting it back in. Very disappointed since this was working really nice however 20 uses within one month and the item breaks... unacceptable. If this get remedied I will update. For now 1 star.",

It clamps onto our wood table with a lip and seems like it would fit most tables because the clamps are adjustable. Messes can be wiped off with a damp cloth. Also, I've seen reviews about the leg holes being too small. My baby's legs are pretty chunky (10 months right now) and the leg holes seem fine. He likes to sit in it. I love this chair!!",

Glass tables or anything too skinny are a no and tables with edges are a no and too thick of tables are a no. We went to some different travel settings and we couldn\u2019t use it because the tables just weren\u2019t compatible with it. We had to bring the bumbo for backup.

The next day I put it back on and put my toddler in it and within a couple minutes the entire zipper came apart and my daughter was left dangling upside down at the counter. I was within steps of her and grabbed her but she could have been seriously hurt. Would not recommend.",

It fits very snug around my sons thighs it makes it really hard to put him in and take him out but not only that, it doesn\u2019t fit on all tables. It works well on kitchen islands but when we try to put it on dining tables it doesn\u2019t fit on many of them. My friend had a different brand and it was much more flexible with table types. So I say if you will use it for restaurants or kitchen islands it\u2019s fine but know that t doesn\u2019t fit all kinds of tables.",
