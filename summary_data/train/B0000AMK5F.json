Negatives: Learning curve to prevent double nailing (minor). Loud (expected). Details: Bought this over a cheaper model because it's the model that HD rents. Purchase cost was lower than renting (long time doing it after work & weekends). 1 jam in entire roof was easily cleared. Simple depth adjustment only had to be done once. Used Bostitch nails - They dropped right in, fired regularly. Learning curve: Had to train myself to hold it firmly & be very deliberate about down-up motion. No biggie.",

All the other nail guns are shooting nails just fine. These fine used to be the bar but now, not so much.",

There is no reason to not buy new- they sell used and beat up on Craigslist for top dollar, and renting one for more than a couple of days makes buying a new one, using it as needed and selling at a later date a no brainer money-wise. Worked perfect, as expected from a new Bostitch. Never a misfire, and loading is super easy with the flip open one-piece side. Time is money- having a brand new nailer that didn't need to be futzed with or rebuilt before it worked correctly was worth every penny to me.",

I bought this nailer and also bought a Makita so we could both be nailing at the same time. Bostitch far outperformed the Makita, which double fired on a regular basis, jammed twice, and was heavier to boot. I am a big Makita fan and have lots of their tools, but in roofing nailers they don't have a competitive product.",

That said, I can't compare this roofing nailer to any others, but I put together a small 7-square roof over a weekend and had absolutely no problems with this guy. I also got the N75C-1 siding nailer for this project, and I definitely prefer the single-door loading mechanism on this model, so that's a great feature. If I had one complaint it's that I'd like more graduations on the measuring foot, my shingles needed a spacing that wasn't available on the gauge (something to an eighth and the gauge only does quarter-inch increments). But also I ended up just not needing the gauge so everything turned out fine.",

Yes, it also has single firing capability, however, when trying to hold a shingle in place on a steep roof pitch and single fire the gun with one hand the recoil is often enough to lift the gun enough to reset the bump fire and fire another nail before you can release the trigger. Then you usually have to stop and deal with a unset nail or gun jamb. The model RN46-2 only has the single fire per trigger pull mode.",

I'm very pleased with this gun but took a star because I got double nails more often than I liked while bump firing. Pros: * Bump fire * Light weight * Reliable feeding * Easy to load * No tool required for depth adjustment * Integrated shingle spacing gauge Cons: * No hard case or tool bag in which to store the tool * No adjustment for head sensitivity to help eliminate double fires",

    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\nNo nailer does everything, but the Bostitch RN46-1 3/4-Inch to 1-3/4-Inch Coil Roofing Nailer comes close. Stop at any construction site and watchas the roofers fly through their job with ease. Chances are, they are using the no. 1 roofing nailer in the business--the RN46-1. This little tank is built to last even under extreme job conditions. Bostitch makes sure by dragging it 75-miles across asphalt shingles in its testing labs. Constructed of tough but light magnesium, the RN46-1 weighs only 4.8-pounds and delivers 410-inch-pounds of torque, and it comes with unique features like a single-action side-load canister that is quick and easy to load; a dry-fire lockout so it won't fire when it runs out of nails; carbide inserts wherever it might contact a work surface; skid-resistant pads; a tool-less shingle guide; and an adjustable-depth dial and an over-molded rubber grip.",
