The pre-shave oil is tremendous for those of us with sensitive skin. The shave cream is thick/lushous but not gloppy. You can use the Shave Cream without the pre-shave oil and your blade will still glide nicely and remove hair/beard well. Only negative, the post-shave moisturizing balm could be a slightly bigger size (.5 oz) to match with the use of the Shave Cream and Pre-Shave Oil. You run out of balm way before the other products of this kit. You will like shaving again if you use this system of products.",
