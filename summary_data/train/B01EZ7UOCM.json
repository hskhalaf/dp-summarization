Love it. The two sides are perfect, one aggressive one to de-tangle mats and a finer side for combing out to a smooth finish.",

Boudreaux likes that it isn\u2019t noisy. He get brushed every morning. It doesn\u2019t seem to remove the current knots, but once we keep the undercoat down maybe he won\u2019t get as many. I\u2019ll update you after I\u2019ve used it awhile. So far - so good. Update: the knots are coming out and so is the undercoat. Be gentle with this thing or your precious pet will revolt.",

However he will tolerate this on his back for a few strokes, and that\u2019s keeping the back mats under control.
