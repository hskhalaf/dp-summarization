They were adjusted a bit too tight out of the box, but take an adjustment easily and hold it well. I have extra large hands and can very comfortably fit three fingers in the lower handle. Four fingers will fit but that is a little cramped. The thumb hole is very generous. They are very large. Wiss makes good products so I am confident they will hold an edge well, and last a long time with reasonable care.",
