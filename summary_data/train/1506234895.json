      "text": "This book has been so helpful in helping me study for the Gmat. Regarding the missing answer choices posted by another reviewer: the questions are data sufficiency questions. The answer choices are always the same for these types of problems. You would need to actually read the book to know that there is a method of solving these problems without needing to look at the answer choices. There are some examples/practice problems where the answers are completely off due to typos in the calculated work. I have posted a picture that shows a wrong answer because the book asked for the diameter but the radius was selected as the proper answer. I recommend the book despite its flaws. Four stars.",

      "text": "I think this guide does an excellent job of explaining what you need to know for the exam. The answer explanations are always clear and coherent, something that can't always be said for the official guide (for the quant section, at least). I would recommend supplementing with another book for more quant practice questions though, as there aren't enough. Plus I think Kaplan's quant questions are slightly easier than the actual exam. The verbal section is very thorough and informative though, and helped me greatly improve my verbal score.",
