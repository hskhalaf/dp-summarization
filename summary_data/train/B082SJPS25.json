      "text": "As you can see from the photo, Day 1 of using this product made my dog seem really, really stoned. However, it also seems to have relieved some anxiety in that she doesn\u2019t whine at one of our neighbor dogs walking by outside. She also didn\u2019t hide under the couch when folks down the street set off some fireworks...or maybe those were distress flares? During the \u2018Rona, one can\u2019t be certain. The collar definitely has a distinct smell, it reminds me of mild floral soap, so I don\u2019t much mind it. The dog has paid closer attention to me on walks as we work on loose-leash walking, too. Will report in a few days as to continued effects.",

We had enough left over from the rubber strip to be able to swap in scrap pieces onto the collar. The scent is very strong at first and worked immediately to calm our 5 month chihuahua terrier mutt. Cons: the scent dissipated quickly. Even adding in the scrap rubber pieces, the collar has lost its use after two weeks. For the price, I would hope it would last longer. Not bad and I would buying again just to help our pup get through major stress events (moving, long car ride, vet, ect). For daily use it is impractical.",

Sad because I think this does actually calm her a bit but no way it\u2019d even last a week. Also note it comes off really easy from the puppy\u2019s natural horseplay and the scent, while pleasant to the nose, is very strong and rubs off on anything it comes in contact with including hands, clothes, furniture, fur, etc. We\u2019re returning it unfortunately.",

I don't think this is a good or bad thing, just FYI if you/ your dog is sensitive to strong odors.

It\u2019s easy to put on and fits him well, doesn\u2019t bother him at all. We are going to try other products from this company throughout his recovery due to how well this is working for us.",

We\u2019ve tried the anxiety vest- kind of works or could be a placebo (placebo on us haha). THIS COLLAR is working very well. He is moaning less. The collar does have a scent to it.... kind of reminds me of a generic bathroom botanical spray. That lasts for only a couple days.
