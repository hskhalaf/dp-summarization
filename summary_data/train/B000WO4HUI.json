      "text": "The saw is incredibly accurate and a pleasure to operate. Overall, from uncrating, assembly and turning the switch on, about 6 hours. I took my time to make sure everything was accurate. That also includes a trip to the hardware store to get some nuts and bolts that were shorted. This was irritating along with purchasing the chord and plug to connect it to our shop electrical. I am happy with the purchase but it is a bit overpriced when you add in the trip to the hardware store for fasteners and the electrical chord and plug. Thanks Amazon delivery for setting the saw in my shop...great delivery service!",

The extended fence table is also substandard but does not effect saw operation. All critical measurements and alignments were dead on from the factory. I am willing to overlook the quality of the bolts and extended fence table because the saw itself is great",

I had a Bosch 4000 prior to this saw, the upgrade was well worth the cost. This machine is solid and very powerful. I recommend this saw for anyone in the market.",

    "title": "JET 708675PK XACTASAW Deluxe 3-Horsepower, 1Ph, 50-Inch Rip Fence",
    "description": "Style:50-Inch Rip FenceAMAZON.COM\nThe JET 708675PK XACTA SAW Deluxe 3 HP, 1Ph, 50-Inch Rip Fence is a high-performance cabinet saw with a full range of high-end, innovative features. Featuring a quick-release riving knife and integrated arbor lock for safe, efficient operation, this powerful machine is one of the most accurate, most versatile, and smoothest-running cabinet saws currently on the market. It includes an enclosed cabinet with a built-in sealed storage drawer.\n\n\n\nLarge Cast-Iron Table and Trunnion for Versatile, Vibration-Free Operation\nThe XACTA features a large, finely ground cast-iron table measuring 29 x 42 inches (with extensions) to provide plenty of work surface for large jobs, including 10 inches of clear table in front of the fully raised blade. Under the table you'll find a heavy-duty, wide-stance cast-iron trunnion mechanism--the heart of the saw's remarkable performance, stability, and nearly vibration-free operation.Conveniently Mounted Operating Mechanism for Easy Miter Slot Alignment\nThe XACTA's operating mechanism is conveniently mounted directly to the all-steel cabinet, which makes aligning the miter slot in the cast-iron table with the blade as easy as loosening four hex head cap screws, all of which are accessible from the outside.\n\nCast-Iron Handwheels for Precise Height Adjustments\nMade using a pair of heavy, eight-inch diameter, cast-iron handwheels (with spinner handles) that operate machined worm gear drives, the bevel and blade height adjustments are precise, effortless, and designed to remain smooth after years of use. Even the locking pins at the center of each handwheel are all steel and precision-machined so that when they are applied there is no creep or change to that setting.\n\nLeft-Tilting Design for Safe, Burn-Free Bevel Cuts\nThe XACTA saw is a left-tilt machine, meaning the blade tilts away from the fence. When cutting bevels, this allows the scrap to fall freely onto the table and prevents your work piece from becoming trapped between the fence and the blade, ensuring safer, burn-free cuts.\n\nPowerful 3 HP Motor and Poly V-Belt System for Smooth Operation\nThe XACTA comes equipped with a 3 HP motor (power rated based on continuous duty cycle) that's rigidly mounted directly to the under-table mechanism. Power is delivered to the blade through a pair of precisely machined pulleys and a super-efficient poly V-belt to provide smooth operation, resistance to slipping, and very low heat generation. Additionally, a push-button arbor lock allows for rapid blade changes.\n\nExclusive 50-Inch Commercial Fence for Improved Accuracy and Performance\nThe XACTA comes with an exclusive 50-inch commercial Fence II with T-square design to enhance accuracy, performance, and safety. It uses high-end materials that are precisely welded to make a tough, accurate fence system. For instance, the T-square head has simple adjuster screws and an adjustable magnified cursor built right in, and the locking mechanism is made from powdered metal parts for extended durability.\n\nIndustrial On/Off Switch to Protect the Motor\nFully wired internally, the XACTA includes an industrial magnetic on/off switch to protect the motor from dangerous power fluctuations. It also prevents the saw from restarting unexpectedly after a power failure by requiring the operator to press the \"on\" button to restart the saw.\n\nSafety Features to Enhance Efficiency\nThe XACTA also comes with a high-tech modular blade guard, anti-kickback pawl, and riving knife assembly to improve efficiency and help keep you safe in a wide range of situations. Additionally, like the riving knife, the dust shroud is mounted to the same cast-iron boss as the blade. That means it \"follows\" the blade through height and bevel changes to maintain maximum effectiveness.\n\nFull-Featured Miter Gauge for Precision and Consistency\nFinally, the JET Deluxe XACTA Saw comes with a full-featured miter gauge with a 17 3/4-inch long bar that follows the miter slot smoothly and accurately. A disc at the bar's leading end engages the T-shaped miter slots and prevents the miter gauge from lifting during a cut. For added convenience, the miter gauge fence can turn 60 degrees left or right, and it locks easily at any point, including at the adjustable presets of 90 and 45 degrees, with a twist of the handle.\n\nThe XACTA measures 36 x 38 x 85 inches, weighs 510 pounds, and is covered by a five-year warranty.\n\nAbout JET: A History of Sharing New, Feature-Rich Products\nOpened in 1958 after the founder of the company, Leslie P. Sussman, took the first Boeing Jet Airplane trip from Seattle, Washington to Japan, JET began as a small dealer that sold air hoists and trolleys out of a single hardware store in Seattle. Over the years, JET has carried everything from snowmobiles, transmitter radios, and forklifts to nylon stockings, but by the early 1970s, metalworking had become the base of their business line. And by the 1980s, JET had expanded into the realm of woodworking. Today, you'll find that JET offers a wide range of popular woodworking tools that are backed with best-in-class features and excellent service.\n\nWhat's in the Box\nSaw, 50-Inch XACTA Fence II (708675PK).\n\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nIf you've ever wondered about what a tablesaw can really do, look no further. Introducing the new JET\u00bf 10\" DELUXE XACTA\u00bf SAW. The Quick release riving knife and integrated arbor lock keeps the operator safe and more efficient. The DELUXE XACTA\u00bf SAW offers an upgraded Poly-V belt drive system for smooth operation and optimal power transfer, a fully shrouded blade for highly efficient dust collection. The 26\" x 30\" wings and deeper table gives you even more cast iron to work on. A built-in 12.5\" x 18\" x 4 \" storage drawer sealed from the cabinet keeps your necessities within arms reach, also includes an on-board fence and miter gauge storage.",
