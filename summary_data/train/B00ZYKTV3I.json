I work with Windows, Mac, Ubuntu, iOS, Android and Chrome OS. And for about 90% of my clients, the Chromebox or Chromebook is BY FAR the best choice. They run very fast (4 seconds to start up and 4 seconds to shut down), they are very sturdy against viruses and malware and super simple to operate! That's the perfect combination for beginner and advanced users alike.",

It booted up really fast and is very responsive and zippy. I was nervous about the 2GB of ram situation, but ChromeOS seems to be very light and capable. Definitely happy with my purchase. Would recommend to anyone needing a fast straightforward desktop PC.",

Chrome OS is a game changer for anyone that finds most other operating systems daunting, And this is a great desktop to introduce anyone to the Chrome family.",
