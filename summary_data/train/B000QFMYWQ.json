The only downfall for me is that just the top and bottom Right doors open. Left side is welded shut. Overall, it's strong, easy to modify and looks great.",

The bar spacing is good for him and he likes the multiple levels. I like that the door opens and is wide enough to fit litter boxes and play with him even in the cage. The ramp that attatches to the middle of the cage could clasp on better. It sometimes falls and I zipped tied it to help it stay stable. Other than that, this cage is great. The locks are ferret proof and I love the storage shelf underneath the cage.",

It is measured in cm so this is the translation - 4.5ft height, 2.5ft width, 1.5ft length. It is an amazing cage. On the picture one of the photos shows it WITH a hole on the level, 2 other pics show it WITHOUT the hole. Just to clarify, it DOES NOT hove the holes on the levels. The doors are amazing to open (smooth glide) and I love the storage space in the bottom. My chinchilla loves it even more than I do.",

You can't change the levels once it's in place, it's such an awful design and not good for the ever-changing ferret mind! If you're thinking about getting this for your ferret, STAY FAR AWAY.

I found maggots in the railing area when I took it apart because you can see or easily get to it to clean.

One of my ferrets is so small that her feet slide through the bars.

The welds are a bit flimsy and will snap if you aren't careful. Cage looks good over all just like the picture the wheels are great and the removable tray is great too. The doors however aren't very well made on the latches the screws tend to stick out at an odd angle causing the latches to not shut without bending them out a bit.",

It's a good decent amount of space and the hammock it comes with is good quality! To help combat the mess the bedding will make we put some black duck tape around the sides to help keep it all in.

But when I did get it fully assembled, found it to be sturdy and bigger than I initially thought, which made myself and my rats happy. The only problem that I ran into was that I put the middle floor on the wrong way, and the two wired loops were facing backwards and could not use the ramp without having to wired it manually. You will know what I mean if you run into the same problem.",

Impossible to clean if anything gets between the places where it's screwed together. Doors don't open or close with ease anymore. Not worth it in the long run.",

This happened particularly where their water bottle was above (I assume from the drips) and also in the corner where they use the bathroom. Although I clean their space regularly, it is almost impossible to keep between the shelf and the main frame of the cage dry. Will NOT be buying this brand again!",

We cut up a fleece blanket and laid it over the bottom just because I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll hurt his feet.
