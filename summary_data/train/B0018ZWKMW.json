Last year I didn\u2019t have any ear plugs and ended up getting so much water in my ears it took 3 days of being completely deaf that I decided I needed to get something to keep that from happening. These worked great! Even in rougher seas with the water splashing over your head, they kept a seal. No water in my ears at all! I\u2019ll be recommending and purchasing more!",

Tried the wax ones too, never sealed, wax and sand, not a good mix=nuisance. Added these on and love that they don\u2019t cut out sound too badly so I can still converse in the water and wallah, no more ear infections. I never lose them in the water only getting them back to the little case. Drop some on both my son\u2019s and friends as a preventative measure, love the price. Don\u2019t spend $16-18 at the surf shop, try these.",

They float and allow sound to come in well so you don't need to remove them to have a conversation. Highly recommend these.",

I figured the curved section could help seal out water, but I was wrong, the surrounds will flap over, and funnel water in your ear if you are doing anything aggressive, like an fast freestyle, feet first jump, or low dive. Putting them in is also inconvenient, the left and right plugs are counterintuitively reversed in the case, and you have to get them perfectly clocked/positioned into your ear, or else they won't seal. I found standard straight plugs worked better.",

I lick them and pop them in while suiting up to create a better seal. They stay in my ears and have never fallen out and I've taken them out on well overhead days. After taking waves I do have to tilt my head to the side and push the tab forward to let some water drain out so I can hear again. Hearing is not great but hey, would you rather have your buddies speak up a bit while you're out there or have a surgeon drill into your ear canal?",
