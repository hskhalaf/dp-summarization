I prefer a mineral powder to liquid foundation and have been looking for something that is very light weight on the skin, yet provides good medium coverage for any time of day.

Didn't break me out so it is great for sensitive skin!! I have veeery fair skin, and the porcelain matched my neck but the color 'light' was a true fit to my face tone color. Doesn't run orange or oxidize. Highly recommend and is a decent price for a higher end product!",

I just got this for the first time this week and I'm very happy with it. I use a kabuki brush to apply it to my face and I love the natural \"glow\" it gives my skin. Makes me look younger too and as if I just got out of a facial. It goes on evenly and blends evenly with my skin tone. Beautiful product. Highly recommend.",

Yesterday we were meeting friends and I was shocked to see the beginning of an empty spot on the bottom of the \u201cbase\u201d that holds this makeup! The \u201cpowdered make up\u201d must be very thin. Will not be ordering this again because it is too costly, even though I was happy with the coverage, if it is going to not last for a very long period. I will go back to what I was using before.",

In the review about product possibly changing, she explains that the product has changed because the labels are a different color? Not too sure if this is accurate. I am curious to know if PUR MINERALS is still using \"Silica\" in this foundation. I will look into this further before purchasing again.",
