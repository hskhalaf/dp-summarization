It has super thin rubber coating on thin wire. The rubber exterior turned brittle and broke after two months of light use. It came coiled up tightly in an overly complicated packaging system. It was difficult to straighten and through its self coiling after each use the rubber broke and the copper interior crimped itself. After a little while the mic stopped working. I tried to let it uncoil and straighten out but the wire broke. They refused to replace the product.",
