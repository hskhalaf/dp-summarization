The pillows are also NOT soft, very rigid and made of cardboard and poor quality of synthetic materials. It feels cheap. My wrist is 6.25 inches (15.75 cm) and the case does NOT fit any of my watches. Please see the attached photos. I emailed their customer service about the issues but they did NOT reply. Terrible customer service!! Worse experience with this company. Don\u2019t waste your time and money on this one!",

ALSO when you close the box, the ribbon that holds the top the bottom lays inside the box over the watches- I imagine that happens with any watch box but I don\u2019t know because I\u2019ve never owned one before this.

One of the photos showing the product has woman's watches , so I mistakingly thought woman's watches would fit. However, it is a nice case, I can take some of the pads out & put bracelets in. My daughter said her fiance\u0301's watches fit perfectely, so it is geared toward a mans wrist size.",
