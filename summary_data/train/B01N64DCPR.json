So what is this product good for? It's great as an \"initial clean\" for extremely muddy paws. It does a great job of removing big globs of mud that would be gross to tackle with a paper towel.

I lay a microfiber dog towel on the floor and fill this with water and a few drops of dog shampoo. I place their paw inside, one at a time, and their paws are clean. The towel gives the wet paw a place to dry off, then when all paws are clean, I dry them with the towel. Perfect solution.",

We've had a lot of rain the last couple of weeks and we're constantly having to clean off his and our foster pup's paws, which takes forever, prior to getting the MudBuster. This worked like a charm, just have a towel ready to dry off their paws. I haven't had to use my carpet cleaner to clean up dirty paw prints nor hurt my back from bending over to scrub all the mud from their paws. I'm so glad I got bought this product!",

I am able to fill it up with water, dip their feet in, and dry their paws off. It's SUPER easy to clean. Only thing I would say is that I didn't pay attention to the measurements for the sizes and I got a large. It is HUGE. I could have definitely just gotten a medium and been more than fine.",
