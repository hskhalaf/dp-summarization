Increase backlight to full strength. Keep noise control auto, then turn off all other smoothing (soap opera) effects. You will witness what picture perfect means. The picture is so vivid. I can see so much detail even in cartoons. The backlight evenness is not perfect, but fairly acceptable and not noticeable once movie starts. Great buy! QLED rocks!",

The Samsung repair team showed up today. Within 1 hour they changed the screen on my 82 inch qled TV that had a bad pixel. Professional and polite is how I would describe them. Life is good again.",

The smart features are intuitive to use and it is so easy to link your YouTube, Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Hulu accounts to the TV. Another feature I love is that it shows (when you switch to satellite/cable mode) the popular TV shows being viewed currently. I scored mad brownie points with my hubby for getting this for him for Christmas. :)",

It should be black, why in the world would you want something that reflects light right up against your television?? Not everybody watches TV in a black room with no lights at all behind them. Such a little but obvious thing that takes a bit of enjoyment from what would be a perfect TV. The standard above-average Smart TV UI from Samsung is here, which is a plus.",
