The build quality of the product is very good.your passports ,jewlery, important documents,hard discs ,DVDs and other stuff can easily be accommodated inside it. I tried exposing this bag to the lighter flame and there was no effect on the bag. It is big enough to have some certificates like birth or marriage. Moreover to my joy I can use it to keep my lipo batteries of my drones.its a kinda added advantage with this bag. So overall I would recommend to buy this bag at this price.you can blindly go for it.",

The COLCASE bag seemed like the answer and gave us a roomy fireproof place to store them all for less money than a safe deposit box. The inside has a nice coating so the documents slide easily in and roomy enough for 1 /12 inch or more stack of papers. The super strong Velcro enclosure make it very secure, nothing falling out of this bag. This helped to take some of the worry out of having a Wood Burning Stove in our house & keeping valuables safe.",

It is large enough to easily hold 8 1/2\" x 11\" documents so you can protect all your important papers. These would make great gifts and I plan to buy them for each of my family during the year. The velcro closure is strong and grips well, you don't need to worry about it falling open. All in all for the price, it's a great buy and will last many years.",
