So i did me some research and found a cheap solution - buy a u bar (cost $12, see pix)! This made the whole package completed.",

Also, in order to tighten the screws, you would need a couple of wrenches, doing it by hand or with conventional tools is not gonna work.",

The first time I used it I only went about 5 miles to the park and the straps had already loosened on their own. I have since just used a couple short lashing straps to back them up. Overall it is good for less than $100 but make sure you use bungees to secure your bike for extra safety.",

As a result my bike tires drag when I enter my driveway which is at a slight slope. So I cant use the adapter. So - I would not recommend this rack unless you are using it with an SUV type vehicle.

The lower hitch pin at the base allows it to quickly fold back/outward to easily open my Subaru Crosstrek's back hatch. Easily pull the upper hitch pin and the bike support fork folds down to make it compact when not in use. Take a look at the photos to see how to handle mounting women's crusier style bikes and even full suspension bikes. This thing is great. I would highly recommend this to any biker.",

A simple bungee cord solved the sway issue. My next-door neighbor has a 4 bicycle unit that he paid three times the price for, and they\u2019re almost identical.

      "text": "My initial impressions: The largest metal parts appear satisfyingly sturdy and well crafted. Oddly, no bolt is provided to secure it to a 2\" hitch. That the installed rack wobbles is irritating and unsurprising. Most worrisome are the thin, flexible components through which the straps pass that secure the bike. These are critical components that appear extremely vulnerable to failure. I suppose I could be mistaken, but I simply do not believe that they would survive for very long. I am discouraged, but nonetheless resigned that something better might not be at hand or worth the wait or added expense.",
