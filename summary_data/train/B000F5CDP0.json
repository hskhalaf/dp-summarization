There was one huge, can-not-ignore fault that is a complete dealbreaker: the screw that holds the clamp onto the iron catches and pulls the hair. My hair was caught almost every time I curled and it yanked and tore hair out of my head (so painful). I tried a few different times and tried using different methods, angles, and products to help and nothing prevented the pain and the catching. AVOID THIS IRON.",

Also it didn't come with a removable heat shield that came with the first one (fortunately I saved mine and was able to use the old heat shield on the new wand). Honestly - wouldn't buy another one. I will start shopping for a better one now and give this to the local thrift store when I find what I want.",

It leaves my hair shiny and the curls last a lot longer than just rolling them wet with regular curlers (which I also do). It's a breeze to clean, too.

I guess i just need a little more practice, other than that, my curls turned out beautiful, was great compared to those i've used for 3 x the price.",
