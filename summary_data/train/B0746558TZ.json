Purchase 304 stainless if you want them to last: You may often find stainless steel food containers made from 200 series stainless steel. These are typically less expensive than 304 grade as manufacturers essentially substitute manganese for nickel. Although food safe, they are not as resistant to corrosion and not as high quality as 304 grade. Search for 304 Stainless Steel mixing bowls are you will find a much better quality for a lower price.",

Upon close inspection it became clear that the balls are coated with a thin layer of some material which is coming off and creating these dents. These bowls are low quality and I will be getting rid of them soon.",
