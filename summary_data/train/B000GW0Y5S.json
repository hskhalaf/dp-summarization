Weight is perfect for combination of blocking and tackling drills. Is balanced well so it will free stand on its own without falling. We have previously purchased leather wrestling dummies and the quality of this bag is on par with those at a fraction of the cost. Was very surprised by this but would recommend this product for any age up thru high school.",
