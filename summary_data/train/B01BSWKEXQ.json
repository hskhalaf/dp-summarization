When I read the reviews online for these sheets I noticed several comments about them feeling scratchy at first, so I purchased them with a bit of trepidation. However when they arrived, beautifully packaged I might add, I found them to be exactly what I was looking for. They are the best. Their crispness is not scratchy at all, they have an amazing feel night after night. They feel special. I'll be spreading the word and saving up to buy another set. Thank you for the great quality.",

I have tired a number of different sheets through the years at a lot of different quality levels. I have even tried the cheap generic box store sheets and those blew these out of the water. I figured these would get better with wear and washes. No luck. We just purchased a new King bed, standard height (non-pillow top) and the fitted sheet repeatedly comes off the corners. TL;DR: Poor quality fabric and feel, sizing is not correct for a standard mattress let alone pillow tops.",

As directed, I washed the sheets in cold water with a mild detergent and tumble-dried them on low. When they came out of the dryer, they felt like SANDPAPER. I'm outraged over the false advertising, and am returning the sheet today. I don't care if they're washed, they'd better refund my money. I can't afford to speak over $100 on sheets that are CRAP. I was hard=pressed to even give these sheets one star...they don't deserve it.",

Do not recommend buying at this price - these should be priced at half ($45ish) to accurately reflect their quality.",

After washing they felt great ( nothing beats cotton). Going to buy another set for the guest room",

I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a nicer packaged sheet set and the personal note included from the company is a nice touch.. if you like percale sheets these punch well above their price point for quality.",

So far, the flat sheet from the set I bought in May is OK, but the selvedge on the other flat sheets have completely torn off. Bottom line - very nice sheets but very poor durability.",
