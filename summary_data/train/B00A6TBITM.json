The front light latch doesn't stay on the mount. basically just have two lights and can't connect them to the bike at all. waste of money. I purchased other lights from other sellers. I will be asking for a refund. This is probably the worst item i received in amazon and am very disappointed. i did not expect the quality to change so much from my previous lights i purchased from another seller a while ago and those lights still work but I gave them away with my old bike.",

The batteries last about 6 weeks of 1.5 to 2 hours of weeknight use. I used alkaline. The tail roughly 2 months of the same. No problems mounting. The strobe seems to simulate a cop light as i noticed people would slow down when seeing it vice the straight blinking light. Bonus for that. Just keep a hand or finger in front of the light when dismounting it cause it will shoot out of the mounting bracket.",

It's really flimsy, difficult to attach properly, the instructions are poor, the material is of very low quality, and it doesn't even ship with batteries for the lights because the company wanted to save those extra few cents. You would be better off investing a few extra dollars on something of better quality. I highly regret making this purchase.",

This setup might work for gentle riding on paved bike paths, but not riding hard. Couldnt retrieve either of the lights either because I lost them at intersections at night and they didnt seem worth the trouble.",

Doesn't really provide light enough to see the road ahead though. I couldn't believe that I replaced the original batteries from the tail lamp (after five years). The nut on the tail has rusted which is kinda expected wear and tear. However, electricals inside are still good. Replacing the tail lamp battery was bit tricky, which is why I came to this page and eventually wrote this review. I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for bike head/tail lamps in order to 'be seen'.",

I had only turned it on 3 times because I usually bike in daylight. I first thought it was the batteries but even with new batteries it won't turn on. Obviously it failed after the return period had expired. The front light works fine and I'm happy with it. I don't know if there is any way I can just get a replacement because it obviously is still within the warranty period.",

The front light is powerful and the rear does stand out with different warning light which makes it perfect. Compact and very easy installation. This does a good job so that my son can be seen. Works perfectly. The lights are removable for long lockups in public places. What would make it perfect if the lights were rechargeable. It also using a flashing mode to get attention of people and cars coming toward you. Great price for a great product. I would highly recommend it and would buy it again. \ud83d\ude0a",

      "text": "Hard to argue with the value of this light set and for a price of $10 you can't go wrong. I considered this headlight more for others to see me than for me to see the road (beam is quite narrow focused.) Both the headlight and taillight have multiple modes (steady and flashing type) and are quite bright. One downside is the headlight requires 4-AAA batteries but it does throw-out a fair amount of light in return. As for quality of construction, you can tell it's not of the highest grade materials and finish but considering the price I think it is an overall great value.",

These two lights completely remedy that. The 5 LED light is blindingly bright and there is no way anyone is not going to notice you. The red light is also quite bright and great for a taillight. The lights all have thee settings: on, burst, and flashing. The burst will give you temporary blindness if you look directly at it, but the constant light is very nice.
