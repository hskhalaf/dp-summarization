The post is actually kind of short too; and since the sisal is up on top, when my cats sit to scratch it, the whole thing tips over on them. The base needs to have much more weight in it to prevent it from tipping. I would definitely not recommend this.",

They're 8 years old and really just want to scratch it. I do like the wooden base, with or without the marbles, because it seems more sturdy. Overall does it's job, the cats scratch it as intended, they're just not as excited about the marbles as I was. lol",

But then I realized the tube is just card board and it became detached from the piece that attaches to the base. It had staples sticking out. Super disappointing since it had such great reviews and my kitty had so much fun with it. Maybe I just received a defective one?",

A simple fix to the base would be getting a larger plywood base and simply screwing it to the existing base allowing for a larger base and a larger cat.",

He loves it though. I will say that it is small and once he is full grown I may have to get something bigger. Super easy to assembly though and very stimulating for a kitten",
