That said, DO NOT use the mounting template that came with it; at a minimum, check the dimensions on it to make sure they correspond with what they are supposed to be. I had a number of failed mounting attempts before I compared the template to the speakers themselves. Surprise, surprise. The template was way different than the speakers.",

They sound great wherever I have placed them. I would definitely buy them again in the future. My only complaint is the appearance of the angled top on the speakers, but that's just my personal opinion, that doesn't affect the sound quality.",
