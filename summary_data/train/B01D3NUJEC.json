I have done away with DSLR photo booth operations and moved into iPads for simplicity, speed, and wifi direct capability with both the Selphy CP1200 printers, and the wonderful Epson PictureMate PM 400. These coupled with my iPads increased profits, and gave customers a great interactive option at parties, events, and business meetings. I've lightened my loads and customers and made nothing but positive comments and re-bookings.

      "text": "After trying to use various \"smart\" pencils with my iPad Air 2 with little success, I jumped up to the iPad Pro for the ability to use an Apple Pencil for notes, drawings, and photo editing. For everyday use it's just a more expensive iPad, but when you need the extra features it's great. The pencil charges extremely fast directly from the iPad's lighting port, which is awesome. The extra speakers sound nice and really make a difference when watching a movie. The camera is nice, but seriously, who wants to take photos with an iPad? It's good in a pinch, but there are much better and easier to use cameras out there.",

I was afraid I couldn't afford a new one, but this one was well worth diving into the savings.

I was surprised, and so relieved. I got a great deal on this product, and should of bought it earlier. The only thing that confused me was that there was no charger or cable included, which I understand other customers received, although I read that it wasn\u2019t that good of a charger. Overall, very satisfied and relieved it is fully functional.",
