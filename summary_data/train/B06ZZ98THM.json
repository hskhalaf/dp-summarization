He is a foreman so he is pretty tough on his wallets. It lasted about 5.5 months. (It was a christmas gift) it ended up splitting down one of the seams. I'm still giving it 4 stars because I didn't see anything mentioned about durability in the description so I don't feel mislead, it's just a bummer that it didnt hold up longer. So it may not be the best choice for men with labor jobs. Otherwise it was a nice wallet. :)",

If you're searching for a genuine leather, solid stitched, tri-fold wallet...you're search is over. Sure, you could probably spend more for some poorly made 'name brand' wallet, but why? There's no need to impress anyone here but yourself. This holds all your cards, displays your license and can separate your CC receipts from the cash money in the main section.

The good thing is, it'll be harder for pickpockets to steal it since it doesn't easily come out of my pocket. It's not a smooth material but rather a little rough. I would say with time, it'll start to wear so it'll get easier. Not a big deal for me though, just thought I mention this.",

Only reason I rate it 4 out of 5 is because theres some weird type of blue residue inside the sleeves and It got all over my cards and other items, destroyed a few business cards also. Would be nice to know what's getting all over my hands everytime I pull my cards out. Feels like some type of grease. Maybe a preservative, either way it's not good... Maybe put in the package describing what it is to your next customer so they're not surprised like I was and ruining things of importance. Still happy with it despite that.",

    "description": "Wallet Specifications \n\n - Holds 12+ credit or ID cards \n- Trifold design \n- Soft napa leather \n- Divided billfold \n- Color: Various\n- Wallet Dimensions when folded: 3.25\" x 4.25\" x .5\" \n- Wallet dimensions when open: 9.25\" x 4.25\" x < .5\"\n\nWhat is RFID and Why do I Need to Block It?  Credits cards, government issued personal identification cards, passports, and more are being fitted with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chips. These chips act like the strip on your credit card or drivers license and are able to quickly and wirelessly transmit personal and financial data. These chips help you check out at the store faster, speed up your time at customs, and generally make your life easier. \n\n HOWEVER, and this is big, some malicious individuals have found ways to intercept these RFID signals and steal your personal and financial information. Our RFID blocking wallets help protect you by blocking the signals that thieves are trying to steal. \n\nAbout RFID There are two main types of RFID frequencies: Low Frequency (LF) and High Frequency (HF)\n\n- LF devices operate at 125 KHz or 134 KHz and have a read distance of up to 10 cm. This is what your access card uses to let you in the door at work. LF devices tend to work more slowly than HF but are more powerful than the other two, meaning they can work through metal or other materials (like our wallet) that block LF signals. \n\n- HF devices operate at 13.56 MHz and have a read distance of up to 1 meter. HF devices include credit cards and government issued ID cards. The lining in the Stealth Mode wallets blocks this frequency to prevent your personal and financial information from being stolen. \n\nStealth Mode wallets are designed to block HF signals since that is the frequency used by credit cards and government issued ID cards.",
