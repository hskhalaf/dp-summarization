I had invested in quality full frame glass to use with that camera anticipating a jump to full frame down the road. This camera is fantastic. Don't let reviews or ideas of an \"older camera\" guide you away from this. The full frame sensor is excellent. I've been using it for about a month now and I appreciate this camera more and more after every use. For the price, The a7 is one of the best purchases you can make if you're into mirrorless and want to venture into full frame territory. I only do stills, so video is not something I can speak for with this camera.",

I have several cameras from other manufacturers and I was surprised when I found out that Sony is the only company that produce the sensors for both Canon and Nikon. I decided to try a Sony because I did not like the other mirrorless and I needed a \"smaller\" camera so I bought this one. The pictures are incredibly clear, no Lightroom needed!!!! the pictures are transferred right away to your phone! My only regret is that I spent so much money in other cameras and lenses.....On top, with the right adapter (all in Amazon) you can use all your \"old\" lenses....",

It's fun because with other cameras when you pull them out, people get all serious, like \"Oh, there's a BIG camera there....let me pose and act unnaturally now...\" - whereas with the A7, you can stealth-mode get AMAZING pictures. I won't even go into all the technical amazing-ness this thing has - if you're seriously interested, then I HIGHLY suggest reading up on it and the specs. The kit lens this came with is quite respectable for the price point. Just amazing.",

By the way, the first time I picked one up I was amazed by the light weight- and then I looked through the finder. What a thrill. The magnification is perfect for me as is the ability to add my Leica lenses and now a Voigtlander lens. The prime lenses are magnificent, really. The 55mm f1.8. Is as sharp as my Summicron. This is amazing. My advice is, forget what you think of as a good size for a camera and try this.",

This camera would be fine for a hobby photographer, but if you\u2019re using it regularly for extended periods of time, get a a7iii or riii (I have and love both, and the grip issue is resolved, in addition to their other upgrades.)",

It is my 1st full sensor camera, but, I have been a pro for over 20 years starting with shooting medium format and 35mm format film & cameras. The files are huge, which caused me to have to buy a newer computer for processing faster along with more memory. It is my personal camera for shooting fine art projects. I'm hoping that Sony will come out with a mirror less camera with sensor image stabilization. That would make it perfect for me because I love the image quality of this camera!!",

There are very real trade offs between the A7 and A7R, the A7R might be slightly better at certain very specific tasks, but overall the A7 provides better images in a wider range of situations. Contrast and color depth can be especially stunning from the A7, the A7R not so much. But for anyone ready to buy, but just can't decide, RENT each one first! You can probably rent either for a weekend for under $100 (maybe roundtrip shipping included).",

I can charge from the wall, computer, laptop, USB connection in my car. Battery life is on the short side. Around 300 shots on a charge with Wifi disabled but that seems acceptable to me. No dedicated charger included was a bit shocking but the batteries are compatible with the NEX line so if you have one that charger will work. This camera utilizes the same battery that is used in the NEX 5N.",

    "description": "Style:Base| Configuration:BaseNo other full frame, interchangeable-lens camera is this light or this portable. 24.3 MP of rich detail. A true-to-life 2.4 million dot OLED viewfinder. Wi-Fi sharing and an expandable shoe system. It's all the full-frame performance you ever wanted in a compact size that will change your perspective entirely.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\n\n\nSony \u03b17 Full Frame Compact Interchangeable Lens \nDigital Camera \n\nNo other full frame, interchangeable-lens camera is this light or this portable. Features 24.3 MP of rich detail, a true-to-life 2.4 million-dot OLED viewfinder, Wi-Fi sharing and an expandable shoe system. It's all the full-frame performance you ever wanted in a compact size that will change your perspective entirely. \n\n\nTECHNOLOGY\n\n\nWORLD'S SMALLEST AND LIGHTEST1 INTERCHANGEABLE LENS FULL-FRAME CAMERA\nSony's Exmor image sensor takes full advantage of the Full-frame format, but in a camera body less than half the size and weight of a full-frame DSLR.\n\nFULL FRAME 24.3 MP RESOLUTION WITH 14-BIT RAW OUTPUT\nA whole new world of high-quality images are realized through the 24.3 MP effective 35 mm full-frame sensor, a normal sensor range of ISO 100 \u2013 25600, and a sophisticated balance of high resolving power, gradation and low noise. The BIONZ X image processor enables up to 5 fps high-speed continuous shooting and 14-bit RAW image data recording.\n\nFAST INTELLIGENT AF FOR RESPONSIVE,\nACCURATE, AND GREATER OPERABILITY WITH \nFULL FRAME SENSOR\nThe high-speed image processing engine and improved algorithms combine with optimized image sensor read-out speed to achieve ultra high-speed AF despite the use of a full-frame sensor.\n\n\n\n\nFULLY COMPATIBLE WITH SONY'S E-MOUNT LENS SYSTEM AND NEW FULL-FRAME LENSES\nTo take advantage of the lightweight on-the-go body, the \u03b17-series of full frame compact interchangeable lens digital cameras is fully compatible with Sony's E-mount lens system and expanded line of E-mount compact and lightweight full-frame lenses from Carl Zeiss and Sony's premier G-series.\n\nSIMPLE CONNECTIVITY TO SMARTPHONES VIA\nWI-FI OR NFC\nConnectivity with smartphones for One-touch sharing/One-touch remote has been simplified with Wi-Fi/NFC control. In addition to Wi-Fi support for connecting to smartphones, the \u03b17 also supports NFC (near field communication) providing \"one touch connection\" convenience when transferring images to Android smartphones and tablets. Users need only touch devices to connect; no complex set-up is required. Moreover, when using Smart Remote Control \u2014 a feature that allows shutter release to be controlled by a smartphone \u2014 connection to the smartphone can be established by simply touching compatible devices.\n\n\n\n\nPLAYMEMORIES CAMERA APPS ALLOWS FEATURE UPGRADES\nPersonalize your camera by adding new features of your choice with PlayMemories Camera Apps. Find apps to fit your shooting style from portraits, detailed close-ups, sports, time lapse, motion shot and much more. Use apps that shoot, share and save photos using Wi-Fi that make it easy to control and view your camera from smartphone, and post photos directly to Facebook or backup images to the cloud without connecting to a computer11.\n\n\n\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\n\nFAST HYBRID AF W/ PHASE-DETECTION FOR DSLR-LIKE FOCUSING SPEED\nEnhanced Fast Hybrid auto focus combines speedy phase-detection AF with highly accurate contrast-detection AF, which has been accelerated through a new Spatial Object Detection algorithm, to achieve among the fastest autofocusing performance of any full-frame camera. First, phase-detection AF with 117 densely placed phase-detection AF points2 swiftly and efficiently moves the lens to bring the subject nearly into focus. Then contrast-detection AF with wide AF coverage fine-tunes the focusing in the blink of an eye.\n\nNEW EYE AF CONTROL\nEven when capturing a subject partially turned away from the camera with a shallow depth of field, the face will be sharply focused thanks to extremely accurate eye detection that can prioritize a single pupil. A green frame appears over the prioritized eye when focus has been achieved for easy confirmation. Eye AF can be used when the function is assigned to a customizable button, allowing users to instantly activate it depending on the scene.\n\nHIGH CONTRAST 2.4M DOT OLED EVF FOR EYE-LEVEL FRAMING\nView every scene in rich detail with the XGA OLED Tru-Finder, which features OLED improvements and the same 3-lens optical system used in the flagship \u03b199. The viewfinder faithfully displays what will appear in your recording, including the effects of your camera settings, so you can accurately monitor the results. You'll enjoy rich tonal gradations and 3 times the contrast of the \u03b199. High-end features like 100% frame coverage and a wide viewing angle are also provided.\n\n3.0\" 921K DOT LCD TILTS FOR HIGH AND LOW ANGLE FRAMING\nThe tiltable 3.0\" (921k dots) Xtra Fine LCD Display makes it easy to photograph over crowds or low to capture pets eye to eye by swinging up approx. 84\u00b0 and down approx. 45\u00b0. Easily scroll through menus and preview life thanks to WhiteMagic technology that dramatically increases visibility in bright daylight. The large display delivers brilliant-quality still images and movies while enabling easy focusing operation.\n\nPC CONTROL W/ REMOTE VIDEO CAPTURE CONTROL\nRemote Camera Control allows you to control your \u03b17 from your PC using a USB cable. Feature control has also been updated to include video capture control.\n\n14-BIT RAW OUTPUT FOR RICH TONAL GRADATION\n14-bit RAW image data of extremely high quality is outputted by the \u03b17. This data fully preserves the rich detail generated by the image sensor during the 14-bit A/D conversion process. When developed with Sony's Image Data Converter RAW development software, these images deliver the superb photographic expression and rich gradation that only 14-bit data can offer.\n\nNEW BIONZ X IMAGE PROCESSING ENGINE\nSony proudly introduces the new BIONZ X image processing engine, which faithfully reproduces textures and details in real time, as seen by the naked eye, via extra high-speed processing capabilities. Together with front-end LSI (large scale integration) that accelerates processing in the earliest stages, it enables more natural details, more realistic images, richer tonal gradations and lower noise whether you shoot still images or movies.\n\nFULL HD MOVIE2 AT 24P/60I/60P W/UNCOMPRESSED HDMI OUTPUT\nCapture Full 1920 x 1080 HD uncompressed clean-screen video files to external recording devices via an HDMI connection in 60p and 60i frame-rates. Selectable in-camera AVCHD codec frames rates include super-smooth 60p, standard 60i or cinematic 24p. MP4 codec is also available for smaller files for easier upload to the web.\n\nUP TO 5 FPS SHOOTING TO CAPTURE THE DECISIVE MOMENT\nWhen your subject is moving fast, you can capture the decisive moment with clarity and precision by shooting at speeds up to 5 frames per second. New faster, more accurate AF tracking, made possible by Fast Hybrid AF, uses powerful predictive algorithms and subject recognition technology to track every move with greater speed and precision.\n\nMULTI-INTERFACE SHOE FOR FLASH AND MICROPHONE FLEXIBILITY\nUnlike conventional cameras, the \u03b17 features the advanced Multi-Interface Shoe that dramatically expands compatibility with Sony digital imaging accessories, thus raising the potential for photo/movie shooting.\n\n4K STILL IMAGE OUTPUT BY HDMI8 OR WI-FI FOR VIEWING ON 4K TVS\nEnjoy Ultra High Definition slide shows directly from the camera to a compatible 4K television. The \u03b17 converts images for optimized 4K image size playback (8MP). Enjoy expressive rich colors and amazing detail like never before. Images can be viewed via an optional HDMI or Wi-Fi.\n\nTRILUMINOUS COLOR OUTPUTS WIDER COLOR GAMUT TO COMPATIBLE DEVICES\nTRILUMINOS Color technology, allows you to experience photos and movies in rich, natural colors on any TV equipped with a TRILUMINOS Display. The expanded color gamut immerses you in those unforgettably colorful moments, from the complex shades in a shimmering blue sky to the delicate skin in a baby's face.\n\nIMAGE DATA CONVERTER\nAdvanced features enable manipulation, conversion and management of full-resolution RAW images. You can expertly adjust exposure, white balance, tonal curves, saturation, contrast, hue and sharpness \u2014 as well as apply DRO and vignetting compensation. Bundled Remote Camera Control software also lets you remotely activate and deactivate still/movie recording and control various camera settings from a PC.\n\nVERTICAL GRIP CAPABLE\nEnjoy long hours of comfortable operation in the vertical orientation with this sure vertical grip, which can hold two batteries for longer shooting and features dust and moisture protection.\n\nMOUNT ADAPTORS\nBoth of these 35mm full-frame compatible adaptors let you mount the \u03b17-series with any A-mount lens. The LA-EA4 additionally features a built-in AF motor, aperture-drive mechanism and Translucent Mirror Technology to enable continuous phase-detection AF. Both adaptors also feature a tripod hole that allows mounting of a tripod to support large A-mount lenses.\n\nSUGGESTED ACCESSORIES\n\nSonnar T* FE 35MM F2.8 Zeiss e-mount lens\nSEL35F28Z\n\nSonnar T* FE 55MM F1.8 Zeiss e-mount lens\nSEL55F18Z\n\nVario-Tessar T* 24-70MM F4 Zeiss e-mount lens\nSEL2470Z\n\nSony Off Camera shoe\nFACS1M\n\nSony Genuine leather case for \u03b17 and \u03b17R\nLCSELCA/B\n\nSony Semi-hard Screen Protector for \u03b17 and \u03b17R\nPCKLM16\n\nSony Vertical Grip for \u03b17 and \u03b17R\nVGC1EM\n\nSony A-Mount to E-mount Mount Lens Adaptor\nLAEA3\n\nSony A-to E-mount FF Mount Adaptor w/ TMT\nLAEA4\n\nW-Series Battery Charger\nBCTRW\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINNOVATION FROM EVERY ANGLE\n\nCamera\n\n\nWI-FI/NFC\n\n\nIso\n\n\nSensor Type\n\n\nViewfinder Type\n\n\nFrame Per Second\n\n\nVideo Resolution\n\n\nLCD Screen\n\n\n\u03b17R\n\n\nWI-FI/NFC\n\n\n Up to 25,600\n\n\n 36.4MP 35mm Full-Frame sensor\n\n\n 2.4M dot XGA Tru-Finder OLED EVF\n\n\n Up to 4 FPS\n\n\n Full HD 1080 60p/60i/24p\n\n\n 3\" tiltable LCD\n\n\n\u03b17\n\n\n WI-FI/NFC\n\n\n Up to 25,600\n\n\n 24.3MP 35mm Full-Frame sensor\n\n\n 2.4M dot XGA Tru-Finder OLED EVF\n\n\n Up to 5 FPS\n\n\n Full HD 1080 60p/60i/24p\n\n\n 3\" tiltable LCD\n\n\n\u03b17S\n\n\nWI-FI/NFC\n\n\n Up to 409,600\n\n\n 12.4MP 35mm Full-Frame sensor\n\n\n 2.4M dot XGA Tru-Finder OLED EVF\n\n\n Up to 5 FPS\n\n\n Full HD and 4K QFHD\n\n\n 3\u201d tiltable LCD\n\n\n\u03b16000\n\n\n WI-FI/NFC\n\n\n Up to 25,600\n\n\n 24.3MP APS-C HD sensor\n\n\n 1.4M dot Tru-Finder OLED EVF\n\n\n Up to 11 FPS\n\n\n Full HD 1080 60p/60i/24p\n\n\n 3\" tiltable LCD\n\n\nNEX-6\n\n\n WI-FI\n\n\n Up to 25,600\n\n\n 16.1MP APS-C HD sensor\n\n\n 2359K dot XGA Tru-Finder OLED EVF\n\n\n Up to 10 FPS\n\n\n Full HD 1080 60p/60i/24p\n\n\n 3\" tiltable LCD\n\n\nNEX-5T\n\n\n WI-FI/NFC\n\n\n Up to 25,600\n\n\n 16.1MP APS-C sensor\n\n\n N/A\n\n\n Up to 10 FPS\n\n\n Full HD 1080 60p/60i/24p\n\n\n 3\" flip up tiltable touch LCD\n\n\n\u03b15000\n\n\n WI-FI/NFC\n\n\n Up to 16,000\n\n\n 20.1MP APS-C HD sensor\n\n\n N/A\n\n\n Up to 4 FPS\n\n\n Full HD 1080/60i/24p or 1080/30p MP4 movies\n\n\n 3\" flip up tiltable touch LCD\n\n\n\nArray\n\n\u03b13000\n\n\n N/A\n\n\n Up to 16,000\n\n\n 20.1MP APS-C sensor\n\n\n 200K dot QVGA Tru-Finder EVF\n\n\n Up to 3.5 FPS\n\n\n Full HD 1080/60i/24p or 1080/30p MP4 movies\n\n\n 3\" LCD\n\n\n1.
