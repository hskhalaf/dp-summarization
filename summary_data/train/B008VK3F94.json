I hesitated to buy this, but it's working well as a face sunscreen. It starts off greasy-ish on your skin, but that goes away after a bit. I find that if I dust on just bit of face powder (I hate wearing makeup), it looks really natural. It has good coverage.",

Light, dissolves quickly, dries clear, can wear under makeup without greasy appearance, and is long lasting throughout the day. It doesn't clump or chunk up or leave a chalky-look if you emerge in water. If you get it on your eyelashes by mistake, it will sting a little, but that is to be expected. Washes off easily. Love this and will continue to purchase, forever!",

Has a mild sunscreen smell at first that goes away once absorbed. I totally forget that I have this on.",

It does have a pump making application easy.
