It was a small annoyance compared to the years of great use I got from them. (Weirdo that I am, I kept the magnet inside of one of the earpieces of my old set for use as a fridge magnet.)",

Small problem and most people could probably figure out how to fold the headphones, but the instructions should be correct.

A 'drawback' (if you want to call it that) is they limit external sounds, but not entirely. My experiences with Amazon.com have been nothing but enjoyable.
