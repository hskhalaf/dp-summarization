However, for the pricepoint, it certainly delivers and is replaceable without breaking the bank (unlike the K65, lol). Unlike the K553 Redragon keyboard, this has a really easy-to-read font on the keycaps. If one is looking to get a budget mechanical board, this might be worth looking into.",

Now this keyboard sounds like raindrops hitting a tin roof! You hear the click but not the clack! Perfect for typing/gaming, not recommended for streaming.

Not quite the quality you get from a high end mechanical keyboard, but at this price you definitely can't complain. I originally purchased as a hold over until I got some extra money for something nicer but I really see no reason to replace it now.",

It feels durable and of good quality for me. Loved that the key-removal tool is included. Only been using it for a month, so no notes on durability yet. Did recommend to several of my friends",

Tip: the version without a back light has key caps printed with a standard font--it looks a lot more grown-up/is a bit more subtle than some other gaming keyboards.",
