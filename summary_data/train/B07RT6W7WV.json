Its vulcanized sole composition accommodates the use of inserts to achieve a more cushioned feeling inside the shoe.",

After a few weeks they did break in a bit and are more comfortable but still feel a little tight. They look similar to Vans low-tops, but better in my opinion. Also, i like to wear bootcut jeans and some shoes allow the pants to hit the ground in the back. These shoes protrude slightly in the tongue/lace area which pushes the paint opening slightly forward and keeps my pants from touching the ground at the back of my shoe. Buy some! But consider getting them a 1/2 size larger.",

I can go a full day without any issues.",
