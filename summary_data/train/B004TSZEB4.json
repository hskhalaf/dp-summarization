These aren't going to be the highest of quality forstner bits that you would get at a place like Rockler but they definitely do everything you want them to do. They cut great and they leave a smooth cut no Jagged edges and a smooth bottom",

I read up on how to sharpen Forster bits, tried that since I paid $50 for the set, but saw marginal improvement. Do not buy unless you want to drill 2 holes per bit.",

I think the bad reviews may be a factor of people not knowing that these bits require a slow speed. I set my drill press to its slowest speed (620 rpm) and I have had no issues thus far.",
