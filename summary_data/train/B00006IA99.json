Have also used it in a small group setting--even at a restaurant in a booth with other writers. Works slick. One person writes our brainstorming and plotting ideas on the board. Each writer takes their \"page\" home when the story has been plotted. They can then re-adhere it to a wall or wherever once home. No problems with permanent marker fading through to another page either. Will definitely order again.",
