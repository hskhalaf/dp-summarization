They should also be prepared to be completely mesmerized by its superb lightness. With all that said, those who are more likely to go on serious winter hikes may be taken aback with the boot\u2019s reported setbacks. Nevertheless, the Coldspark UltraDry is yet another satisfying Vasque product that outdoor lovers may want to check out.",

      "text": "Just a very comfortable, totally waterproof and warm boot that held up miraculously well on a trip to Iceland. We slogged through some pretty wet turf, and feet stayed dry the entire time. My feet are very bony and run cold frequently so it was a concern when I read some of the other reviews. My only slight complaint is that it's a little too high around the ankle and rubbed a bit, but not to the point of discomfort. Very durable boot. Wish I could wear it again, but I live in a warm climate so it will have to wait.",

After 2-mile walk both my heels got blisters, I am not able to hike in these boots period. If you just running errands then your toes will be fine. Also, the hook at the top of the for shoestring got caught few times while walking caused me to trip and fall. overall a great pair of boot!!!",

They're advertised as waterproof, but I just can't believe that as the side of the boot (where you see those lines) are a very breathable material like you'd find on running shoes.
