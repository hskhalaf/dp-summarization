This unit is disappointing as one of the most critical things to know from your charger is whether it is charging (other models change color) or when charging is complete. This unit doesn\u2019t change color-stays blue while plugged in. UPDATE: Anker customer service contacted me immediately and shipped a revised version of this charger which does have an active charging feedback light feature. Most impressed with their commitment to customer service and satisfaction!",

Terrible policies and intentionally difficult processes. Look for the amazon brand to get better customer support in the future, or better amazon partners.",

It could easily slip out if mounted in any orientation but straight down. I sort of fixed this by spreading a just bit of solder on the outside of each of the prongs. Had to then sand it down to get it just right. This shouldn't be necessary. The prongs should be just a bit thicker.",

      "text": "Note: unlike prior Powerport chargers this \u201cupgraded\u201d version does not have a true LED status indicator. The circular LED lights blue when it is plugged in and remains blue whether charging or not. The charger is slightly smaller than the Powerport 4 which provides 40 watt and 4 USB ports, but does have a LED status indicator that switches to green when charging a device. Update: Anker Customer Service was extremely helpful and directed me to the previous model with a functioning LED status indicator.",
