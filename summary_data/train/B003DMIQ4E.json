Right now I'm trying to get with Amazon to get a refund of $ 82 ,and I already went in and ordered a new handblown $82 unit that I will receive on Thursday, I hope. But the way I already have a classic 8 cup and I do not need a second unit.",

First of all, there isn't a seam like my old one and the bottom of the pot has \"CHEMEX\" stamped on the bottom. My old one has an \"X\" shaped logo that is a molded into the glass. These changes appear to be an update they made recently. Either way, it's not the handblown one and it cost about twice a much. Amazon was good about the return, but this should be fixed.",

The handblown (13 cup one) is thick, heavier, and clearly less likely to shatter. The Classic is thinner, has a bigger seam and has inconsistent edging lengths in the carafe near the spout area. The handblown does have a seam, though a lot more subtle than it's classic counter part. The classic is lighter and sounds different when tapped, it also burns your hand when the coffee is freshly poured. Overall, it's a Chemex, so the quality is perfect if you buy nice coffee and know how to pour correctly. Highly recommend, it's extra work for a better cup of coffee.",

I love this system, obviously I've had three. The reviews for the hand blown had a lot of complaints about not receiving the correct model. I did not have this issue as well as receiving it within 24 hours. The chemex cuts the bitterness of coffee which can also cut the bolder body flavor. I usually use a medium and dark roast combined to get that bolder flavor. I know it's not great for the environment, but I do prefer the paper filters over the metal reusable. Overall I recommend this product.",
