If you are upgrading from the 900 series or even a 1050-1070 then this is a great option, if you already have a 1080 or 1080ti then wait for the next iteration, because Nvidia missed the mark with their high end cards this year.",

The increased performance is noticeable. I do gaming and some 3D rendering with this card and have had a very good experience. You can look up the specs and benchmarks on plenty of sites, but from a human perception angle this is noticeably a huge improvement over most previous generations. A good buy.",

Without any adjustments it boosts over 2000Mhz !!!",

If you compare it to other popular cards like the 1080/1080ti, the RTX 2070 fares better than the 1080 and about the same as the 1080ti. The card gets better frames than the 1080 in triple a titles and in games like Fortnite, PUBG, APEX, and League. Overall with the 2070 being a fairly new card I'd say this is a safe buy if you're looking to upgrade an older GPU to stay up to date or if you're planning on building a new rig and aren't looking to break the bank.",
