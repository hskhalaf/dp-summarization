And it's well balanced and really efficient. Plus after dealing with bigger clumsier tools like large pad, disc, or belt sanders this tool ROCKS! And cutting trim couldn't be easier unless someone else was doing it! I'm in love!",

The metal parts close to the head get hot when used for a while, but I guess this is normal with any tool with exposed metal. You'll quickly learn where NOT to hold it. And this kit with all the extra bits is far cheaper than what you'd pay for a comparable kit in your local big box store.",

(I'll still use the battery-powered tool, you can't beat battery-powered for portability and ease-of-use when doing a small job.) Minor note: the \"52 Accessories\" is slightly misleading, IMHO -- 35 of the 52 are pieces of sandpaper, which aren't really accessories in my book, they're consumable supplies that have to be replaced as they wear out.

      "text": "Great quality tool it has seen extensive use and the ability to change motor speed on the go is great. The blade changing system is easy and significantly faster than other makes of this tool. Other oscillating tools I've used have a much slower blade changing method and is harder to change the blade and get it situated correctly. The blades that this came with are not a good as the most blades you can buy separately, but they are very serviceable. When I bought this the blades included were worth more than what I payed for the kit if I were buying similar blades.",

The Porter Cable has a lot more power, runs more smoothly and I especially like the quick change mechanism for the blades.

The tightening and loosening of the bolt eventually caused the head to fall off and you couldn't find a replacement. This one has a sp ring lever that is so much more functional. The case and all the extra blades make this a real bargain.",

It felt powerful enough to do the job, yet not too powerful that it didn't let me stay in control of the area that I wanted to cut away. All the accessories that came with were a huge bonus. Taking off the different blades and adding the other ones on was very easy. I felt like they might have came off with the vibration, but that was not an issue. The blades can get hot after some use, but that would be expected.",
