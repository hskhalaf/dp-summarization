      "text": "I needed to replace my mattress protector and wanted one that was water resistant. I have an elderly pet that sometimes has minor accidents and wanted protection for my mattress. Traditional waterproof protectors do not circulate air and I would wake up soaked in sweat. This mattress protector gives me the protection I need, but breaths and no sweating. When washed It does take a bit longer to dry than a traditional mattress protector, I run it through a light drying cycle and then hang to finish drying. Has held up very well. It is thinner than a traditional mattress protector, but I do not need extra padding just protection and this provides it.",

Old protector was getting progressively disfigured with every wash/dry cycle, and this one one seem like the best alternative available. Material is soft and has a bit of a cushion feel to it, plus it does not have an obvious plastic underliner like the old one we had. So far it worked as expected, preventing spilled sippy cups juice from getting to the mattress, and any collected juices washes away with ease. Would have no problem recommending this product to others.",

I recommend spot cleaning & hand wash when you can. I dry it in the sun because the dryer takes a long time and you need to use low heat setting. We have a King Serta iSeries Hybrid 300 Plush which is 13.5\" thick but this could fit a mattress 3-4\" thicker. 1.5 years later- still fits great & my mattress still looks brand new!",

It says that it keeps you cooler but not really sure about that statement. I sleep with a fan directly on me year around and this pad doesn't seem to cool me down but it also doesn't make me feel any hotter either. I think this was a good buy for me.",

He sleeps on a full size bed and this is a great product for keeping your mattress protected and dry. Also, you can dry it on a normal setting in your drier without having the waterproof barrier melt (which is what can typically happen with cheap waterproof mattress protectors).",
