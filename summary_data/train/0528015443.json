      "text": "We really enjoyed the first book in this series (Geography Maps & Activities Beginner), so I ordered this for my 8 year old. It's fantastic, introducing maps and map skills in a fun, colorful manner. The beginning of the book covers different types of maps and map symbols, then it begins to explore different regions of the world (not just continents, but also, for example, the Caribbean or India). There are fewer hands-on activities than the Beginner level book (no directions for building a rain stick), but still plenty of crosswords and map searches. I feel the agree range is too old for this book, I would mark it as 7+ as long as the child is a strong reader.",

Overall, it is a fun way to teach geography. Even though it doesn't go into too much detail, it provides a great overview and zero preparation time for me.",
