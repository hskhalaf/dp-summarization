In my case, my frontyard... half of it is flat and the other not so much.

I have an approximate 15' x 50' area of artificial turf that constantly needs raking because of the ficus tree. This product pushes the ficus size leaves around as much as picks them up but it does a pretty good job of picking up the majority of the figs that get caught in between the grass fibers! It may do much better on different surfaces and with different size leaves. I also use it to \"spruce up\" the artificial grass when having company over.",

I am happy with what it can do because I never had the expectation that it would pick all of the leaves up. It\u2019s easy enough to use that a couple of my kids enjoy going out and using it to help.",

It fills quickly, requiring multiple trips to the compost bin, but the leaf catcher snaps on and off easily. I bought it to use myself, but my wife has pre-empted it since she finds it fun to use. A suggested improvement would be a way to mount a garbage bag in the leaf catcher for those who bag their leaves.",
