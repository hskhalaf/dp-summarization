      "text": "Well, given the reviews I read on various electric power washers I am happy to give this a good rating. First, very easy to assemble. Only 6 screws to attach three parts that came with main body. Second, power cord adequately long. Third, it did a great job cleaning my 15 year old trek deck. I have used it about 8 hours total without any hitches. Gave it 4/5 because only two things i noticed. One, the washing wand/gun when assembled hits the ground when resting in its holder, and two, it seemed like I had to occasionally adjust the spray to keep it how I wanted it. Good luck with yours!",

It would be nice if it came with another nozzle that had a wide fan as opposed to just the bulldog style rotating nozzle and adjustable needle tip.",

The only thing I would caution on is the connector to the hose is a snap in and plastic... although I have had no problems, it makes me a little nervous (I prefer metals on this kind of connector). Love this thing and would recommend it to any do it yourself-er that has work to do that a big machine is too much for.",
