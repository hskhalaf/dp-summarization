My forearms burned and my muscles were pumped after just 1 set. The results are visible in less than 3 weeks of work - more definition, a touch more size and way more veins popping out. Individual muscles in my forearm now routinely show. Most importantly, the twisting action is very practical - comes in handy on a day to day basis. Under arm twisting is absolutely brutal and has built up significant strength. Highly recommend.",

FYI the alcohol will dry quick so pour some in the grip and cover the hole so it does not leak out, also have a towel handy so you can get a good grip when you try to push the bike handles on. FYI: If you have any cuts on your the alcohol does wonders for helping you find then, LOL.",

I haven't put really heavy weight so i cannot tell you whats the maximum weight on this but I've just been using a 5lbs plate and that is WAY more than enough for me.",

The handles aren't welded onto the center piece so once it comes loose it will break and unless you like putting it back on after every half set, I recommend you buy a better one. You get what you pay for in this case. I recommend buying one of higher quality of you want it to last.",

The grips however do not last very long and after a few weeks one of the grips became loose and spins freely unless you overly exert your grip. It is still usable but it does cause a minor annoyance when having to overgrip the handles to prevent them from slipping.",

The first time, I didn't realize and felt fortunate that the line didn't pull through the hole because it would have been a task to get the line back in.
