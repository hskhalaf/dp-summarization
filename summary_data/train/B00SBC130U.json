Changed the batteries (fully charged) but still they are showing, by the red indicator light, that they needed charging and then cut out. No matter what I do, no success. I have checked numerous forums and thuis seems to be a common problem. Not what I would expect from something costing in excess of \u00a3150. Going to see if Seinheiser are ameanable to honouring teh warranty.Wish me luck.",

Returned and have ordered some new earpads for my aging beyerdynamic dtx 800 headphones instead.",

I needed Headphones that were in perfect time, had a great sound and were wire free and thankfully its 3 out of 3! You are paying top dollar but you are getting your moneys worth with these. I have over 10k worth of sound gear in my home studio and these make all my expense pay off and sound fantastic!",

From time to time I get some \"ghost sounds\" (interference, I presume), but the signal has to pass several (internal) brick walls. My ears get quite sweaty after an hours light exercises. They are NOT noise-canceling, but they block external noise well, fitting around the ear as they do; this of course explains the sweating. I am quite happy with them, although I thought the price steep when I bought them.",

I was able to use the RS130 phones all over my garden and there were only a couple of places where the sound cut out, but these new ones - can't go 15 yds outside before the sound cuts out. Such a shame RS1130 are not available any more. Have contacted Sennheiser but not had a reply. Am pretty surprised that at that price they are not up to standard.",

The RS175 seemed to fit my requirements & according to the spec had the same 100m range as my old TR130 & 140's. They don't! My old ones reach the whole of the house & part way up the garden, these do not even reach the top of the stairs - very disappointing. Also the +/- buttons for the volume control are cumbersome & slow to react, that is if they react at all whereas the old roll knob is quick & simple. Not an improvement, I'll stick to the old ones.",

They feel so flimsy and cheap. The docking stand is all but hollow and falls over easily. For the price they should be considerably more sturdy and luxurious. I personally like the feel of wearing them but others that have tried them haven't. Honestly if they jus felt and looked like high end headphones i would give them 5 stars.",

Anyone who's ever used gaming headphones will appreciate how much you actually miss out on when you don't wear any.
