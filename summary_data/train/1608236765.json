Either you are cutting one side of a page to then paste it into the back of the very page you cut OR you're cutting a page with valuable information on one side that'll be lost by the pictures you need on the other side of said page (hopefully my pictures convey my point). I gave it two stars, and not one, because it IS really good content. But grrr, why is it so hard to find a high quality geography workbook for kids this age?",

The activities are well thought out and keep her interested but you need to copy certain pages because sometimes activities are listed on both sides of the same paper. Thus, if you cut and paste for one activity you cannot do the activity on the backside of the paper.",

However, cutting it out will leave the next page riddled with holes and unusable so I'm not sure how they want the child to do this. Many of the lessons are not able to be completely finished because of this. Annoying and an easy fix for any book publisher. I'm not sure why they didn't catch this problem.",
