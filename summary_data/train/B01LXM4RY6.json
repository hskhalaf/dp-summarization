From my observation the loop is not properly stitched and the thread became loose. The loop is the least complicated part of the bag construction and should not have failed so quickly. I can no longer carry the bag by the handle and will have to purchase another bag. The bag is versatile but I would not purchase another of this brand.",

Both were missing completely and only has a sown on handle that I\u2019m 100% sure is going to rip off within 3 months. Overall decent bag.

And a zipper was a bit stuck at first but after a couple days of using it, it unstuck itself. Bought some more containers through the company to meal prep ahead of time. Totally recommend it.",
