      "text": "Replaced my old Nest thermostat when it lost support of my several hubs. It worked perfectly on my millivolt furnace. Changing to Ecobee was a simple matter of moving the colored wires to the new device. The secret in both cases is to supply a 24v power supply to the thermostat. No converters or supplemental wiring is needed. The downside of this is that when the House AC power fails, so does the thermostat. It's not a problem for me because my generator kicks in automatically in a power failure and that restores the thermostat power. The Ecobee Lite was definitely a step up because of it's remote room temperature/occupancy sensors and beautiful always on temperature display.",

      "text": "Installation is fairly straight-forward with surprisingly easy-to-read instructions for the layman, even those who don't have a ton of electrical experience. Even after adding the device to Alexa, there is some confusion with how to get Alexa to issue commands to change the thermostat when it is on a schedule; Alexa prevents adjusting the temperature when there is a schedule, even though you would expect your command to change the temperature to take precedence over any other setting. As a Home Assistant user, initial integration was good, but continued functionality has been spotty and I am continuing to understand the difficulty.",
