I would recommend not to tighten the pole support on bottom and top too tight.

I would say with this price (less than $200), it's okay, but if you're looking for something more sturdy, high quality, you would look for something else, especially if this is for 65' television or larger. It fits our 55' television nicely (have some extra on both sides), and the style is good enough, match to our living room decor.",

The engineering is forgiving enough for this, but greater care in manufacturing/quality control would make all the difference. Good concept, weak packaging and rather shoddy manufacturing, but if you can get past all that, the final product is not bad at all.",

It took me a little under 2 hours to assemble this by myself, it has a nice height to the actual tv stand too. and it is pretty sturdy.",

It took my husband little more than hour. For 65inch tv is perfect, with lots of space for other little things as well. We didnt wanna buy expensive heavy tv stand, since we gonna move out to another state in couple years anyway. So we are very happy with this purchase, but honestly I was nervous first, to purchase from a third party seller )) lol So I would recommend this, if you are looking for a simple and affordable tv stand.",

If you try to mount the hinge to the door and then to the inside, you run the risk of tearing it off due to its weight and angle. My TV is 48\" btw. Fantastic!",

Nevertheless, I was able to set it up at the end, but not thanks to whoever made and packaged this product. Once assembled, it supports the TV weight well, though.

Its gonna be different for everyone but holy hell it was a PAIN IN THE BUTT. Because of this im taking off a star. Aside from that, it looks good, does its job and holds my 55 inch TV well. I can place things inside the little cabinets and all. Im very satisfied. If product came already built, 5 stars all the way.",

The product came quickly and took me (by myself) about an hour and a half to build. None of the pieces were defective and the stand feels sturdy. My 55\" tv fits well enough. However my friend purchased this stand and it came with two left side doors. While the stand may be a good product buy with the precaution that it may came with defective pieces",

Make sure that you attach the hinges to the doors and the side pieces of wood first, then start at the beginning of the instructions. Except for that, the parts were very clearly marked with stickers and the instructions were clear. Also, I found the height of the stand to be too high for a large screen (55\") so I didn't use the top shelf. Still very pleased.",

Thus, it is easy to damage the unit when simply trying to, for example, insert a cam bolt. And, once the particle board gives way, so does the black finish. Speaking of cam bolts, the holes for these don't have pre-drilled threads, so it is easy to end up with a crooked bolt; fortunately the cams don't seem to mind.
