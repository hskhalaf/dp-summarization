However, the wires leading from the controller to the blanket are fragile and actually split from the plug into the blanket. I bought this blanket in July and have only recently been using it. The blanket did shut itself off once the wires detached. Would someone please post contact information, i.e. email address for seller? Also, I don't understand why Amazon is still selling his blanket after many pictures of dangerous wires and fire?",

Fibromyalgia makes you super-sensitive neurologically, and you feel like you're chewing on tin foil, under a regular electric blanket. Very high quality blanket, super soft, and a 10 hour timer. I use fleece sheets, so the blanket does not move about during the night. You can't tuck this blanket in, so it's important to use sheets that offer some resistance, like fleece or flannel.

I also loved that its thin, but has a light weight to it, and with the pleasant warmth, it seems to envelop you and helps you sleep better, to me anyway. For those concerned about feeling wires, you feel them, of course but just barely. So they're not that noticeable. We're enjoying our blanket and hope you will too",

Must have broken wires in serveral places. Will not buy it again.",

I'm looking forward to a lower heating bill next month, as we don't use the forced air at night now.",

Now after having this blanket about a year one side turns on for about 5 seconds then just shuts off. We switched controllers and the same thing happened. We tried other outlets. Nothing on that one side. The rotary dials are very cheap for an expensive blanket. I've noticed other people are having the same problems that we are having so it's obviously an issue with the factory/production of this blanket and not a user issue. We were really pleased but now I'm angry that I spent the money on a well known brand and it's just junk. Save your money.",
