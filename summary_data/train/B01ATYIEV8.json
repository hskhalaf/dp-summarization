I have a 4 year old and 8 year old and they both remind me to give them their vitamins each morning since they love the taste. They actually call it their \"citrus cooler\". I love that they are regularly getting their vitamins and aren't having sugary gummies wrecking their teeth each day. I set up these vitamins on a subscription so I don't even have to think about it. Great product that is kid approved!",
