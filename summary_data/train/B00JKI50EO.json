If you're standing in place, and have thicker feet or wear huge socks they may work well for you, and the construction and stitching is good. The weight is heavier than any other boot I own in the size and price range, and it wears my feet out over a longer day. I'll pull them out for going out for a couple of hours since they look fairly nice, but I wouldn't recommend these to walk around all day in. More of a 3.5 star boot, but for the price I expect a less weight.",

Tread felt rugged enough, would not climb smooth wet rocks though, cause you will slip. Might change the insole out just cause I prefer a hockey heel. A lot of top of the foot space inside, good side fit. Overall, they are okay, I would buy them again if they came in a 6-8 shaft height. cat tax",

Also, I walk our dog 45 - 60 minutes in the morning and again in the evening, and we follow rough muddy trails on a nearby hillside. Same thing: secure footing.

The only fault that I have seen is that the tread has worn down quite a bit.",

These boots fit perfectly right out of the box, and I am a true 11 and a half D in virtually every shoe I've ever worn. You will not go wrong with the 452, and you absolutely get what you pay for.
