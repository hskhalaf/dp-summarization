      "text": "These are good. It made my hair thicker and longer. I\u2019ve gotten 3 bottles which I have used on and off and even then I noticed an improvement. They will not work overnight but they are a great help when used with good hair masks and conditioner. Their only drawback is the weird after taste. Take them with a meal. I did not notice any major hair growth in any other place other than my head. Price is a little steep so I might try to find something else but I totally see me using it in the future again.",

It feels fuller, looks shinier and just overall healthier. My hair has grown, and while I'm not sure if it's at an accelerated rate as I didnt measure but I was never able to put my hair in a ponytail after cutting it and now I am! So I think that's a good indication. Another thing that's great is this did not irritate my skin as had happened to me previously using Biotin which caused cystic acne. With this my skin is as usual. Love hairfluence!!!",

This was a large investment that I cannot get back. I have thin, fine, semi straight dark blonde hair. I have kept everything else - diet, water intake, medication, etc the same.
