I just needed a table cloth so I'll probably use the blanket for other things. I actually thought it came with just 1 napkin, missing 3, but they are used as cushions between the other plates! It will be great fun to use this!",

      "text": "Yes, the backpack itself is very sturdy & worth the money I paid. I like the amount of room in the insulated food compartment. Nice to have 2 insulated drink holders, albeit very skinny ones. The plates: too small, the napkins: very flimsy, (will likely disintegrate on their own). The glasses & silverware are extremely cheap. I would never try to wash any of the above in dishwasher or clothes washer. I bought 2 of these for Christmas gifts & was appalled at how cheap the above parts were. While this item might be okay for teens going out on a picnic date, I absolutely cannot recommend it for any adult. An adult would immediately see the problems.",

      "text": "I didn't want anything too fancy, but I also didn't want the cheap bottom of the line packs. This backpack has just enough elegance to make a day hike special. The oversized blanket is damp-proof, and there are two bottle holders (one is supposed to be for water, but we used both for wine.) The plates are scratchproof but not overly heavy, and there's even cheeseboard with its own knife. It's comfortable to wear, and even more comfortable after eating and drinking the contents at mid-day! The pack has extra thick, padded shoulder straps so it doesn't dig into the shoulders or back. Would love to have more choice of colors maybe, but otherwise the product is great.",
