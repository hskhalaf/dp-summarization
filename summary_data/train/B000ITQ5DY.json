As far as performance, it does well. Heats up my workshop sell even when it's below 35 degrees. It doesn't deflect much heat to the sides, but you can modify a cover to accomplish this. The handle pulls out easily and rarely is in place when going to pick it up. The cage is a bit flimsy as well, but can be modified to heat water on the top to wash hands while working.

Also, I love how it's powered entirely by batteries and kerosene, making it almost perfect for emergencies when the utilities fail. It comes with a siphon pump to help reduce spills, but the siphon pump began to fail during the second use. I suspect the adhesive used in the pump is being dissolved by the kerosene, which is a strong solvent. However, a large funnel suffices. Minus 2 stars for shipping with a defective part.",

With common sense and use precaution, it is a perfect backup solution in the cold winter. I read several researches and online posts regarding safety. Most of the fire hazards occurred because of mishandling and not used specified 1-k kerosene. With this type of kerosene heater, when it is turned off it needs a coupe minutes for the flame to extinguish completely. By the way, the price of 1-k kerosene is not cheap. But I'd rather have this than the firewood and fireplace (these two are not completely smoke-free smell).",
