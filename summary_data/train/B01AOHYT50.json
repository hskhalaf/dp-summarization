There is a flap on each side with a tube in it that you shut in your door, and an elastic band on each side to loop around the side mirror. It comes folded in a pouch of the same material. Have not tested it in snow yet, so will update later. UPDATE: 12/17 Well, tried it out a few days, and it works well. Saves time cleaning off the windows after work in the winter. See new pics.",

It covers the wipers and the little space between the wipers and hood so ice and snow will not accumulate there either. I pulled it off after light snow last night and it just slid right off.

The flap at the bottom near wipers does get blown upward with wind exposing the glass. You could put wipers over top to hold down, but then it defeats the purpose of avoiding the snow. Good idea, just needs better adjustments for or have different sizes for all vehicles .",

It is annoying to put on and take off every time you get in/out of your car, so I end up only putting it on sometimes. When I do have it on, it does a good job of keeping the snow off my windshield. However, it's useless if there is wind. The wind will lift the flaps up from the bottom, allowing for snow and ice to get on your windshield.",

      "text": "Keeps the snow and ice off my windshield like a champ. I live in Kansas, so it saw its fair share of ice and snow last winter. I found that the bottom of the cover has a tendency to flip up a bit in the wind, which may just be due to the shape/angle of my windshield (Volvo s60). I put my wipers over it to hold it down. They're easier to unstick from the cover than from the windshield itself. Overall, I definitely recommend it.",
