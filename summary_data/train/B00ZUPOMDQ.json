      "text": "I like the look, feel and build of this keyboard. However, there is something that is either an error in manufacturing or just Corsairs quirky way of doing things. Keys like the number keys, apostrophe/quote, question mark etc have the shifted symbol listed UNDER the unshifted one. For instance, the quote symbol is printed under the apostrophe on the key. Not a deal breaker but not what I expect when I spend $110 on a keyboard. Also, the fact that they listed this keyboard as \"quiet\" is a bit of a stretch but I like a chunky mechanical keyboard. If you, however, are looking for a quiet one, look elsewhere.",

The Keyboard feels great, now I can type at night without having to struggle it also helps when doing homework and when gaming. My only complaint is not from the keyboard but how Amazon decided to package the keyboard. Amazon shipped the keyboard only with the keyboard box and as a result, a few keys were loose. If I'm paying over $120, I'd expect better packaging from Amazon.",

I've let them know that I will send the keyboard to them personally and see if they can fix it. If not, I want another replacement. Til then, one star.

This keyboard has a lot of controls and lighting which I'm sure my son hasn't even begun to scratch the surface. Cable is very sturdy, shrouded and has 2 connectors. The only problem I have is the keys can pop off fairly easily. It does come with extra keys just in case some get lost. Also comes with a hard plastic wrist rest that snaps to the front of the keyboard. My son hasn't used it.",

The software (iCue) that Corsair has now for all of their devices is super easy to use, but I only wish they had integration of the Hue smart lights I have in my game room. Other than that this keyboard, so far, has been worth the $100 I've spent. P.S. even though corsair shows their special character keys in upside down, they do not actually work upside down. i.e. you still have to hold down shift to do a question mark and no shift still does forward slash.",

Already had one other person in the office buy one himself after trying it out (he loves it as well), and the RGB gets constant compliments.

For a keyboard that costs this much, this shouldn't happen. I have bought cheap mechanical keyboards and they have better key caps for much less.

It was my first mechanical keyboard so I thought it was better than it was. Mechanical is indeed the way to go, but choose a different keyboard. As I alluded to originally, the keyboard itself isn't so bad though it could be better, but the software is just abominable. Unstable, inscrutable, and surprisingly limited.",

      "text": "Works well, great key response, fun customization. I will say though, having only red keys doesn't really open up the possibilities for customization, as most custom presets (user made or Corsair made) are made for the full color keyboards. I chose this model because it matches the color and styling of my rig, and I didn't think I'd really use the multicolored features enough to justify the extra price of the full color models. However, if you think you will use the full-color customization, and you have a few extra bucks to spare, I'd say go for it. The build quality on these keyboards is great.",

The LEDs are nice and bright even on a bright sunny day and can be adjusted to different brightness levels.",

The indicator for scroll lock will flash continuously once it is in bios mode. Similarly, you can turn the mode off by holding down the same buttons for three seconds.",
