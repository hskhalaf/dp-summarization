If you keep the tray empty, and don\u2019t try to do too many at once, this machine works great. I regularly punch 15+ sheets at a time and it has yet to jam on me. It definitely sounds like it\u2019s working harder with a thick stack of paper, but it always gets the job done. It\u2019s such an improvement over the manual punch I was using.",

I have never counted the number of pages I put in the device, but have never come near the advertised capacity; I would rather punch 16 to 20 sheets, which are easily aligned within the device, than trying to align 28 sheets before running the device at capacity. Having recently used this to punch holes in over 120 sheets of quality paper that were put into a binder for presentation, the end result was a professional look with consistently aligned holes.",

I can't image it doing the listed 28 sheets at once smoothly. My paper is a heavier weight - 60 - so it may be able to do 15 sheets of 20 weight okay. Not a problem for me since I just reduce the # of sheets I punch at once and would never do that many sheets. But if you truly expect or need it to punch 28 sheets at once you may want to purchase a higher level machine.",

I figured if it were good enough to handle high volume use in a library, certainly it would hold up at home. This is the case, and I recommend the product to anyone.
