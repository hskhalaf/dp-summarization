At 1/3 the cost, we gave this a try. YES! Used the apparently warranty voiding ZeoSand (100 pounds vs the recommended 200 pounds of pool sand) with much success!

My pool runs all year long here in Miami so it never gets winterized or stops working. These filters are great because there is no need to change filter cartridges. Just back wash once a month during summer and once every 2-3 months during winter months. This whole process takes less than 5 minutes and you're done. What really helps TREMENDOUSLY is using a skimmer sock. My pool stays crystal clear all year long using the skimmer sock.",
