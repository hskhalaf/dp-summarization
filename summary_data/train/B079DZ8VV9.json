I\u2019m only glad I noticed the tear when I did so that it didn\u2019t break in a dangerous area. This pathetic product couldn\u2019t last 1 month. My other retractable leash made it a whole year before tearing. Besides the tearing the locking mechanism isn\u2019t as smooth or easy to use as other leashes I\u2019ve tried. I\u2019m shocked this product has so many positive reviews. A leash being this fragile is dangerous for your pet! Be warned!",

I like the coordinating accessories it came with, and the bright color helps us to spot it easier if it doesn't get put back where it belongs immediately. My only real complaint is that it is very bulky and heavy for what it is. It is a little difficult to hold if trying to juggle other things in your hands.

The problem seems to be that when you use the slide to hold the button in the lock position, it doesn't hold the button in far enough so the lock isn't fully engaged into the locking slots. If the do pulls hard enough it can skip and the leash can ull out. After a while, it takes less and less pull for the lock to slip. The sliding lock that holds the button in is too easy to engage accidentally. So unfortunately, I can't recommend this retractable leash.",

I highly recommend you get this set, great deal that stretches the buck but doesn't skimp on the quality of the product!!",

Unfortunately, my 11 week old puppy is a chewer and the part of the leash she can reach is already fraying. It is what it is because I'm still training her to \"respect the leash\" but I'm kinda sad because I may have to eventually toss this out. I wish there's a way to replace fraying part of the leash. But overall, I love this company. I even bought the matching brush and nail clipper set. :)",

      "text": "I liked all the gadgets this leash came with, but the actual quality of the leash is pretty bad. The retraction is very strong, so if your dog is small he has to actively be pulling on the leash even if he\u2019s just standing there. Retraction is too strong. Also the button releasing the leash or stopping the leash is terribly cheap and gets stuck almost every time you push it. Really stuck to the point that you have to put everything down, make your dog stop moving and work on it for a while to get it working again. High price for such a cheap product. Very dissapointed.",
