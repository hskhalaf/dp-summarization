If you turn it up too much, it sucks in air instead of water, so it's set at a suitable level. (Not where I'm typing, unfortunately, so I can't tell you what that is.)

Requires a setting of 3000 RPM to match the old pump, however at full power 3400 RPM it definitely flows more than the 1 1/2 HP pump. It would be nice if the strainer basket was half again larger. I have not given it 5 stars due to the very convoluted and confusing programming menu.",

The bag of associated hardware was missing the screws to attach the power supply box so had to just silicone it to the pump housing, and the included Installation and User's Guide was for the Whisperflo not the Intelliflo. Fortunately I found the correct guide on the internet.",

Cons - Questioning cost versus two speed pump, but didn't have time to do all the math.",

    "description": "Color:011018Traditional pumps operate at set, unchangeable speeds. Those speeds are almost always higher than required. As a result, they overpower the jobs they're assigned to do, which wastes energy. Intelliflo allows custom programming of optimum pump speeds for specific tasks such as filtering, heating, cleaning, spa jets and waterfalls. for virtually all applications, the optimum speed is lower than the preset, unchangeable speeds of older pumps. When water moves more slowly for longer periods, it helps reduce the occurrence of algae that forms more easily when water is pumped briskly and then allowed to rest for long intervals. Your filter works more effectively because it has more time to sift out particles from the water, and because particles aren't forced through the Filter media under needlessly high pressure. Automatic chemical dispensers and chlorinators also work better when water is kept moving.",
