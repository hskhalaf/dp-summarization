It's half the price of the Le Creuset and very compact, which is nice, especially for when you're not at home. I'm really impressed by this wine opener. I corkscrew works perfectly, and I love the step down feature that assists in pulling out the cork. I don't love the foil cutter, but that's okay. Glad to have the ability to foil cut, if I need it, but the separate, stand-alone foil cutters work much better. That said, this cork removal system of this product is, in my opinion, just excellent. I highly recommend. I would definitely purchase again.",

My one gripe is that it's a two-handed tool- I have to use my other hand to pull out the blade, instead of being able to flick it. That being said, a little retraining of muscle memory on the floor solved the problem. I have the wood and moonstone finishes. The weight feels awesome and pulling the cork is smooth. This is my go-to wine opener both at home and at the restaurant.",

First I immediately noticed the high quality of the corkscrew. It had a decent weight to it unlike other light that further reinforced my opinion. Finally and most importantly it easily screwed into the cork and smoothly pulled the cork out with little effort on my part. I will be purchasing more during the holiday season to share with others.

Both of these defects suggests that the screw is made of a fairly soft steel. So now, I have one corkscrew without a screw and another with a collapsed screw that won't screw into a cork!

The wood finish is nice. The foil cutter is sharp and works well. It would be nice to have a corkscrew that had a slippery surface like teflon so rotating into the cork was easier and removing the cork is easier, but for the price I'm quite happy.

      "text": "I have been Bartending for about 30 years, this by far is the nicest wine key I have had at this price point. It is well made, heavy duty and just outright good looking. The knife is sharp and well curved... When you have this key in your hand you know it is there, it has a great weight to it, and fits really well in your hand... Goes through real and artificial cork with ease... I recommend this key to anyone in the bar/service industry or for your kitchen gadget drawer. Well worth the money! There will be no \"whining\" (get it) here here about the quality of this key!",

I never thought I would say such thing about a corkscrew, I thought they were all somewhat similar, but this one is different! I am no bartender, but I have opened a good share of wine bottles and this one is the best one yet. It feels great on your hand, as you screw it into the cork, you feel less resistance than when you use a generic brand. It took me a couple of tries before I used it right, but I guess old habits die hard, lol. I love-it!",

Takes some getting used to but certainly allows easy removal of a cork. However, it is sturdy. I have no doubt it will last forever and it is attractive, and it does the job.
