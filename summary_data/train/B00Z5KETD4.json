Not sure how but the bushing that let it slide with some slight friction fell out, which caused it to just slide all the way open and fall apart when I picked them up one day. Mind you, they still work, but the slide mechanism has almost no friction so you have to actively apply pressure to keep an accurate reading of what you're measuring and the fall apart pretty easily now.",

This appears to be a sloppy manufacturing defect that should have been caught by quality control. The result is that it is impossible to use the pointed tips to take an accurate measurement, and instead you can only use the flat surfaces of the caliper. If you need to take accurate measurements, I recommend purchasing a higher quality product- you wont be happy with this one.",

Nice feature with the exception being you need to lock the device when storing and transporting. Any small bump may cause it to turn on and stay on, burning through your battery.",

They also seem to be more accurate than my previous digital cal. tested alongside my very expensive dial calipers. Excellent product at a great price.",
