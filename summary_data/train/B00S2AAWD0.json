The other is broken completely, and won't hold weight at all. Since one is working I can tell how they are supposed to be set up, and it appears in the broken one the little spring was either installed backwards or slipped out completely. Since the hinges are riveted I can't take it apart to try and fix it either. Currently I just have the broken one tied up with knots to hold it. That makes adjustment pretty much impossible, so you better only be using these at one level.",
