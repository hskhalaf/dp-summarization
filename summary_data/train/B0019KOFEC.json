It is made of plastic and it came out of the box already kinked in 2 places. If you keep the hose straight, it's great. But try and keep a hose straight when you are actually using the vacuum. A replacement costs between 25 and 35 dollars. So to have a good vacuum, I will end up paying over a hundred dollars after replacing the hose.",

      "text": "I see other posts complaining about how the tubing gets kinked or twisted, along with the accessory parts falling off easily. For me, I do not have these issues. If you pay attention to the hose and untwist it if it starts to kink you won't have a problem and it will not create a permanent kink if you do not store it inappropriately. Also, the accessory parts go on perfectly and if you add a little pressure then twist, they stay on and do not fall off. It has great suction and it reaches to high ceilings . This is a great little vacuum for a low price.",

The first lasted about 15 years and I liked it so much that when the motor finally burnt out, I purchased a new \"pet version.\" I had it for approximately four months and it no longer works. The motor smells like it is burning, the sides are super hot and the suction is basically gone (and yes it has a new bag in it). Very disappointed and apparently the quality of the product just isn't the same but I would expect more than four months use out of it. Before it died, it did work great though.",

A minor adjustment would make this the \"Perfect Vaccuum\". We are amazed at the suction, the long handle fits easily under all our furniture and the long extension cord make moving around a snap!",

      "text": "I purchased my first MightMite vacuum in 1996 and it lasted 20 years. In August 2016, I purchased the new Pet Model specifically designed for vacuuming pet hair. It lasted 2 years before the switch broke off the vacuum. I purchased two more of the same model in August 2018 and the same On-Off switch broke again in two months. Eureka's a quality product, but for some reason, they need to redesign the switch. I'm dealing with Eureka Warranty - I'll let you know how they honor their product.",

      "text": "Wow....awesome vacuum. It maybe a little loud but it works great. The suction on it is strong picks up anything. Be careful with your hands in the little suction opening. You can adjusted for the pressure. I always had upright vacuums but not anymore, I'm a believer now an have switch for the better. You do have to use different accessories for area rugs. I use the pet/upholstery one so it doesn't pull rug as I clean it. For hardwood floors I bought a different attachment that has more of a brush/bristle on both sides so it doesn't scratch floors. The one that came with vacuum is good but doesn't have much bristle n scratch my floor.",

You got to propt up the plastic a lil bit to disengage switch. A total inconvenience. Obviously. Thanks, Eureka",

The wand has come apart and dropped on my foot a few times. It does have good suction. There is a hole in the top of the wand that can be covered or opened to regulate the suction. 3. I wish the company would make a better floor brush (more bristles) for picking up fine dust. 4. One of the extra attachment is a small brush which is made into two brushes, one side with bristles and the other side not bristles. The bulk of it made it useless to me.",

I love them because they are lightweight and don't lose suction. This time I upgraded a few bucks to the pet lover version and it is the BEST of all. The rigid part of the hose is sturdier and more stable, the wide floor head works better on carpet than the older versions, the pet hair attachment has an excellent rotating brush, and the unit comes with a snap-on optional hepa filter. Great value for the price!",

It has some trouble picking up larger, heavier bits of debris, but it picks up the majority of stuff. Strongly recommend this vacuum, especially if you have pets.",
