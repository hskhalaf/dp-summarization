I spent an hour on the phone with Samsung customer support and they claim that because my phone is 1 and 1/2 years old, I should pay $50 to get a system refresh. Samsung was the one who did the update, not me. Plus, the Samsung customer service person told me there was no guarantee that I would get the same quality camera features back, even with the $50 payment. Is this the kind of company you want to deal with after paying $1000 for a phone?",

      "text": "Bought this phone through the seller Wireless zone. Listed as a Samsung unlocked phone. What I received, as you can clearly see in the pictures, is an AT&T phone. I am one very unhappy customer who immediately returned this phone. This seller would not be allowed to list an item as factory unlocked when it is obviously carrier specific. If I could give this NO STARS, I would. Thank goodness Amazon is awesome to work with it I would be out over $600 for a phone I came use.",

      "text": "Even though the image and description say there is a US warranty. There is NOT on the one they sent me. When I tried to register the phone with Samsung it came back that it is not a US phone and that it is an international phone. When I set it up it was all in Spanish. I should have realized it then. This is false advertisement and should be illegal and I am shocked that Amazon even allows it. It's a HUGE gamble if you get this phone and something goes wrong.",

      "text": "This phone is a pretty big let down for me. I switched from an apple iPhone 7 plus. To this Galaxy, and it really wasn't worth the switch or the price I played for this phone. The service data is very bad quality. In places I had 4G LTE on my iPhone. I dnt even have 3G on this Note 9. And I know it's not the Cell provider. It's the phone. The fingerprint scanner is just not what it is on the iPhone's as well. I'm just not very impressed. Probably going to go back to iPhones. Unless someone can change my mind?",

I went from charging 2-3x day to it lasting a day and a half. This phone is up to date on security patches and software and is a true workhorse. Highly recommended buying from this seller. He backs up his products.",

This phone is a big scam, It turns off by itself, every time I\u2019m trying to install something through the play store, phone gets hot and turns off. I thought buying a new one will help but this is Horrible, need my money back!!!",
