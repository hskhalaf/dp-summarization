If you want a high-end look, then you better spend the extra $$$ for it; otherwise you'll be disappointed with the \"look\" of the chandelier. If you want something cute but don't want to spend a lot of $$, I highly suggest this chandelier. I gave it four stars because my hubby hot wired it, and it wasn't easy installing it.",

I will be hanging this above a free standing tub in my master bath and it's absolutely well made, the silver has streaks of gold through it so it placates the silver making finish less bright than bright chrome which is exactly what I was looking for as my faucets are all brushed nickle. It is beautiful just in the box so once hanged I know it will be much more beautiful. I'll post pictures once in my bathroom.",
