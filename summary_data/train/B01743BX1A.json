Bowls are tiny - just toss them and eat out of the pot. The spork is a nice addition except for the fact that stuff keeps sticking to it and won't come off? Again, don't even bother with the loofa because it's not getting food off. The pot does well for boiling water, so there's a star for that.",

Used it on a camping trip to Shenandoah. Lightweight, packs small. Only disadvantage is that the lid doesn't sit nicely on top of the skillet, it'll fall down into it rather than rest on top like it does the sauce pan. Oh well. Definitely not a deal-breaker for me. Clean-up is easy too. It's pretty non-stick, never had to use oil on any of my food I cooked. As long as I scraped at the bottom of the pan with the wooden spatula that came with, nothing stuck.",

From a stowage perspective it's REALLY small, lightweight and fits well on my motorcycle storage spot with the rest of my gear. It's as big around as my fingers/hand and about 5 inches tall when it's packed together. Wife says it's really cute and will do the trick when I travel. For now, 5 stars.",

      "text": "This product was perfect, for me. It's a small folding pan setup, with flip out handles and an extra pan. One is more of a stew/soup/boil pan, one is more akin to a fryer. It also comes with two nice, stacking plastic cups inside (for portioning, eating or drinking - I used mine as a water cup) and a spork. They all fit back together, quick, and then into an included carrying sack, with a rope-close end. It worked great for me, as I was alone on this trip. For 2-3 folks - buy one for each person, you'll be great!",
