Love that you can open and close the in/out door with the handle on the outside. Nesting box is easily accessible and fits two chickens perfectly. Roosting bars could of been a bit higher but something you can change on your own. Great little backyard coop!",

The size of the sleeping area is where problems arouse, the perches where way too close to each other and too low.

You need to know that you will have to add security measures such as better and more locks and latches. It took my husband about 1 1/2 hours to put it together by himself and Then another 1 hour to secure it. I love it from an aesthetic standpoint. The lever to close the coop at night is great. You have to put chicken wire or something over the window.",

Easy to understand building instructions and easy to assemble. I did add extra more substantial locks/latches. Not predator proof, especially with the removable floor board in the nesting box. I ended cutting and placing a wooden board as the floor for the nesting box.",
