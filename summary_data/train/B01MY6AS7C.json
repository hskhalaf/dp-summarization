      "text": "I bought two of these covers for my Jet skis last year. The skis are located on our dock and are partially covered. In less than one year both covers deteriorated from the weather and both have multiple rips rendering them useless. The covers do not hold up in the outdoor elements. I expected at least a years worth of durability, however I now have to buy two new covers. Very disappointing that they can advertise the product is Water proof and Sun proof when in less than a years usage, they are neither.",
