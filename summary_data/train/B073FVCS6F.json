As it can tilt upward for a more sit up angle, I wish it had a 5pt harness and not just a 3pt at the waist. And for $200+ you would think it would have a powered mobile, but no. Baby got bored quickly after eye sight developed enough to see that far, and none of the motions worked to sooth (bc it was uncomfortable to sit in, don't blame her) This was regifted to a friend after a month.",

Final verdict: Spent last week at a house that had a $30 chair that vibrated and bounced naturally on a spring. Worked just as well if not better. Would not recommend.",

    "description": "It moves like you do. The 4moms mamaRoo 4 infant seat bounces up and down and sways from side to side, just like parents do when comforting their baby. Select from five unique motions, like car ride and tree swing, and five different speeds. Choose from four built-in sounds or connect it to any MP3 player. The seat reclines to multiple positions to allow baby to lie back and relax or sit up and play. The mamaRoo is also Bluetooth enabled so you can control the motion, sound, speed and volume from your compatible smart device without disturbing baby! The overhead toy mobile now includes interactive, reversible toy balls. Keep baby\u2019s attention with the sound of the crinkle ball, rattle or reflective mirror ball. Compatibility: The 4moms app for iOS is compatible with all Apple devices newer than the iPhone 4s that are running iOS 9 or newer. The native Android app is compatible with most Android devices that support Bluetooth Low Energy and are running Android 4.3 or newer.\n\n\n\nThe mamaRoo is an infant seat used to comfort, soothe and entertain your baby. It is not a sleeper, nor intended for overnight sleep, since it is neither a flat surface (there is always a slight recline), nor a firm surface, as recommended by pediatricians. Never leave your child unattended.",
