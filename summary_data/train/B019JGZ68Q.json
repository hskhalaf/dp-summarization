My dog's first trip in a kayak was enjoyable for us both because the kayak did not wobble in his first nervous minutes. The Skipjack 90 is an excellent value for the money. con: it cannot be transported on a standard carrier because of the keel, but problem easier solved with a cradle carrier. Many kayakers would probably be able to carry this 46-lb. kayak short distances; but being 5'8\" and 114 lbs. (and 69 years old) the width of the kayak made it too unweildy for me to manage alone.",

The plastic buckles that keep the seat in adjustment do no hold, for a very frustrating experience constantly readjusting the buckles. We were interested in the Hero Seat offered by Vibe for $99 but it appears to have the same buckles, and if so, it is probably worthless also. There are kayak seats offered by other manufacturers that at least offer an alternative to the low quality offering by Vibe.",

The paddles are a lot more curved than my other paddles. So far I don\u2019t like them, but I think my poor paddling technique is to blame. They are just different.

      "text": "Haven't been able to get it to the lake yet, still a bit chilly. But impressed with workmanship and it arrived in 100% perfect condition. I am a bit older and I know I cannot get this up over my head to put on top of my car myself so will have to find another way to get it to the lake. Just want to let anybody know that who is wondering. I can easily lift it into the truck of my car though. Thinking may have to get an SUV!!",

Thus frees up leg room since you have to leave the back storage for the cooler. Bonus it arrived in about 1 week so was able to get back on the water asap.",
