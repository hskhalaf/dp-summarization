      "text": "Really like it. My 17 month old slept all night in it when in the pack n play. She always sleeps in her crib so was worried about her being in the pack n play. Light and easy to travel with. Tip: when you put the sheets on, wrap it all the over the pack n play hard mattress thing also. My toddler did eventually start pulling at it and flipped one side up over and over because of how it folds. Wrapping it over the pack n play mattress prevents that",
