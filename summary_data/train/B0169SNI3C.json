It is nice to have the benefits of a Blackberry with the access of the Android platform, but it's not very easy to navigate and I would not buy another one. Also, there is no way to block numbers, and even setting an individual ringtone to silent is a twenty-step process, so I get a lot of annoying calls.",

Thanks to Blackberry and myriad additional security measures, I really enjoy this phone. My only complaint is that the screen is not bright enough for use outdoors.

      "text": "Been waiting a while for another android slider. Keyboard works great, I can almost type without looking at the phone. Nice to be able to answer calls by flicking the phone open (even if you're wearing gloves). Keyboard doubles as a trackpad. Supports HDMI (slimport) and USB OTG. Also wireless charging, as well as QC 2.0. I get about 5-6hr screen-on-time on average. The best part of this phone is the ability to hang up by SLAMMING THE PHONE SHUT!!! YEAH!!!!! ...uh, sorry, got a little carried away there.",

BB10 is a great OS which world doesn't know about. A big error by BlackBerry, but it seems the latest OS from Android has covering some ground. I think a big plus for this phone is the additions of the BlackBerry integration. I think it really enhances the Android experience and not to mention make it more secure. Plus, the physical keypad. Nice. If you prefer Android, you should seriously consider this phone for what BlackBerry adds to it, including more security in a really nice package.",
