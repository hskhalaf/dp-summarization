      "text": "The campco has one fatal flaw. It makes a loud hissing sound which completely ruins the ambience of having a fire. I can't believe the company hasn't fixed this. To fix it yourself you have to buy a new elbow that doesn't have the pre-drilled holes in it. Supposedly these holes are supposed to allow you to adjust the color of the flames. I tried to use the adjuster and it's pretty useless and has a tiny screw that no screwdriver seems to fit, I had to use a vice grips. There are two other manufacturers that may not have these problems. When is called campfire in a can.",

      "text": "This is a great little propane fire pit. It puts out good heat and a decent flame. I just wish that they could figure out a way to make it quieter when you turn the flame high. And, it can go through a propane tank (large) pretty fast on high for a long time. However, I used mine for a couple of weeks at various levels for a couple of hours each night before my tank was empty.",

No more smoke of trying to start a fire under the rain.... or having to buy those over priced bundles of fire wood at the store. It's great to have an instant fire at night, and or early mornings with a cup of coffee... we do s'mores and cook sausages on a stick and a cold IPA... doesn't get better that that.... it has come great when you go into campfire restrictions areas..... Haven't had any issues with it, even when doing washboard roads off of the beaten path...",

I\u2019ve seen other models which the whole bottom pan has holes in it to allow better, quieter air flow. It has a hiss that gets louder as your turn up the flames. Flame and heat output however is pretty decent for a fire pit this size.",
