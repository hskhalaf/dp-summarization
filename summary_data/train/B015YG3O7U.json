I'd give it more stars, but it generates a serious amount of radio interference, especially around 100 MHz which is in the middle of the FM band. A favorite radio station on 100.3 was very listenable before installing these exit signs, but now it is impossible to receive. If I turn of the power to the exit signs, the reception is fine. They also seem to wreak havoc on the AM radio band as well. This \"feature\" is not exclusive to this particular brand of sign. I've discovered that most LED exit signs do the same thing, including some that cost a LOT more money.",
