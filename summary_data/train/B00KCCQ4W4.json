I had to mark it down a star though because it seems like there are fine feathers that are just pouring out of it. I have checked every inch of the comforter to see if there was a rip that needed patching but nothing and these feathers just seem to ooze out of it from everywhere. I wake up covered in these fine feathers and they are all over my room. That being said it is still a very warm comforter and I'm never cold when I use it.",

So at night when it's between 55F and 35F outside, I don't have to turn on the heat and this comforter keeps me nice and warm. This would not be a good all year comforter in Texas.",

The fabric is rough, paperlike despite several softening attempts ( in the dryer as water would damage the down). It's extremely loud and hot. Fill power isn't the amount of down put into the comforter, but the quality of the down. A 750 fill power comforter should be incredibly light but still warm, this seems very heavy, I believe its over 10 lbs. Comparatively other confirmed 700+ fill power down comforters with similar fill weight weigh around 70 oz or 4.5 lbs. That being said it is still a decent comforter for the price.",
