This isn't how Oculus intends for you to set it up, so they don't include a USB cable long enough to do the trick. I figured it'd be best if I didn't have a short cable going through the center of where I'll be messing around (while more/less blind to my surroundings), so I opted for a better route by buying this. It works well for what it needs to do. Haven't had any problems yet.",
