And since there is no USA warranty, I can't get it fixed. If you tried taking it apart to fix it yourself, you can't because there is no way to get inside. Now, it won't even turn on. super disappointed because of one small problem",

The phone itself is awesome, as expected, with fast performance, a beautiful screen, a great camera (wide angle is amazing and the main camera offers a ton of manual control), a premium feeling body, and an overall pleasant experience. If you have the cash, grab this phone as it can be picked up for cheaper than other flagships while performing just as well if not better in some regards.",
