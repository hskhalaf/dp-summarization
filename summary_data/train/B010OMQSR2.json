      "text": "Currently, I keep this sight off my rifle due to the fact that when fully tightened, the mount sits crooked on the rail. Rail is straight. I've also had a pretty difficult time getting this sighted correctly. Co-Witnessed Irons work flawlessly, not sure why the Red Dot won't sight in. Dot is crisp with a tad bit of glare, I'd give it 5 stars for build quality and feel. If only I could get it to mount flush to match my Irons.",

Dot is actually bright enough for me at lower setting, so distortion isn\u2019t a bother. Good deal & seems well made. I would recommend it for those on a budget.",
