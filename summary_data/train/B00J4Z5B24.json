Our house is over 5000 sqft and you could smell it from the other end. Urine was soaked in to carpet, padding, subfloors and everything. At one point I was thinking it was either a house cat with huge bladder or a small tiger. My wife used our commercial carpet steamer, I pulled the carpet and cut the padding, nothing helped until this thing came along. Literally in 2 hours smell was gone and it stayed that way after 2 weeks as I write this report. Best money spent.",

I have two indoor cats with hairball issues; they are often spitting up hairballs, or stomach acid only before or after the passing of the hairball. (Sorry for the TMI.) Of course, they only want to do this on the carpet and rugs. This stain remover effectively removes the bodily fluid, hairball, etc. with a nice, fresh minty scent and no sticky residue. I keep a bottle upstairs and downstairs so I don't have to go hunting for it during those 2AM hairball vomiting sessions (because, of course, that's the only time they want to throw up).",

I've been using a Bissel shop-vac style carpet cleaner every weekend for a month to get the smell of this stuff out. The bottle it comes in is so cheaply made then neck actually bends when squeezing the trigger. This is a money maker for the manufacturer but useless for you & me.",
