These electromagnetic waves cause slight vibrations that disturb the communication and living of pests, irritate their nervous system, and ultimately drive them away.\n\n UNMATCHED RODENT CONTROL Our Turbulent Storm Technique makes each speaker emit ultrasonic sounds at a different set frequency. This improved acoustic technique ensures that rodents cannot develop an immunity to the sounds. Rodent Targeting allows you to target specific hearing zones while Rodent Confusion hits the hearing zones of different rodents for unmatched electronic rodent control!\n\n CHEMICAL-FREE The Advanced Rodent Repeller is environmentally-friendly as it uses chemical-free ultrasonic sounds to electronically repel mice, rats and other rodents away from unwanted areas. The ultrasonic sounds fall outside the hearing ranges of humans, cats, dogs and birds, so you and your pets won't notice a thing.\n\n AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE We care about your repelling success, and we want to use our 25+ years experience in the Electronic Pest Repelling business to resolve your issue!
