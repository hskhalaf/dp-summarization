      "text": "Purchasing this scissor jack set was the best investment, by far, for my toy hauler. The jacks are heavy duty and well built. The 24\" height comes in handy for camping on uneven ground. The kit includes bolts which will work just fine, but I replaced mine with a nut and bolt combo with thread locker. The set also includes a 3/4\" bit, which I found to be a little shallow. If you'll be using an impact, like me, I would reccomend a deep 3/4\" socket, or you will damage the socket head ends of each jack. I would highly recommend these, if you're using the old bottle neck style jacks, like I was.",

I was able to jack up the four sides of my 3,500 travel trailer (RV) just using my 20v Black and Decker cordless drill and the drill attachment that they provided. I don't know if they meant to do so, but they included 2 of the attachments, which is really great, because I already lost the one that I had for my trailer jack. I am well pleased with this purchase.",

Was very impressed with the width of these compared to an auto jack, that I was originally using... to no avail, as it bent, These are sturdy, with a low profile when not expanded and also fit great in a small cabinet within my RV, before I attached them. The handle tool, bolts, and socket were put to good use. This is a great product that I recommend to everyone that needs to level an RV/camper or other. Thank you for making this available on Amazon and being of high quality! THX!!!!! :)",

Only problem is if you back off of the jack too far, it will cause the crimp on the thread to move which will make your jack not want to stay up while you are driving. so if you dont back it up too far then it will work great. Anyway a good product and worth it for me",
