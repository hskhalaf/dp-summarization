I also have not had to use the support and can't provide any comments. I purchased this for a second home and love the ability to create a different code for anyone that may need to access the house. I also love the alerts and notifications that let me know when the door is locked or unlocked. Bottomline - I would recommend this lock for anyone that is looking for a way to manage and control access.",
