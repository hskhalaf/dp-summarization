I'm trying orange to help with losing it problem. If you've ever drowned a camera in the rain or ruined one with dirt, think about this one- it's impervious, I would hand it to a three year old in a mud puddle!",

The color of the photos appears to be very saturated and water shots both above and below the surface turn out very blue. I snorkeled for a couple of hours before the battery died, so it is better than a cheaper camera using AA batteries. It also shoots in video, zoom mode, and wide angle \"stitch together\" mode. I'm sure there are better models out there, but for the money this was a good deal instead of buying disposables.",

Employees are not the most careful with company property, so having a camera which is dustproof, waterproof, can be dropped to the floor without harm, and can be stepped on without harm; gives me a lot of peace of mind. Can't do anything about it being \"theftproof\" but at these low prices I will just have to take that chance.",

So, today I bought it again, and I am sure we will get as much enjoyment from this one as we did before.

Ordered an extra battery when I bought the camera, but Amazon recommended the wrong one, so it didn't work. Also, Olympus uses an odd shaped cord, so I couldn't use any other USB cord to charge. Missed a lot of photo opportunities because of that. I plan to get an extra cord and another battery before I use the camera again for an extended period.",

It doesn't float, and I would highly recommend buying a float attachment for it. I bought a yellow Chums waterproof camera float and it works perfectly! It's important to read the directions and let it air out after each time you open the battery compartment. The poor ratings on here clearly didn't read the directions and take proper care of their camera.",

I have now used it in the summer in many american lakes, where it worked, but also in sea water where it failed. I had always washed the camera immediately after in regular tap water. Now to the picture quality. One expects some impairment relative to normal cameras, and the picture does seem slightly soft. Moreover, the flash is far too bright, and one must snap from much farther away with a zoom to ensure any type of moderate exposure. Really this should not be the case.",

I've taken it in ponds, rivers, oceans, across continents, over hemispheres, and into a cup of coffee or two. It doesn't come with a case! I also highly recommend a larger memory card than the one that comes with. Bottom of the camera has a notch for screwing into tripods.",

I used the camera for less than a week and went back to an older model. This camera is now a backup in case my older one breaks.

      "title": "Great Disposable Camera",
      "text": "I received this camera in Mid June. By Mid August, it was done. I enjoyed the use of this camera while snorkeling 2 days a week for 2 months until it no longer worked. I would say a little over $100 is worth the investment for a disposable camera that only lasts 60 days. I sent the camera back to Olympus- they said the camera was unable to be repaired. Olympus offered a link (generous) to some refurbished disposable cameras much like the one that is now inoperable for 2x the $$. I say, fool me once...I had ordered an extra battery, b/c battery life is about 2 hours. Guess I'll be sending that back, too.",
