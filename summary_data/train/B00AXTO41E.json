In my wife's opinion the only negative is that it doesn't have sufficient power to blow heavy leaves (especially magnolia) and doesn't meet her needs for cleaning her mower deck. I mainly use it for sweeping sidewalks and the drive way and it is more than powerful enough for those. I am 68 with arthritis in my wrists and I couldn't love it more.",

It would be interesting to know where they came up with the 120 MPH wind output since that is so easily overcome by a 15 MPH wind.

I returned 1 for a replacement and the 2nd one I just went ahead and replaced it myself. If it wasn't for my Wife liking them so much, I would not recommend them. They WILL fail.",

Battery life will get you 30-60 minutes at full power, depending on usage.",
