I got really excited to see they were back and immediately ordered a new pair. I must agree with many others that the quality is not like they used to be. Unfortunately, it's less than 2 weeks of wear and a seam is already busted on the side edge of the left shoe. They are worn as a daily work shoe and I had no major wear this past week and a half besides normal work hour routine and walking. I am disappointed by this, but maybe I got a dud?",

They were fantastic looking and comfortable, and lasted for years. Not only does this one feel cheaply made, it looks trashy as well. I've since moved to Ecco shoes since I've tried several pairs of Clarks in the past year, and all seemed chintzy.",

In the place where these two sections meet, a very painful ridge runs right under my plantar tendons. I felt like I was standing on a garden hose after a while.

The negatives: the heel is much too tight (and structured) to make them an easy slip-on, expect to have a seat and use a shoe-horn. The styling is also not their best. It's hard to see in the product photo, but the top \"tongue\" is partially detached (it protrudes from the body of the shoe). Combined with the center stitching, it has an oddly casual look, like they made a loafer out of stiff dress-shoe material. Not the best aesthetic. Add in the tightness, and they are going back.",

Which obviously after a few hours their rough on your feet. In terms of grip also not that good",

He spends most of his work day on his feet, an average of 10 - 12 hours per day, and he raves about how comfortable they are! For how he wears them (frequency and duration) the tread and inside support lasts a very long time. He was incredibly disappointed when we could no longer find these in the stores, and we tried a few other Clark styles but none were as comfortable nor lasted as long. He was thrilled when I found these on Amazon!",

May invest in another pair (just because I go through shoe soles quickly for some reason)l I'm hoping the soles with this pair hold out like a previous pair of Clarks I had (which lasted probably 10 years before the uppers began to fray AND the soles began to get thin).",
