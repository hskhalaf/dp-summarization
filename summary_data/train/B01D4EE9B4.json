Picture crisp detailed, colours vivid. Got to be said, some veteran newscasters don\u2019t benefit from HD images this size... Movies amazing. We connected it to Sky Q with a long hdmi lead and audio system through 3.5mm lead. Definitely best bang for your buck in the AV world in my opinion.",

We use it as our main TV on a 100\" screen. It works really well for me, but personally I dont think the HD side is as good as it could be, we dont use the sound as this goes through my amp. Its perfect for everything from YouTube to TV, to movies etc. Focus is good too. Very simple to use with a lot of options to get the picture perfect.",

As with all electronic devices, there is a hum from the cooling fan, but with my BOSE speakers turned up its hardly noticeable. Also love the fact its a portable, take anywhere system that I can use for work as well, or just change room to watch my movies!",

Also no need for screen if you have a white or clean almost white Wall. I wasted money buying a screen which I don't think I will use.",

I have attached a couple of pictures to show the pin sharp image quality. I would estimate that due to the academy aspect ratio of 1.375:1 for King Kong I had the projector just over a metre away from my wall and slightly closer for the screenshots Interstellar. To obtain these settings I used the Disney Optimizer that can be found on their recent Blu Ray releases.",

Why watch a 30-55 when you can watch a 65-300 well as big as the wall in your house. Plan on buying a sony 3d blue ray player and linking via Bluetooth to a bose surround sound bar. Only downsides are No Bluetooth out No DVD player built in No smart projector features In my eyes if this projector had Bluetooth out and Netflix, amazon prime and a 3d blue ray player built in it would be perfect.",
