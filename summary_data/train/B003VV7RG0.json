The bend of the legs make it susceptible to breakage. The design makes it difficult to enter and exit without placing weight on corners. However all corners are mark as \"no touch\" zones. Purchase at your own risk!!!! I sent this one back and purchased one from Cabelas.",

Although the cot is not for me, I definitely will be shopping with them in the future and hope that all of you do as well. They no longer are selling this particular cot but they have one that is built stronger and better as well as have lots of wonderful merchandise just waiting for you to purchase. Thank you Earth...",
