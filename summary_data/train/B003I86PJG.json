Attempting to place the cursor on a waypoint on a bouncing boat is terrible. Sorry Garmin the model 78 is a looser",

It provides water depth in more cases than GPS coordinates on the screen or briefly shows coordinates then jumps to depth. It also sometimes shuts down when you press Enter using the sequence describe here. Again, satisfied overall but these items would make the 78sc more user friendly.",

      "text": "We got this unit in combination with the Garmin BlueChart g2 Southeast Caribbean Saltwater Map microSD Card. It tracked our moves perfectly well, which made planning our day very easy. The GPS was attached to the helm of our charter boat with the use of a Ram Mount Suction Cup Base for the Garmin. This kept everything in place and within easy reach when navigating. We also used the GPS to monitor our anchoring, which was very helpful. The GPS is light weight. The screen was very easy readible, even though the sun was shinging every day. Still need to read the full manual. We just used the device as plug and play and everything worked well.",

      "text": "The product description is not clear at all. The 78s \"Compass, Barometric Altimeter\" is VERY different from the \"Maps, Compass, Barometric Altimeter\" version. The 78s is 50 dollars cheaper but this \"Marine GPS\" comes NO marine charts, Just a very rudimentary base map with no water charting. To actually get a marine chart, those must be purchased separately as microSD cards for $150. Then the card is locked to that device and can not be re-used.",
