As a 48 year old mom/grandma, I have used several different mops over the years. I like this one the best. Been using it now for about 4 months and it's golden! I have 3 dogs that shed and sometimes pee on the floor and grandkids that spill pretty much everything. This mop easily and nicely cleans the messes and I know it's more sanitary than ordinary mops because I can thoroughly clean the heads either by hand or in the washing machine. I'm sold! This mop is the best :)",

The mop part I haven't used yet but I will. That's the only reason why I gave it a four star. But looking at the mop part it looks like it has fringe at the end which is good. Makes it good to pick up anything from the edges. you can send me another survey about the mop part. And by then I will know if that part was good.",
