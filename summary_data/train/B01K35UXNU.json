      "text": "I really love these shoes. They're near perfect all-around. They fit as expected, look amazing and were reasonably priced when I purchased them a year or more ago and I have kept them in great shape. The insole heel will probably be worn out in a couple of months, but that's not a huge problem. I wear them to work a couple of times a week and have received a lot of compliments on them. Depending on how long these last and whether or not this particular line is still available, I would consider purchasing another pair. And I'm not sure if I've ever said that about any shoe before. Easy five stars.",

This particular set were a bit tight at first and the ridge of the back of the shoe would put too much pressure on the back of my foot making them difficult to wear. However, after about three days of heavy walking they broke in and have become one my most comfortable purchases of this brand.",
