This one seemed to have good scores, comparably, so I took the chance. Not disappointed. It runs great, especially overclocked. I'm still not sure the turbo boost software does much for me, but I use it. It's nice not having to wait on my computer much now. Most things are more or less instant.",

      "title": "WARNING: THESE CHIPS HAVE HEAT ISSUES (X-SERIES / SKYLAKE-X)",
      "text": "Be very careful when purchasing any chips in the x-series, particularly the i9, as they have known heat issues. Unless you have a really good AIO cooler or a custom-built cooling solution, you'll likely run into problems. I got the i9 and with a Corsair H100i my cpu sat at 34C idle but quickly climbed to 95C - 105C while gaming. I'm returning mine for an i7-8700k and suggest others do the same unless you're willing to shell out more money to solve the heat problems.
