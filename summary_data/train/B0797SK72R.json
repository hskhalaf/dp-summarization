      "text": "After much research, I purchased the ESDDI Flash Speedlite for use with my Nikon D7200. I am a photography enthusiast/hobbyist who is a beginner in the realm of flash. So many reviews, so many opinions are available; I was unsure of the quality I would receive at this price point, and was considering a higher-priced unit. However, I decided that the ESDDI Speedlite should suit my needs just fine. I find that the ESDDI Speedlite is well-made, with features available on higher-priced flash units, and works great. I look forward to more practice with the flash, and great results.",

You can believe that I will be keeping a close eye on it and updating this review if it has any quality issues though, as my experience with cheaply made camera equipment is it works really well for a very short period of time then it begins having serious issues.",

It has so many features I'm still learning, but it allows great portrait photos inside and outdoor low-light scenes such as subjects with a sunset in the background. I originally hadn't thought about setting up a master / slave for some of my shots, but this flash makes it look so simple and inexpensive I may just have to get a softbox and give it a try. Good on ESDDI for creating a solid feature-rich product.",
