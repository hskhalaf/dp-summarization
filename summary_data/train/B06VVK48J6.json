It comes with the option to use 4 AAA batteries (not included), which insert into a compartment on the back of the mirror. The mirrors are clear and the lights are definitely bright enough for applying makeup and styling hair. Overall, a great product.",

My one complaint is the usb cord that it comes with it so short that it might as well not be in range for anything, it's rather useless. It doesn't come with batteries (it states that) but I thought the cord would at least be useful. I have tried it however and the lights do work, but you're best off buying your own usb cord or buying batteries if you want to use the lights. I don't use the lights so it doesn't really affect me, the mirror still does it's job of magnifying and looking cute in the stand!",
