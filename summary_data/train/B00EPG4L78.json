      "text": "I needed to cut some small squares of glass to repair an outdoor lantern. Glass is pretty cheap, and I did ruin a few pieces. But after a little practice, you will find that this does the job. I did not use the round end at all. In fact, when I tapped with that I just cracked the glass. I found out that just putting on some good gloves, and bending the glass worked perfect. As far as pressure, that is where the practice comes in. But make only ONE pass, and not too hard. You will be good to go.",
