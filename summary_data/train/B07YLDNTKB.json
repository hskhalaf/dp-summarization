The controller works great, and feels good, but the battery life is awful. I could get a couple weeks of casual play out of a Xbone controller, with Enloops. The PS4 controller wanted a recharge after about 2 hours of use. Good machine that I am happy with overall.",

I definitely recommend others to order their PS4 here if they are having trouble buying one since a lot of people are ordering consoles during this time. Quick and good shipping and packaging!",
