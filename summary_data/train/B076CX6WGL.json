This one is USB-c so it seems to do a lot better. The phone is still quick and has everything I need. If you're looking at this phone in 2019 you probably already know that you want it because of the screen or some other specific feature, go ahead and buy it.",

The phone died after 6 months (screen failed). It took me approx 3 hours on the phone, and several emails over 10 days with Asurion to convince them that I purchased the warranty, then that the product had actually failed. Not only can they not get me a replacement phone, I can't even get a refund of my money! Their idea of a full refund is an Amazon gift card...if only my local grocery store took them as cash. Lesson learned, I won't anything that requires an asurion warranty again.",

For the price I don't think there's many options with a snapdragon 835. But all of that comes with one huge deal breaker,... the unbreakable screen. It won't shatter but that's because it's made of a soft plastic that scratches very easily, even a fingernail can scratch it and the top layer can start peeling off over time from normal wear and tear. So imo the shatterproof screen is a big down side and a deal breaker.",
