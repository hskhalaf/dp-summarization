The zipper is sealed and with the flap securely closed I don\u2019t believe any water could get it. The outer skin feels a bit like a silicone breaking sheet, I thought about testing the fireproofing but it looks to good to mess with. It does come with a paper report from some kind of testing. I\u2019m not entirely sure what it means but I\u2019d bet it\u2019s something to do with it\u2019s fireproof rating.",

It isn't just a regular bag, the texture of the outside is almost waxy. This bag definitely was what I expected it to be. As far as organizing your things inside, there aren't any pockets or folders or anything so you have to put something in there if you want something a little more organized but there is a lot of room so that isn't an issue.",
