I emailed SS Premier and immediately got a replacement lid without any problems. - The grinder is quieter compared to the Butterfly model - The grinder is more efficient and able to grind in 25 to 30 minutes Dosa batter (enough for 8 persons) what would take 40-45 minutes with Butterfly for the same consistency. When new the Butterfly grinder would take about 35 minutes.",
