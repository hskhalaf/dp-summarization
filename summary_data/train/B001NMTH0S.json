The only negative is that the arms, when fully extended for use with 12' board, tend to sag a bit more. The issue with the cable causing the lift to drop while raising a board is avoidable if you pay attention to the cable while raising/lowering the lift. I used my hand to guide it so it wouldn't stack on itself while raising and had no problem whatsoever.",

With the Sheetrock on top of the system, it has plenty of \"give\" to handle the sheet hanging on one side (like grabbing underneath an electrical box or wire on the way up), so you just maneuver it a bit to unhang and keep on going up. It's also very easy to roll around, and every component swivels 360 degrees, plus there's a brake system for the wheels.",

Before doing the drywall, needed a way to get bundles of rock wool insulation into the attic. Tried doing this on a ladder. Wasn't happening. Thought of putting a piece of plywood on this and then raising the insulation bundle on that. Worked like a charm. After that, needed to put up the vapour barrier.

If you get ahead of the game and keep the pulleys heavily lubed, you should not be bothered by this shortcoming. That's the only reason we did not give it 5 stars.",

      "text": "We bought this when we were ready to hang wallboard in a new garage studio building. It worked very well, my husband and I were able to do 10' ceilings ourselves. The lift worked very well, we never has any issues with it and were able to use it when we put an addition on the house. We have gotten a lot of use out of it and it still works as well as it did on day one. Being 5'2\", it was nice to just be that helping hand to help put a sheet of material on the lift. Highly recommended. Buying cost a fraction of renting and we will sell it when we finish our last project",

The hardest part of the job was lifting the sheets onto the lift, after that, hanging them both on the ceiling and walls was a breeze! Assembling it was really easy too, it was completely assembled, just broken down into three pieces and folded up. I would definitely recommend this lift!",
