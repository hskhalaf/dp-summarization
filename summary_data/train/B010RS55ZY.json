      "text": "Love these sneakers! They are super fly and were so comfy from the get go! I felt they really helped my running game (i do only run on the treadmill less than 10 miles a week) It did take a couple uses for me to break them in but I felt like it was much quicker than my last pair of sneakers. The sneakers felt so supportive and I have a high arch and I felt they really helped with that. I would definitely recommend these.",

They are kind of narrow though so if you have wide feet they probably wouldn't be that comfortable. I think they are very comfortable and pretty.",
