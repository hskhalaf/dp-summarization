We also have a chihuahua with separation anxiety and they work like a charm on her as well. We were about to put them both on medication and didn\u2019t want to do that. My trainer recommended rescue remedy and we are so glad he did. Amazing product highly recommend.",

I don't think it's a fix but it could help them a little bit and make their life a little easier, I have no experience using this with any animals other than parrots.",
