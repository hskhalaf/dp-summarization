      "text": "When my 25-year-old bench-top Craftsman saw (10\") finally died (burnt out bearings), I researched all the current crop of portable saws. I was leery of going with the 8-1/4\" bladed saw, but now I couldn't be happier. The DeWalt is stable, powerful, and accurate. The rack-and-pinion fence adjustment is rock-solid and the integrated measurement bar is accurate enough for 95% of all my work. Only when I needed things cut to less than 1/32 accuracy did I need to micro-adjust with a measuring stick. The smaller blade size never caused difficulty and indeed, it allows for higher RPMs, meaning a cleaner cut through most material.",

It doesn't allow use of dado blades, but for me that's a minor issue. As with any compact table saw, you definitely need an extension table when working with larger pieces.

The saw is at 90 degrees, parallel to the miter slot, fence is also parallel to the miter slot (I use a digital gauge) and even checked the axis of the blade but still, I get the same issue. Is it possible that the blade itself is bent (doesn't look like) or the fence is moving or bent while cutting? I paid attention to my gestures to make sure I follow the fence. Any advice would be very appreciated. I am a beginner and very confused with the table saw. Thank you",

This is so the saw is very stable but it takes a lot of room. I am going to make a stationary stand in my shop for it and remove it from the rolling stand. Don't get me wrong, the rolling stand is great and I will keep it for moving the saw outside on occasion. I love that all the accessories are stored on the saw. Good distance from front of the saw to the blade too. For a portable table saw, this is the bomb!",

Only thing I would change is to make the table out of steel instead of aluminum so magnetic attachments can be used.",

One negative is the instructions on how to use some of the features. It took way too long to figure things out.",
