After using this mirror for a few days/weeks it was apparent to me that the image was undistirted to my eye.",

      "text": "I love that the hanging bracket and design allows the mirror to be flush against the wall. However, the first time I cleaned it before installing it, the top edge of the bottom frame caught bits of my towel, which fell into the opening between the mirror and channel frame. Since I haven\u2019t been able to figure how to remove them, I wish I would have returned it. It\u2019s unfortunate because they\u2019re reflected by the mirror and look like fuzzballs. If it weren\u2019t for that, I\u2019d highly recommend it for a home application, since it\u2019s nicer than Pottery Barn or RH offerings in other ways.",
