As a nail technician, we tend to need alot of things on the desk for each appointment including a nail lamp, overhead lighting lamp, nail products like gel, acrylic, implements and tools at the least. However I make it work and it will do for now. I like that is has wheels and it's portable for those of us who do mobile services as well. It's very easy to fold and unfold and packs well in small spaces.",
