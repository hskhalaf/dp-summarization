Costs a bit more but appears it is better made. I bought this a month in advance of beach trip so can't return it either. Would appreciate if the seller could send a replacement wheel.",

Those with the wagons had to pull wagons and had chairs falling out and difficulty positioning the umbrellas. However, with our cart, we had no problem and everything fit on this one cart. No regrets and would definitely buy again but I think we will order some better tires.",

The front wheels on this new one do not rotate like they should, making it extremely difficult to maneuver. 2.) The back wheels squeak and squeal very loudly. 3.) When loaded with chairs, the fold-down bar that holds them sinks past the plastic pieces that are supposed to stop it from drooping too low. This causes the chairs to either hit the front wheels or graze the ground. I don't recommend this cart to anyone, and I really wish we could get a refund.",

One of the back wheels is separating along the seam (it's a hard plastic wheel, not rubber) and I just realized I lost one of the \"tires\" from the front wheel so it's now lopsided and more difficult to push.

The large wheels managed the sand in South Carolina very well, but I would imagine it might be a bit more of a struggle if the sand isn't quite so packed.

It rolls easy and you just need to remember to pull when you are in the sand instead of push. Our grandkids will be visiting up soon and it will carry all our supplies and theirs as well.",

Being tall I find the handle to short so it makes it harder to pull.",
