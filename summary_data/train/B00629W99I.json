Has a great finger Guard, Varry durable easy to sharpen and clean I have had this knife for a year and haven't put any oil on it and the knife don't have any rust on it. The sheath is bulky but works nice and has a plastic piece inside the sheath so the knife don't cut through, extra pocket for a flashlight little knife or little first aid kit, got clamps to tighten around thigh, good stitching overall an amazing knife and at a beautiful price.",

This knife is both thick and full tang as well as down right wicked looking. The sheath is nylon with an inner plastic blade guard to keep it from tearing up the sheath every time you draw it. The thigh strap is adjustable and clips easily together to keep it from flopping around when you\u2019re knees to chesting it. It\u2019s easy to draw and easy to clean and can easily be attached to any MOLLE webbing. You\u2019re definitely gonna enjoy this knife I know I do.",

Blade length is a full 6\" which makes it legally a Bowie knife and a permit would be needed to carry in Georgia. Comes w/ a drop down leg holster and leg straps. Also has extra compartment in front of leg sheath for acces. like a sharpening stone. Made in China (which i'm not wild about) but appears study, strong and durable. I like the gold colored blade which is a good offset to the black handle. Good weight, and balance to it.",

Handle edges are sharp and require some sanding to be comfortable, but due to other reviewers, I realized that in advance. I have not studied the quality of the sheath, though other posts highlighted what I deem unrealistic expectations for a $30 knife. My recommendation: Focus on the knife, not the accessories. You can buy another sheath for cost savings. Can't speak to the quality of the edge as of yet.",

I guess I can find a way to jury-rig the lashing so it will fit. I didn\u2019t buy the knife for the sheath anyway. That\u2019s just an added bonus.

Of course I did my research before I bought this gem. I have seen videos on Youtube of this knife chopping and batoning as well as slicing and piercing. All very impressive. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this knife to anyone interested in a quality tactical/survival knife at a budget price.",

Quality, heavy steel, full tang design and a solid contoured handle is what you want in a good tactical blade. There's an abundance of great reviews already written, so I won't burn up your time with my song, other that to say, \"Great Knife, Great Price and Great Service from Amazon\". Buy this bad boy...you won't be disappointed. I'm about to buy two more, for my son and nephew. Thank You, MTech and Thank You, Amazon! I love this knife as much as my K-Bar!

The sheath has some poor stitching though, and we we're required to re-sew several areas including the belt loop. The leg wrap also is far to small for almost any adult we've tried to tie it around. Honestly as this is a weapon that I carry on me daily the sheath is the only draw back, I truly wish the company would have maintained the same production level across the board.",

I would recommend a moderate angle sharpening, followed by a fine sharpening. Overall, for the price, it appears to be a decent tactical, camping knife.

      "text": "mtech xtreme feels like a good knife for the price. it feels sturdy and has a good feel to it. the only reason i did not rate 5 is because the top part that looks like a saw to saw a tree branch or something is completely useless. Overall it looks sharp out of the box but would recommend to sharpen it yourself to get it really sharp and maybe if your good enough you can sharpen the saw part of it",

Seems pretty sharp, though that is not that big a concern. I'd rather receive a good knife I need to put a better edge on than a junk knife that's sharp out of the box.",

Please don't go cutting people up. Quality is questionable. I bet it'd break on me if I used it for chopping and stuff. For $30 and made in China, you get what you pay for.",
