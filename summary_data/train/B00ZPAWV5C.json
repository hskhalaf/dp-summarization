But not too soft. The reason for the 1 star shortfall is because the only thing holding the wheel on is the grips. So they can somewhat move off a bit as you see in the pics. Not so sure how others hold the wheel on but on this if the grips go bad there's nothing to hold it centered. Just fyi.",

It takes some getting used to... start slowly and gradually work your way farther in subsequent reps/series (you'll feel the pull, so pay attention and roll back before you hurt yourself). Even with less than half a minute's worth of reps, you can feel the burn if you're using your abs to keep yourself from going too far and to pull back. Other supporting muscles get some work too, like the forearms, triceps, shoulders, lats, quads, and hamstrings. I give this a high thumbs up. The 5th star would require a thicker, better-padded knee rest, but that's a bit nit-picky of me.",

      "text": "This is a very sturdy product and it is great that it comes with a knee mat as well so that it can be used pretty much anywhere. You assemble the device by sliding the metal bar through the hole in the center of the wheel. There is a rubberized sleeve already on one half of the bar and you have to slide on the other rubberized sleeve which effectively locks the bar in place. I have to say it was extremely difficult to get this second sleeve on.This makes it difficult if you want to dismantle the wheel and pack it in luggage if you go away.",

And I wasn't sure what to expect with the added e-books, but they are definitely a very nice free addition! The only thing to be aware of is assembly\u2014it was very challenging to get the handle padding on (just takes some perseverance and patience).",

Assembly is literally one step. The knee mat is handy as well. I havent used an ab roller with curved handles but i can see how that would be helpful. After doing a few reps you might feel a strain on your wrists and shoulders (due to the nature of the exercise), but that could very easily just be because i am new to the workout and need to develop strength in these areas. If you have any shoulder injuries stay away from this exercise.",

This sometimes causes a faint squeaking noise reminiscent of styrofoam or fingernails on a chalkboard, which is unpleasant. I'm normally blasting music when I exercise so not a huge issue.

I am still sore the next day, but I am getting stronger. Best of all, I feel more in control of my body now that my muscles are getting stronger which gives me confidence in all other parts of my daily routine.",
