      "title": "Great voice quality - lower than expected lifespan",
      "text": "This is the U.S version. I just returned another one of these to a vendor from Amazon because they sent me the European version. The differences have to do with wavelength and the languages and dialects. The functional quality is very good, in my opinion, both inside and outside. The quality of the lifespan probably isn't, though. My first one lasted about two years, then died. From reading about this product, lifespan seems to be an issue. I use it a lot for work, so even if it has a shorter than expected lifespan, the voice quality and comfort make up for it.",

I have had at least 20 different headsets and none come close to the voyager Edge. Well worth the extra cost above other headsets. I use my phone in my business daily and I have never had anyone say, \"It sounds like you are in a well!\"",

      "text": "The Edge started out great. However, it is not durable. Each of the three I've owned has had the same problem, the mic gets faint and the other party cannot hear you. Don't buy this model... instead look at the Voyager Focus UC which is binaural and does both mobile and laptop is awesome... it also cancels ambient noise beautifully making it very quiet even if you're not on the phone or listening to music. And speaking of music, the fidelity is excellent on the Voyager Focus. But unlike the Edge, you can't drop it in your pocket... its only limitation.",
