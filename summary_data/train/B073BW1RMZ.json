The clubs look and feel just like a small version of grandpa's real PING set (I'm grandpa), with a very \"pro\" looking mallet putter too. The bag is more than adequate for my little guy to carry around as we practice together. These are a good value if you have a little one that wants to go the range with you. Bring some wiffle or foam balls along for them to start with, and you're all set.",

They look like a set of golf clubs instead of cheap plastic ones and are indeed golf clubs for beginners. They will last her a couple of years. The bag is the weak link, but we can live with that. Price is good too, as we spent time looking around. I would recommend them.",

He\u2019s younger but about the size of a 3 year old and I thought the plastic beginner sets wouldn\u2019t survive his surprisingly strong swing (and I was worried about the dogs chewing them). Although it was hard to pay more money, it was well worth it. They are a great set and have survived a strong little boy, his dogs, his older siblings and a nice in the rain. I\u2019d buy them again... and honestly probably will.",
