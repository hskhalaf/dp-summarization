It's very difficult to properly place the rubber pads securely under this rail .It makes the lift chair leaning to one side. So I put spacers under the other side of the rail of the lift chair.",

Though we did have a little problem setting it up under her recliner because the recliner doesn't have individual feet like the picture shows and the depth of the seat is shorter than the shortest length of the base, we were able to make it stable enough that it is an asset for her.",
