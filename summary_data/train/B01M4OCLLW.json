I love the blue lenses and the white, gold tone frame. The shape of the lens is what I love most. There not to long to hit my cheeks when I smile or talk. The arms don\u2019t curve down too much around the ear, so no discomfort after hours of wear. The case is nice sized to keep in your handbag. I also need to mention, the lens color does not distract your vision to see clearly, drive ect. I will be rocking the beach all summer in these beauties",
