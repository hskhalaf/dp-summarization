The fireplace screen adds needed weight making it near impossible for her to push through or crawl under. We have installed clips on either side of the door to prevent it from falling & hurting any kitties. Since the screen is covered in mesh its the perfect cat gate! We get fresh air and don\u2019t have to worry about \u2018escape artist\u2019 kitty sneaking out and getting run over by cars or eaten by bears.",

I read reviews of rust on the screens from previous reviewers. There was rust \"dust\" on a few edges, but had nothing to do with the screens rusting. Had to simply wipe off the dust. Vendor should do a better job of keeping their packaging area clean. We love our screens almost as much as our National Championship LSU Tigers. Geaux Tigers!!",

The first one I got had a broken hinge upon arrival, probably through shipping, but the second one works. I am sure that with a hard fall or two on my floor the hinge could very well break again. I would recommend but durability is definitely questionable. If you have kids or pets who might knock it over perhaps look for something else. Otherwise go ahead and get it!",
