That's a lot of weight and it does the hob perfectly. It's strong, durable and dependable. Get one if you plan to use it on a snowy hill. It should last a lifetime",

However, a big storm blew through here Weds (1/17/18) and we finally got to use them. They're light, pretty sturdy and move like lightning. My only complaint is they are a bit narrow so they are very tippy. Makes for an interesting ride and fun wipe outs, but I would prefer to stay upright until the end of my run. I'm going to look for some sleds that are a bit wider in the rear for next year and hope we get another good snow.",
