The liners are very reasonable they're a little harder to find in department stores but they're very worth it especially considering the fact that I can get them on Amazon. I highly recommend the subscribe and save. They're very durable they block the scent and they don't break the bank I've been using my. Munchkin pails for about seven years now and they haven't failed me yet! It was an excellent purchase!",

For me the answer is yes, because it's too hot/cold/muggy/whatever outside and I'm lazy and I hate the smell of old poop. I've heard you can DIY makeshift bags from regular trash bags, but that defeats the purpose of a product that only exists to eliminate the daily 2 minute walk from baby's room to the outside bin. Just buy these and embrace your laziness. Or use those extra 2 minutes per day to do something nice for yourself, mama. You deserve it.",

This means that the diaper pail seriously stinks well before the time that the bag is full and needs to be changed. Also, as noted by so many others, these bags consistently rip along the seams as they fill up, resulting in a very frustrating situation to say the least. Avoid this product.",
