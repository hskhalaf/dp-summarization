      "text": "I used this money belt on a recent trip to Italy and it met all of my needs as it had enough space to hold two passports, a couple of credit cards and cash. The belt was very slim so it didn't show through my clothing, it was comfortable and the elastic band retained its elasticity. I would definitely recommend this money below. One last comment - I wrapped the elastic band around one of my belt loops so that even if somebody had been able to disconnect the belt's latch the belt would not have been able to be removed as I would have felt it being pulled upon.",

My fiance had his under all his clothing. I kept only money in mine. He kept passport, money and credit cards in his. We'd take them off and put them right into the safe in our hotel room. Perfect!",

This slim product would be ideal for a single traveler - one passport and cash to discreetly wrap on your waist under your shirt and partially under your shorts/pants. Due to the slim design, I would sometimes have to check if it was still there, good from a comfort perspective, a little worrisome from a security perspective.",

My only concerns were with the pockets for storing cards (on the inside of the zipper pockets). They felt loose when I put my cards in the pockets and I had to be very aware when I took my passport out that I did not accidentally knock my cards out as well.",

I've seen others post that it broke on them and I see why, the \"grabbing fingers\" are small and curved in such a way that could easily catch or be stressed. Not looking forward to that, but I will replace it when it does. For now, it's a great value and got much use on my travels.",
