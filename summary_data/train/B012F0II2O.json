      "text": "We ordered four of these in stainless for a remodel. We got two oil rubbed bronze and two stainless. One of the stainless's spout was out of square and looked like it happened in the manufacturing process. The one remaining one had a good feel to it but had some very sharp edges in the spout itself and I worried that someone would cut a finger on it. One of the popup drains had scuff marks on it as well. I didn't open the other three it investigate those. Unfortunately they aren't what we thought they would be and I'm sending all four back tomorrow.",
