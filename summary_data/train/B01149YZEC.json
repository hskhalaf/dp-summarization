This does not seem to be the case with this one. I purchased two separately although I wish they had a deal for a 2pack, that would be great! Nonetheless, this has fared well so far, no signs of rust yet with this lock but will update in the future!",

For example, if 0000 is the combination aligned on the side then 3333 --in the sample above-- shows on the front.",
