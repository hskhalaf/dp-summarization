They come with a set of black plastic frames and plano lens. I'll give them to someone to use in a play or something. At first I was a little wary of my looking like out of \"the Matrix\", but now I really like them. Not polarized, but cut glare and sun pretty well on morning commute. Also, after about two months (including two weeks overseas travel to India), they still look to be in great shape! I just pop them in my shirt pocket when going indoors.",

I read the reviews, and they made it sound like the clip on part could be removed, so I bought them. I will be returning them and getting a clip on pair of sunglasses that don't come with frames attached behind them. I am hoping this brand carries the clip ons separately, because they seem well made and the customer service is good so far. So for those who were wondering, these are not meant to be removed from the frames. They are more of a vintage fashion look. Apparently clip ons were a trend at some point.",
