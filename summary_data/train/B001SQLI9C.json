This was so much more impressive in person. It looks great against his tan skin. The hands glow at night. The time has been steady and accurate. I will update this review to 5 stars after 6 months if it is still working correctly and in good condition. **UPDATE 8 months later** This watch is still in perfect working order and still looks fantastic. The band is holding up nicely and the time is still accurate. I love it almost as much as my husband!",

The packaging does not look like the advertised product. There is a 4 paged cheap booklet inside. It was packaged in a Christmas tin. The watch is set in a hard, beige coloured recycled paper. The watch is very handsome, as advertised. I just wish it worked.I am awaiting a reasonable resolution from this seller. One month later..... Situation is resloved and I am very happy. Got back a new watch. .....and YES the watch is authentic. Just defective.",

The only negative is that it is a little hard to read even though the display is big during daylight as the colors and finishes kind of blend together. Also the hands are not illuminating in the dark. I thought they were supposed to be activated by the sun. But maybe its Seattle, it is sunny here now, but me, I avoid the sun a little so that might be it.",

Prior to me purchasing this I did see a review that stated that the leather WAS NOT black. I pondered this and took a chance. Well... it is true. It's a dark brown that perhaps from a distance shows as black. I was dissapointed that FOSSIL would say that it's Black Leather. C'mon people. We know our colors. It's an obvious dark brown and there's no doubt about it. I don't trust purchasing leather strap watches on-line now due to this. I'd rather go to Dadeland Mall where they do have a FOSSIL store and see it at first glance.",
