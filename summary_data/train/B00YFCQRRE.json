I would have even been happy with Red, White, and Blue, because at least that gives the red a purpose. Regardless, my spice racks are filled (with regular sized bottled), saving me much room in the limited cabinet space I have, and equally important they are quick and easy to access.",

The strips would probably stay up without screws, but would rather not chance it. There's no adjusting once the sticky strip hits the surface. Tried the screws provided and they seemed a bit of overkill , so I used shorter ones and had an easier time of it. The way the holes in the strips are placed makes the screwing in a bit awkward, especially if you're doing it manually. A variety of jar styles fit quite easily. The plastic seems sturdy, but the strips have been in place for only a month, so we'll see.",

If you follow the instructions about how to install them (clean the cabinet door first and then wait 24 hours before hanging something on them), you will have no problem with them coming undone.

Update 6/26/16 -- Now the jars won't stay in the clips at all .. once they are sprung open, they won't return to their original shape and the slightest touch causes the jars to fall ... What a mess now getting them all taken down and replacing them with something better.",
