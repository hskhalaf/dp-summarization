I plan on using daily to commute to work 5 miles one way (100% flat asphalt), be healthy and reduce my carbon footprint. I am 5'9\" with ~33\" inseam, the 54 cm is a perfect fit.

Additionally, I'm really disappointed with how poor the rim strips are, as well the brake pads. I want to replace the tires, rim strips, and brake pads because of how terrible they all are. Because of the good rating of this bike on amazon, I was happy to spend over $300 on this, but now I have severe buyer's remorse. Perhaps Pure Fix will see this review and accommodate me, but I've had such bad experiences with most bike companies' customer service that I'm skeptical they will.",
