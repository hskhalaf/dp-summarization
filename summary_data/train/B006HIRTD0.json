However, this is the first automatic with the see through case back and I can tell you its mesmerizing to view the movement. The anti-reflective coating does well but there is still reflection from the metal on the hands as its is very polished. The lume coating on the hands and markers is also very impressive. Good Job Victorinox!",

After the death of his mother in 1909, Karl Elsener introduced the brand name Victoria and the iconic Cross and Shield emblem is registered as a trademark. With the advent of stainless steel, Karl Elsener coined the company\u2019s name, Victorinox, by combining his mother\u2019s name with \u201cinox\u201d, an abbreviation of the French word for rust-resistant steel, \u201cinoxydable\u201d. After World War II, the \u201cOriginal Swiss Army Knife\u201d began its successful progression around the world and enjoyed exceptional popularity. In 1989, Victorinox entered the timepiece business in the United States under the brand name \u201cSwiss Army\u201d.
