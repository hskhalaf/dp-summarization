Just not something I would gift but a great option if you are on a budget.",

It folds up nicely, there's enough room for a change of clothes and the wipes, creams, and diapers. I changed my baby on floors, in the back of my car, public bathrooms, etc, all knowing this was protecting my baby from any gross surfaces. It wipes clean, it's super cute, and it's so much easier just grabbing this little pack out of the diaper bag instead of lugging the whole bag back and forth for a diaper change.",

A month after, the inside material started breaking and ripping. As you can see in the pictures the hole is huge and I only use it couple of times a week. It was not expensive, but I expected to last at least few more months",

      "text": "I've had this changing pad for 9 months and it is already falling apart. The plastic material on the inside is breaking. Also it is not a very functional design. You can't really store bigger wipes in it, it's hard to open one handed (usually you will be holding a possibly screaming baby in the other hand), and it's pretty small. Also there's no padding so I always have to fold over the pocket side to give my baby a little cusion for her head. I'm buying another pad, and if I were you I think on this is would be worth spending a bit more for something that is better quality.",

Unfortunately, after only about a dozen real uses, it is falling apart, and I'm super disappointed in the quality. Where the handle attaches, holes are appearing, and growing rapidly. We are super careful and gentle with things, so it's definitely a quality issue. I can't honestly say I'd recommend this particular clutch.",
