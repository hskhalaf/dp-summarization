She's now 6 months old and we use these multiple times a day. They have a textured handle that makes it easy for baby to hold. The tip bends when baby dips it in the food so she can scoop from many angles- perfect for learners. They wash so easily. I have nothing bad to say about them. I recommend them to everyone and bought them as gifts this Christmas. They're that good!",

      "text": "We did baby led weaning for my son. Once he turned 1 we wanted to introduce spoons. This is not the right spoon for him. The pointed end is to bendable so items fling off once he is able to scoop them up this ending up with an empty spoon. Also, the amount of food that could be held is rather small so he gets frustrated trying to get something to stay on the small surface. This would be best if you were spoon feeding a baby but NOT for a baby learning to spoon feed themselves. It is now in his play kitchen :)",

Doing that in the presence of first foods makes a very positive association with eating. Unfortunately, they are a bit overpriced.

The grip is great and the way the spoon bends getting the food is really helpful for my babe who is learning to use utensils. Cleaning is easy and they look brand new still, even after daily use AND we've let my babe knaw on it while teething multiple times with her 4 (and now 7) teeth. We only originally bought the one pack of two to try out and now plan to buy another pack just so we don't have to wash quite as often if we're not easily able. Love!",

Feeding him with these can be a bit tricky because the tips are so flexible that he can easily flick the tip of the spoon out of his mouth and spray food across the room. They work really well as teethers, and it doesn't seem like my baby will be able to chew bits of the spoon off as his teeth come in. It's also kind of nice that they stand up on their own, although I usually just rest the spoon in the bowl anyway so there's no need to stand them up.",

It's just the right size, food doesn't go all over the place like with other spoons (where they put too much & doesn't funnel into baby's mouth). Baby can also easily hold and chew on for teething. Food does get on the stem (when resting on bowl rim) and therefore on your fingers (short handle), which gets annoying but I still rather use this spoon than longer stemmed, stiffer spoons. Have and bought several of these (easy to clean too).",

We started with these spoons with the first introduction to pure\u0301es and solids around 3-4 mos old, and baby took to them immediately.

The tip is flexible so when my daughter tries to feed herself, she doesn't gag on it. The handle is also much easier for her to hold and they are the perfect length. Other reviewers commented on an odor but there was not any kind of smell when I opened mine. I'm so glad I bit the bullet and tried them!",

Sometimes is falls off if she turns it upside down, but she usually grabs the spoon quickly and moves it to her mouth even quicker. She\u2019s nine months now, and we still use the spoons. We bought more to send to the grandparents\u2019 houses as well.",
