Very comfortable and handy, being taller I appreciate the adjustable handle bar but I don't appreciate having to buy all the accessories. With that said I love the easy assemby and folding. It fits in our small car trunk without hassle. Also I appreciate the huge canopies specially when kids are napping. Pretty pricey but worth it in my opinion. Thank you Amazon for the nice discount.",

This is by far the most versatile and my favorite out of them all. The brake is simple. The tires are awesome. The one hand fold is essential and I love it. My daughter is 3 but over 100% for height and it's been a struggle to fit her in a stroller. She doesn't ride often but occasionally does and will on our upcoming trip to universal. This stroller fits her no problem and it even fits my 8 (pictured)and 9 year olds who tried it out too. So highly recommend.",

This stroller fits perfectly through standard size doorways, handles gravel and slightly tough terrain with ease, and has amazingly large sun canopys that blocks the sun from my 3 month old twins faces perfectly! It has a suspension like frame and works wonders on my gravel drive!! Also, I love the way the backs fold down for naptime and how the stroller itself folds with one quick pull!! Great stroller and definite must have for busy moms!!",

The seat material is also very nice. The cons are that the basket holds a bunch but isn\u2019t the easiest to access for diaper bags or bulky items. Also, the most upright position is still a bit relaxed and I had to buy the snack tray so my child could safely sit forward and hold onto something still buckled. We will be keeping this stroller, I just wish for the price they could fix at least one of the two issues.",

I did purchase one tray for my toddler, but didn't realize you had to buy the belly bar in order to attach the tray, so I had to purchase that after the fact. also purchased an amazing stroller organizer for the handlebar. Fits perfect and has wonderful compartments for necessities and insulated drink holders. It's an \"Ethan and Emma\" stroller organizer.",

This is a must if you like going on regular walks with your baby. The only drawback for me is that the wheel base is wider than the handlebar. This has misled me many times in judging spaces when maneuvering it, leading me to accidentally brush the wheel against a store shelf amongst other objects. This has caused me to stumble and be slightly embarrassed! I still love the stroller though!",

I am hard to please and get easily frustrated with poorly executed design. So far, I've only found one flaw: when a Maxi Cosi car seat is snapped in using the adapters, the other seat's canopy does not open or close well. Other than that, it's a beautiful stroller and I am very satisfied.",

We bought three different strollers and this was the best. I knew with the first use that it was a keeper. Drives well, even on gravel as long as the front wheel is locked. The only dislike is that it wants to tip over easy if turned too quickly. But that is remedied by the user being more aware of what they're doing. Hopefully once the baby is big enough to be out of carseat with use it will not happen.",
