      "title": "Same problem!!!",
      "text": "I had this faucet installed in February 2017. Like another review on Amazon the hot water valve was not as strong (pressure) as the Cold Water Valve, Last week it stopped working completely. After calling a plumber, he checked the hot water line to the tub and everything was fine. He had no idea what the problem was. The problem was the faucet. After reinstalling the faucet the pressure was just slightly better. This morning dead, with water just a trickle, again. This is turning into an expensive situation. Another type of faucet to be ordered. Another plumber appointment to install a new faucet. (Parts for this faucet apparently are unavailable after some research) Buyer beware. .",

We have been to hardware store after hardware store, had tons of advice, and tried everything to connect this fixture to our water supply lines but can't get them to seal properly. It's a great fixture but we need help. It shouldn't be this hard. :( ***UPDATE: After going to four stores and thankfully, a plumbing store, I was referred to a local hardware store that the plumbing store had heard had clawfoot tub supplies. They had the proper connections!!! Geez, that was a long time coming!!!",

I do wish that you could rotate the handles so that the labels could always show how you want.My cold and hot water valves are on opposite sides than the norm so the labels are turned around. We were able to make some other adjustments to remedy that a little (adjusted the on/off positioning) but turning the labels around would have been ideal. The faucet is smooth and easy to turn on and it opens full with a quarter turn - just great!",
