There is a massive problem though when you enable freesync ultimate in the menu, most applications are fine but certain applications when in full screen make the screen flicker, so much so that I had to return this monitor. Also the stand felt loose without any means of tightening in as its a sealed unit meaning the screen wobbles from side to side. Gutted really as my search for a new monitor continues.",

It's almost like the stand is loose but you cant get to it as its enclosed in the monitor. Bad build design but awesome monitor. After having this monitor for almost 8 months now I have now wall mounted it with a Ergotron Arm, This got rid of the tilt to the left and looks fantastic hovering above my desk! I can highly recommend this monitor",
