Completely unnecessary and not something I will give my one year old, she should not have any processed sugar so young and definitely not at bedtime.

Great squeezed over plain yogurt or peanut butter. (My daughter does insist that the word \"BABY\" be crossed out with a Sharpie before she'll take these to school :))",

Both my children love them and I am happy to let them grab them off the shelf at anytime. The nutritional value is hard to beat. The quality is excellent.",

It doesn't give him a belly ache like straight-up juice. I gave it 4 stars because they are small.",

She seems to prefer the varieties with pears in them, and I do like that is is getting some spinach and that she actually likes it! She does prefer the Peas, Broccoli, & Pear flavor, but this is also a favorite. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the smell of the mango can be pretty overpowering. I like fresh mango, but for some reason the smell of mango baby food is just awful to me! Other than that, a good product that I'll be ordering again.",
