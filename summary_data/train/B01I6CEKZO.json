And most of all, I like the straps that you can use to connect the seat to a regular chair to use as a makeshift high chair. This seat is very well designed.",

It is very stable and I use it on a variety of surfaces so she can watch me do what needs doing around the house. My only complaint is that the safety buckle in the front is very stiff and hard to undo. This makes it tempting to only use the tray to secure them, which the instructions tell you not to do.",

      "text": "Love this seat for my 4 month old to hang out in! Right now I just put a few suction toys on the tray and he loves playing with them. The only issues I have with this seat are that the middle buckle is sometimes hard to get at. Once we put him in the chair, 90% of the time he ends up sitting on the buckle so I have to dig it out from under him. Also if you happen to have long fingernails or even big hands its kinda hard to unbuckle.",

I like that the back is high and supportive for my 4 month old who can't sit up on his own yet. I also love that the tray stores underneath the seat. However, it's a little hard to buckle & unbuckle the lap straps. The middle strap is right behind the \"leg divider\" so when he's sitting in the chair, it's hard to get your fingers between the baby & the rubber to clip or unclip the buckles.",

It's incredibly easy to clean, and the tray has no metal in it, so you can just stick it in the dishwasher without worrying about any parts rusting! The tray also fits underneath the seat, which is super handy, and it comes with straps so you can connect it to a normal dining chair! Love it!",

No more balance issues. The only gripe I have is about the straps. The center strap is very difficult to access and use.",
