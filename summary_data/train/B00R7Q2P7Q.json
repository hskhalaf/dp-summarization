My daughter chewed on it a lot and was very drooly with her teething, so it\u2019s not worth causing potential harm even if it was her favorite",

My son is interested in it for only a few minutes at a time, and usually drops it for another toy. It's a good portable option for a toy, but nothing to write home about.",

The flight attendants and passengers seated near us were equally entertained. The rattle is also easy for little hands to hang on to, and our baby loves gumming it as well. We've had it for a couple of months and have not had to replace the battery. Easily one of our best toy purchases to date!",

It is great because its such a sensory experience- see changing colors with each shake, nom on the little plastic eyes (soft plastic), hear the gentle rattle shake and have control over the experience with her own hands which easy can grab it due to the thin handle. Seriously whomever designed this toy is genius. The best part is that no matter what your toy budget, this is something everyone could spring for. It's under $10 and it doesn't break the bank. It will keep your baby entertained.",

It's easier to change the color if you slightly tap the side rather just shake it. It will change if you shake it but it takes longer to change. The plastic material didn't bother me as it did some others. It's still really lightweight and some of it is rubber so it's good for teething or just sucking on it. This is definitely a toy to keep!",
