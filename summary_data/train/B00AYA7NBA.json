      "title": "Not Good w/ my MacBook",
      "text": "Tried to hook this up, via Thunderbolt to HDMI, to my MacBook Pro (circa 2012), and the picture was horrible. Fonts were fairly unreadable - at least I would not have wanted to read on this monitor for any length of time (say, over 2 minutes). Overall picture was fuzzy and certainly not HD. This appears to be a Mac to monitor problem. When I called HP, they were very helpful, but in the end it came down to that there are no drivers for the Mac, so they could not help. I did not try the VGA connection since I specifically bought this for HDMI hookup.",

Sadly, the sound Beats bar is crap...so that was disappointing but I already had speakers with a subwoofer...yet was hoping to eliminate that but this isn't even half as decent in sound....But I do love the large screen and qualify of image! Surely comparable to my Mac retina screens...so overall great!",

      "text": "Overall good monitor. Image appears clear and bright as needed. My only minor complaints are accessing some of the common front panel controls, in particular volume, require more front panel button presses than should be necessary and volume control for the built in speakers. I run this with Beats enabled and the subwoofer ( on and the audio is generally good but I find myself having to adjust the volume when playing video/audio from different sites/sources. Also, sometimes there doesn't seem to be much of a difference between volume at 10 or up to 20 making the volume setting somewhat misleading.",

They sound good while they work but every few minutes they'd produce a deafening sqawk. I had to disable them. (Using HDMI audio passthrough, volume was low but squawk was always full volume.)
