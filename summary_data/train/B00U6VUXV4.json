I recently went on a trip to Seattle and tested out the various modes. The colors come out pretty great and there's wonderful clarity on landscape mode. I love the somewhat grungy/vintage look that prints without using any of the modes as well. Super fun and great camera! P.S. When they say don't point the camera at the sun, really don't. I caught the sun in one of my photos and it was a beautiful black circle in the sky. Haha.",

I'm into photography and figured I would prefer the camera that can do more with lighting and shutter. Plus I love the look of this camera. It's simple to use and the film is easily available on Amazon. It is a bigger than I thought, but still a fun size. It comes with a strap that attaches right to the camera. I haven't been able to really dive into everything it can do just yet. But so far I love it!",

Also, once, it wouldn't print a picture, opened it & when I shut it, a imageless photo came out- upsetting since Ive taken less than 20 pics- This product doesn't come with any film either. so its going to cost you $30 more just for the film, & half your pics will come out too dark bc of the flash i mentioned earlier.",

      "text": "I love all instant cameras. I have so many. This is the first time I've tried this camera and I LOVE it. The images have just a touch of that vintage look without loosing the picture. I have the lower version of this camera and have no Idea why I didn't just get this one. I tried far away pics, med pics, different lighting and they all came out great. I read the reviews before purchasing this and knew that in macro mode the view finder would be off and it was. I don't mind that though. I will be taking this camera with me everywhere.",

      "text": "With its retro look and size it's the perfect fit for what I wanted. I love all the available options but just using it with flash alone when it's too dark (you will have to experiment to get to know it's exposure) or without flash when it's bright enough works just fine. Remembering it's a \"Polaroid\" I love the vintage looks it delivers, never expecting \"great\" quality, the vintage outcome, to me, is the great quality. Overall, I would definitely recommend this camera.",

I didn\u2019t drop it, didn\u2019t spill on it, or anything like that. The film was brand new, the battery was charged, and there was no reason for it to have stopped working the very first time using it. Unfortunately, I think I\u2019ve waited too long to post about this but I just wanted to warn others of this blinking display issue where the camera just stops working without cause. Very disappointing considering what I paid for it.",

I was wary of repurchasing it as it is clear there is a design/manufacturing issue that has not been addressed; rather continued production of a faulty product. Such a shame.",
