While advertised as an under-eye illuminator, it's really a heavy duty-concealer that can be used for under-eye dark circles or blemishes. My only caution is that it's easy to cross the line from the \"natural look\" to looking like your'e wearing foundation if you apply it liberally. However, it has great staying power and really gets the job done. I'm very pleased with the quality and efficacy for the price. I could easily see the tube lasting me for 4 months or more.",
