It is made of engineered mesh with foam-backed side panels. It has pretty effective traction and Micro G cushioning setups. Those who take basketball seriously will surely appreciate the goodness that this shoe offers.",

        "The full-length Micro G foam provides a lot of impact protection and court feel according to some wearers",
        "UA\u2019s HOVR-equipped basketball shoes (e.g",
        "UA Curry 6 and HOVR Havoc) reportedly offer a similar cushioning experience",
