The thermostat is on the main floor so it fails to turn on the air conditioning. Having a thermostat that has multiple sensors has made all of the difference. Switching sensors from main floor to upstairs a half an hour before bedtime is wonderful. The whole family has commented on how much more comfortable the house is. Have recommended it to neighbors and friends who have a two story home. Will purchase again if I move to another multi story home.",

The Ecobee does an amazing job of making our home comfortable. And now that the price has been reduced, it made me pull the trigger. Installation was easy and everything worked out of the box.

After you vacate the room, a short period of time later the sensor will report back that the room is unoccupied and the thermostat will adjust accordingly.

      "text": "I would have given this product four stars if not for a difficult installation. The thermostat requires a connection to household power (common). If no common connection is available a special adapter is provided, but must be installed at the location of the furnace which, for my house, is hard to access. It seems that the Nest thermostat contains a battery and is able to power itself from the charge in the other wires. I wish this product had the same feature or provided an option for acquiring a battery. The external temperature sensors are this product's most distinguishing feature, otherwise I don't think I would buy it again considering the painful install process.",

It was a bit more difficult for me to install because I didn't have a connected blue (C) wire. After that was resoved, things went smoothly. Nice to set and forget. The app allows me to monitor temps at home from work or where ever. Customer service is great and, being Canadians, they are quite polite. Highly recommend this for automatic and web controlled temps.",

Before I had to guess what downstairs temperature needed to be set to have the right temperature upstairs. The Away feature is very nice, it reduces the usage while no one is home.",
