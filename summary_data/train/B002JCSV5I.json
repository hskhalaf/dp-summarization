      "text": "This is a great start for those who want to move to DSLR from your regular point-and-shoot cameras, like Coolpix. This doesn't have overwhelming bells and whistles like the other 4-number series or the 2-number series. This gets you used to the basics of DSLR's...like how to change a lens, lens care, body care, focal points, using a top wheel, using a thumb wheel, and answers your basic \"What does THAT button do\" questions. If you're interested in going DSLR, and want to start slow, I advise the 3000. Graduating from this will make it SO much easier when you get the camera you really want.",

If after my intro photography classes, I decided to pursue it as a long term hobby then I'll probably upgrade again...but I'm pretty sure that won't happen for awhile. I thought not having a liveview would bother me...it really doesn't make a difference to me. Overall, I'd recommend it to my \"I have a budding interest in photography\" friends.",

I do plan on getting a second battery and a 32 GB memory card. The picture quality it produces are light years ahead of my old Fujifilm.

I have taken some amazing pictures with my G9 but the D3000 certainly didn't compare to it. I was really shocked because I expected a big improvement. I tried the 3000 on auto and some scene modes but the pictures didn't appear that sharp even though I braced it more than enough for a steady shot and a lot more than I need to with the G9. All of the pictures on the D3000 were taken with the kit lens 18-55 so maybe it's just not that good on scenic pictures.",

It won't zoom too far and won't get great macro shots, but it's a nice all around lens that you won't have to change too often if you're not taking pictures at the extremes of either spectrum. Overall, very happy, Nikon won't let you down. 4/5 stars for lack of video ability.",

I recommend the 55-200mm autofocus zoom lens as a necessary accessory for outside shots (the kids play soccer). One caution, professional reviews talk about the multi-point focus providing depth of field focus for foreground and background objects. For action shots, keep your main object [kid] centered to make sure they are in focus.",

The camera is also very well manufactured. Very good quality!!! and also very comfortable while holding it. It's too much better than my friend's D60 and Canon's entry level SLR. For the lens, I don't think I really need to buy a 55-200 for it. Maybe I will buy a better camera with the lens of 18-200 together several years' later. Right now, this is enough for me!!!",

I also had a fast lens on me, so that helped. I won't say much else, because it's all been covered in the other reviews, but again, this is a great camera for beginners to get started at a low-price (relatively).",

      "text": "All of the previous review have got it spot on and could not agree more, so I will not write another. I have this for my vacation and a wedding. It is just loads of fun and not intimidating to use( being from a point-and-shoot) with the Guide mode. The kit lens is great but have its limited reach so i bought the 55-200mm VR to compliment it. During the wedding, i manage to get 2 of my cousins to switch from point-and-shoot as they were impress with the D3000 with its ease of use and quality of the pictures. I already out grew my camera bag as i add the 55-200mm and a 50mm prime in my collection.",

I also bought a Speedlight 600 to go with the D3000; the flash helps to create GREAT lighting and wonderful family photos. For the price, you can't beat the simplicity and quality of the D3000.",

I would suggest a fast sd card I have one and have not experienced the lag others have complained about. It is a great purchase for what I have used it for so far.
