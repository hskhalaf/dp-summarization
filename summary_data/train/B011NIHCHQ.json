And that's with two huskies that like to chew their bones against it grinding at the chrome all the time and driving me crazy. The faux wood top looks great, it looks very real (until you get super up close with it). It's also very sturdy, I'm 230lbs and I sit on it all the time and it doesn't budge, bend or move at all. It also has nice plastic feet that don't scratch the wood floors. For the money this is an excellent table.",

I could not be happier with the table :):)",

Very easy to put together my pre-teen Son put it together and it does not wobble but it is delicate so just take it easy while assembling it.",

It looked good after installation and was easy to put together but the top \"wood\" piece is actually a printed covering. The covering lifted in a portion of the table top and there is no way to secure it back down (maybe with super glue) unless we were to take the table apart. BUT for the price of this table, you can't be setting your expectations too high. Looks good if you don't analyze it too much!",
