      "text": "Super happy with this set given as a gift to my kiddo for Christmas. It comes completely shrink wrapped so great to give as a gift. This is far better scratch art paper than what Melissa and Doug offers. Colors are truly rainbow and vibrant. Great samples included with stickers and a small holographic sample. Lots of stylus pencils for others to draw at same time. I will buy more as gifts. Great for little artists - and I guarantee adults will get it on fun as well.",

He has spent a good amount of time creating his own drawings, writing messages, and just being an artist. The pages are big enough for multiple drawings and/or messages to fit on one page. The stickers that came along in the set were definitely young for a 12 year old boy. But free stickers are always useful for something. I honestly did not expect him to like this scratchpad as much as he does. So it was a pleasant surprise. I would definitely recommend for creative/artistic children of any age.",

They enjoyed it and it was simple and easy to use and the adults came by to try it out too! The only thing is the amount of black scratched-off stuff that collected next to the kids, but that is to be expected. It's still one of the cleanest art items that we have and can whip it out in the car or restaurant without creating a large mess.",
