Time to install said 45 min which wasn\u2019t true - took about 3 hours total with the 6 stools. My husband and daughter worked on the table and I did the stools. Some tight corners with the table so my daughter\u2019s smaller hands were useful.",

This furniture will not hold up in direct sunlight at all. This set started to come apart in the first month. Where the glass sits on the table was completely disintegrated within three months.
