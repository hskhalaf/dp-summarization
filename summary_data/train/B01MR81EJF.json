Luckily we were out there with him and quickly got him inside the house. The plastic connectors are not rugged enough.

This often causes the chest strap to shift forward and undercut the front armpits of the dogs front legs, making for a very uncomfortable fit. THIS harness, has a fixed angle on the front vs chest strap, completely alleviating that potential source of irritation. I would suspect this is more of an issue with short hair dogs, as the hair length does nothing to retain the position of the straps, but this one, does not exhibit those shortcomings of alternative harnesses.",

They are well made and it works easily to go from taking a walk to clicking them in the backseat of the car with the dog seatbelt. Highly recommend these harnesses!",

      "text": "The size chart says that a small harness fits 17-22 inch chest. I measured my dog's chest as 18 inches, but this harness is HUGE on her. I have adjusted it to its tightest setting, and it will do for now, but if she had a 17\" chest this would be inappropriate for her size. I can fit at least two hands between the strap and her body with room to spare. It does seem comfortable for her but because it is too large it kind of swivels to the side a lot. I would suggest if your dog is falling on the lower end of the size chart to get the next size down.",

Love how the harness snaps around neck and waist, so is fast and easy to put on. And looks good on my dog, and functions great (wear and walking).

What a wonderful individual and company. I recommend this company and will refer my friends to the site that have pets.",

Very frustrating. He has such a small head that I can't just snap a leash onto his collar. He pulls it right off. Apparently his head is smaller than the circumference of his neck.",

However, the cons we have found is while the straps can all be shortened they won\u2019t stay shortened so there is not enough traction or teeth in the plastic to keep straps from loosening up. Also where the handle is on the top of the harness we noticed our puppy constantly scratches and it due to the metal links that dig into the dog from the underside even though there is cloth covering the metal, you can feel it pushing through the cloth and it is hitting up against the dogs back.",
