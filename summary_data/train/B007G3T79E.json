      "text": "We bought this saxophone for my 11 year old and he is extremely happy with the quality of the saxophone but what I am most impressed is with K-Digital customer services, professionalism and trustworthiness. We had an unfortunate experience when we first received the saxophone and regardless of the situation K-Digital was able to revert it spending additional costs and going above and beyond expectations. The combination of buying a Yamaha and K-Digital was amazing but I strongly recommend any purchase to K-Digital as you will be 100% satisfied. Suppliers as honorable as K-Digital are rear.",

      "text": "This saxophone is excellent for the beginning student. However, there was no neck strap included and young players must use a neck strap to help hold the instrument. Although the product description did not mention a neck strap, parents of beginning players would assume that all necessary materials for the first lesson were included. It would be unfortunate for a student to not be able to participate in the first music lesson because of the absence of the neck strap. For this reason I gave the product 4 out of 5 stars. Product arrived well packaged and in a timely manner.",
