We tried a few 360 cameras that were inexpensive and they were disappointing. Most cameras beyond this were pushing out out of budget. This camera has great support for post production and that may be its best feature. There are some seams in the video but we set it up to work for us, made some adjustments in post, and the client was very happy with the end product. We're really happy with the choice and have zero regrets",

Since June of 2017 I have been trying to work with Garmin to get bluetooth audio to work. I have a trail of emails over the last nine months where I was promised the problem would be fixed ASAP, with the last one being recieved today 2/13/2017. I have repeatedly asked Garmin to buy the Camera back if they are not going to fix the issue, and of course they have refused. It states plainly in the manual that bluetooth audio capture should work , but yet it doesn't.",

So I returned the product and I ordared a new one ... whoever , I found the same problem in the new camera when I receive it ... so the only thing I can say about it it is very low quality product and I don\u2019t recommend or advise any one to buy it !!",

I\u2019ve preformed multiple factory resets, reformatted the SD card, and have done everything I know to get this to pair with my phone and it will not work. Only works about a third of the time. We use this for work to take progress photos. I am really disappointed with this product. When it actually works it\u2019s amazing... but it doesn\u2019t work so... I wish I could still return this.",

If you are going to use it in low light use the pro tune settings in the app for your phone. The software for the mac book pro is no good. All messed up. So don't even try to use it till Garmin updates it. Mounts are standard, battery is good for about an hour. Very happy with it, just needs to have the editing software updated.",

You can relive every experience in VR or create a multi angle movie as if you had multiple cameras mounted. Hands down an amazing product.",

The rest goes downhill. The software is buggy, connection to the mobile app is slow and sometimes doesn't work. The camera advertises 5.7k with 4k stitched in camera. It delivers on the 4k very well, but overheats going for 5.7k. The mobile app and desktop software will get better, but right now they are kinda poor and tarnish the excellent hardware.",
