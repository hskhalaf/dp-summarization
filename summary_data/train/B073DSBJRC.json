You can also purchase natural dish soap that would be fine for the environment to take on the trip.",

I would advise spraying the pans or coating them before cooking, the eggs I made really stuck even when using butter on them bottom. I also used them on an over the fire grate, they worked however I do not recommend this, the handles started to turn brown, they didn't melt.",
