There is always a smear of black ink somewhere and images often come out with lines and gaps all over the place. I only use the epson ink and the printer has been in the same spot - never moved or broken in any way - still it has never been a good printer. It also runs out of ink CONSTANTLY and I only print 1-10 pages a week with only 2-3 being color. Today I ordered an HP and this printer is going to be recycled into something better, hopefully!.",

      "text": "I chose this printer after talking with Epson's technical service people. For those who want to print in color, it is the top choice for quality (other than their commercial line over $1,000.). The main features of this printer are the new extremely small ink drop size and the fact that it uses pigment-based inks rather than dye-based inks used in the lower end of the line and almost all competitive machines. The pigment-based inks do not fade when exposed to light and are considered \"archival\". There is no need (as Consumer Reports suggests) to reprint your photos every 1 or 2 years. These prints will not fade for 200 years. That's good enough for me!",

The ink system I installed is from Ink Republic and works so good you would think you were using original cartridges. They also sell a \"head cleaning kit\" which is worth the money!

    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\nNote: If the Epson R1800 is not available in the timeframe you need, consider purchasing the R800 instead. The R800 often ships faster and has a lower price but does not support wide-format printing. \n\n The Epson Stylus Photo R1800 is the photographer's choice for large archival photos. Taking Epson's award-winning technology one step further, the printer quickly creates large, archival quality glossy and matte photos worthy of display. Experience the rich, true-to- life colors and subtle detail that's evident in every image. It's all possible with Epson UltraChrome Hi-Gloss Inks, plus an industry leading resolution and ink droplet size--the same innovative features that made the Epson Stylus Photo R800 a resounding success.\n\n \n\nEasy-to-use printer driver\n This printer's impressive eight-color individual ink system, which incorporates red and blue inks, means you get a wider color gamut for incredibly vivid photos. Its separate matte and photo black ink cartridges are integrated into the system as well, so you get the deepest, darkest blacks on matte paper, and brilliant results on glossy paper automatically. Finally, the unique gloss optimizer makes glossy prints look like they came from a traditional photo lab. And, since the inks are pigment-based, you can be confident the color and detail will remain true for up to 200 years (see www.epson.com for details).\n\n Print Directly onto CDs\nThe Epson Stylus Photo R1800 delivers studio quality results on a wide variety of media and in eight popular borderless sizes--up to 13-inches wide, as well as panoramics up to 44 inches long. Best of all, the Epson Stylus Photo R1800 speeds through every project, so you can quickly print stacks of high-quality photos. \n\n The R1800's expertise goes well beyond the art of photographic prints. This photo printer makes it easy to add that special touch to your portfolio with professional quality printing on inkjet-printable CDs and DVDs. \n\n What's in the Box\nPrinter, ink cartridges, small CD insert, printers software CD-ROM, CD position check paper, user's guide, matte sheet support, roll paper holders, single sheet guide, CD/DVD tray, FireWire IEEE1394 cable; USB cable not included",
