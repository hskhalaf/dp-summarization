Wonderful for yoga/conditioning as well. Would also be very useful for people with babies and toddlers--great coverage for the floor in case of messy accidents, learning how to walk, and even great padding for parents and grandparents to sit on \"floor\" and play with the kids and grandkids! We've only had this about 2 weeks, but the quality seems amazing so far with hours of use every day during summer break! Recommend! I would greatly appreciate it if you mark this review as helpful--thank you! :-)",

I can imagine that there could be people with some specific allergies but for an average person I think this is acceptable.. Very easy and lightweight to fold. Does not slip on a hardwood floor.

It's also used when they practice bridge work, back walkovers, baldez, cartwhells, and other skills. Combined with a 4 incher, they can do small passes with roundoffs. I bought two to create a 10x10 area. While the price is the same if you buy from the manufacturer, with Amazon, you have the potential to get free shiping which saves you hundreds. Only reason for not giving it a 5-star is that the mats don't connect well side-by-side, only length wise.",
