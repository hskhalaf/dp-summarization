A very nice CSR named Shelly emailed me and said they were sending a replacement set. Got it right away. I still like how comfortable they are and am so happy I have a working set. Nice to see a company so responsive and helpful! (Original Review: Right earbud quit working after 6 mos. of very occasional use. Comfortable tho...and easy to connect. They WERE my favorites!)",

I have another pair of bluetooth but don't use them that much because of the minimal batter life. The sound quality is pretty good. Not quite bose quality but actually not that far from it. There are numerous tips and mushroom looking things to adjust the size perfectly to fit your ear. Even running on a treadmill these stay in place and I rarely adjust them. Another great product from Anker, a brand I've grown to trust.",

After my initial review Anker sent me a second pair free of charge. Hopefully this second pair will work as expected. September 12th, 2018 update. Second pair that Anker gave me just died on me. I use this for regular running and I am guessing they are not suitable for regular exercise. Totally disappointed by this product",

I was apprehensive to try since earbuds tend to fall out during my runs but the soft clip goes over my ears and is very secure.

These were the least expensive of the headphones and i have not had any problems with them....of course I\u2019ve only had them for a month, but am already recommending them to someone. Anker was great too because the original ETA was one week; they arrived the next day! No more wires to deal with!!!",

They are incredibly affordable for Bluetooth headphones yet reproduce sounds with average fidelity, resulting in a surprisingly good sound with some distortion on the lower end. If you\u2019re looking to cut the cord at an affordable price, especially in an environment where high fidelity is optional, I recommend these headphones. Myself, I purchased my Anker Soundbuds for running, as my over-the-ear Bose were too bulky and hot. Some reviews stated a limited range, however I could get 10 m (30 ft) of separation between my iPad and Soundbuds without dropout. Pairing (and repairing) was easy as well.",
