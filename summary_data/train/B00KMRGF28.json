The slowest computer I have ever used, and it will freeze up while typing because it can't process what you are doing fast enough. If you go to a \"heavy\" webpage that requires a lot of processing power, it will freeze for minutes sometimes. It is not good at all and I wish I could return it or better ye, never bought it at all.",

      "text": "I have always went with Dell laptops - especially the Inspiron series. This laptop in particular has been going strong since 2014. It has not had even one crash, bug, or glitch with it. Nothing in this laptop has been replaced or needs to be replaced yet. The fan runs very cool which prevents it from over heating. The hardware in this laptop is adequate for the price. It is used all day for gaming (bought it for a sister) and it runs smooth and fast without any noticeable decreases during the day. It has a very strong connection strength and can connect to the router - even from outside. This is an ideal laptop for children or for family.",

      "text": "While this laptop is not going to win any awards for an awesome screen or speed, it has been a good FANLESS laptop. Over time, I've become more sensitive to PC fan noise. Since this laptop runs such a low power chipset, it is fanless and that's great. I've upgraded to 8GB of RAM and to a 250GB SSD, which makes this laptop run much better than the stock setup. The upgrade process for both was easy. If you're looking for a low cost fanless laptop that is easy to upgrade (not a chromebook), this is a good choice. By the way I run Ubuntu on this laptop with no issues.",

I would not buy this again, and am so frustrated that I am considering throwing it away. I would give it away if I could find someone tech savvy enough to figure out how to get rid of the adware and malware.",

It is not a small, compact laptop, but I won't be traveling via air often, so its size and weight is not a problem for me.

The next obstacle is the infinite login. It takes far too long to boot up. Once it appears the login is complete and you are finally ready to roll, you're not. It takes a solid ten minutes to get onto the internet, then the long delay between pages on websites. It sucks all the fun out of online shopping! This laptop is virtually useless.",
