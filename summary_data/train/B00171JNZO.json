The Mikasa ball didn\u2019t hold up long enough to be tested properly, it found a stray piece of wire on the court, which ruined the ball.

The previous volleyball was about 3 years old and had seen a lot of play so I think that these speak to the durability of the construction. The only issues with the previous ball was some nicks and cuts on the ball from being used on non-grass and sand surfaces, so can't knock the ball there. Overall a great ball and the official ball of the AVP so you can't go wrong there, and to have the ball that the pro's play with at an affordable price, I don't know why you would look at an alternative ball.",
