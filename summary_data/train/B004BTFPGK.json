I put some pictures up one has the tire size chart that shows what size tire this cable fits I highlighted my particular tire size. I also purchased a yellow spider bungee sold separately .",

Snow chains may be effective, but not as a temporary solution. They have to be put on well in advance. I think it's best to stick with snow tires and carry a shovel, just in case.",

    "title": "Quality Chain Cobra Cable Passenger Snow Traction Tire Chains (1046)",
    "description": "Size:1046Cobra passenger cable chains are made with tough, low-profile carbon steel rollers to provide traction and long wear. The low-profile of the steel rollers allows increased tire-to-road contact resulting in better stability as well as considerable noise and vibration reduction. These Cobra cable chains are designed for use on cars having minimal clearance availability and original equipment tires with high tread. They are totally galvanized for rust protection and come packed in a plastic box for easy storage. Fits Tire Sizes: 255/45-19, 245/65-15, 265/75-15, 225/70-16, 285/40-17, 235/65-17, 245/65-17, 285/30-18, 275/35-18, 285/35-18, 275/40-18, 275/45-18, 235/50-18, 235/55-18, 255/55-18, 225/60-18, 235/60-18, 225/65-18, 235/710-460, 275/35-19, 285/35-19, 275/40-19, 235/55-19, 265/35-20, 275/35-20, 245/40-20, 225/70-17, 295/50-15, 275/60-15, 235/50-19, 265/35-19, 275/30-20, 255/70-15, 245/45-19, 235/30-22, 245/30-22, 255/30-22, 225/50-19",
