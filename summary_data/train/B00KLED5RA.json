      "text": "I love this tablet. My wife has an IPAD and the screen resolution has no comparison with the Tab S. I don't deny the IPAD has a great feel when used and is better than previous versions of the Galaxy tab, but this tablet when compared with price too is an awesome bit of kit. Look and feel is great and if you are a google user and have a Samsung phone this is a must have addition. I rarely put it down.",

      "text": "Buyers beware. After months of this tablet not functioning properly it has finally kicked the bucket...not even 12 months old yet. After contacting Samsung warranty services & giving them my product serial number they informed me that it was an Asian import, therefore it is was not covered with Samsung UK warranty. I doubt this review will ever get uploaded - my previous 2 never did but if a miracle does happen then stay away from the seller 'SmartDealsLondon'. These are not genuine 'UK' versions.",

      "text": "For some reason Amazon have provided me with a Hong Kong variant without making it clear in the text of the item for sale - meaning that it has a forced Chinese keyboard and forced HongKong homepage in Chrome - crazy. I had to do a factory reset to try and get the language out of Chinese and into English when first powered on, and still get strange results in web searches with Chinese letters. Feel let down by Amazon. Great tablet, apart from that point (would give it a 5 if Amazon hadn't sent me a HK-regionalised tablet).",

    "description": "The Galaxy Tab S embodies the next evolution in mobile display technology, delivering a wider range of rich and crisp colours. Its industry-leading WQXGA (2560 x 1600, 16:10) Super AMOLED display delivers more than 90% of Adobe RGB colour coverage - expressing more colours than ever before - and has a remarkable 100000:1 contrast ratio which provides deeper and more realistic images by making blacks darker and whites brighter.\n\nThe Galaxy Tab S also features additional Samsung screen technologies that go beyond the hardware specifications. The tablet's Adaptive Display ensures the best visual experience anywhere, anytime by intelligently adjusting gamma, saturation, and sharpness based on the application being viewed, the colour temperature of the viewing environment and ambient lighting. Pre-set professional modes (AMOLED Cinema and AMOLED Photo) also lets users manually adjust the display settings for bright, dynamic results for both video and photo content.\n\nIn addition, Galaxy Tab S users can fully enjoy content clearly and easily outdoors, even in bright sunlight. The tablet's advanced outdoor visibility technology makes on-screen content look bright, natural, and easy to view.\n\nThe Galaxy Tab S is made for entertainment and comes packed with a variety of content including the debut of the Samsung magazine service, \"Papergarden\". An optimised viewing environment for digital interactive magazines, Papergarden users will be able to view a wide range of popular magazines with vivid and true-to-life colours.\n\nThrough 'Galaxy Gifts', Samsung has teamed up with more than 30 of the world's leading mobile content and service providers to offer Galaxy Tab S users the ultimate home, work, and play entertainment experience through premium content and services across a wide range of industries.\n\nBeautifully crafted and designed with architectural aesthetics, the Galaxy Tab S is modern and sleek. Extending this design identity, the Galaxy Tab S offers a choice of several fashionable and practically designed custom accessories (available separately).\n\nBOX CONTAINS\nSamsung Galaxy Tablet\nAC Adapter\nData Cable\nUser Documentation",
