I labeled the top 3 shelves with each of their names and the 4th shelf space for paperwork due the next day. I use the drawer for school supplies such as pencils, pens, glue and index cards. This desk organizer is a complete life saver and takes away a lot of my stress each school day. I just have them put their papers in their specified shelf space and grab supplies as they need them. I love it!!",

The smell still stays. and anything you put in there gets the smell on it, and it does not go away. Ruined expensive Apica Premium CD notebooks among other things. If you have zero sense of smell, this would be perfect for you. Otherwise, avoid it like the plague.",

I kept the box for return, hopefully, the gassing off of the paint or whatever will end soon. most likely I will just put it in the garage for a week or so. That typically works out okay. I do have air filter system that senses odors and comes on, this is NOT setting it off. this makes me think it's not unsafe and the odor is okay.",

There was an issue with the delivery, some parts of the product were damaged, but this is more due to Amazon's delivery than the vendor. But when I reached out to let them know, they responded immediately and offered a replacement. So, I am happy with their customer service too!! :-)",
