We recorded a video and played it back but there was no sound. Eventually realized we needed to unplug the mic from the headset/mic jack ... and then the sound played fine. Bottom line it works great and give great quality sound that you couldn't accomplish with the phone's built in mic. Thanks PowerDeWise team for a great product!",

Of course, the other unacceptable issue is the lack of a microphone equalizer built in to Windows 10 that could address this sort of problem. Otherwise, the rest of the product is sheer perfection.

      "text": "I am happy that the package came on time, there were no missing parts and the microphone works as it should. I was kinda nervous that the microphone would not work with the audio recording app of my choice. It does perfectly. I also didn't have to do any major adjustments with my Motorola Android e5 Plus phone; just plug it in. One advice I have for folks that have phone cases, make sure you push the microphone jack all the way in to make sure it is connected properly. What's included in the box is shown in the picture I posted. I'm glad it comes with a case, extender and adapter cable so I am ready for all situations.",

This is because the customer support through Facebook Messenger was absolutely amazing. Super Fast, explained how the mic handled noise cancellation, ETC. Could not ask for anything better. Give it a try for sure if you are interested. For $22, you absolutely can not go wrong.",

The sound isn't tinny or hollow. The only thing that would make it better is if the lapel clip was multi directional - but that's pretty minor.",

Lesson is to use fully charged iPad or iPhone with this microphone as electric current really interferes with it.",

After a buffer of 3 or 4 seconds of peaking audio, it will adjust and bring down the levels, but it does so quite quickly. It requires me to almost always adjust the audio at the beginning of the clip in post and bring it down about 2db.

By default when having it plugged-in into the headphone jack (3.5mm), one hears nothing from the speakers but uses the product for recording.

The sound clarity was very clear and didn't ahve any pops or hums, it didn't pick up any of the ambient noises from my living room, and the audio was in synch with the video. I will certainly grab another one of these for my 2-person videos I plan to produce. GREAT quality!",
