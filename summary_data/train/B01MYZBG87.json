Just a little harder to make sure it locks closed; you have to pull firmly. The handle is convenient but takes some getting use to. Love the ability to contain and control the water dripping Over all I\u2019d recommend this umbrella and buy it again",

It opens and closes easily, it really does trap the water on the inside of the umbrella when you close it, and when you open it again, the water flies off of it! It also stands on its' own, as shown in their video. GREAT buy for the cost. You won't be sorry you ordered one...so many beautiful designs to pick from!",
