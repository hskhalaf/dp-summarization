It's a small hole, but it renders the product unusable. The hole allowed all of the water and polishing grit to flow out. See pictures. Also, the motor and gears are very loud. The hard plastic container makes the rock noise loud, too (some rock tumblers come with quieter, rubber containers). It was far too loud to have in the house, running continuously for the weeks it takes to finish a batch.",

Despite meticulous care in setting the completely clean sealing O ring and locking the top as instructed, the unit still leaks. Moreover, the tolerances on the drum are such that the drive doesn't make enough contact with drum to drive it without slippage. This can be overcome by putting a large rubber band around the rim of the drum, but why should that be necessary. Poor design and poorly manufactured. Don't buy it!",

I had one as a child which used a simple threaded cap design (like a mayonnaise jar) and it never failed. After 3 phone calls and 2 emails I received a replacement drum 30 days later.

I am glad to say now that a wonderful man named Jeff worked to resolve this and has sent me a fabulous selection of rocks just before Christmas for this was a present for Grandson. Thank You very much for your fast and speedy response. We're all Happy Campers now! :)",

It helped a bit, but the worst is to get the top off.. Impossible once a little grit leaks into that seal. I sure would not order another till I saw how it sealed.. Got to be a better way.",
