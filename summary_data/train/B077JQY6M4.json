Unfortunately, the foot brake is defective and we are unable to use this stroller and consider this is a major safety issue. The company is willing to replace the main part,but not replace the entire stroller. At this price point, I would expect better manufacturing and there are many videos now on you tube pointing out the defective brakes. I hope the company is able to make changes to improve their brakes, as we were overalled pleased with the manuverabiltiy and size of the pram.",

I'm 5' 3\" and my husband is 6' 3\" and we can both push it comfortably thanks to the adjustable handle. I can't recommend this stroller highly enough! Update: I've been using this stroller for a while now and I still love it. It still steers and rolls so smoothly, and it's easy to wipe clean!",

It's so nice not to have to strap the baby into the carseat just to go for a walk; we can just place him in the bassinet. We use it for naps occasionally and plan to use it for travel too.

    "title": "2018 UPPAbaby VISTA Stroller, Jake (Black/Carbon/Black Leather)",
    "description": "Color:Black/Carbon/Leather| Style:JakeWith more than a dozen configurations, the versatile UPPAbaby VISTA transforms into any stroller you need it to be, whether you're strolling with a single child, siblings or twins. Start with one child in a bassinet, infant car seat, or the Toddler Seat she'll use until she no longer needs a stroller. When your family grows, add a second seat\u2014and even a glider board to take a third child along for the ride. Robust suspension in the VISTA frame and wheels provide smooth handling over uneven terrain, while a one-step, standing fold makes for convenient entries and exits during errands. The VISTA offers a reversible seat, a height-adjustable canopy, a near-flat recline, and tons of storage space. No wonder it's one of the most popular strollers on the market.
