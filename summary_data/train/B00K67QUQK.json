I tried to give the benefit of the doubt in testing it with my camera on, ignoring the obvious scuffs & wear and tear from a previous owner, but then when I removed my Canon G7X, the grip on the Roxant which makes physical contact with the camera came right off. Clearly it was not manufactured (glued) correctly & clearly I received a defective/used. Now I have to postpone what I needed to shoot because of this easily avoidable mistake.",

My original intent was to get this for my wife for when she documents marches, so that she can have steady footage with her google pixel, but then when I saw how nicely built it was, I thought I could use it with my camera. The size and weight seem perfectly suitable for our purposes, it should be good for extended periods and is also unobtrusive in a documentary environment and so shouldn't scare subjects. For use with DSLRs, ILCs, and smartphones, this is a really fine product, and actually surprised me with the value for money.",

I do wish there was 1 or 2 more millimeters of movement in the ball piece, but that is a small issue. I shoot, edit, and manage Facebook ads for local real estate agents. This helps me get really high quality movement shots which adds to the appeal of any space. People love to be able to move around, of course, and smooth camera movements help the customer feel what it would be like when if they moved there. Highly reccomended for smaller cameras!

The difference is staggering. Even though I was moving very slowly and carefully with the Roxant Pro, and took my time setting it up properly, the shots looked shaky. With the electronic gimbal, however, I can move quickly in any direction, point the camera in any direction, run with the gimbal, and 90% of the time my shot is ridiculously smooth. I wish I could recommend the Roxant Pro because the company's customer service is the best ever, but I cannot.",

I highly suggest that once you find the perfect balance, mark it on your stabilizer so you can go back to it easily next time you change lens or camera.

It was more sensitive than i had imagined, a near microscopic change in the balance arm or camera position changes everything. The device did do a very good job of removing shake. I wish there was a way to remote adjust the zoom of the camera as any touch to the camera zoom button throws everything off. In short, for about $60 it is a good alternative to a much much more expensive steady cam.",

It's not that it didn't work at all it's that it didn't work well enough for the kind of shots I need to compile. I've concluded that the Roxant Pro (and other similar stabilizers) are useful for a particular kind of shot and not many others. Specifically they're useful for shots in which a little bit of camera sway may actually add to the video rather than detract from it. So, walking shots, action shots, etc., are likely fine (with a fair bit of practice) for this stabilizer. However, if you need rock solid and smooth, gliding footage I just can't recommend it.",

The best tip of all is to move the weight uphill. Once I got my head around the concept the balancing process was pretty easy. The product is well made and seems very durable. I do a lot of outdoor environmental training videos and I was looking for something easy to use outdoors. This is a great product and well worth the money!",

I mostly use a GoPro as well and my iPhone and have found the ROXANT stabilizer to be exactly what I was looking for except I had to purchase a few after market items to get it to comfortably balance with my lighter camera equipment. The color is really sharp and I like the design. Well done. Also the customer service is unreal, really super rad company to work with.",

The Roxant Pro stabilizer offers great versatility, size and weight for use with my smaller action camera or phone. At first it felt a little clunky until I viewed the tutorials and figured out how to dial in the settings to get the perfect amount of balance and flow. I recently used it for two healthcare-related projects requiring POV shots. One project is from the perspective of a patient (re-enacting his experience interacting with various clinicians involved in his heart condition/treatment) and the other is an employee (avoiding slips, trips and falls). Very happy with the results.",

The last stabilizer I had was a long rod over 2ft long and that was clunky and not very stable. This design is superior. It feels solid and it\u2019s pretty easy to set up. I like being able to control with one hand and it feels light.",
