      "text": "If you're a parent sick of chasing after errant lacrosse balls...this is for you. My son's throwing and catching has greatly improved since purchasing the Swax Lax training ball. I now spend less time, hunting for lacrosse balls in the bushes, over the garage, across the street in the neighbor's back yard, or half a mile down the street, and more time throwing and catching. As a layman, the size and weight of the Swax Lax seem pretty similar to a regular lacrosse ball. The advantage is when I miss, the ball doesn't take any crazy bounces into the thorniest bush in my yard, or roll two towns over.",

Bottom line this has increased our at home practice so I\u2019m sure coach is happy. One con is the price for a glorified hacky sack.",
