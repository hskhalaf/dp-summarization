      "text": "My husband is currently deployed overseas. Before we left, I saw this product featured on Shark Tank and immediately ordered it for my 3-year-old daughter. It works exactly as we had hoped! It really makes such a difference that she can leave Daddy a message as soon as she thinks of something she wants to tell him vs. waiting until our next call. And she lights up when she hears Daddy's voice. It was slightly difficult to set up, but it's simple to use day-to-day. Even my 20-month-old can leave Daddy messages. What an amazing product! It makes Daddy seem closer to home, which is everything right now.",

Unfortunately, the buttons didn't quite line up well, so she would have to unzip the pouch and take out the electronic device to use it. On top of the ergonomic issues, setup was a bit of a pain and she and I would both find message notifications would often be delayed. The most use it's gotten was when my two year old got a hold of it and and a market and went to town. A bit of an expense investment for those few minutes of fun. All and all, a major disappointment.",
