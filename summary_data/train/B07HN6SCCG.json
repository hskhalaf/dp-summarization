      "verdict": "Retro vibes run deep in the California VTG or Vintage by Puma. Named after the sunshine state of California, the classic tennis sneaker grew an audience in soccer-loving European countries. The affordable sneaker that became an inspiration for the Puma GV Special and the Puma G. Vilas is known for its reliable external arch support and thick rubber outsole. The EVA midsole of the vintage kicks also allows for lightweight cushioning and support.",
      "pros": [
        "Some customers repurchased these Puma California Vintage sneakers for sentimental reasons having used the shoes in the 1980s",
        "One user like the vintage looks of the sneaker especially its navy, black, and grey tones",
        "A few noticed the VTG or Vintage version of the Puma California sneakers is more breathable with the use of mesh in parts of the footwear",
        "A commenter finds the neutral colorways not overly done making them easier to style with casual clothes",
        "Some people call it the OG of the Guillermo Vilas endorsed and designed sneakers back in the \u201880s",
        "One commenter liked the breathability of these vintage mesh shoes with lots of perforations in the toe box",
        "The synthetic nubuck material in the toe box gives the shoe a polished old-school sneaker look"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "The vintage shoe looks bulky as compared to other classic Puma designs like the Puma Suede and Puma Clyde",
        "The shoe design and colors looked a tad boring compared to other classic sneakers according to a couple of reviewers",
        "One user says the tongue of the sneakers could get quite uncomfortable when the laces are closed tight"
