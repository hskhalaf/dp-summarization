Went with the Oreck, which works OK, but the Riccar outperforms it by leaps and bounds. Long cord is great. Price is great for what this vacuum is. I'd definitely go with this vacuum over a Bissel or a Wal Mart style vacuum.",

Firmly planted in middle age, I've got an elbow, back and sometimes a knee that can't handle heavy machines anymore. And I find I don't want all those attachments other machines have. Because it is so lighweight, you can use the whole Oreck just as readily.

Personally though, I prefer items that perform one job exceptionally, than a bunch of jobs mediocre.",

It's not as wide as I'm used to but that doesn't slow down the job. No settings or accessories which keep it simple, but limited. The cord must be about 500 feet long. It's only shortcoming is on some area rugs you must know the nap and only vacuum one direction. Otherwise very easy to use and should last forever.",
