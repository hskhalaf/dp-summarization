It actually sucked out the black heads and white heads (sounds disgusting, but it is exactly what I needed) You can feel the suction tightening your skin as it works. Super happy with my purchase.",

It\u2019s helped my skin the most in this area. I hate caked concealer under eyes.. it looks awful on me. I love this thing! I\u2019ll be getting one for my boyfriends daughter.

My skin is so soft, clear, glowing, pores tighter, skin not tight/dry and just overall better.

That is why I rate it a 4/5 because its not for everyone. Definitely wash and exfoliate your face before to help open up the pores. I recommend washing your face after and using a good moisturizer too.",
