The 6 bottles are packaged in one nice, small, black box. You are only meant to use a drop or two of the oil in an oil diffuser, so with 6 of these bottles this should last quite a while. The scents are not too overpowering which is nice. I don't much care for the Tea Tree scent, but obviously opinions of scents will vary depending on your tastes. I don't have any negatives about this product. I would definitely buy again",

It makes it very easy to store the oils, and I just put the oils back in the box provided after using them. I think the sizes of the bottles are perfectly fine, and will last a long time especially with 6 different scents.

It even comes with a little basic guide for how to use them and suggested uses for each oil. I appreciate this starter kit more than some of the others, I feel like the choice of oils were way more suitable for a beginner and way more useful. Will purchase again.",

It's just really bad. Overall, I'm pretty disappointed but hopefully it will diffuse OK. My mother in law was diffusing the lavender at her house and it really smelled great. Almost like tea.

These essential oils do not even remotely smell like the scents they are supposed to. I have been using essential oils for my diffuser for years and I always try different brands from amazon or Marshall\u2019s and this brand is by far the worst. The package had a heavy stench of orange cleaning soap before I even unwrapped the box. I tried a mix of eucalyptus, peppermint, and tea tree in my diffuser and it smells disgusting, like cleaning soap. Extremely disappointed in this product.",

I\u2019ve used 3 of the scents so far in the burner I bought a few weeks ago and I really liked the orange and lavender scents. The peppermint smell was nice as well and was reminiscent of Christmas. Great price as well. I\u2019d recently bought just peppermint in a little bigger size and paid more for it than I did this entire set.",

My husband and I were so impressed by the strength that we bought some for ourselves. Now we have some stronger oils ready for the infuser but also roll on oils. Great buy and a great investment!",

I've had them for a long time, and I still have at least a few drops left in all the bottles, so I'd say the scents are potent enough.",

I enjoy having a variety of oils for keeping my home smelling fresh and relaxing. I will probably find a use for the other scents. This set of essential oils are really nice.
