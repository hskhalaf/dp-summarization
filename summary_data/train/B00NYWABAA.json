I was more than surprised with the quality and capabilities of this little unit. Out in the park at midnight, and could pick up a fox across two football pitches. Amazing. The only con is my main phone it is a little loose and the camera sometimes switches off, but in an old phone it's perfect. I can literally walk through the park in complete darkness.",

I'm glad I've previously had struggles with my phone relating to the connection on a one plus 5t, consequently I understood that I'd need to allow it to connect via settings which the manufacturer wouldn't have been able to help me with. The resolution is alright but not fantastic (the reason only 4 stars). Have had some good images but to get something more satisfying I've used Mirror Lab image manipulation to give a more worthwhile image. Expensive just for a bit of fun but it may be really useful one day.",
