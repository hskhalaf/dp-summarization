It is kind of like Trivial Pursuit, but there are different types of questions, which use different types of knowledge/intelligence to figure out--it's not just about knowing facts (though that's the biggest part of it). I cannot figure out why the others don't like it and they haven't been able to articulate what they find objectionable about this game. I think it is really fun.",

The questions are challenging but not impossible (we're no geniuses...), and they require different types of intelligence, so a person who is good at one type of thing but not another has a chance to get some right. There are a huge number of questions, sort of like Trivial Pursuit, so I don't see us running out of cards any time soon.",
