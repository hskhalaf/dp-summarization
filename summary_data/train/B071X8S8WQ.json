He used them for a while and then either lost them or grew tired of them. His reaction to the Infinity Cube is very different. The product has a solid feel and he is able to manipulate it one-handed. It helps him to concentrate when he is doing school work and studying for finals. It also seems to significantly reduce his anxiety. I can't thank you enough for this product. I wish we would have had it years ago. But I will be grateful for it now.",

Unlike the cheap plastic ones that are less expensive, this has a nice construction and heft. They are more durable, the hinges are better, and it is a more gratifying cube. The nice thing is it's not the price of the fancier ones, but it does feel luxurious and well crafted.",

I can play for hours while watching tv or reading. It had fallen to the floor a couple of times and it didn't break or damage. Highly recommend for fidgeters of all shapes, sizes, and ages.",

Every possible bend and fold you could think of in each direction is not possible...you may be able to bend over and touch your toes; but you certainly can\u2019t bend over backwards to touch your heels. I would not use this in a classroom setting, a bit distracting with the clicking noises. Still a very unique product, would purchase again if anything were to go wrong.

Really happy to have this -- it's a lot better than my stress ball :) The only reason my overall rating is four stars is because the material (described as metal aluminum) appears and feels to be more like a hard plastic, and while I'd still like a metal fidget cube, the material doesn't take away at all from how I enjoy using it.
