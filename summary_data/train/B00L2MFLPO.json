I expected them to be more rough and scratchy, like loofah, but once they're fully hydrated and softened the indside gets a thick gel-like consistency. It creates a slip effect that is more noticeable when used without soap, and helps the sponge glide over your skin and buff away dead cells without causing irritation or sensitivity. I've seen other reviews talking about how well their face soap lathers when using this sponge, but I prefer to wash my face first and use the sponge on my clean skin afterward. Its extremely soothing, and gentle enough to be used every day.",

I also use on my chest and back from time to time - my skin is so much smoother and the fact that it's natural products really increases my level of feeling safe with it.",

In the past I have purchased very rough exfoliating products that didn't always buff away the dryness but definitely enhanced my skin's irritation and breakouts. When I have used both of these sponges it does take a bit of time for them to absorb water and become pliable but when I have used them I have noticed how soft and gentle they are. They gently buff and polish the skin without causing irritation. I never thought I would pick such a gentle product but I am pleased that I did and would recommend it to others as well.",
