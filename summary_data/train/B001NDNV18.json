Sometimes we can\u2019t even get one room vacuumed and it jams up again. We vacuum every day so it is not like we have a build up of dirt. What a waste of money.",

Great suction, extra long heavy cord. Does what you want it to do \"vacume floors\"",

This poor design does not work!!! And this morning, only a scant 20 months into ownership, the on/off switch has failed.

The Oreck met these criteria, had good reviews, and was very reasonably priced. I can say I\u2019m very satisfied with its performance and it definitely meets my criteria. It vacuums very well and is light. For steps and upholstery, I have a separate small low-priced shop vacuum that I used to complement my cleaning.",

It seems to bust a moove picking up dust bunnies and the such. I think I like it, I would really prefer a fun color if we are gonna do this whole retro thing but regardless, it works well!",

The \"return window\" closed a few days ago, so we are trying to arrange for a warranty return from Oreck, but we are disappointed in the product.",

Just ask the pile of broken cyclone and whirlwind plastic housings that couldn't seal if you glued them with a caulking gun of RTV. The Oreck is simple, basic but proven ideas that have lasted the test of time. I predict it will outlast every vacuum out there.",
