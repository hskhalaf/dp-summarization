I bought 2 sets and I'm now down to about one set. Just stacking them up in the cabinet chips them or accidentally knocking them against something in the dishwasher. Every bowl has at least one chip and the plates are not much better!!!",

These dishes have been knocked off the island and counter onto weed floor in the kitchen by accident more than once and not so much as a chip anywhere. My favorite is that you can fit a can of soup in the bowls without it overflowing and still have room for crackers. They are super easy to clean by hand and seem to dry faster than other dishes. They inspired me with its sleek and modern design to update my glassware and silverware that I also purchased here on Amazon that I am thrilled with.",

I did not really need the coffee mugs, so one missing is not a deal breaker for me. I found that the glazing on the outside of this red and black set is not shiny, its very dull/muted compared to my mosaic set. The photo online made the outside seem more shiny. The inside/eating surface is a shiny glaze. I like the set overall.",
