The phone is noticeably heavier and thicker than my dear old 925, so does not slide as easily into a pocket, but is otherwise excellent.",

That said, despite some minor scratches on the backside, the phone appeared new. I would simply advise seeking another seller for this item.",

When combined with enhanced backhaul, 4G means faster speeds, where data transfers take less time to complete.\n\nAT&T has upgraded the software of its nationwide mobile broadband network with HSPA+ which, with enhanced backhaul, enables speeds up to 4x faster than AT&T's already fast mobile broadband speeds. And now, AT&T is evolving to even faster 4G speeds with the launch of AT&T's 4G LTE technology in select markets.\n\nBackhaul is one of the major pieces of a telecommunications network. Think of it as the limbs connecting AT&T's cell towers with AT&T's backbone network that provides access to the Internet.\n\nHOW DOES AT&T 4G DIFFER FROM OTHER 4G NETWORKS?\nAT&T is the only network offering two layers of 4G technology: HSPA+ with enhanced backhaul and LTE, both capable of delivering 4G speeds. Customers will have access to fast speeds as they move in and out of 4G LTE areas. Customers of competitors who do not have HSPA+ with enhanced backhaul are likely to see a steep drop-off in speeds when they move out of LTE areas.\n\nIn areas where either AT&T's 3G or 4G network is not available, you'll continue to receive service on the AT&T EDGE network, which offers availability in more than 13,000 US cities and along some 40,000 miles of major highways.\n\nOPTIONAL AT&T SERVICES\nAT&T Navigator: This premium GPS navigation application includes audible turn-by-turn directions, real-time traffic updates and re-routing options, and 3D moving maps (additional charges applicable). AT&T Navigator offers several other features to make your commute more enjoyable and reliable, including mobile access to Yellowpages.com. You'll be able to find the closes ATM, restaurant, gas station, Wi-Fi hotspot and more with over 10 million business listings.\n\nAT&T FamilyMap: Locate any phone indoors or outdoors on the AT&T Network. FamilyMap provides peace of mind by being able to conveniently locate a family member from your wireless phone or PC and know that your family's information is secure and private. Want to verify that your child arrives home from school each day?
