They use to have this that you could search the world over via wifi. \"Internet Radio (over 16,000 stations) and FM-RDS Waveband\"...they no longer have the 16,000 radio stations that you could search. The reason that I bought this radio was because they had the 16,000 radio stations from all around the world that you could search. Contacting support was useless. If you're looking for a good Wifi Radio...this one isn't it. Look for something else.",

Now all that changedl a few months ago. The radio would just randomly drop off the station I was listening to. The screen started freezing up and have flashing waves across it. The latest problem the audio is good and then stops, then starts. Adjusting the volume didn't change the volume. Its unfortunate because I really do like this radio!",

Also, the unit is quite heavy when the D-sized batteries are installed, but the batteries themselves last surprisingly long. The speaker has good sound and loudness. Overall, a great sounding unit!",

I like the options of using regular batteries, rechargeable batteries or the ac plug that ships with the radio. Since I only use the internet radio, I can't comment on the radio reception. Internet radio sound is very good and there is a built in equalizer to tweak the sound. The radio does take about 30 seconds to boot up and I do have issues with signal which could be my router. I just move the radio. So far so good.",

I carry mine in my work bag and the radio gets turned on easily inside the bag. I fixed this by gluing a plastic ring around the button, but I wish the power button was on top.",
