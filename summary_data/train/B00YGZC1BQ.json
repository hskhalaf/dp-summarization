Fits my medium-sized, 15 pound dog well without digging in or causing discomfort. My dog doesn't try to bite at this harness at all like he usually does with others. I've tossed out all my other harnesses for this one and will re-purchase if it gives out at any point. I really like the double links for clipping the leash too because it adds more security, and therefore, peace of mind. The clip is also really easy to take off which is not always the case. Definitely recommend!",

It's a must that I have a harness that falls below the throat while walking him as this exacerbates his condition. With this \"Step-in\" harness, it sits low on his chest yet does a good job of holding him back. Putting the harness on can be a bit of a challenge but I've figured that out rather quickly. There is a bit of stretch after a month or 2 of use but not enough to make the harness useless. And you can tighten it if you need to. All in all I am very pleased.",

The straps are wide and don't seem to cut into her like ones I've bought with narrower straps. The harness is easy to put on, although she has trouble lifting her left front leg. The snap seems robust. Enna would have preferred a pink harness, but the black one was significantly less money.",
