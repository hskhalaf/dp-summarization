I'm just now honing my techniques, and advise anyone who uses these to view the plethora of great YouTube videos available online about fusing glass jewelry (Glaze Jewellery in New Zealand) and about fushing glass in general (aaeglass). There are others, too, but these are my favorite sites for technique and inspiration. I've shown my very first piece, a kitty pendant for my niece. aaeglass also has a very good selection of glass decals that you fire onto the surface of your finished fused glass. They work very well, and the technique is demonstrated on YouTube and probably their website as well.",

I am a very careful person I read the instructions carefully and re-read them. I made sure I had 90 Coe glass and I didn't mix glass types. I made a simple project put it in and when I fired it, it melted way too much and I took it out to let it cool and when it was cool the glass was stuck to the sides and won't come off. I'm very unhappy that I did everything i was supposed to and the kiln created this problem.",

I have looked at this and read the description many times; however it felt like I'd been ripped off when opened and found just the tiny kiln, no supplies or beginner's materials or even a booklet to instruct the beginner for the huge price. I am rethinking this hobby and wondering if it is worth the cost along with the frustration of learning.",
