      "text": "Excellent camera - dont know why people would pay 50$ extra for the bigger LCD screen in its next model (SD650). Advantages; - Very compact, nice looking - excellent photo quality - nice software (check out 'photostitch' - creates panoramic images by auto-merging several of your photos. amazing!) the batter life has been good so far - i've only had it for a month or so. The AC adapter is very compact too. Overall- good value for your money. Cant buy anything better in 200$. Advice: get at least a 1gb SD card with it. I got 2gb, and now click worry-free. Each photo is ~2mb in superfine mode, FYI.",

This is my third elph, and my only complaint is that the sunlight manual setting washes out the colors. I have to switch to automatic in bright sun to get the punchy colors I used to get on sunlight manual. Then switch back to manual for shadowy areas. Nonetheless, that small quibble aside, if I had the money, I'd buy one of these cameras for everyone I know. I'm looking for a reason to buy one for hubby, as I'd like to retire his slightly older Elph.",

Its nice and small easily fits into a shirt pocket), has a decent zoom, the lens retracts completely into the stainless steel body, which means that our two-year old has not been able to destroy it (yet). Optical viewfinder has the usual problem (it underestimates what will be on the image), but the digital screen works great. No manual options, but most of us can live without that. the flash is as bad as expected. At 1 inch above the lens it's in your face, but hey, with a camera that size you can't expect much.",

I have taken several hundred pictures in all conditions and am more than satisfied. The manuals are easy to understand, the pictures are clear and sharp and the feel of the camera is comfortable. I purchased an extra battery, the hard case and the 1 GB card. I've only had to replace a discharged battery once and have space for over a thousand pictures left on the card.",

Although the battery lasts a long time and the charger is very small and easy to travel with, if you're at an event and the battery dies, you're out of luck until you can charge it.",

So search for \"lens error\" or e18 lens error and canon. None of the suggestions fixed it. Nothing I can do but get a new camera and it definitely won't be a canon!!! A lot of people have had problems getting canon to even honor the warranty.",

From flim to digital had to be canon. I must admit that I have been using it more than the intended user so I will have to get my own.",

    "title": "Canon PowerShot SD600 6MP Digital Elph Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (OLD MODEL)",
    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\nEquipped with the latest Canon technology, the PowerShot SD600 Digital Elph gives all the power you'd expect from a high resolution camera and more. Packed with a full array of Canon's most popular and convenient shooting features, this Digital Elph has a sleek, ergonomic design that will turn heads.\n\n High resolution and superior comfort\nDesigned for the way you like to shoot, the sleek and compact 6.0-megapixel PowerShot SD600 Digital Elph has just what you need to make every image razor sharp and vibrantly colorful. The genuine Canon 3x optical zoom UA lens brings you in close for the details that will make your images startling and bold.\n\n Better shots, easier replay\nPowerShot SD600 Digital Elph incorporates a large 2.5-inch LCD screen for a truly eye-opening view. This high-resolution screen offers a crisp, clear picture and wider viewing angle to make shooting, playback, and using the camera's menu functions especially convenient. And when you're shooting at dusk or at night, the Night Display function lets you see the display clearly. It brightens the object while you compose your shot by reducing the frame rate on the LCD screen.\n\n Canon innovation enhances your experience\nThe PowerShot SD600 Digital Elph features new ISO 800 and High ISO Auto settings that reduce the effects of camera shake and sharpen subjects in low-light situations with high shutter speeds, giving you greater flexibility for shooting.\n\n Advanced imaging technology improves every photo\n\n DIGIC II Image Processor\nCanon's DIGIC II Image Processor is designed to improve processing speed and image quality, so DIGIC II provides markedly faster startup, autofocus, and playback, plus it assures that every image is more colorfully vibrant.\n\n iSAPS Technology\niSAPS Technology is an entirely original scene-recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos, iSAPS works with the fast DIGIC II Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy, as well as exposure and white balance.\n\n Shoot and view wide images\nThe PowerShot SD600 Digital Elph includes a 16:9 widescreen resolution option, producing images and film clips that are perfect for your widescreen TV or computer monitor.\n\n Superior quality movies\nFast Frame Rate Movie Mode allows you to record extremely smooth, full-motion movie clips for up to one minute long in QVGA at 60 frames per second (fps) (320 x 240 pixels). With a highly flexible movie mode, you can create the movie that's perfect for any application. Select from VGA (640 x 480 pixels) and QVGA (320 x 240 pixels) with frame rates of 30 fps and 15 fps for recording up to 1 hour or 1 GB. Plus, Compact Movie Mode (QQVGA; 160 x 120 pixels) records at 15 fps for up to 3 minutes.\n\n Shooting Modes\n\n\nAuto: The camera chooses all the settings so you can concentrate on your subject. Manual: The ultimate in creative control, you set ISO speed, exposure compensation and white balance. Portrait: The camera sets a large aperture, focusing the subject and artistically blurring the background to make your subject \"pop.\" Foliage: Capture brilliant shots of autumn foliage, greenery and blossoms. Snow: Shoot clear snow scenes without darkened subjects or bluish tint. Beach: Get clear shots of people at a sunny beach without darkened faces. Fireworks: Grab brilliant images of skyrocketing fireworks. Underwater: Capture underwater images with reduced backscatter effect. (Note: Optional Waterproof Case WP-DC2 required for shooting any underwater images) Indoor: Reduce blur and improve color accuracy when shooting handheld indoors. Kids and Pets: Reduced focusing time freezes fast-moving subjects, so you won't miss those special shots. Night Snapshot: Get natural-looking pictures with brighter backgrounds and subjects lit by flash. Color Accent: Choose to retain a single color in your image while other colors turn monochrome. Color Swap: Select a color and replace it with a color you specify for special effects. Digital Macro: Shoot larger-than-life close-ups with one-button simplicity. Stitch Assist: Build awe-inspiring panoramas by neatly aligning sequential images. My Colors\nVivid Blue: Emphasize the sea, sky and other blue areas.\nVivid Green: Add vivid dimension to greens for extraordinary nature shots.\nVivid Red: Charge up red objects in your images for extra impact. Neutral: Produce images of subtle, elegant tonality. Sepia: Recreate the look of vintage photographs. Black and White: Deliver enhanced clarity - especially useful when shooting text. Positive Film: Combine \"Vivid Blue,\" \"Vivid Green,\" and \"Vivid Red\" to achieve a positive film effect. Lighter Skin Tone: Make your subjects' skin tones lighter. Darker Skin Tone: Darken skin tones a shade. Custom Color: Finely adjust brightness and vividness, and set your preferred balance of blue, green, red, and skin colors. The complete print solution\nThe PowerShot SD600's Print/Share button makes direct printing easier than ever. Simply connect the SD600 to a Canon CP, SELPHY, or PIXMA Photo Printer or any PictBridge-compatible photo printer, press the lighted Print/Share button, and print! (Printer not included--must be purchased separately.) Also use the Print/Share button to transfer images to a computer (Windows and Macintosh).\n\n What's in the Box\nPowerShot SD600 body, Lithium battery pack NB-4L, battery charger CB-2LV, SD memory card SDC-16M, wrist strap WS-600, Digital Camera Solution CD-ROM, USB interface cable IFC-400PCU, AV cable AVC-DC300",
