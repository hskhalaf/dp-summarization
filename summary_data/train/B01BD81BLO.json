I cannot comment to the laser because I don't use it since I have mounted this saw onto a Kreg Rip Cut Jig and the combo of the rip jig and saw is a perfect combo. All I have to do now is set the rip jig to the correct length, make the cut and done. You can find the jig here",

I was cutting through 4x4 pressure treated lumber by cutting it on one side, flipping it over and then cutting the other side (You can't really do the depth to get through a 4x4). I then cut through a bunch of 2x4s in no time. The guides make it easy to use, and this thing is easy to make straight lines with. I haven't tried angle cuts, but it seemed pretty easy to adjust for that. The only trouble I had was finding the key tool. It is a black flat metal piece that slides into the back of the guide plate :)",

When I hold the Skil saw with my right hand, the motor is on the inside, closest to my body and I can't see the blade as easily. It does have the light for a guide, but I prefer to see the blade position exactly on my own penciled line. Otherwise, it worked well.",

I do like the laser guide, a nice touch.

I'm so glad I replaced it with another Skil saw. The new one is much more powerful than the old and has features like a safety lock, power indicator light , and laser beam that ensures I'm cutting on my line accurately. Considering the relatively inexpensive cost of this new saw, I'm almost glad the old one finally had to be scrapped.",

My only note is that the high pitched whine it makes is different than other saws i have had in the past. You must wear ear protection - it's ear splitting.

Also, it does help keep your cuts straight. Provided of course you have a guide line to follow. The saw also seems quite a bit lighter than others I've used. It's very ergonomic, and very easy to operate. All of this with the blade that comes in the box.",

The skill saw gives a specific tool to tighten on the blade, and states \"do not overtighten blade\" but then would stop spinning, shake, and would make burn marks on the blade and wood. When googled, it said the blade may not be tight enough, so I did overtighten and it seemed to work better. In the end, we ended up returning this.",

      "text": "This is a great saw! It's size and weight is its best feature--perhaps 2/3 the size of the old style circular saws. Makes it easier and less tiresome to use. The laser guide lines up nicely with the saw line. I was able to cut more accurately with this saw than any previous circular saw I have used. As always, SKIL is nice quality for the price. I consider this saw a Best Buy!",
