I did research before ordering this tool, and was impressed with everything I read. I would not recommend this tool or brand, it is not safe to use.",

I haven't really even begun to use this, and I'm terribly disappointed that the quality has diminished so much on my absolute favorite multi-tool.

The gear drive on the pliers gives you a lot of griping force and makes for a very smooth opening tool. Its very easy to flip the tool open with just one hand, different than your average leatherman. 3 years of hard use and it still performs great! I strongly recommend this tool if you are in the market for full sized, daily use, multitool. This is not a gimmicky tool, its solid, practical, and meant to be used.",

      "text": "The knife and saw work are super sharp. The locking mechanism is also really nifty. It locks in place both when it's open and when it's closed. It has enough tools to be really useful but not to the point where it gets bulky and unmanageable. I live in a condo and keep this tool in my unit and my toolbox down in storage. It works great for the little jobs around the house and given it's weight I expect it to perform well for camping and backpacking this summer.",

      "text": "I bought these mainly for the pliers which is what I would use most on them. Because of the gear action they are stronger than other multi tool pliers I've tried. They also have a smaller needlepoint and a longer wire cutter. The v cutter works good for striping wires. I also like the assisted action of the 2 blades. The only thing I would change is to add a belt clip to the multi tool. It has one attached to the casting case but it would be more usable for me the other way.",

I knocked a star off THIS review because I purchased one as a gift for somebody and upon opening the shipping box the product's actual packaging was all taped together, it looks like it was completely ripped open then taped together. Everything was there, and it's a minor gripe....but it was a gift and kind of makes it look crappy now.",

No V Cutter as mentioned in the description, but a file, that isn't bad a file is useful. I really don't need a C-4 tool I do need a Phillips. Not sure if I am going to return it or not.

I've already used the easy access knife in so many occasions because it is SO EASY to just flip out. The other tools inside work just as well and the compound leverage is something else. The ONLY problem I see with the tool is when you want to take the v cutter out it also brings out one of the can openers. You can put it back with the slightest pressure but its just a little annoying at times. NO BIGGY though. Definitely would recommend this to a friend. Already have.",

The PowerAsssist does offer much more cutting and gripping strength than other multitools I have used. The blades are easily accessible and quick to draw and the locking mechanism seems very secure. I am quite happy with them so far and the only reason I have not given them 5 stars is that they are not as easy to use one handed as the Gerbers they replaced.",

Smoother operation of the pliers, the blade steel is ok, not S-30V like the Charge. Cuts well, grips very good, and if you don't have the money for a Leatherman, go with this, WAY better then a Gerber. I love the lock out system, but they need to rethink the blade release method it's hard to get your thumb to the post and get it released for assist open, it's well built, but the operation was just not very well thought out.",

The first is that there are knurled lock bars to lock open the blades These things are sharp! So sharp that it makes handling and holding the tool difficult at times. The second problem is the style of swing on the blades. There is a \"hitch\" in the middle of the arc as the blade opens and my finger kept slipping off the thumb stud and connecting with the blade edge. Ouch. This was repeatable and was also very annoying.",
