I tried cleaning it with lemon juice and as a last resort used bleach. Nothing is getting the water lines completely clean. I am so disappointed.....",

I figured at 28 lbs a day I could harvest at least 12lbs per day. I was wrong. It is slower at making ice than my refrigerator and the ice comes out pretty wet. I am not exactly sure how much ice it's making a day but it's probably in the region of 7-9lbs over the 14 hours I am there to check it, fill and empty when needed. The ambient temp in my house is about 76 degrees.",

Downside is it's somewhat noisy when it's working and goes through cycles with its fans, internal components, and pumps. Also, to be clear, it is not cooled actively, it makes ice and then the ice keeps the interior cool, so only fill as much water as you need so the heat capacitance of the water reservoir doesn't melt your ice as soon as its made.",
