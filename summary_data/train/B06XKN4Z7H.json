I do not think I got the value for my money. At $300, I was expecting higher quality parts. The control knobs are cheap plastic, the grill grates are thinner than expected, the base stand is flimsy with cheap wheels. Heat distribution is not even. The back of the grill cooks much faster than the front of the grill. Very annoying when cooking for a large group.",

Summary - good deal for a very basic grill if you have the patience to put it together. If you have a little more money you should try an infrared like Char-broil Performance TRU-Infared 500 about $395 on Amazon. If not be sure to try the silicone grilling matts.",
