The picture doesn't depicts all the cool feeling that I have felt and touched with my butt. It provides fast ventilation in the cooling mode and great comfort for driving, especially long distance. The Mesh design was well thought such that the seat can have enough ventilation without the stickiness. I haven't tried the heating function because it is dog days of summer now:) Shipping was fast too.",

I have a fairly loaded GMC Sierra but because it has a bench seat in the front that deletes heated seats. My issue with this is the seat bottom is just a tad short for the size of a full size pickup it hangs at a bit of an awkward angle due to the fan being needed for the cooling process. My other issue is there is not built in timer, this runs off a 12v adapter; if you forget to turn it off you're draining your battery (if you're 12v doesn't turn off when you shut down your vehicle).",

My only complaint is it's not very comfortable at first but either I've gotten used to it or it just had to \"break in\" a little after a few days.

When I come in to work in the morning, the outside temperature is usually around 30 degrees. Heats up quickly to warm me up! Later when the temperature rises and I\u2019m working hard, I use the cooling feature and the cooling works quickly too! Fan is a little noisy, but I do not notice it when I\u2019m working or listening to music. It sounds like background noise. I would like the top back strap to be a adjustable and longer, but I did know it was not supplied as so when I ordered it.",

And with a little finagling you can strap it onto your standard office chair. In all, the problem is the built-in timer (the mesh covering is somewhat uncomfortable too).",

      "text": "In the area in Georgia where I drive a school bus we do not have air conditioning and we started school August 2. Which is HOT! I found this works wonderfully well in the morning when it is a little cooler...but nothing helps that much in the afternoon. However I can tell a difference which is good. At first I wasn't convinced there was an improvement but after a week I do think it helps. But don't expect it to be super cool in extreme heat. I look forward to trying out the heat this winter.",

After trying the replacement and the other original one I had, I realized these do not work as advertised. On both of my working seat covers the heater only heats an area of a couple square inches, and even that area does not get very warm. Overall extremely disappointed with the product and I wonder how there are so many good reviews. Save your money and buy something else!",
