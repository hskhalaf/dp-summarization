And even if you go through the work of defrosting it, it comes right back. The probable reason for frost in any freezer is poorly made seals, and that makes sense because the seals on this one are extremely weak and barely seal at all when you close it. Find one that seals better. It does get pretty cold an it's quiet. But having units with poor seals from day 1 is inexcusable. I want to put food in it not frost.",

This helps to evenly freeze throughout the freezer. This thing is so quiet I sometimes think that it's not working. I am truly amazed to how much I can fit in this size. I highly recommend it.
