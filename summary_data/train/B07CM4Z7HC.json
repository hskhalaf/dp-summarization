This iconic street racing shoe has accumulated over 20 years of success, helping the overpronators to maintain stability and comfort over long distances. The last kilometer will be as comfortable as the first, thanks to the excellent Flytefoam cushioning midsole that helps the shoes recover shape after impact. This means that the greater the rotation of the foot, the better the stability will be.\\nThe shoe has been improved with a range of new features, including a newly designed upper using a jacquard net for improved fit. Optimized fit and stability thanks to the metaclutch technology for excellent heel hold, a new heel lining for maximum comfort and a new medial support system, together with a more spacious tip, make the GEL-KAYANO 25 extremely comfortable for run great distances.",
