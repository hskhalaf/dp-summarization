      "text": "These are pretty nice for the low price, but they stopped working after about 1 year of school use (as a personal pair used by 1 student). That isn't so great. The product description talks about the lifetime warranty (for the wired version). What it does not tell you is that you pay to mail them back to the manufacturer. That's a sigificant fraction of the cost of a new pair. I'm going to send mine back and see what they do. According the the warranty FAQ, if they decide that the headphones weren't abused, then I will get an unspecified amount of store credit for their own online store with free standard shipping back to me. I'll report back.",

These are VERY comfortable. My wife and I will even use them on occasion and we're full-sized adults. The materials are very nice. Soft earcups. Lightweight but feel sturdy and well made. They have great battery life. Easy operation. Most important: They're truly sound-limiting at 85dbs. No jacks and jack plugs to get ruined. She walks all over our house in them and loves that she can pause and advance tracks from the headset.",

The only issue I have is that I didn't order two of them which means I'm ordering another one because the value is just beyond what I expected",

If it was longer, he'd probably roll over the cord with a chair or get it caught on something since kids are less observant than adults.",

They fold up for easy storage in their backpacks and have a pretty good microphone. We had only used them previously for videos and audiobooks, but they became essential when we began virtual school last spring. My only complaint is I have had to pull apart the casing on one side to get the comfort lining back in place. Once I figured out they clicked together and it wasn't glued, it was pretty easy. No complaints on functionality. Very good for kids and have volume control to protect young ears.",
