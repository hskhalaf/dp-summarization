We use these for our Timers to hand record each racer's time as a backup to our digital automated system. These timers have substantial functionality, are easy to use, with clear and easy to read displays. The buttons are correctly sized for an assortment of hand sizes. We plan to get a few years use out of these and it looks like they'll hold up well to water and chlorine conditions. Well priced and good quality, these stopwatches are a win.",

I don't have to put on my glasses to read it. Like all brands of this type of watch, when they get old they start to malfunction. After this one woke me up at midnight when I didn't have it set for that, I decided to abandon it and just use my phone. This was two months after buying it. It also will sometimes alarm five minutes after I set the alarm. For example at 9:00 I set it for 9:30, it goes off at 9:05, but not at 9:30.",
