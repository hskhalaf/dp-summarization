It's just a really good sports bra for big boobs.",

I have a small band size and large cup size, which is VERY hard to find any bra to fit, sports bras included. I LOVE that there are clasps in 2 places on your back. The bra does a great job of keeping the bouncing to a minimum without feeling like you are compressed and can't breath. It also covers you enough without feeling like you're wearing a whole tank top. I've used it for long distance running, biking, yoga, etc. and it works for all occasions. I highly recommend!",
