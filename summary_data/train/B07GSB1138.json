It\u2019s been a month since I\u2019ve used the case and frankly it looks like I\u2019ve had it a year. I don\u2019t go anywhere. It sits on a desk or my headboard when I\u2019m not using it. I haven\u2019t dropped it. It doesn\u2019t go loose in my purse. And yet, it\u2019s lost all of its gloss and it\u2019s completely trashed from very basic use. So very disappointed with this case.",
