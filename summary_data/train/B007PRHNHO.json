Auto-sleep. -Pairs quickly and easily with the iPad. -Nice tactile feel to keyboard. -Attaches snug and firmly. Cons: -Magnets could be a little stronger. -Bottom has no rubber pads or feet which makes it slide somewhat and scratches the nice aluminum in spots. Minor but stupid oversight. Overall very pleased and this keyboard has increased the utility of my iPad (for work especially). I would buy another in the future.",

I bought this one used in \"like new\" condition and, so far, it's performed very well. The key strokes are fast and easy, and are accurately translated to my iPad. No complaints on performance. I also love the sleek, clean look of the unit. The slot holds the iPad securely enough. I do have 1 issue: One of the keys popped off and got lost. Bummer! I still give the keyboard 4 stars because, compared to other keyboards I've tried where multiple keys went missing, I can deal with the minor disappointment. It shouldn't happen, but perhaps it's the 'nature of the beast...'",

The magnet on the hinge is strong and holds the iPad securely. When turned on, the Bluetooth attaches quickly and stays on as long as the case is opened, even if you let the iPad shut off from inactivity. It comes right back as soon as the iPad wakes up. The keys are a little flat, but have a good positive feel and make touch typing easy. The instructions promise up to 6 month's use between charges. I have charged it once but have not used it enough to see how long a charge will last. Overall, a good product.",

The magnet slips very easily and you need an additional cover to protect the ipad. Also, when the ipad is sitting up in the slot on the keyboard, it often falls over, which can be very frustrating. The price is considerably better than other units and the battery life is excellent.",

I spent 28 years of my life as a high school business teacher. Keyboarding was a class I taught for many years. This keyboard is a great size. I like the feel of the keys. I love the fact that it attaches to the iPad and provides a stand for it. I can't think of one thing I don't like about this keyboard. It has certainly made blogging (and typing of ANY kind) easier.",

Like others have said, if it's not clicked right, the iPad will fall right out of the keyboard and hit the table, (or surface it's on) so thankfully I have Apple Care and won't worry about that! But it's still a little frustrating that it falls out (it has 2x already for me). I say worth the price, especially at the refurbished rate!",

The keyboard feels great, the quality and styling are otherwise great and this could have been an outstanding product.

The keyboard is well laid out, provides excellent tactile feedback, is responsive, and beautiful. Also, the battery life is phenomenal.",

The magnetic strip holds it very securely while I'm using my lap tray unless I tilt the tray too far forward. The only suggestion I have is that Logitech switch to a different plastic surface that isn't as shiny so fingerprints aren't as obvious.",
