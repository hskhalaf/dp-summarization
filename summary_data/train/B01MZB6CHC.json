      "text": "The style is OK. They are good looking shoes. But the insoles are so thick and uncomfortable. I wear a D or M width size 12 with most shoes. These felt tight when I tried them on. Went against my first impression to return them. It seems in the process of making the Bruin a \"skate\" shoe (originally the design was court and they were very comfortable) they stuffed thick silicone insoles in the Bruin line. I got a blister when I wore them with the original insoles. . I had to replace the insoles just to get more room in them. Much more comfortable now, but have to wait for my blister to heal before I wear them again.",

The skateboard shoes they made in the 90's fit much looser, and that's what I was going for. I gave 5 stars because it's not the merchant's fault I overlooked something. I like them though, and the shipping was fast. Thank you!",

I only wear them a couple of hours at a time, and they are pretty comfortable as long as I keep them laced very loosely. I don't think going up a size would help, it's more of a narrowness issue.",
