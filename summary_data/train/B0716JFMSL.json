I was looking forward this so much and was so happy when I finally got it yesterday.... I don\u2019t wanna turn it back cuz it is so much work unscrewing it and pack... I thought maybe complaining people are kind of picky so they have such high expectations.. but it turned out there is a reason for their complaining. I feel bad... without these broken parts, I would give five stars but I am not gonna recommend buying it through online.",

The real leather seat and handle wraps are absolutely superb and the green color is beautiful in person. The wheels came with a little wobble in them but other than that nothing bad at all. Feels great, she's enjoyed it for around a month now and she loves it. Can't recommend it enough. The basket is one of our favorite parts as well. Sturdy and rigid, doesn't feel like it'll be breaking any time soon, much less at all.",

The packaging seemed so thorough yet this is clearly a consistent problem-see other reviews. Very easy to assemble-once I looked up a video online. The assembly guide was pretty useless, full of the most intricate details of correct assembly of every last portion of a bike-but not this bike in particular or how to put any bike together once received as shipped. Otherwise I would have given this a 5 star rating. Love the bike for aesthetics and quality.",

So I had one piece on the wrong way. I eventually figured it out by looking at a photo of the fully assembled bike online. You may find that helpful. I've enjoyed riding this bike a lot since I got it. No issues whatsoever. And I have to admit that I also love it because it's adorable. It looks SO good.

There is a single gear in front so you only have to worry about shifting one de\u0301railleur. The shift mechanism is a ring on the handle grip that you just twist -very easy and intuitive. It has an attractive pannier basket that comes off quickly and has a carrying handle. I wish it had two.",

    "title": "Raleigh Bikes Women's Superbe City Bike",
    "description": "Designed for women with a serious sense of style and appreciation for the finer things, the Superbe is a gorgeous new ride from Raleigh made to match your signature style. This work of art is not only superbly comfortable to ride, but it also shows off your superb taste. With paint colors influenced by up and coming designer Madison Howe, each colorway is fashioned after a well-known shopping district-from British racing green representing London's Regent Street and classic black for New York's Soho district to iconic ivory for Chicago's Magnificent Mile and dusty pink for Beverly Hills' Rodeo Drive. Raleigh dressed these bicycles with beautiful lock-on leather grips, soft supple leather saddles with classic coil springs, historic Heron insignias inside the chain ring, custom wrap-around chain guards (to keep your treasured trousers from getting caught up), brass and copper etched nameplates, retro white tip fin fenders, brass bell, and removable wicker basket with handle to take shopping with you. The attention to detail is incredible. And this bike rides just as beautiful as it looks-from the smooth-shifting 7-speed drivetrain to the Superbe' s relaxed position that allows you to see what's up ahead and stop easily to smell the roses. The classic, low step-thru steel frame allows you to get on and off the bike easily, even in a skirt. The look and feel are indeed, in a word, superb.",
