Wheels are great 4. Easy to push and maneuver 5. Easy to fold 6. Includes cup holder which is a plus Cons: 1. After folding the lock is hard to push in and open 2. Using the feet to fold can be a little tricky",

      "text": "We purchased this stroller for our trip to WDW and we couldn't be happier. It's lightweight, folds up tight for use on the resort transportation busses and it was comfortable for our two kids (4 and 2). The 5 point harness buckles worked well when the kids were napping and the canopy is generous to keep out the Florida sun. It was also great for the airports. Just fold it up and checked it at the gate. Storage is good in this stroller too. It has 4 total pockets that held everything we needed in the parks. Ponchos, extra jackets and sun hats. Very pleased with this purchase!",

The only thing I don\u2019t like is that I have to take off the cup holder in order to get through a doorway but other than that, it\u2019s a lifesaver when I need to go out with both kids without my husband! The turn radius is great and it maneuvers very well. I like that each seat can recline independently and the shade is sufficient enough to cover their face and part of their body. Folds very easily and leaves great trunk space compared to other double strollers. Great product for the price!",

When my twins turned one, I knew they would want to ride side-by-side and also I was tired of lugging around my front/back double stroller (it's huge). This stroller is great - it folds up so small that we can store it in our coat closet, we can throw it into either of our cars easily (with plenty of space to spare) and it will great for an upcoming plane ride we have. Additionally, our 3.5 year old can sit in it too. I was worried about storage space since there is no basket underneath, but the mesh pockets have been working out fine!",

This fit the bill. It does squeak occasionally (like others have complained) and is not the most sturdy stroller (my kids love to lean forward in it), but again it is perfect for travel and really easy to collapse.",

(This bugs me ) -the handle bars are far apart -barely fits through a door. Can\u2019t really help it since it\u2019s a side by side design. -heavier than I thought",
