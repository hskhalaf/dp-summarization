After 6 months of use headphones already wont work, I bought an extended warranty so will see where that gets me. Even if they send me another pair the same thing will happen, these are by far and away the biggest pieces of junk.",

Comfort is good for workout headphones, there is a nice add on to having the cord for when the battery runs out. These headphones are great could use some tweaks but since the price drop they are ok, at least I'm not planning to return them.",

They stay on your head tough workouts. I now mostly use them for workouts only as I have bought a pair of Beats Studio Wireless. They are great for the price and pair easily with most smartphones.",

Don't hesitate, get them. They're worth every single penny.",

When it comes to wireless on-ear headphones that are sweat-proof there aren't too many options and that's why I'm thankful monster made these. They have a very secure fit and are pretty much guaranteed to stay on your head for any type of workout you're doing. Now, compared to other other monster products the sound is somewhat underwhelming, a sacrifice they made I believe to increase the durability (sweat-proof) of the headphones. The tight fit may cause a little discomfort on your ear after you've been wearing them for a while, but that's a price I'm willing to pay headphones of this caliber.",
