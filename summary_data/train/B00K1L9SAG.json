However since we were just using it for very short periods of time it did its job. The reason why I'm giving it one star is because parts of the glove have already melted and torn from perhaps 20 uses, and the gloves now garbage. The warmer oven reaches 275 degrees at most so we certainly did not use it in an environment that is too hot or beyond its stated capabilities. It is obviously a quality issue.",

I have some woven gloves that I've used for some time in the kitchen but their issue is that they can't handle steam or liquid. These gloves solve that problem. One thing I use the woven gloves for, and these gloves will work too though not as nimbly, is to search through frozen foods in a chest freezer. The only improvement I can think of would be to make the cuffs a bit longer, though this is really not an issue. [They make a longer glove (3 inches longer) if that is what you want] Great product.",

I will say that once I feel the heat, it takes a bit for these to cool off but that\u2019s a small complaint, they serve their purpose well",

I promptly ordered a 2nd set, threw my old pair away and now have friends who have ordered them! Highly recommended! I own the original and the newer version. The original pair is a little more flexible, but the new style feel heavier duty. Both are still great!",

We cook very regularly on open flame and in smokers. In one incident, a grill exceeded 700 degrees with a faulty thermostat, and I was able to remove the grill contents without any harm to myself. I would highly recommend these for anyone looking for quality hand protection in grilling and smoking meats.",

Freedom from tongs, claws, oven mitts, etc. I Love my Gloves!!!",

I use some cast iron grills and pots and heat them to 350+ before cooking and I can use the gloves to lift them around the BBQ area. Instruction say will \"comfortably handle BBQ temps of 225-275 degrees F with intermittent heat to 400 degrees F.\" I have had no trouble moving my pots and griddles around the cooking surface. Especially like the fact they are long and cover my lower arm which sometimes comes in contact with the pot. Great price and great customer service from the company.",

Later, I decided to try the ultimate test and while the coals were glowing, I picked up the bottom grate. Still no heat felt through the gloves. I thought for sure I would have melted the exterior of the gloves but no melting, no damage done. The gloves are terrific, very pleased with the purchase.",

These industrial looking gloves allow you to use your hands on wet foods that would soak into cloth gloves or towels and that spells burns as the heat bridges the insulative properties of the cloth and gets to your skin. I am able to pick up, turn over, and shred a 8 pound pork shoulder shortly after taking it off the grill with these gloves. The long cuffs can be folded down easily, or left long when reaching into the barbecue oven. I love 'em!",
