The only complaint that I have is the area of the ball that was drilled for the finger holes is right where there are white swirls and the holes that are drilled are also white. I have a hard time locating the finger holes when it is my turn to bowl. I think I will need to get colored inserts that are a different color. Otherwise, performs as expected. Would buy again. Fast shipping.",
