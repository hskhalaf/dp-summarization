There is a plastic pole that supports the front that can be dangerous if they lean or jump on or near it. Overall, for the money, its worth it though. We put a pillow and all his Sesame Street Plush Characters inside and there was still room for him to crawl through. There is also rings to attach his money tunnel (also purchased on Amazon). The price is right, and it looks awesome with his Elmo Couch! If your child loves Sesame Street, get it !",
