For reference, my cup size is 36B, waist is 29inch and hips are 41inch. I typically wear size 8 in jeans/shorts. I bought a size large and since I\u2019m so short (5\u20192) I think next time I\u2019ll go with a medium because there\u2019s a tiny bit of extra fabric BUT STILL oh my gosh guys, this suit is amazing. I want one in every color. For $20 are you kidding me? This suit is a dream.",

I feel like they run large while the top runs small. I\u2019m 5\u20193, 130# and ordered a medium. I bought the white/green suit and the all black so that I can mix the tops with my other bottoms. Will probably wear the bottoms in my backyard but I wish they had more elastic to keep them in position. Too is cute and comfy with removable padding.",

I\u2019m 5\u20192 ~155 with an athletic build\u2013 I usually get M or L, I got a Large in this suit. The bottoms fit like a gem, I wish the top was little tighter, I probably could\u2019ve sized down to a medium but I needed the suit before a trip to Vegas. I will definitely purchase another color in the future. For the price, you can\u2019t beat the quality. I have suits that I\u2019ve paid 2x the cost of this set that are 1/2 the quality.",

      "text": "For reference, I am 5'7\" 36G 150 pounds. I bought this suit in size medium, based on other reviews. The bottoms fit, but the top doesn't cover enough, with a little bit of fallout. I really only wanted the bottoms anyway, so that's fine. This is a surprisingly high quality suit for the price, and I will order another in large. The cut of the bottoms is very flattering after I put on a few pounds during the pandemic. 07/10/2020 Edit: I ordered the suit in size large, and it fits perfectly! I absolutely LOVE this suit! Very comfortable and well made, and it looks great, too! Hubby approves.",

The bottoms make your butt look amazing and the bandeau is slightly padded and gives your boobs some oomph, if u know what I mean ;) no muffin top and hits right below my belly button, but I\u2019m tall so it might go higher on some",
