I have noticed I can tighten them down more and it seems to help contain them but I am not sure how comfortable that is for him.

      "text": "I like these shoes. The only draw back is they are kind of difficult to keep on a fluffy doodle because their paws tend to be a bit more narrow than most dogs. If you want to have an easier time getting your dog to keep theirs on measure their front and back paws and perhaps buy 2 and 2 that are sized for any difference. Other than that no complaints. This is a well made product.",

The only issue is the fabric is coming apart on the top and rubber is separating at the seam, but that could be because she wears them so often. But, when they do come apart will just buy another pair.",

He was laying down and would not move for 20 minutes, until I removed the boots. For that reason, I had to send them back.",
