I immediately ordered another one because dollar for dollar no other camera can produce the results I got from this small and handy powerhouse. The zoom is great at 7X optical, and 12 megapixel gives me all the resolution any normal user will ever need. Easy to use features, including an \"auto\" that does all the work for you. I can even make movies. I studied long and hard before I bought and my research paid off handsomely. I strongly recommend this product. My only suggestion is to spend the $40 for a 150X memory card for ultra-fast operation between shots.",

You can really tell the difference in the auto-focus when these features are enable. The only con I see with this camera is the awkward position of the screen and buttons. I have not found a way to comfortably take pictures with one hand. I have to hold the camera by the top and bottom edges. I would have to get fingerprints all over the screen to hold it with one hand. However, I expect this from a such a compact camera. More room would mean a larger size.",

Not so great for: When you're pretty far from something, dark-photo quality (night time, clubs, etc), presets are stupid sometimes. Guess she's gonna get a SLR for X-mas, better start saving up!
