They cannot injure other dogs while wearing it. And it is very difficult to bark, my dog (who can be very yappy) wont even attempt to bark when she has it on.

I'll probably find a way to connect it to her collar. 3 stars since I'll have to rig it but great product for the price. Only muzzle that works for a short snout big eyed pup like mine.",

It does not affect the function, it just looks a bit tired. Also, the hole for the nose is a bit big or misplaced (unsure really of why) so if she would attack a dog and the tip of an ear gets close to the hole she could actually get a hold of it. However, since there has been no other alternatives for me, I am pleased with the product. A plus is that it arrived fast.",
