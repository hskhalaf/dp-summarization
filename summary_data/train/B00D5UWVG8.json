I haven't found any beter liners and one of my cats has knives for claws. He still sometimes can make holes in these liners, but it's not bad and like I said he has crazy claws",

These are high quality thick plastic liners that really resist tearing. We are a 3 cat household and use roughly 3 inches of generic clay litter changing every 3 days. These have never failed. Not litter escapes. Just use the wide red drawstring to close and lift. No mess!! Set aside and replace; dispose of used litter with no spills and you are done in under 3 minutes",
