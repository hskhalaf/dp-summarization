The rubber loop for the lanyard clip broke within 2 months so I clipped the lanyard between the bottom two straps and it held up for another 12 months. The fit was great and not too tight or loose. I just replaced it recently thinking I\u2019d get the same fit. Nope. They switched to a harder rubber and the fit is way too tight. As soon as I strapped it to my work phone I could see the rubber turn white from the stress. We\u2019ll see how long this lasts. Disappointed.",
