A few days ago it stopped charging and I assumed the battery had expired. I thought it might be simple to get a replacement but nooooo. Sony dont do em so I guess they want you buying new equipment when what you have is perfectly ok. Cant find em on the WWW either. Very annoying.",

The Bravia engine makes for brilliant video quality and if like me you have other Sony equipment in your home you will enjoy its seamless integration. For me though the real stand out quality is its high degree of water resistance. Use it by the pool, in the bath - or wash it when it gets slightly dirty - without any worries.",

My biggest criticism of this tablet is that it drops the internet very frequently. I had to update the software a couple of times just to get minimal performance. I hate it so much I gave it to a colleague at work who works in IT to play with and experiment with viruses. Will buy IOS next time.",

Within the last month android 4.3 came out for the experia Z and it fixed all issues and made it a very user friendly tablet and a great competitor for Apple's Ipad!",

The battery life is really good, considering it's only 6000mAh. It holds the full day while continuously on wifi, browsing, playing games, etc. After the 4.3 update, the launcher and the whole experience is even better, as it became smoother and faster.

Overall the performance is great. Only thing I would have liked to see was little locking clips for when the flaps are open, other then that, as long as the flaps are closed, you can wash the tablet along with the dirty dishes.",

It is very quick, captures WiFi really well (I am doing this rating from a bar in cape Verde Islands off west coast of Africa with no problems at all) People with other makes namely the ones that start with a letter begining with something you see out of are having trouble with their devices. In summary, I would recomend Sony to anyone who is thinking of changing its brilliant!!",

    "description": "Size Name:16GB| Colour Name:Black\n\nSONY XPERIA Z 10.1 INCH TABLET\nAT A GLANCE\nThe Xperia Tablet Z is bursting with innovation. Experience a stunning colour spectrum from the 10.1\" HD Reality Display -- a first among tablets -- and razor-sharp, super-bright images thanks to BRAVIA TV technology from Sony. \n\nWeighing just less than 500g, with a thickness of only 6.9mm, the Xperia Tablet Z is an incredibly light and slim 10-inch tablet. It also resists water and dust, making it an ideal companion on all your travels. \n\nSharing data couldn't be easier: with Near Field Communication (NFC) and Bluetooth technology it only takes one touch to transfer photos or music to other NFC-enabled devices -- such as the Xperia smartphone from Sony. \n\nIN DETAIL\nFULL HD REALITY DISPLAY\nEnjoy crystal-clear, cinema-like viewing wherever you go: the Xperia Tablet Z with its 10.1\" Full HD Reality Display delivers unrivalled colour control and saturation. Add to this real-time contrast optimisation and sharpness enhancement thanks to the Mobile BRAVIA Engine 2, and S-Force 3D surround sound that will blow you away.\n\nWATER AND DUST-RESISTANT\nYour ideal companion wherever you are: the Xperia Tablet Z resists both water and dust with a rating of IP55/IP57. So you're free to take it everywhere -- even in the bath. This robust, lightweight tablet survives more than splashes -- it can withstand being submerged for up to 30 minutes. \n\nLIGHT AND SLIM \nThe Xperia Tablet Z is incredibly light and slim. At less than 500g and 6.9mm, it weighs about as much as a notepad and is as thin as a pencil, so it slips easily into any bag, making it ideal for life on the move.\n\nCONNECTED ENTERTAINMENT\nXperia Tablet Z brings you more than a tablet experience. We've used our broad expertise in consumer electronics to design an Android tablet that's ready for another level of connection. Xperia Tablet Z can control other devices, share content between screens and act as the ideal companion to your TV experience. So you can change the channels on your TV while you tweet. Want to see your memories on the big screen? Choose a photo on your HD tablet, then share it to the TV with One-touch mirroring. No cables, no buttons, no confusion. Just the content you want, wherever you want it. \n\n*As confirmed by Strategy Analytics on 4th February 2013.\n\nPRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS\nWeight: 495g. Dimensions: 266 x 172 x 6.9mm.
