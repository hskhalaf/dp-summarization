I also had an issue where the unit just jammed and the wheels would not extend, finally I got round it but I had a very frustrating 20 minutes. The design could benefit from allowing it to roll when folded, (transporting it) unfortunately you have to carry it like a baby or hang onto it like a really heavy shopping cart. I have kept this only because I didn't find a better design out there but this one could use improvements.",

I agree with others, if you want something little more sturdy replace the smaller wheels with slightly larger rubberized ones. I honestly have not had a problem but I move in and out of elevators a lot and the smaller wheels tend to get caught and you have to kinda do the lift and pull into the elevator. Larger rubberized wheels would definitely be better.",

I highly recommend that you keep a few bungee cords with it to secure your loads. Easily folds by pushing the fold button and the wheels tuck in for flat transport. *Make sure your watch your fingers as this baby can pinch your fingers if you are not paying attention when it collapses.",

There is a easy modification you can do at home to fix this problem if you find it bothersome. Basically the bottom part of the \"L\" pivots too far, and you loose leverage to tip the cart back.
