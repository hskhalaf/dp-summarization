Not sure if this is the result of a firmware upgrade or not. Trying to get some help from Nest support but have been on hold for several hours and have tried multiple times - they are useless.

Only thing I would recommend beyond this is a 3rd party plate like the POPMAS copper plate I bought here from Amazon. The neat comes with a super cheap plastic plate that will look terrible. If you\u2019re going to spend $200-250 on a Nest, do spend another $20 on the plate. (See pics)",

Therefore you are sweltering before the second stage kicks in. For heat you can only turn on emergency heat at the thermostat not via the app. Again it\u2019s dumb.

It will tell you when you have the temperature set in an eco friendly range. You can also set it up to notify you when your electric provider has surge pricing enabled so that you can save money then. Our bill has soberly seen savings since getting this. We also put the thermostat in ourselves. It take probably 30 minutes, which is not bad but you should have minor repair and home improvement skills. Also, double check on Nest's website that your system is compatible with this thermostat. Not everyone's is.",

It cycles the air much better, it senses the ambient temperature with way more accuracy than those old mercury thermostats that suddenly got triggered when you move by them.

      "text": "The only reason I purchased this was because my apartment's thermostat location is behind my TV. The heat from my TV was causing the thermostat to read up to 5 degrees higher than the rest of the room. I replaced the original thermostat with the Nest, and then purchased Nest's remote sensor and placed it on the other side of the room. In 1 month I cut my electric bill in half because my air conditioner wasn't running as much. Plus the other features of this thermostat are great. I never thought I'd pay $200+ for a dang thermostat but the savings will help pay for itself, plus AEP is giving $100 rebates for electric furnaces.",

The device overrides my choices and while I am away, it wastes crazy amounts of energy. The exact oppposite of its purported design. 3 trusted contractors have told me to remove them as they refuse to use them. I will not promote another device other than to say, the nest thermostat is a major disappointment and a complete waste of money.",

      "text": "Initially installing this device was a pain. I failed at it twice, and then it somehow started working on the third try. The first two times the device caused my HVAC to blow heat nonstop. But after the third time it mostly works as expected. I can control it from my Google Assistant and Google Home app. Not sure if it's a setting, but sometimes I'll set the AC to a certain temperature and then come back an hour later and it's set itself to an even lower temperature. Fun device if you want your home to be \"Smart\" but just know there's still room for improvement with this device.",

It will only adjust the thermostat. I only have one thermostat in my house and it is downstairs, so I felt I needed this. I do wish it was less expensive.",

    "description": "Color:Stainless Steel| Style:Thermostat OnlyThe Nest Learning Thermostat is a smart thermostat that learns your schedule and programs itself to help save energy. You can control it from anywhere with the Nest app, and it works with Alexa and Google Assistant so you can adjust the temperature with your voice. And it\u2019s beautifully designed, with a big, bright display and metal finishes to suit any home\u2019s style.[1] Remote control and mobile notifications require working internet and Wi-Fi.
