      "text": "Had purchased a single bed rail for my older son a few years ago and liked the quality, so I purchased two of these double bed rails because my twins were transitioning into twin beds. They were easy enough to put together, but the tricky part was getting them on the box spring and then adding the mattress...which I struggled with by myself. But once I got it figured out for the first bed, the second one was operational in minutes. My 2 1/2 year olds are rough on things, but these are very durable, and strong as well. We often put them in the same bed to sleep because they sleep better and the rails have never failed",

      "text": "Generally the quality of the product is good, but it has big design issue. If the frame of the bed is not flush with the base (base is deeper), then this will not fit inside the frame, and putting the plastic parts out of frame makes it too bad for several reasons; 1st, both sides stick out, so bed becomes wider without any use, 2nd, the metal bars still go deeper to reach the base, which means the whole rail gets inclined toward the middle of the bed, instead of being vertical, and finally, 3rd, the mattress sits only on metal bars, so it is both a little uncomfortable on the surface, plus it is getting damaged.",
