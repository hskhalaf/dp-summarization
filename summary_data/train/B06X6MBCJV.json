With some skepticism I ordered this and assumed I would not be greatly amazed. HOWEVER I was wrong. With the same razor I always use and without changing the blade and I didn\u2019t change the fact that I shave in the shower this shave cream gave me the closest shave EVER without any rash, or burn to my delicate baby face. I am impressed and will now make this a part of my regime. Congratulations MARLOWE",

It rinses off easily and completely. My face doesn't feel tight or dry after I shave. Provides ample lubrication for my various choices of razors. The price was reasonable, though I'm concerned that the tube won't last quite as long as other brands. Only time will tell though :)",
