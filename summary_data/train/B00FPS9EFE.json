Since I don't like the verisimo coffee pod (they are priced way high) much, I use the verisimo milk pod and CBTL coffee pod on this machine. I love the design of the machine, it is very neat.",

      "text": "When brewing regular coffee, it works great! For some reason known only to Howard Schultz, the machine spews out decaf coffee grounds around the time it is halfway through the brewing cycle. The end result is a grimy, mini-grounds filled cup of coffee which is virtually worthless no mater how long you stir it. When I inspect the spent pod and compare it to a regular coffee one, there is a second puncture point. Since I am off caffeine per doctor's orders, look for my Verismo in the for sale cheap section.",

It's one of those products where you can't help but wonder if they development team even tried it out because everything tastes so bad. It also only makes small servings that are expensive and the machine, despite looking simple, still isn't all that user friendly. Get a different single cup brewer, you'll be glad you didn't buy this one.",
