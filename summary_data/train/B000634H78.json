I wish it had sprung the leak before I stocked it....spending over $300 today on supplies for appropriate rehoming while I deal with the manufacturer.",

It really doesn't serve a purpose other than hindering access to your tank. I was also barely able to fit a few pieces of my hardscape through the lid openings so if you have large pieces of stone/driftwood you may run into an issue.",

The top opening is designed for the light (w/o bulb) housing. Rear cut outs service the filter and air hoses. Cautions: the space for top access is limited. There is little room for a heat lamp or algae UV filter if needed. The lamp case fits perfectly, but a different lamp style would certainly work as well.
