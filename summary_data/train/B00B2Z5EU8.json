The odor is something more chemical than wood and does not seem to be dissipating much in the three weeks we have had it assembled. If that is something that will bother you, I'd advise you to steer clear. Assembly was fairly easy - done primarily by one person with light assistance from a second to hold things up or in place for securing. As with other Home Styles products, the directions are minimalist and could be significantly better.",

The bed is also not truly white. The frame is really low to the ground, and I don't think it's going to last more than a few years.",
