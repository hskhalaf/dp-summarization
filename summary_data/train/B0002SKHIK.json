Luckily, the case was so tough, that in spite of their attempts to gain entry, they were unsuccessful in prying it open. When they were called on their lawlessness, they paid for a new one so I wouldn't cause any trouble for the damage they did to the case. That legendary ruggedness is exactly why I chose to replace it with the exact same thing, and this new one lives up to that reputation quite well. You cannot buy a tougher case for this price.",

Enough space for two or three mirrorless bodies and four or five lenses as well as flash etc. Useful not only for travel (rollaboard) but also for at home storage of a camera system. Padded dividers are a bit more expensive than the pullout foam version but much faster to use and easier to reconfigure. Pull out foam version might be best for a very stable system but the padded dividers are more flexible.",

I travel all over the USA and Canada driving one way and flying the other. Baggage handlers have damaged a couple bags so I decided to go big or go home. First trip out barely a scuff. It is perfect size and is lighter than it looks. Most of my co-workers and several friends in other fields use this case and claim you can't break it by accident. I am confident my tools are safe with Pelican.",
