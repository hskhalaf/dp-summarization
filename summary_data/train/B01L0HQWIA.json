I\u2019m especially glad that the broad toe-strap is wide enough to accommodate the bunions on both of my feet. I had almost given up on all sandals that didn\u2019t have thongs or toe-rings. So glad I discovered this brand! I\u2019m looking forward to wearing these all summer and into the fall. Liked these so much I bought a second pair in black, and they\u2019re my new go-to sandals for work and going out.",
