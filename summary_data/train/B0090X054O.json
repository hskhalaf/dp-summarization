      "text": "The treadmill itself is great. Nothing new to add to other reviews. Three things though: 1. Check the box before you accept delivery. First box from Amazon was crushed and ripped open. Refused delivery, contacted customer service, second box great. 2. Belt completely unlubricated from the factory. Check and lube before you use the treadmill. 3. Factory roller size set to wrong diameter in computer (6.4\"). Manual also incorrectly says 6.38\". The treadmill has a 6.75\" roller. Set it to correct size if indicated speed and distance matters to you. A too-small roller setting will make the treadmill too fast for indicated speed.",

He has a basement workout area, with a normal basement ceiling, and his height (6+ ft) is no problem. He lifts the platform up when he is not using it, so it doesn't feel imposing in the room, and it works as well there as ours still does at our house. My husband does the occasional maintenance on the tread, I think it is less often than once a year, but probably based on mileage. Great feeling surface to run on.",

I plan to use this 1.0 mile in the morning before going to work and 1.5 mile in the evening after work. This cuts down jogging in the elements and much more convenient. Very pleased!",

So if you trying walking and holding onto front handles especially during incline, it is impossible, unless you want to bend. You only could hold side handles. This problem is only significant when you want to use front handles. If you only run or don't mind to use side handles than its fine. Otherwise I'm very satisfied with quality of treadmill.",
