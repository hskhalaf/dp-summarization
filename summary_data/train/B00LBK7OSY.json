That means it's already paid for itself like 40 times over. 4 stars cause the locking mechanisms are finger nail busters (gotta be a better way, right?) and it's just slightly too big to comfortably fit in any of my pockets. The lanyard kills your neck if you keep a phone in there. Not really problems when you consider that it does what it's intended to do. I don't think I would trust this submerged in water for hours, but it'll save you when you have that uh oh moment while on the water. That and Joto Bag is fun to say.",

Once you put the phone in the case underwater, the pressure makes the plastic press on the phone screen, and my phone goes haywire. It's like someone is pressing buttons all over the screen. The one time I was able to get it to work, the picture quality was terrible. I was really disappointed that I couldn't take photos while snorkeling, but I guess that was never promised in the item description. I will probably look for another product that does this.",

But upon pulling out the paper towel, there wasn\u2019t even a hint of moisture on the inside. Also, I have an iPhone XR and was concerned about the facial recognition, but after putting my phone in the case and testing, everything worked great. Even was able to still take great pictures.

Even if it\u2019s a simple beach day laying in the sand, it\u2019s nice to have this protector. Works perfect! And tested it underwater. I love the neck strap! Super helpful. I\u2019m thinking of attaching my own though because the connecting strap to the phone is really thin! It has been reliable, but I will definitely be using my own lanyard",

Check. Can still use the touchscreen? Yes, though the water can make you prone to the touchscreen registering taps in the wrong area... physics, right? Camera clarity? Clear, though the air gap between your phone and the bag, combined with the water on the outside, will naturally cause your image to look a bit hazy when the sun reflects through the water. Is the strap trustworthy? Absolutely. All in all, for the price, you really cannot beat this. Love it!",

It also fits and works for the iPhone 7, you could still press the power button through the plastic to turn the screen on and then you just have to turn on assistive touch by going to settings<general<accessibility<assistive touch on. Also another tip: before sealing the phone, make sure to get all the air out so you have a nice snug fit around your phone.",

I returned it and ordered another green.",
