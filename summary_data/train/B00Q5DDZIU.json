You can't use the internal playback mode without embarrassingly slow / jittery and out of sync video play-back. Sound is better although you will need to you the multi-cable output to an amp and speakers to descent quality. The HDMI input is a MUCH better option, and the screen quality and contrast is surprisingly good for a unit of this type and size. However, I am sure you will find a better one at around \u00a3400. Thankfully, I only paid half of that.",

      "text": "Very compact and light weight. No UK plug, some ridiculous large converter contraption to change to UK plug that makes the plug larger than the projector and therefore cannot fit in the carry bag, which is way too small to fit this in and a hdmi lead which sadly is not supplied either which I would expect at this price. The carry bag is not very well padded either: I assume Optoma are confident in the robustness of their product - time will tell. If you are selling a product in the UK then it should be fit for purpose in the UK. Petty penny pinching just takes the shine off what is an excellent mini projector.",

It coped well with movies and games (GTA4, wokfenstein and COD). The screen size can be stretched to 100 inch at a push, but 80 is probably best. The speakers are very weak, connecting an external speaker is a bit of a faff as you need to use a multipurpose cable, it is a shame it does not have Bluetooth connectivity as standard, I hate cables trailing all over the place.

It's tiny, it's bright, and if you pair it with a standard tripod, it becomes wonderfully simple in terms of set up, even if you have to move it round your house a lot. Only downside is the focusing can be a bit uneven and fade off towards the edges. When you're watching a movie, this isn't really a problem, if you use this projector as a computer monitor for lots of text, then you're better off with a screen, or a more expensive projector.",
