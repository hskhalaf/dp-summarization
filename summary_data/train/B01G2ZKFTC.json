      "text": "I purchased one of these in Oct 2017. I did really enjoy how it worked, when it worked. After about two months, it would not hold a charge anymore, so no heat, no vibration. It was basically a textured lacrosse ball. I just figured I had bad luck on the purchase. I bought a second one just a couple weeks ago, because I did like the way it worked. I\u2019ve used it leas than three weeks and now it won\u2019t vibrate. At all. I\u2019m sorry to say, this is junk.",

I am finding it very difficult to actually apply the ball to specific pain points in a therapeutic way. Wish I hadnt spent the $$.",

Not round with weird grooves. The more surface area to potentially come in contact with the tissue, the better it will be at manipulating tissue. It needs to be a full ball. Also, the vibration really let me down. This vibration is for putting you to sleep, not for actually getting into muscle and helping with relieving \"tight spots\". The heat was nice and i think it heats the best it could. Overall, I should have bought a lacrosse ball and a portable battery charger from ROSS.",
