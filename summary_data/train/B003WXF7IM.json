It arrived in perfect condition and all my husband had to do was assemble, which took no time at all!! The packaging was killer, Coaster definitely wanted to make sure nothing happened to the plant stand while in transit! Also, if someone was strapped for space, this plant stand could double as a bedside table (this would have come in handy when I lived in my condo!). I would DEFINITELY recommend!!!",

BUT BEWARE it states the color as being cappuccino which like the rest of my furniture in that color is black... This stand is basically dark cherry..... there is nothing in my house that is dark cherry!!... SO as you can imagine I am very disappointed.....darn it !! so 3 stars for not being the color I needed..... if it had been some sort of shade of black then it would of been 5 stars....",
