The problem has only gotten worse, now my wife 150 pounds and I 220 pounds each sleep in our own divots in the bed and we both wake with a backache most days. Today I woke with shooting pains due to the poor support. For the price I didn't expect it to last 10 years, but six months is ridiculous. I wish more people would post longer term reviews than these reviews immediately after purchase, they are really misleading. Will be ordering another mattress.",

If anyone\u2019s been complaining in the posts, I\u2019d guess it\u2019s mostly problems with foundation upon which the mattress lays, rather than the mattress itself.

      "text": "I was initially very excited with the look & seeming quality of this mattress, but it fell very short of the description quickly. After 90+ hours of decompressing we still had a pucker & 2\"-3\" less of height than was promised. The mattress felt hard & unyielding, very uncomfortable to us. Would I buy it again? No. I got a refund from Amazon who handled the problem expertly & professionally. If I had the money & could do it over again, I would choose another high quality pillow top mattress that gives support & feels good to lay on immediately. The whole process of leaving it for days to decompress & air out is a pain!",

      "text": "I am approx 118lbs and am a side/back sleeper. I thought the 8\" would be sufficient but I need more cushion to fall into. Maybe the weight has something to do with it, thus the reason I provided the information. I like it a little firm thus my choice for going with the 8\" but now that I've had it for a couple of weeks, I know. I think the quality is great for the price and the guarantee is competitive with Casper and T&N. That says a lot about a company. The mattress didn't take long to reach full thickness. I'm going to go to Lowe's and try out the 10\" Tuft and Needle before I make another decision.",

I bought the 12\" again under the presumption that it was softer than the 10\". It hasn't expanded more than 10\" anyway and is only 8\" in the corners. (Today is Wednesday, received Saturday) AND IT STINKS. HORRIBLE! I come up the stairs from outside and the whole loft is stinking from the bed. Biggest mistake ever",

      "text": "I love this mattress! I admit I was kind of scared about buying a mattress I couldn't try before purchase, but decided with the low price point if it didn't work out I could replace it in a few months. I am not a large or super strong woman, but I was quite capable of getting the mattress into my house and set up by myself. Within 2 hours of setting up, the mattress was at least 95% expanded. I did not notice any odor from the mattress. I have found this mattress to be the most comfortable and no longer wake up with hip and shoulder pain from sleeping on my side.",
