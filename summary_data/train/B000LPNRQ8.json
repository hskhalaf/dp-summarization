If your guitar is deeper than 4\" this case will squash it a bit. The pictures show an item that is 4.5 inches and what happens when it's placed in the case and the top is closed. When they measured the internal depth, they were not too careful...I hope this helps them fix the description. I'm still looking for a case to fit my 1856 Torres model.",

I bought a Cordoba Cadete 3/4 guitar shortly after ordering the case, and the Cadete fits like the case was made for it - no movement at all in the case.",

      "text": "Ordered twice and both times this nice guitar case came in a box with no packaging besides a plastic bag and empty large box. Opened to find seams on both split and wooden box split as well. Combo or because of quality of case plus poor shipment? I don\u2019t know. Case itself overall is what we wanted but quality control is not upheld in workmanship or shipping. Disappointed daughter as it was supposed to be her bday gift gift. Reviewed a lot of these before paying $15-20 more for this one as it looked sturdiest. Back to the drawing board.",

It did not disappoint....perfect fit for my new Washburn R45RCE Resonator w/ cutaway. My guitars dimensions are: Lower bout - 14 3/8\", Upper bout -10.5\", Body depth - 3.75\", Body length - 19.5\", Overall Length - 39\". This case is lightweight, which is nice because the resonator is pretty heavy. It gives better protection than a padded gig bag, is lockable and seems well made. I'm very pleased with the price, which is about $25 less than the Washburn case made for the guitar.",

I bought one from another dealer- the dimensions said it would fit, but it was described as a classical guitar case. The dimensions were correct, but the \"shape\" was slightly different and the upper bouts were too tight. This case fit perfectly.",
