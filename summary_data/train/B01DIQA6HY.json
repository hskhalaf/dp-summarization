Given the price and supposed quality of these shoes, I'm extremely disappointed. I should note that our previous pair was bought in a local shoe store. This makes me wonder if the quality is different for those being sold through Amazon. Based on our experience, I would strongly advise against buying these here.",

The only thing I don't like is how low the shoe sits on his foot. Whenever he takes his shoes off once he gets home, they are full of rocks, dirt, and pebbles. We live in the mountainous region of Arizona, and I'm hoping these shoes can hold up to the three times a day my child has recess at school. Other than that, I highly recommend it for everyday school and play.",

Plae's foot support is great, the sole goes up to provide generous toe protection. Love that the tabs are replacable. And fabric is awesome.

They also let in alot of dirt in comparison to the other shoes she has. She then ended up with blisters so I gave up and bought her a different pair.",

      "text": "They're made to fit kids' feet...wider in the toe box, narrower in the arch and heel. My son scrubs his shoes on the ground on the big toe when riding his bike or playground activities...it's his brake...so having the extra rubber there helps lengthen the life of the shoe. I've seen reviews where others have complained about how long the shoes last...we've not noticed that. Kids grow out of shoes so fast. And, just like adults, if your kids have more than one pair, and the shoes have a chance to dry out between wearings, then they last longer overall.",
