      "text": "Very helpful for travel/hiking places where water quality is an issue. Gives you peace of mind if traveling overseas, and would also be great for hikers who may need to drink from streams or something. You do have to use a decent amount of suction to get the straw to work, but it is easier than drinking a thick milkshake. The bottle did drip a teeny bit occasionally, so you do want to store it upright when full. That's the main reason I only gave it 4 stars - it would be nice to be able to throw it in a backpack or tote and be confident it won't leak.",

You do have to be good a sucking... as your mouth suction is the \"power\" which draws the water thru the two stage filter. I didn't have a real issue doing it... but the wife couldn't seem to bothered to do it often. I personally; think this would be a good product for emergency usage for hurricane alley... but YMMV.",

You can drink fairly rapidly despite having to suction the water through all the filaments. The carabiner makes it easy to clip anywhere I want to carry it. Other reviews were concerned about the distance between straw and bottom; for me, there was not enough distance to make a difference in its effectiveness. I wouldn't have given it thought if I hadn't seen reviews about it, honestly. I would get this item again.",

Rinsing the filter with bottled water helps with the chlorine taste so I feel that now I need to buy a faucet filter so I don't keep using water bottle water for rinsing. This also doesn't filter viruses so it would not prevent all waterborne illnesses.",

Fun tip: Pack some coffee grinds and put them in there. The filter will remove the coffee grinds but leave the flavor. If the local water is already cold, you've got a great source of cold brew. The downside is that you'll ONLY have cold brew until you clean it out so you've gotta watch out for caffeinating.",

My only complaints are that it is definitely harder to suck through than most filter bottles and it leaks quite a lot. If you ever have elevation or heat change the water that is still in the filter pipe pushes its way up and out of the top even with the straw is down. Makes for a very leaky experience - which is a bummer since I got it to replace a another brand due to leaks.",
