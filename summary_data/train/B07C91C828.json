I purchased these due to recent recurrence of plantar fasciitis - I wear them after running, and nearly all the time walking in house [I was advised to limit barefoot walking]. These have really helped me, as my plantar fasciitis issues have improved. The cushioning is fantastic - takes a lot of stress off the foot, especially on hard flooring. I wouldn't say the raised nodes on the sole do much (in terms of any kind of massaging of the feet), but I don't particularly care.",
