I can be twenty feet away from my brother who's playing call of duty and the microphone will pick up more or less everything. Other than the microphone this is a great headset - the wireless feature is outstanding. I can go up to my second floor from my basement and still get clear sound which blows my mind. Overall, I recommend this headset when it's on sale (I got it for $93)",

The issue is with the lack of mic feedback when using xbox chat. Without the xbox cable plugged in, you can hear yourself talk, which makes things sound less muffled (so you don't yell while talking to friends). The second you plug the cable in, however, that feature is disabled :(",

If youre willing to spend a bunch more money you might find something with better surround sound but for the price, you can't beat it.",

The problem with the F540 is that the sidetone is so loud that you can hear every single thing happening around you: your breathing, you scratching yourself, you moving in your chair, opening drawers... and you can't disable sidetone, so you constantly hear white noise and all the sounds around you. Too bad because the headset itself is comfortable. The sidetone just makes this product unusable.",

I did not like many of the Turtle Beach's fit. The sound quality also is superb; surround sound makes it easy to hear where other players are when playing Call of Duty or other first person shooters.
