We were both died in the wool SLR users and had Leicas, but when the first digitals started to appear we tried them out. Our first was a bulky Sony which we loved, but the first Exilim that we spied we tried and we have never gone back. This newest one seems to have the best picture quality, ease of use and a great screen. We can't wait for the next big trip to try it out.",

To stop the zoom anywhere between the full zoom and no zoom is extremely frustrating; the zoom motor is just too fast and there is no way to easily fine-tune where you want to stop the zoom. Otherwise the camera is good. Very portable, very good picture quality. Overall I give it 3 stars.",

Unlike the simpler point-and-shoots, this camera isn't that simple. Once you get the hang of it, though, it's fast, powerful, and takes great pictures. But, if you want a total point-and-shoot, and you really don't want to figure out anything, then get a simpler, and cheaper, one, though I think the $$ value of this camera is pretty dang good!",
