Normally, the KTM Dukes run 2 bars from the top of the temp gauge. Mine was running 3 bars from the top with the Engine Ice, and then when I was revving her up a bit, would hit 2 bars before max temp, fan came on but only for a very short time before turning off again. This is AMAZING!!!! Normally the fan runs way longer and sooner. This stuff definitely works and I love that it is non-toxic!!!",

Normally I get off highway take back roads and use to hit halfway mark on gauge and fan kicks on once gone after 3 miles back roads. Now its just above the 1/4 mark and fan doesnt kick on once home.
