      "text": "This was the most comfortable pair of sneakers I have ever owned. They\u2019re the lightest and most comfortable sneakers. One month after purchase, while walking down the street, I thought something was stuck to the bottom of my shoe. Lifting my foot up I noticed that a big chunk of tread had been ripped off. This was very disappointing. It makes walking difficult if not impossible with the tread missing. It looks as if the adhesive holding the tread to the bottom sole is ineffective and flimsy. I did nothing other than a mild walk on flat level ground. This should not have happened. Hopefully the next one I purchase will have this issue fixed.",

I have a tough hike coming up and I bought these to train for it and I took it on ONE 10 mile hike and the bottoms were worn down completely and one sole was coming off. The lettering inside the shoe was completely erased but that's just aesthetic, the worrisome part was the soles coming off after one hike. I had my shoes for one week and they looked like I had them for 6 years. This shoe did not perform and I would never purchase these again. I returned them and bought different Merrells",

The fit and feel of these shoes were great, but I was really shocked at how fast and how completely they fell apart because I have had Merrells before and really liked them.",

They are true to size (he wears an 11 EE in New Balance shoes and an 11 in everything else) and fit right out of the box. They drain very well and offer a ton of support. He wears them without socks in the pool. I will update this review if we have any wear issues as other reviewers have had. Cheers to Merrell for yet another amazing shoe!",

Completely disappointing and I wish I had done more research. Find something else.",
