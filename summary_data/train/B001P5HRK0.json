      "text": "Well built frame. Bought it for my grandpa and he loves it. We bust it out at all the family gatherings now. Unlike most ladderball games, this one is metal, so it won't crack and will last a long time. However, after just a few uses on grass, one of the balls has a small split and is slowly leaking sand. We can always make some more legit ones with golfballs, but it's kind of annoying how this thing is such a great quality with a nice carrying case and the balls break so easily.",

Though it come with a bag for storage and travel, we usually leave one assembled all summer and leave it in the camper.

Portable games like these are classic and entertain kids and adults for hours at a picnic, party, or just for practice in the backyard.
