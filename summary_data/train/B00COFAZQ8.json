I am looking forward to the ability to handle up to 17\" with this saw. IT IS VERY HEAVY!!! The base is a little smaller than I would like as I was leary of it possibly tipping so I made a dolly for it that is 4 to 6 inches larger than the base, is on wheels and has the saw bolted to its 3/4\" plywood base. Locating replacement or supplemental blades can be a challenge due to the long size of the blades.",

I have plenty of experience with other the setup and use of other bandsaw and was completely shocked at how terrible this machine is. There is a reason these anniversary editions are still for sale. Nobody is buying.",

I have read through the manual from front to back and even tried reading it upside down. All the diagrams show this bearing positioned the way it is installed but again, it doesn't do anything. Can someone please tell me what is the deal with this?",

Be assured that the Grizzly technicians know Grizzly tools well and are trusted advisers whenever I've had a question. This is an excellent band saw and will provide many years of excellent service!",

I called the company and they said they would send me a new guide post which I received a week later but it was the wrong type of guide post. So I had to make my own readjustments for the blade guard to hold properly on the guide post. But overall, the machine is strong and durable. I would like to be a customer for Grizzly but it doesn't look like a promising future with them.",
