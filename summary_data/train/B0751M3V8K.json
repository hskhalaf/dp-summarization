The starter cord cover is made of plastic and at least 2 of the 4 bolt holes (bottom side) that hold this unit to the engine were busted. This resulted in the first pull of the starter cord disengaging the cord from the starter. Other than that, balance was okay, but I would say that the \"handlebars\" are a little wide for a shorter person with a shorter arm span (I'm 5'6\" tall), as I found it somewhat uncomfortable to hold.

Star spline connector--if you have the more common square spline attachments, they won't hook-up. Spring for a better harness. It's pretty much a Stihl knock-off for guys who can't afford a Stihl.",
