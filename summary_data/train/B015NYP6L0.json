      "text": "Spoons seem well made but they are not accurate at all for measuring volume. The US and metric units stamped on each spoon are not equivelent. The tablespoon says 20 mL, but a tablespoon is supposed to be roughly 15 mL. I measured with my kitchen scale and sadly metric stamp is correct. This means you're going to get an additional 33% with each scoop from the spoon. Other units of measure were off, too, but the tablespoon was the most egregious. They seem like nice spoons and cups, but they aren't worth much if they don't measure correctly.",

Additionally, at the rivet points where the handle attaches to the cup they have started to rust after just a month of use.

Major drawback so far, however, is the measurements imprinted on the handle are hard to read. This is fairly common, however, on metalware. Otherwise, this is a good value.",
