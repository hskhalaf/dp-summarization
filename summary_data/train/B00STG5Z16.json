      "text": "I bought this (June 22, 2017). I love the stroller very easy to push, fits through standard doorways, reclining sits are amazing. I gave this a four star because there is no storage. I have a single Kolcraft Cloud stroller and it has the storage space on bottom and I love it. The other down fall which it hasn't happen to this stroller yet is that the canopy doesn't hold its shape very well. I'll keep you post on that. UPDATE...I have used several times and the canopy's are holding up great!!!",

Never thought that we would straight swap our regular double stroller (10x the price) but this stroller was bought for recent trips and has not let us down.

This would be the perfect stroller if it had storage but we use a simple stroller organizer on the handles and have been super happy!",

Both of my girls are in the 90th percentile for height and weight and fit comfortably in the stroller. The seats reclined just enough to allow naps. The stroller just barely fit through doors, every once in while we had to jiggle our way through a smaller doorway but it still fit. Best purchase for our vacation.",

We also have never had a problem fitting through any door and the maneuvering of this stroller is great!",
