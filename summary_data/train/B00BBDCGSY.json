They said there is an oil sending switch that shuts it off after 5 minutes if oil is not full and to bypass it and see if it works. Didn\u2019t work, took it to tractor supply service and they wouldn\u2019t work on it because the engine has low compression and will never work properly. I know it had oil when I started it because I work fuel oil and hydraulics for my career. Need to get champion to replace the motor.

If your plan is to have a handy gas wood splitter that takes up little floor space and cracks through any logs up to 19 inches in length, this is perfect. Assembly is easy but for one point : If the high pressure hose is hard to align to the lower connection, merely disconnect the hose at the top end, install the lower connection first, then re-connect the upper part. I've put-up two cords and this little unit works great. Put-in the engine oil and hydraulic fluid as directed, fuel-up, retire the axe and \"Happy Splitting\"",

Use ethanol stabilizer so you don't gum the carb when storing for long periods. It's pretty quiet too.",

It was missing a locknut to hold end on the hydraulic shaft and I could not find a metric locknut at our hardware store. I had to change nut and bolt to US.",

The engine pulsates as if it is running out of fuel then starts again. The motor actually stops half way through a cut and I have to restart it. I feel that the motor is cheap and it would be a better product with a Honda motor. Overall design seems to be good, just a weak motor that can\u2019t keep up. Maybe I will go back to using my axe.",

    "title": "Champion 7-Ton Compact Horizontal Gas Log Splitter with Auto Return",
    "description": "The Champion Power Equipment 90720 7-Ton Horizontal Gas Log Splitter is small on size but big on power. If you\u2019re looking for a quick, dependable and portable solution for log splitting, this is the unit for you. Depend on the reliable recoil start to start up the powerful Champion 80cc single-cylinder OHV engine, which features a cast-iron sleeve, a 0.4-gallon fuel tank, 0.4-quart oil capacity (recommended 10W-30) and a low-oil shutoff for safety. Never struggle to lift a large, heavy log onto your log splitter again. The low-profile design makes it much easier to load a large log onto the splitting beam, and the integrated log cradle keeps the log safely in position. This small but mighty machine handles logs up to 19 inches long, weighing up to 50 pounds. Seven tons of splitting capacity deliver the power you need for the job at hand. The hydraulic oil system has a 1.3-gallon oil capacity and operates at 3 gpm to power through tough logs. Champion designed this log splitter with a skewed wedge to increase splitting efficiency, plus it has a 20-second cycle time and dependable auto-return valve, which is capable of 180 cycles per hour. The 2-stage gear pump reliably adjusts flow and pressure by delivering high flow/low pressure when there is no resistance and low flow/high pressure when cutting through a log to increase productivity. This log splitter will fit easily in any truck bed, plus it\u2019s easy to move from one job to the next with the comfortable handle and 10-inch never-flat tires. Assembly and setup are hassle free with Champion\u2019s clear directions and thoughtful packaging. This log splitter is EPA certified and CARB compliant. Buy with confidence - our reliable support and network of service centers will back your purchase up with a 2-year limited warranty and FREE lifetime technical support.",
