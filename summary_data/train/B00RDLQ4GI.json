I ordered them, and they are an excellent alternative at 1\u20442 the price of the OXO brand. I'm very satisfied.",

You can close them fast so it makes a satisfying sound, and then use that sound to act like your going to grab your child's nose and chase them around the kitchen while they scream and run to mommy but then you start doing it to momma and they start screaming louder then your wife gives you a look like \"Really! Now I have to deal with this screaming kid while you get to walk away and dinner better be ready soon or so help me God!\"",

      "text": "Update: Second time around purchasing these tongs because I loved them so much the first time. Made the mistake of leaving them in the restaurant for the rest of the team to use so they ended up disappearing. Both of them. I use the smaller tongs on the line and the larger tongs stay tucked away comfortable in my bag. If you arent careful then the rubber grips will come loose, but I've managed to keep mine on so far by simply paying attention and taking care. Very sturdy feel and good weight in the hand. Convenient locking mechanism makes for simple storage and looks great. I have a go-to when it comes to tongs and it's Dragonn.",

These are NOT cheaply made. They're beautifully constructed and will last me forever. They stay in the open position and have loops that I can use to hang them. The claw part will not bend like the junk tongs they sell in the supermarket. They're the 2 sizes I need most. Both pair for the right price. Very happy with this purchase.",
