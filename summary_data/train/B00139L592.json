No mention was made in the product description that the sound was bad. I have used this model of DVD player for over 10 years, so I know how it's supposed to sound. With headphones on, the sound is fine. But without headphones the sound is \"tinny\" and an unpleasant experience. I wish the product description had said something about poor sound without headphones",

But I also use it everyday at home. I don't have a TV in my bedroom, so I use this to watch/listen to movies every morning while I'm getting ready for work. After countless hours of play, this little gem is still working perfectly. I did drop the remote a few too many times, and had to replace it, but that was my fault. I would definitely purchase this Sony DVD player again, and again.",

After buying and returning other players, I found this to be the only one with sufficient volume to hear the dialog with earphones above the din of the treadmill. The controls - either remote or manual - are easy to use and the picture resolution is great. Also, the video will resume where you stopped it, even if you turn it off - something the other players won't do. Although this is not the cheapest player out there, if you're looking for a decent portable DVD Player that's easy to use, I highly recommend you look no further.",

The display has an honest 480 lines to avoid compromised picture of some other models using less than 480 lines of pixels. Machine is simple to operate. Only missing desired feature is zoom to generate larger picture when one doesn't mind losing some picture on left and right edges. Such a feature is standard on standard monitors, and may not be normal to have in dedicated small screens integrated with portable DVD player.

Power button is also hard to find and easy to accidentally press. Individual volume controls for the headphones would be great so I suggest keeping all your headphones to the same model.

My only problem is that when set to the default 16:9 widescreen, and strictly playing widescreen DVD's, some display properly (utilizing the full horizontal width) and some don't (displaying fat black bands at the left/right sides). For instance, the screen is 800x480 (a 1.66 ratio). When I play some widescreen DVD's with a 1.66 ratio they properly utilize the entire screen. And yet other widescreen DVD's with the same 1.66 ratio don't. Instead they play in a rectangle within the screen surrounded by thick black bands at top/bottom and left/right. Makes no sense.",

I love the video input/output feature as I use this as an auxiliary monitor for my Canon DSLR when it is mounted on a tripod and I can't look through the viewfinder. The only thing I wish this DVD player had is a Memory Stick Pro Duo slot so I can watch MP4s of shows exported from TiVo for my PSP. Hey Sony, are you listening?",

With this case, you can have the player fully extended (open up 180 degrees) or folded with the LCD facing out (flip open), which are the features I looked for in a case.",

The size of the screen is perfect and the really great part of this is that I can carry it in my backpack. I would recommend this product. And also, the price was good. Thank you",

Of course it is out of warranty. Sony's website offers to refurbish it for $136 (you can buy a new one for $153) what a joke. That does not include fixing the display on it which is the part that is broke. This is the second Sony item that we are not happy with. Used to love Sony, not anymore. Will have to look for a new more reliable brand.",
