They can't get the lids on and they can only usually get them off. While this works out great if I'm the one using it, it's nearly useless if I'm packing it in a school lunch, which is what its primary purpose was. I will give it 100% credit for being leak-proof, though. I filled all 6 up with water and left them in a bowl and various angles of upside down and sideways and in the morning, not a single drop had leaked out.",
