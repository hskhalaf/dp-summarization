      "text": "Our little puppy has 5 beds throughout our house and 2 of this particular one. He curls up in it and seems to love the comfort and style. He doesn't even try to chew this bed as much as some of the other ones and for the price I think it is a worthwhile purchase all around. Seems to be made well and it's cute...just like my puppy...although they look nothing alike!!",

The sides are soft which some people complained about but my dog really likes it. I like that it is lightweight as we live in hot weather and I can take it easily to put in the RV when we travel.",

My dog sheds and this material doesn't really grab on to it. It's sturdy and doesn't loosen its shape after time. I bought the medium. My dog is long bodied and 28 pds. Being reversible is another perk as well!",

Because our two cats are both large, the size of the bed is fine for them. It has worked out very well as a cat bed [despite the dog paw printing :) ] and it survived an initial soaking when it was left outside and we got a good rain. Very happy with the price and product quality.",
