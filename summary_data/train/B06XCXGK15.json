      "text": "Arrived on time and all the parts as advertised. I tested it out using a couple of cans of (relatively) cheap beer to make sure everything seals correctly and to figure out the regulator settings before trying it out on a full growler fill. Works great! Keeps the beer fresh for at least a week and probably a lot longer, but at 64oz, you'll polish off the beer before it goes flat. Gets a lot of compliments and inquisitive looks where ever I take it. Great product.",

I bought a second keg ($29.00), so I could enjoy one, while the other ready for filling. It doesn't come with the government warnings, so you need to get a sticker (Amazon sells them: (Medium 3 Pack) Alcohol / Beer / Wine - Government Warning Label for Growlers - Vinyl Self Adhesive Labels), or some places won't fill it. I added a small bungie cord to keep the tap closed, so that if I hit a bump in the road, all my beer won't pour out.",
