For me this was a game changer because I could adjust mid workout without having to take the mask off and insert or take out the valves. Mask is very lightweight compared to my other two masks whichmade it more comfortable working out. Highly recommend this mask! And the price is so worth it!",

It\u2019s small and if you don\u2019t install it immediately it\u2019s more likely to get lost than ever used. It is very quiet during breathing but that\u2019s about the only thing I liked about it.

However after a certain level of intensity, relative to the individual, the straps begin to stretch considerably when soaked in sweat, reducing face-mask seal. If you\u2019re doing steady state cardio (run, bike, row, elliptical,etc) it will probably maintain a good seal. If you\u2019re doing HIIT or CrossFit style workouts you may become frustrated with how often you are readjusting the face piece or strap tension.
