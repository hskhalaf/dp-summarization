Putting the prongs over our the head of our very excited GSP, can be challenging as we don\u2019t want to poke her in the eyes. I wish this weight came with the clasp for ease of use.",

Just make sure to take the collar off after walks - left on all day they can cause a lot of skin irritation. I've since bought three more!",
