Dislikes....Cannot wear for long periods of time. iIt is comfortable when I first put it on, but it hurts my ears if I wear them any time close to 1 hour. Maybe my ears are too big. So look for something that would encompass your ears and not rest on them. I could not watch an entire movie with these on.",

The color is gorgeous, for those concerned that \"rouge\" means or could look pink I can confirm that these are in fact clearly red and black. The construction feels solid and I've been rolling over the cord for months now with no issues. My only complaint, which I re-iterated in my review of the XL cushions I bought to make it bigger, is that I wouldn't say they are completely \"over-ear\". Even with the XL pads it doesn't encompass my entire ear. I use them without a problem but wish they were slightly bigger.",

They do tend to get a bit sweaty if its warm in the room, but this is common with many other headsets as well. The inclusion of a hard case has allowed me to carry these around the world without incident. I like that the cables are all nylon braided, that prevents the cord from getting tangled in other cables and sticking due to that weird rubbery plastic they use (apple I'm looking at you). You can also customize, but thats not really a deciding factor for me, and I've not done so.",

I realize this is a trade off between having good enclosure and sound quality vs comfort. Maybe I'm just sensitive. My head isn't large by any means. I wear a size 7 ball cap.

These new phones seem to be sturdily designed and assembled, but of course \"time will tell.\" They also claim to be \"passively\" noise canceling, which I think simply means that they are well fitting over the ears and thus well insulating. They are that. I have walked on a busy street with them on, turned up to concert-hall level of course, and I heard surprisingly little car noise.",

After the first 6-12 months I noticed it was getting really gross from working out and the chrome was chipping in addition to the ear cushions themself which were pealing. I should note that I used it exclusively for lifting and running - I was very active during this time. Sound is incredible so no problems there, I was just sad to see how gross they had become, but I probably should have taken better care of them.",

The headset arrived without incident, and I'm loving them already. They're nice and big, very comfy, and the materials are excellent. This is what I'd expect for $200 or more with any other brand. Sound isolation works great, and my music now sounds like it should have all along :) As with all V-MODA products, the packaging is beautiful. Unless you need or want something super-fancy, these are perfect for listening to music while out and about.",

I do wish they were louder, but that could just be my hearing loss due to years of loud music.

      "text": "Not \"noise cancelling\" but when you are playing music through them, it blocks out all noise going on around you, which is PERFECT for my very open office space (low-walled cubicle farm). I got worried that other people may be able to hear the music I'm listening to because it will play so loudly through the headphones, but when I tested it out, you couldn't hear a thing coming from the headphones. When I forget my ipod, sometimes I will just put them on to keep co-workers from asking me unimportant questions and these headphones have a serious enough presence to work as planned.",
