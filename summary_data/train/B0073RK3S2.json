I've noticed a few questions and even doubts in reviews about this product's authenticity. I thought I could shed a little light on the subject. I'm no expert but I do have experience using the product. The liquid should be clear when it is new, it only darkens and takes on a yellow hue when it's older. It doesn't affect the potency nor it's effectiveness. I hope this helps alleviate some questions or there.",

I've been using this for about a year now and if I get a facial by someone other than my normal person, I get tons of compliments on my skin texture and tone.

Among other things, this product is advertised as an anti-acneic solution, and I can only say that if you're looking to clear up more than a pimple or two, don't even bother with this pricey gimmick. It didn't do anything horrible to my skin, but it definitely didn't improve my skin, either. It did, however, cost me a lot of money. If you're looking for firmer skin, I can't honestly deter you from purchasing this serum, but if you're looking for clearer skin, see a dermatologist.",

I do not have many wrinkles as yet. So the main difference I saw in overall improvement of skin quality. It cleared 99% of breakouts and made hyperpigmentation slightly less visible, though no dramatic changes here. Great overnight serum as do not need to apply anything else and skin looks and feels great in the morning. Will highly recommend this product and will start trying others from the same line.",
