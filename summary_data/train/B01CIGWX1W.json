I considered several other advent calendars, but chose this one because it has 24 windows vs some that only have 12; functional toys; and minimal choking hazards (we have 3 cats who like to knock small parts off tables, and a 1 year old who tries to chew on whatever is in reach). My daughter wanted to open every window right away, of course. Now the first thing she asks in the morning is if she can go open her advent calendar. I didn't even know about the Tsum Tsum line before seeing this advent calendar, but it's all really cute.",

All of the characters are classics (Mickey & gang, Bambi, Lady, etc.) so there's never a risk of finding an obscure, unknown character. They also all have some sort of holiday twist, like a scarf, Santa hat, etc. so any collector won't be doubling up. The accessories are cute too. Some of them included a Christmas train, an ornament, and a gingerbread sleigh that a medium-sized character pulls and a small-sized could ride in. Overall, I would absolutely say to buy this for any tsum tsum lover.",

The majority of the doors had actual Tsum Tsums behind them. My daughters were so excited to open the doors every day. These advent calendars were unique and most definitely worth every single penny.
