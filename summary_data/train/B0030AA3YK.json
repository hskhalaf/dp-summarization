There are a couple things to consider though if you're considering this product. One, this is not a daily use, heavy duty product. The price point should have tipped you off to that reality. However, for occasional general use, the vest will likely hold up fine. Two, these vests run small in size. I typically would order an XL (I'm 6'2\" and 225 pounds) but had to order an XXL, which fits me great. Just take that into consideration when ordering. Other than that, I think this is an excellent product for the money.",

It is a nice bright vest and other than my ordering the wrong size based on reviews (saying to size up), it still deserves 5 stars. I'll still wear it...even though it is huge.

However, have two complaints. First, mesh fabric is very stiff and so makes an annoying swishing noise with each stride. Secondly, and most annoyingly, the zipper is BACKWARDS! That is, the metal tab of the zipper comes off on the left side, not the right. Why - just why? Every other piece of clothing I own with a zipper is the other way round...",

I've machine washed them a few times (and air dried) with no loss in brightness or other issues. The short zipper keeps the vest from flapping in the wind, and I prefer it over similar vests with velcro closures. There are no pockets, which is favoured by me, but if you prefer pockets, there are other pocketed versions on Amazon as well.",

In winter (boston) I might even need XXL (shirt + fleece + coat + vest)",

After reading the reviews of this particular vest from previous purchasers, I happened to select the correct size (2XL to go over my winter coat), and though it doesn't have a lot of extras (like pockets), it does do what is needed, and I definitely felt safer, and was more visible. I may purchase one or two more in different sizes, for different seasons (to fit the different coats/sweaters that I might wear underneath).",

This one is the best vest! It is highly visible and comfortable (not stiff and chaffing like the others). I snoozed and didn't get the kid size ones when they were available but it was easy enough to tuck the front and sew it down so it fits the kids. They are so much more visible (we were almost run over a couple of times) and we feel a ton safer wearing these when we're out for our evening walk. Very affordable.",
