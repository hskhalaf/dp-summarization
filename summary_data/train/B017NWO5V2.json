The detachable dust screens are neat, as is the giant quiet fan. All my components went in without too much trouble. I docked a star because one of the included wires built into the case for the HDD light slipped right out of the plug harness, and I never got around to fixing it. Who needs that blicking light anyway?",

      "text": "It's the same chassis as the Core V1 Cube mini-ITX, but it is quieter and looks better. I own both and can confirm that the way this case is vented is also much better for keeping dust out. Easy to build on and manage cables. Fits most video cards, most likely wont fit the 3 fan models or the older blower style cards. Works very well for non-overclocked air cooled systems. Will require some thought for overclocked systems as liquid cooling will become a requirement in this case and you will be limited by the size of radiators you can squeeze into this case.",

Does not take up a lot of room while still providing great airflow \ud83d\ude0e great price too! Easiest case I have worked in because every panel comes off! Top,bottom and sides!",

It's really disappointing because I am now passed my exchange date and have to either contact thermaltake myself or just buy a more durable case.",

It is quite spacious, which also means it kinda big (for a mini-itx board). What I do not like is the cooling design. It comes with a big 200m fan upfront, but the front panel suffocates it. And I wish it was designed to use a 120mm/140mm fan for the rear instead of two 80mm. The side panels may be good for ventilation but also expect it to get very dusty.",
