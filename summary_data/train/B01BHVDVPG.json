I was lucky if she ate half, so I decided to try Supreme because it has the alfalfa stalks in it and she had no problem eating grass and hay. The first day she had her bowl cleaned in an hour! Sometimes I have to double-check if my daughter has fed her because she's eaten so fast and her digestion is perfect. What I like is she's much more energetic. I highly recommend this food.",
