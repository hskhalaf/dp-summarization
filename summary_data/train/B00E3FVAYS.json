So far, we're still in the stage of moving backwards, but not forwards yet, which glides really nicely. Hopefully, we'll be advanced enough soon to really test it out. And since it holds up to 44 pounds, we have time.",

The overall bike is great, lightweight, the whole concept of folding it and unfolding when you need it is genius you can take it with you anywhere.

What they should have done is add an adjustable feature for the seat or legs than this bike would have been great. Description says good for 1-3 yrs old, no way.",

      "text": "Best purchase I've made since becoming a parent. The ONLY wish I had is that it was an inch or two taller. My toddler is very tall (85th percentile) has used since 20 months, and will probably use until she is 28 months. But, perhaps once she grows out of it, then she'll be ready for pedals. It collapses small enough to fit under stroller so can take it along for vacations and longer walks. My toddler flies on this thing! And strangers always comment on the speed and how much it is enjoyed (and ask where we got it). Just fantastic!",

It's been a week since purchasing this bike and he loves it. I just folded the wheels up and put it his bag for Nana and Papa's house for the week, super convenient and light.",

This bike is a great starter bike for little ones and it teaches them balance, steering and speed in a safe way. We also live in a condo so it's nice that it folds up so easily. The only complaint I have is that it says it's made for outdoor use but the wheels are plastic and easily get chewed up on any gravel or uneven surface. It's really best for indoor use.",
