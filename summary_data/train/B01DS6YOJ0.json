Definitely helps release tension and relax the muscles! I really didn't think it would work so well, but I'm a believer now.",

      "text": "I purchased a gallon on 80% alcohol liquid hand sanitizer from a local distillery when the get kind was impossible to find in stores. I love the liquid version in a small pump spray bottle for the ease of use and non sticky and quick drying nature. However, it had no scent added and the small was not particularly pleasant. I had purchased several 2 ounce pump spray bottles to use with the sanitizer and once I added 7 or 8 drops of this oil to each bottle, the menthol scent covered up the alcohol based smell and actually gave it a cool feel. I have no idea if it has any pain relief value, I just like this scent.",

As far as it's ability to remove pain and/or tension, I can't speak to that. I used it mixed into shea butter while massaging the hub's shoulder muscles. Obviously massaging helps the pain so it's hard to tell if the oil made it even more effective than the massage would have been without it.",

      "text": "I've only used it a few times so far, but this oil has been effective in alleviating pain and discomfort from my neck and shoulders, plus hands/fingers that spent too long on the computer keyboard. The oil has the kind of \"cool burn\" that Icy Hot or other muscle rubs have, but it doesn't have the kind of uncomfortable or painful burn that some essential oils can have. The aroma is also quite pleasant. All in all, this may indeed become my go-to product for aches and pains.",
