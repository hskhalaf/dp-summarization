      "text": "This is a great chair! I was very skeptical because of the low price but took a chance and ordered two of them. We got them both put together in under 5 minutes. The motor is super silent and the color is a nicer color than shown in the pic. It's not gray-ish at all, a very lovely soft taupe. The material is nice and they lay almost perfectly flat for optimum geezer napping. Neither of us are small people and these chairs are ample in size. I am hard to please and I am very pleased with these chairs and the price rocks (although the chairs don't).",

      "text": "Great recliner! Got this for my 90 year old grandfather after he complained his current chair is too stiff and hurts his legs to manually push down the leg lift. When it arrived... after it took a max of 10 minutes to put it together... he said.. \u201cthis chair is beautiful. It\u2019s very comfy and reclines all the way back with the push of a button.. I could go to sleep in this chair if I wanted.\u201d When you get to be that age.. very few things matter in life. He isn\u2019t that mobile... so a good recliner is very important. His reaction to his Christmas gift made me very happy. I would recommend it to anyone.",

She can't lean her head back comfortably and watch tv, but gets a nice view of the ceiling. And when the chair is reclined the end of the footrest hits her midcalf. It was easy to set up and the power part works. Might return it and get a chair that can be tried out first.",

Footrest comes up before the back reclines, so you have options. I fell asleep accidently in it for several hours and woke without any back pains. Happy with my purchase.",
