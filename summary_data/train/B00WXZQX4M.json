He wore those at ONE competition and they snapped. We typically do not write reviews but after having two pairs break we felt it was only common courtesy to pass along the information.",

      "text": "Any legitimate crossfitter knows that when purchasing hand grips one should always seek out premium leather products. That is exactly what I found here with Bear KompleX Three Hole hand grips. I have tried two other brands, only for them to bear useless after about 5 months of daily use. This is a fantastic startup company with great service and I highly advise people (specifically those who's hands tear on BMUs or RMUs). Make sure you take your measurements correctly, get the leather version, and don't freak out when they feel \"tight\" before they are worn in. It took about three workouts for them to fit like an ol baseball mit. Again, great company and awesome leather product.",

Had to switch my grip on pull ups to thumb underneath, used to be able to keep thumb on top with my old grips (wrist strap broke). NOTE: another girl in my box has these in black, might be an old version idk but both sides are like the suede leather and not so thick, she loves them. That would be so much better!",

The three hole can bunch up a bit when your hand is rotating over the bar. For pullups and toes to bar, though, the 3 hole is fine and maybe even better if you really want to keep your hands soft or if you're tearing on your pointer pad. Cannot recommend highly enough but if you're a bit more advanced and your hands are toughened up a bit, I would recommend the 2 hole.",

I didn't break them at all and used them for a winter Murph and my hands felt great after even with the rips I had gotten a few days before.

This is the only complaint I have but I will always use these going forward until I find something better. However I don't see that happening. I really love these and I really don't give 5 stars unless something blows my mind.",

I tried them for ring muscle ups and found that they're almost too sticky; they don't allow my hand to slide around the rings. The leather is surprisingly supple and seemed to wear in fairly quickly. I'm excited to see how they break in with further use.",
