Tried Cozy Green and it was awful as both kept shaking making it impossible to view baby. Worthless. This one was indeed easy to install and stays put. No vibrating and is very large. I can pivot it extensively as it is placed in the rear side headrest to view my baby in the center. So far I love it.",

The only drawback is that it's easy to bump when putting a child in a rear-facing car seat so that it has to be readjusted-- an easy thing to do, though.",

This is ok in my situation because the horizontal strap stays very snug, and the vertical is snug enough. Aside from being able to adjust the mirror after it's mounted, my favorite thing is that it came with a protective sheet over the mirror, so the mirror condition was excellent.",

      "text": "I have a 1999 GMC Jimmy without a head rest on the center seat in the back of the car. This mirror fulfilled my need for for a mirror that could not be mounted on the back of my center seat. Over all, I can see my child from the rear view mirror, if I stretch my head up. It's not ideal, but it's sure better than nothing. The mirror buckles onto the side headrest firmly and can be tightened. As you probably would guess, it does make it difficult for passengers to ride in the seat with the mirror attached to the headrest.",

The ohter models use the straps as the adjustment which just leads to the frustration of attatching and tightening it over and over. This one has a much better design where the mirror can be aimed AFTER attatching it to the headreast with straps. And even though it is adjustable it is rigid enough that it never loosens.",

The mirror is huge but somehow manages to fit perfectly on my cars small headrest. The mirror stays very stable and I do not have to adjust it like I have for some others every time I get in the car. The greatest thing about this is I can turn around look at my daughter and she can see me in the reflection and an smile.",

This new mirror works perfect to fix that situation; i can now see her completely. The swivel function on here is also fantastic, super easy to adjust unlike the other mirrors that you have to detach, move, and rinse/repeat until you get it right. I would definitely recommend this mirror and will likely get a 2nd one for the other vehicle.",

Definitely worth the price! I will never buy a cheap (price and quality) mirror again.",

We tried other mirrors that were twice the size of this one and the visibility/reflection in the DaffaDoot is significantly better. It also stays in place and does not require constant readjustment like some of the other mirrors we tried. I would highly recommend this mirror.",

When he gets fussy he seems soothed quicker now that he can see me when I talk to him. It's very simple to adjust as well. I highly recommend this mirror! Thank you!",

I did quite a bit of research before purchasing it, and realized that this mirror has more range of motion, so it's easier to place it appropriately to be able to see my LO in the back and make sure he's sleeping with his head back rather than forward in the car seat. It's also great for him. He loves looking at himself and me while he's in the rear facing car seat. This mirror was definitely worth the few extra dollars.
