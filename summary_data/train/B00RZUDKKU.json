      "text": "My daughter will love this! It's very similar to the game Trouble, but with a Shopkins theme. The age recommendation is for 5+. For 2-4 players. The instructions are very easy to follow for this age group. There are a lot of small pieces, so it is important to keep away from smaller children. The plastic seems to be very strong and will be durable. It fits nice and easy right back into the box, which is AMAZING when it comes to games in my opinion. I'm happy with this purchase and I know my daughter will be tickled on Christmas morning.!!",

The game is easy enough for her to do herself. My only complaints are that the path could be more easily deliniated. The corner spots are often mistaken for the main path. An extra 1/2 inch of space between them and the path or a more clearly colored route around the board would make it easier to tell where to go. But we like it and I actually enjoy playing it with her!",

Simple counting skills are needed. The only negative point I've come across, is when pushing down on the center bubble to roll the dice...the pieces will most likely fall out of place. It's kind of a nuisance and might be best to play with a regular dice if you have one laying around.",
