I wanted to surprise him with one, but I didn't want to spend too much because I was worried that he might lose interest in it quickly (like SO many \"toys\" he just HAS to have. Lol). This has been a great smoker to start with. He's really gotten into it! He says it works perfectly. Everything so far has come out tasting fantastic and smoked perfectly. It's compact yet very functional. We've smoked pieces large enough to feed 6 people and have leftovers and that was using only one of the racks.",

I've been able to fit things as large as a seven pound pork tenderloin with wings, to15 brats, all the way to a 15 pound beef brisket. I adore it. TWO BIG THINGS! 1. Make sure the wood chip pan is not all the way against the right side and heating element. I had grease build up there once and a small fire. Nothing major, just give any drippings room to fall. 2. Cure the cabinet before use. Spray it with a liberal amount of canola spray and then just smoke some wood on high heat for an hour and never clean the cabinet out.",

I was a little apprehensive about it being priced at what it was, but I definitely feel like I got more than my money's worth! He assembled it rather quickly and we just smoked an 8 lb. pork shoulder in 7 hours. It was amazing! Would definitely recommend!",
