You can see the waxes progress without removing the lid. I actually bought the tin wax and just took the bucket out and put the tin in it and it worked perfect. Wax is warm when applied but no where near hot enough to burn. Once you have melted the wax you just have to turn to medium to prevent it from hardening. Overall this is a great little warmer!",

I like the removable pot for those that may have the wax tins that you can stick directly into the melting pot. Then you can keep two different waxes separate, if you're one of those people that does both hard/soft wax. I understand that some wax tins are larger intentionally so that you will have to buy the company's melting pot, so be wary of that before purchase of this + any other tin of wax. Easy to clean if you spill inside, between the pot and the inner pot, it's nearly impossible to do though.",
