I have used it around the house, at parties and while hiking through the Arizona Painted Desert/Petrified Forest. The pictures are remarkably clear and the camera is so light that you forget you are wearing it. It's easy to turn off, I just put it in my pocket or turn it face down on a flat surface. The uploading to the Narrative website is painless and you can edit the pictures before posting them to a shared folder. I love it and am looking forward to taking it on vacation this summer.",

The indoor pictures are very grainy; outdoor high sunlight photos are better, but still not even cell phone quality. The iPhone app leaves a lot to be desired, it's hard to flip through pictures slowly. You can download to your own computer, but the orientation is not fixed before export so going through thousands of photos that are rotated all differently is not very fun.",
