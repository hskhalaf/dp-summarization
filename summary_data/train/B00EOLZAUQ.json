      "text": "First let me say I like this blower and it is a compact model powerful to blow wet leafs. However the down side is it vibrates because of its light weight and therefore limits the length of time used. It also has a terrible connection to your electrical extension cord and the cord lock design does not hold the cord tightly so that it will disconnect constantly in use. I have to use tape to hold it in place. I purchased two units and my comments apply to both my units. Lastly it is very loud in operation. So would I purchase this unit again my answer is yes because overall it gets the job done.",

I bought the 160mph model and found that that was enough power for me- and anyone with a small to medium size yard. Now if you have a large piece pf property you will want to get one of the stronger more powerful leaf blowers. But, I'm sure this 160mph version will work for most home owners. And the price was so reasonable- at the time I bought it it was $35. In short- low price, good quality, good performance.",

The low speed worked great at blowing the leaves from the rock garden while leaving everything else in its place. The high speed handled everything else. This blower is also quieter than the 3 that I have owned (different manufacturer).",

This 225mph rated blower doesn't seem to pack the same punch as my old Leafhog (rated at 230mph), and the blower tube on this one is a good six inches shorter (which might be fine if I were 5'6\" or shorter) so I have to bend low to get it close to the ground for those stubborn spots.

Secondly, the hook for the cord is not long enough so the cord slips out and unplugs. I have a new cord and maybe the problem will rectify itself as the cord becomes more flexible.

Bag design stinks! Needs side zipper to dump into required paper bags without spilling. My yard has large leafs so this may be the problem. Mower better option for me.",

It does require an extension cord, but since I already had a 50ft cord lying around, that was no problem....only thing I would change, or really, add, is maybe a telescoping nozzle...the one it comes with is on the shorter side, which is fine since it keeps the tool compact and easy to use, but sometimes I'd like to either put nozzle directly on floor, or blow off ceiling, and a longer nozzle option would better facilitate that....only used it twice so far, so can't speak for durability, but I give it 5 stars for function",

Previously this was part of the overall assembly. The new piece is constantly coming out of place. - The old knob style on/off switch was easy to use even with work gloves. The new slide switch is much harder to use and just looks/feels cheap. - The old cord lock mechanism was easy to lock in the cord and take it out -- the new design is much harder to use.",

Blow the leaves & dirft out of your camper or car or truck....wherever you need cleaning power. You won't regret owning one of these little Toro's !",

On average, during nine months out of the year, I'll use this about once a week for about ten minutes per session. Without doubt, the Toro 51585 Power Sweep has been a great purchase for me and I hope to get much more use out of it.",
