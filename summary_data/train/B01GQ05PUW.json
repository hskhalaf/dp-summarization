When we removed the chain cover we saw that the chain was so loose that it was remarkable that it had stayed on at all! We slid the rear wheel back to take up the slack, but then discovered that the pedal assembly was moving side to side in its casing. Then, 2 ball bearings fell out! None of these issues were due to assembly, which only requires attachment of the handlebars, pedals, and training wheels. Took about 30 minutes We returned it today for a refund.",

I am not sure if that is common knowledge for everyone else, but we were absolutely clueless.",

      "text": "I bought this for my son who is a little small for an 8 year old. He had outgrown his 16 but was still a little too small for the 20 so the 18 was perfect. It was easy to assemble according to my husband and my son says it's the best bike ever because he finally has a handle break and kick stand. The only reason why it's not perfect is because with the seat in the lowered position for my little guy the water bottle doesn't fit in the holder. Not really a deal breaker. As he grows and raises the seat he can use the water bottle holder.",

      "text": "We have purchased two of these bikes in the last 9 months. Both have basically fallen apart. We really liked the bike initially because it looks great and is fairly light in weight. That said, on both bikes the ball bearings came out of the pedal causing the chain to fall off over and over again. There is no way to access the pedal to repair the bracket. The most recent bike was purchased on June 25, 2018 and broke just over three months later on September 30, 2018. Of course we are beyond the return timeline so we're just out $120-plus. I WOULD NOT recommend this bike if you want something that will last more than 3 months.",
