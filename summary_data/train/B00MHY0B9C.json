      "text": "Died 9 months to the day after purchase. Contacted Frigidaire warranty support via chat on their website, they had someone out the next week. Turned out that water got into the area where the control board is, and shorted out the control board (pictures attached). Technician said he has seen this before. Go figure - who would expect water getting into a dishwasher. I'm probably going to try and use silicone to seal the enclosure contact points so this won't happen again, but I think it's only a matter of time. Looks like poor design. Recommend avoiding this unit.",

Also, I made the mistake of hiring a repairman off of Thumbtack to fix it once, so Frigidaire will not consider accepting that it's a lemon since I didn't use an authorized repair person.

I say hell no, I will be buying another brand and I strongly recommend you do as well. If you do one thing today, listen to this review and do not buy Frigidaire products.",

The refrigerator \"water hose\" on the front door came off and flooded the floor 1 year after we bought it. Had to take the whole door panels off to fix it. The microwave has the most annoying beeper of any I've owned. No quick beep-beep, just a load, continuous tone like a fire alarm that continues on and on like it is an emergency you get the food out.
