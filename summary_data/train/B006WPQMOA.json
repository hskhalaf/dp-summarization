This piece is as obvious as the toilet seat, so either an employee packed the potty into its box with his/her eyes closed, or they noticed the piece was missing and packed it anyway. Thetford did not respond to my email request for a replacement cap, so this brand new product was returned to Amazon. Summary: Cheap product, high price, poor quality control, unresponsive manufacturer.",
