We have to clean the floor every time the rabbit pees. which is very frustrating. I wish I hadn't bought this, waited for it to come, just to not even work like it's supposed to.",

The wiring on the bottom of the cage worried me a bit due to the gaps being so wide, I was afraid that his feet and nails would get caught in it so I just simply placed the bottom tray into the inside of the cage and added some bedding. There is plenty of room in here for him for the short amount of time that he's in there. I would probably recommend a larger one if your rabbit is in a cage more than he's out, but I'm really hoping that's not the case because no animal deserves to be caged up at all times. Highly recommend :)",

Also, I hope no one really lets their bunny just walk around on those wires on the bottom -- please, cover it with something like cardboard or newspaper. Otherwise your bunny's feet are going to be hurt. So, I would recommend this because it is so cheap, but you have to alter it a little.",

It would be a bit easier to clean if I could just slide out the tray, but it is fine. If I want to try using the wire floor when our bunny is older I can. Great cage!",

Enough room for him to move around and high enough for him to stand up without bumping his head. My only issues are the broken tray, and the doors (in front and on top) are pretty hard to open and close. My little Ruperts happy so, so am I :)",

      "text": "I really like the size and doors on this cage, fits my lionhead mix wonderfully. My only issue with this cage is that the removable tray is quite a bit smaller than the bottom of the cage so it kind of floats around thus can lead to leaks so I have had to put another tray under the cage to catch all of that. It would be great if my rabbit was completely litter box trained but he is having issues with that.",
