I am a 66 year old women ad I put it all together by myself in about an hour and a half without having any help. Now I have a bike to take with the motor home on vacations without putting a bicycle rack on it.",

CONS: Cheap low quality pedals are not usable, need to be replaced right away (main reason for one star down rating); Front wheel came slightly bent (not a transportation damage), needs adjustment; Seat post is too short for 5.11 person, need to be replaced with the longer one; Gear shifters work fine, but made from thin light cheap plastic (unusual for Shimano); Manual is for the different model with traditional (not disk) breaks.",

Truthfully you're paying for the frame so it's a great frame and folds well. Fits into my truck of my Camry well enough. There isn't room for much else. The bike does have some weight to it so be prepaid for that. The bike itself works great. No issues at all there. Lastly good luck figuring out the mud cover attaching on. I feel like I was just given random pieces for it. I wasn't going to install it any way.",

Give this bike a good look at if you are looking for a sharp well built bicycle. Free shipping on Amazon prime too.",

The beads of the bearing keep dropping so the inside is unbalanced and thus when I was riding the beads keep coming off and I am pretty sure there would be no beads inside after few rides. And this is very dangerous, because when the beads came off, they would stuck the pedal and it could not rotate properly. There were many times I slipped off the pedal on road, and thank god my speed was low so I did not fall on the ground. And now the pedal is loose and hard to ride.",

I fixed the problem but noticed each time I took it for a test ride the screws were getting loose on the brakes. The gears were an even bigger problem, switching gears is not the smoothest on this bike. I will be returning.",

Overall I'm really impressed by the bike although I did have to take a rubber mallet to the brake disc pad because it was a tad bit bent from shipping. All in all most of the assembly isn't rocket science although the tuning of the brakes can be tedious (may make sense to just take it into a local bike shop for a tune if you don't want to spend the time fussing with it).",

One pedal feels unsteady under my foot. It's loose folded out. But it hasn't failed. The gears work great. The bike feels sturdy. The suspension is great. Other than the pedals being a bit iffy, the bike feels like a regular mohntain bike. It folds and unfolds easily.",

I do like that the pedals fold up, don't like that the handlebar is fixed.

But it works to get around town. The shocks are reliable enought to hop 4 inch curbs with no problems. The gearing is low, so speed downhill is limited. Overall, good. However, with a few tweaks in design it could be great.",

The seat post should have been atleast 350mm long vs 300mm - slight disadvantage if you like a higher riding position 4. The disc brakes need a major adjustment for the initial assembly when you take it out of the box. Expertise required! Outside of the above issues, the bike is good for daily pleasure rides.",

      "text": "The frame is 16\" (stamped on the frame) not 26\", but this will probably work for anyone under 6'. My wife loves it (she is 5'9\"), she says it is the best bike she has ever had. The assembly instructions are useless, but the biggest challenge is installing the front disk brakes (the back disk brakes are already installed). The trick to the brakes is just make sure they are centered. This Bike is probably the best bang for your buck if you are looking for a lot of options and extras (i.e. dual suspension, front and rear disk brakes, and Shimano shifters) for under $300.",

No, WD40 was disappointing, considering the effect only lasted for a few minutes at best. It gives me a workout, but, makes it too hard to ride my granddaughter on it & forget uphill, it's a struggle!",
