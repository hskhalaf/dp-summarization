Unfortunately a single one of these leaves a bit to be desired(In all fairness, I am a basshead, though). When the gains are adjusted appropriately, it has a nice little output. Jack them up and she gets loud as can be, but sounds sloppy. I would recommend it if you're not expecting to rattle everyone in the marina. If you want to, buy multiples. Great sounding units with moderate output. Also very convenient with the built in amplifier.",
