The hydrating soap I usually use didn't leave my skin slimy with this shower filter--just soft and smooth. Wonderful.

      "text": "I have two of these now in my apartment, one for each bathroom, and I can't see ever buying anything else. The different settings are great and once you remove the restrictor, they work even better. That being said, if you feel the water flow isn't powerful enough, it's because they hit a little plastic restrictor inside the nozzle that screws into the showerhead pipe. You have to pull it out with a pick or something small enough to pry it out. It takes some force to do, but you won't break it. Once you figure out how to get the little plastic restrictor out of there, it's an amazing shower head!",

      "text": "Years of dry skin and dry hair were eliminated after I switched to this showerhead. I have spent most of my life and money buying expensive serums, lotions, creams, oils, masks, peels, etc to have clear, soft skin and beautiful, luxurious hair. Nothing really ever worked. I thought I didn't eat enough seafood or that I had inherited bad genes. Nope. Bad water. Old, crappy pipes. City in Southern California life. This showerhead changed everything. I cannot recommend it to you more. If you're tired of dry skin and dry, chlorinated hair (but you don't really swim?) then try this. For what it does and the changes you see, it is worth 4 times as much.",

We mainly got it because our other shower head just plain sucked with the non-existent water pressure. This one has several different settings depending on your preference/function. I use one of the harder ones to rinse my hair out for example. It works really well as far as that goes. We will probably buy another of these for the other bathroom.",
