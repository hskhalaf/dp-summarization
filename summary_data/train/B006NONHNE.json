Looking up the listed US Patents, the advertising of the pad greatly overstates what the patents really claim to do (patents suggest the gel is very good at dispersing heat more than cooling below ambient temps).",

His feet always hang off though which I think is fine but I think if your dog is any bigger than 65 lbs you should go with the XL size.

Even when I used it in our kennel at night she didn't want to lie down. I had to put ice bags on her kennel and turn a fan on instead so she could lay on her soft dog cushion. My friend's Golden loves the Cooling Pad, though, so I gave it to that family and give it 3 stars. I guess it depends on your dog's sensitivities.",
