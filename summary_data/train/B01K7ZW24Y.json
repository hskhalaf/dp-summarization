Note: If you plan to put them in a garage do not put them near or install them in the garage door opener as with most LED's they give off small amounts of EMI around the same frequency as most garage door remotes which will reduce your range significantly. There are specific LEDS for those which I have used and work fine (Though they are expensive)",

They do dim quite a bit more than any other dimmable bulbs I've tried, but of the four I got, only one was quiet when being dimmed. One of them seemed about average buzzing noise, and two were the loudest dimmable LED bulbs I've tried. They also make a noise like a tungsten filament in an incandescent light bulb when I tap them. This is slightly worrying as not even the cheapest of cheap chinese ebay LED bulbs do that when I tap them.",

I bought these specifically for my garage because the standard filament bulbs would burn out and I didn't want to pay the ridiculous price for garage opener specific bulbs. These do the trick wonderfully. They are constructed of a composite outer shell so there was no worry of them breaking. They are also led and lay much longer than your standard bulbs. I stand by the cree name and love these bulbs. A definite buy in the future",

This dimmer fixed the buzzing, but this dimmer also costs $120 dollars (not a typo). Dimming range did not change using this dimmer. Not as quiet as advertised. I used a Cree compatible dimmer control (Lutron MACL-153) and there is some audible buzz. I might be able to use this as a LED for a table lamp, but because of noise I will try and find another use. Otherwise fairly good dimming (not great) and light output is uniform. These are not as bad as the 40 watt versions from a noise perspective.",
