Although I'm not going to get the same quality that I would on the Inspire, the size factor is a big plus. It's so damn small and portable! And the 100mbps and slow motion features are a plus as well. Overall I'm very pleased with the Mavic Air and will be using this exclusively on all of my travel trips due to its increase in sensors, smaller size for portability, and decent battery length. DJI did good with this one! Oh, and the Flame Red is beautiful :-)",

The battery lasts what you'd expect for a drone of this size and caliber, and, despite crashing a couple times, it has held up very well. The wide angle lens does a great job of capturing landscape shots, and it takes clear, high quality stills and video. The collision avoidance was one of the biggest characteristics that convinced us this drone was the best DJI for my husband which has significantly reduced some anxiety and saved the drone from even more crashes I'm sure.",

The signal is more stable and you can go further whitout worries, many peolple complained about signal issues but once you manual setting the frequency chanel all signal problems are gone.

For one it did not come with the adapter to charge my remote, and it also didn't come with any adapters for smart phones so now I have to order more things just to be able to fly this thing. Should have just waited For the official Dji to get more in stock... Product says its used but in excellent condition and failed to mention it comes pre scratched for you.. Nice touch for the money spent!",

The Mavic is about the same size and much better with distance. I am disappointed with this drone.",
