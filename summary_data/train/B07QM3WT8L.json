The AirDots are good sounding buds that tuck neatly into your ears and avoid the silly dangling appearance of other, more expensive, offerings. Everything about them is simple, including paring, controls, and the general design. The lack of volume buttons and minimal waterproofing are minor complaints, but the overall package is very impressive, especially when you consider the price.",

Very pleased with mine so far versatile and compact. The phones come with spare ear phone cover. I found as long as you put them in firmly they don\u2019t easily come out. You can use one or two together very useful if your at work and need an ear to hear things .",

The left one pairs to the right very easily if you put them in this order. You can answer the phone, pause or play songs and Youtube by one click on the bud. There is no volume adjustment button on it, but none of the earbuds in the market has. I'm very happy with the item. Thanks",

I've used them since then for about 14 hours (not non stop, recharging in the case, but each day) and the battery life is still saying 100% on my phone. Amazing. Decent sound quality too, and comfy in the ears. These are the best wireless earbuds I've ever had, top stuff.",

Sound quality is not amazing but great for the price. On the flip side, the noise cancelling is just banging. Overall, i am really happy with these ear pods and i highly recommend these earpods",

The headphones actually are being interrupted too frequently when connected to computer, which is kinda' annoying already (problem exists 20% of the time, the fix is to change your body position, turn to other side, etc), this problem though exists only when connected to PC, on phone everything appears to be ok.",

It was hard to click so clicking it would jam the ear tips down your ear canal and even then it would not click.
