Unfortunately I don't have time to return it due to an upcoming road trip. I need one now, so I'll give this one a try, but I'm not confident it's a very strong lock. Hopefully it acts as a deterrent. AMAZON please fix the issue.",

The bike was taken out of a gated parking garage, so this might help keep honest people honest when your out in public at events during the day, but definitely not a good overnight security item.",

Not impossible, but once it took me a few minutes of messing with it to finally get it to disengage. I've only had issues 3 or 4 times, and all the others have been easy though (so maybe 5% adverse).

The lock fits into the holes of my brake disc easily and the key does not remove unless the lock is locked, so it gives me peace of mind that it's properly locked when I leave my bike. Fits well with the cable under the passenger seat of my 2005 Kawasaki Ninja 636, which is great because cargo space is not impressive on a sports bike.",
