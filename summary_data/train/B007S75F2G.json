I was hesitant to order this one due to the price, but my wife and I are very glad I did. We love sitting out by the fire, having a drink, getting the kids to make hot dogs or smores. It's great for the entire family. I did put sand on the bottom. I did not drill holes in it. I place a cover over it when not in use. Some of the paint on the grate to catch the embers has peeled off, but it's not bad.",

It was true that the ring around the outside didn't fit exactly perfectly but is not noticeable once you get past putting it together. I took the recommendations to drill holes in the bottom and use lava rock. Another thing I did that I might recommend is setting the legs on small brick blocks to keep water from pooling around the feet and rusting them. I also recommend a cover. The ambiance created by this fire pit is so worth any extra effort to get it set up. It's great quality for the price. I absolutely love this fire pit.",

We gave it to my husband for Father's Day, honestly because I had been wanting one for our sitting area for a long time, but because of the \"manly\" looking wildlife cutouts, my husband had to admit that he really likes it, too! The cover fits well, even though it does not cover the feet, but it seems to have kept the rain and wind from doing any damage to it at all. We are also looking forward to trying out the grill--what a great touch! Very sturdy and well-made!",

We roasted marshmellows and told campfire stories with the grandkids. We also purchased a cover for it; it is weathering quite well out on the patio. Very pleased wtih it; we just put sand in the bottom as recommended.",
