I returned this third generation and went back and bought two used first generation airpods while they are still available. I figure there might never be another airpod that matches it.

      "text": "I bought these to workout with and ride my loud motorcycle with. The noise cancellation is an amazing feature but after about the 3rd day there was a small cracking sound in my right ear pod. I chatted with Amazon and they had no problem with replacing them. I have had the new ones about a week and a half and now I\u2019m experiencing the same cracking sound in my right EarPod. They were sold to me as new but I\u2019m wondering if they are refurbished. I\u2019m going to be sending these back and going for my third pair and see how those work.",

Literally they are an inferior product to the regular AirPods at a higher price. PROS: Sound Good! Noise Isolation is Great! Transperacy feature is cool. CONS: QUALITY SUCKS These are just really unreliable. Randomly y disconnect, One doesn't charge, case doesn't charge, Microphone cuts out. The 3 inner ear tips also are horrible. My old AirPods never fell out but these will fall out with my just talking on the phone. I wish I could return these and just get the regular AirPods.",

The connection between the phone and EarPods is not seamless. Often only one earpod will connect. Sometimes on an ongoing phone call they don\u2019t connect at all. It can be very frustrating. Also, they fall out of my ears sometimes, especially when exercising. Lastly, I liked the tapping to skip, pause, etc. much better on the old EarPods than the squeezing on these. All in all, these are good, but have some issues.",
