      "text": "Compact grill that fits nicely in my Jeep JKU. The grill is inexpensive but does have a flaw that is easy to fix. When the grill is expended it opens up too far. To remedy the problem, which was mentioned by other reviews I just drilled a hole in the metal and attached wingnuts for easy removal and storage. Several pictures have been attached to show how you can make the easy fix too. I plan on using this grill on the river, it will be sitting on rocks, sand, and gravel. My cousins have used the same grill and it gets the job done.",

I mounded up hardwood chunk charcoal then I lit the paper and waited for fifteen minutes. No lighter fluid was used. I also sprayed the grilling grates with cooking spray before placing over the coals. Cooked four large burgers easily. Grate could probably hold six to eight burgers. Good airflow. Grates are easy to clean. The unit is well made and I could not see any warping. The only thing I would add is clips to the folding side wings to hold them in place. Overall I'm very pleased with the purchase.",

After grilling, please wait for the camping grill to cool down before folding it up. The racks fit nicely inside the small grill and provide you a quick and easy cleanup.
