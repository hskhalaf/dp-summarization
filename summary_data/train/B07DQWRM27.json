They were supposed to last up to ten hours, so I thought a four-hour wedding reception would be no issue. The candles that went out did one of two things. They either just quit burning entirely or they would start to sink into the water and the flame would be extinguished. It was embarrassing because I was hoping these candles would last as they were in the main centerpieces on the table. I'm giving two stars because the ones that did work and last looked nice. Don't buy these candles if you want reliable candles for your event!",
