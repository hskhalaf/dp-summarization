I find, however, that these bags are a bit thinner and shorter. If your kid makes a really big stinker, you may have to double up, but for the price, the switch was worth it. I would think the same could be said about their ability to hold your dog's business. Also - and this information doesn't impact my future re-purchase - I find these bags have an odd odor that I don't love. It's manageable, however.",
