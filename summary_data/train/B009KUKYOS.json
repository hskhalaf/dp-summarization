The camera strap comes out nicely with the case so that it can be used easily. Very happy with my purchase!",

I love the little zipper pocket; I can fit my memory card and extra battery in it. My only complaint is the piece of material they constructed my bag from does not really match the colors in the stock photo. My bag has a lot of brown, mustard yellow, and dark orange striping rather than the cute pink, royal blue, and turquoise striping that the stock photo has. Not an issue though; construction wise I give this product 5 stars!",

      "text": "I bought this case for my Nikon D3400 DSLR. Works fine for the 18-55 mm standard lens. I might be to small for larger DSLR cameras. The D3400 is quite small and it fits snugly. Check your own camera's measurements against the D3400 to be sure it fits. This case is best for transporting the camera with some protection but not good for taking it on and off for active picture taking. With that in mind, I like the case and love the pattern. I get lots of favoralbe comments on it. The small zipper pocket is good for a lens cleaning cloth but that about it. A spare battery fits but very tightly.",

It fits my Olympus OM-D E-M5 MKII + 12-40 pro lens perfectly. The only reason I dock a star is because the pocket it has is quite smallish. The pocket stretches out just holding a single battery, so it's more for an sdcard or something...and with 128GB+ sdcards who really needs that? I would have given it 5 stars if the pocket was a little bigger and could fit two batteries.",

However, the idea is good as a secondary and light bag to protect the camera during shooting breaks, or if you just don't want to carry your big bag with lenses, accessories, etc. THEY JUST NEED TO MAKE IT IN SEVERAL SIZES !",

While it does feel enough to protect from scratches and bumps, a fall could actually break off he lens attached. It is quite feather weight but I do think it could use with some extra thicker padding for some protection and piece of mind for a improvement. The price is fair too.",

I have only had it for a little while so I can't comment on durability yet but it seems pretty solid.",

We like to use day hiking bags when we travel and this provides just enough protection to pack the camera in with other similarly protected gear. Unfortunately, this sleeve case has one major drawback. There is no reinforcement where the hotshoe mount rubs against the inside of the sleeve. After only a few trips, it has already rubbed through and would soon become unusable if left alone. I still recommend this sleeve, but I suggest you apply a piece of thick tape to the inside of the sleep where the hotshoe mount meets it. I'm using a Nikon D600 and the fit is great.",
