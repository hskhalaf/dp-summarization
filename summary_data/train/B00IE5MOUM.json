I've had a few different Polk Audio subs the most recent being a $200 PSW12 and it was far louder and about the same as far as sound quality. I'm using both subs together now with 3 pairs of ELAC Uni-Fi UB5 speakers. Another problem I'm having is a loud noise when the sub comes out of standby. Usually its just a loud buzz sound but occasionally its an even louder and startling squeal. I bought this sub expecting a tighter and cleaner sound over the ported subs I've used before but I can't say there's any improvement in sound quality.",

Followed the simple setup instructions and even my wife was impressed with how seamless it paired with they system and how good it sounded with music, movies and TV.

I listened to Master and Commander (my test for a sub) and the first battle scene was satisfyingly loud and exciting. The sealed sub will never have the chest thumping presence of a ported sub, but the sound for films is more than satisfying, and the sound for music is outstanding. Highly recommended, especially for the price.",
