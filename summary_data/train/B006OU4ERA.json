This bed is great because of the silent second fan. In the morning it's as full as it is when it's first filled. It's comfortable all night long. The pseudo-suede finish us is much better than the glossy plastic most beds are made by... this also means the sheets stay on better. I recommend this bed to everyone.",

      "text": "Never worry about re-inflating your air mattress in the middle of the night. How annoying is that? It's so easy to inflate and deflate. You don't even need to turn the air pump off because it does it for you. Select your comfort inflation of soft medium and firm and have a great night sleep. Packs up easy with an extra large carrying bag. You don't have to stuff it in the bag if you fold it up right. It just slips right in. For the money this is a very good never flat air mattress. Others are so much more expensive. Great purchase!",

The seams on the springs split, which causes the secondary pump to run non-stop. As such, it's gone from silent, to nearly as noisy as a vacuum cleaner. The repair patches included with the bed are useless for these leaks, not that there are nearly enough included with the bed for all of them anyway. The location of them prevents the stock patches from sealing. Loctite's \"Vinyl, Fabric & Plastic Flexible Adhesive\" and a vinyl shower curtain takes care of them, though. tl;dr: I do NOT recommend this mattress to anyone.",

It makes just enough of a background sound to be annoying but that's not a game changer. After the first few uses when the material is \"breaking in\" it hardly loses any air so you can just give it another little boost the next night to bring it up to where you find it the most comfortable.

Apparently my weight causes the bed to stretch a bit during break in and the bed detects the volume deficit when weight is removed. Some sites recommend using an air mattress only temporarily. Why? I say. With a foam pad under a fitted mattress pad the bed is as comfortable as a mattress, and cheaper and easier to move!",

Able to maintain it's pressure throughout the night, Never Flat\u2122 elimates sagging and loss of air pressure that is so common in airbeds. Never Flat\u2122 technology is an auto-engaging, whisper quiet pump that maintains constant air pressure throughout the night for an undisturbed, continuous night's rest that is never flat. Choose your desired comfort level--Plush, Medium, or Firm--and let the powerful Primary Pump inflate the bed.

It is recommended to inflate your bed at least 1 hour prior to using or measuring it. Extra air may be required after this period to achieve full firmness. For items featuring the NeverFLAT pump system, this extra air is added automatically. All mattress measurements should be taken from the center of the bed surface. For width and length, measure across the bed from the center of each side from widest point to widest point. For the height, measure at the center of the longest side from the ground to the highest point of the bed surface.",
