Live and learn and buy from a reputable source next time. If you look at the left arm you can see that the silver corner piece is not only off kilter, but you can see the indent for where it \"should have been\" placed. And it's backwards, because it's not symmetrical. The right arm seems to have it placed correctly. Let's be honest, what I received was/is a straight up knock off, which is pretty much infuriating.",

      "text": "I got the Jackie Ohh 1's and Jackie Ohh 2's, and they were both so incredibly cheaply made. They were most definitely the quality of gas station sunglasses. I googled, what do real Raybans have and they have a engraved RB on the 'glass', not plastic eye glass lens.... but other than that missing detail, they were constructed from the cheapest materials...litterally felt like a toy...and they were $120.00-$150.00. I decided to GO to Sunglass Hut and see a pair of there glasses the difference was HUGE. They were $170, but at least they are the real deal. UGH! I get angry every time I think of these people ripping shoppers off.... NOT COOL.",

To be honest, I didn't see these things at first, but my wife called it as soon as she opened her gift. Too bad Amazon doesn't do anything to police this sort of stuff.",
