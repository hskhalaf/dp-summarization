I love the fact that when we go to restaurants with my grandson I just sit him next to me In the booth he loves this chair. Very sturdy and great grip and I love the rubber grips that hold on to the table. Chicco was very generous and sent me a new one because I had installed the arms incorrectly and could not get them apart and it was not usable. It was not a warranty issue, it was the user of the item. Me.",

Now the fabric almost touches the edge of the bar our seat is attached to. I was able to put my full body weight (130 pounds) on the chair with no signs of weakness and our baby loves being able to sit next to us at the bar!

This one was very affordable. I probably wouldn't use it every day at home; just have it in the car for when you need it while you're out. It's really secure. My 9 month old (21 lb) daughter loves bouncing around in it but that sucker is so tight on the table that there are no worries.",

However, after washing it one time it started to rip in the corner by the legs. My son isn\u2019t super hyper when he\u2019s sitting in the chair so I know it\u2019s not from use but rather it probably happened because of going through the wash. Unfortunately the chair isn\u2019t easy to spot clean so every once in a while it does need to be washed in a machine or hand washed, but it seems that is this chair\u2019s demise.",
