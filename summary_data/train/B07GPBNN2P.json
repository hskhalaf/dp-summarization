Much, much better video quality and improved flying safety features make it the perfect drone for videographers.",

I'm loving the Mavic's Hasselblad camera with its great picture quality and many photo and video capabilities. The drone is very easy to fly, even for a novice like me. It did hit the bare branches of a tree while I was practicing figure 8s, and I had to replace two propellers, so it's not 100% idiot proof, but it's close.",

They returned it to me two weeks later without fixing the problem, and didn't reply to my message for another ten days. After contacting Amazon support, they sent a new drone which works perfectly, and took a return of the broken one. So I'm happy I ordered it through Amazon rather than direct with DJI.",
