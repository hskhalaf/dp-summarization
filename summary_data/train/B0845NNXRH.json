      "text": "*Update* item returned. It is, unfortunately, not windows. Lovely aesthetics Screen mint Keyboard lovely Just cannot get away with the OS Unable to connect to android phone via bluetooth. Cannot connect to android phone via cable. Too many 3rd party apps required. Apps I.e. amazon and garmin connect do not look good- does not fill screen- almost like looking at a phone - better off using browser. Maybe i was expecting too much from it or expecting it to be as simple as a windows PC (surface pro which we have). With experience in the OS where to find things etc, it will be perfect - Maybe I'll stick with it haha!",
