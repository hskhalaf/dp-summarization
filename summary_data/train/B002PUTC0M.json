Just release the handle for a pressure reading, hold down to add air, and hold halfway down to release air. Only way to make it better would be if the pressure readings were active while you are actually doing the inflating. You have to pause to take a reading. But still way better than the \"traditional\" method.",

This thing is a life saver and really speeds inflating tires up considerably. I used it today to put some air in my girlfriend's tires on her gmc terrain. Using the compressor on my service truck it took like 6 seconds per tire to put 10 psi each. My old tire chuck would've took so much longer! I wasn't even expecting this inflator to speed the job up, maybe just make things a little easier. I'll take it though! 5 star highly recommend!!",

I was skeptical of the self-locking chuck after having purchased a Kobalt gauge from Lowes with a similar feature that didn't work at all, but this one seals instantly, remains attached, and (usually) doesn't leak once attached. I did have a slight problem with one of the tires on my car. The valve stem on that tire is different from the others, and I do have to manually press on the chuck to maintain a reliable seal. Despite this, I am still extremely happy with the device and would certainly recommend it.",

After disassembling the device, the cause was a battery short-circuit caused by a broken battery terminal mount, as shown in the photo. There were bits of loose plastic and the terminal spring was floating unattached. I hope a future version of this device uses an internal rechargeable lithium battery, that is recharged via a USB cable. It's unfortunate that the current version still uses AAA batteries with vulnerable terminal connectors.",

      "text": "It's a great pressure gauge. I love the braided hose cause I've seen a million of the plain rubber ones get cracked and break. Also this one takes a couple triple a batteries instead of the older ones that take those stupid watch style batteries that nobody likes to buy. For some reason though there are some pressures that don't register. For example the gauge will never read 34.5. It will go from 34.4 to 34.6. Every time haha. Not that it's a big deal or anything, it's just an interesting observation. It's a good price too. I just wish it had a button to power off",

      "text": "This tool is amazing. It works great. I started using it for autocross without an air tank. After a few runs, the pressure goes up and I use the tool to check and lower the pressure. It works even better if you have to add air. You can add (or remove) and then check the pressure very rapidly. It works so well, I am going to purchase another one for use at home with my regular cars. I have several GM cars with TPMS. This tool is wonderfull for the \"teaching\" process where you have to let air out then put the pressue back when you are done.",

My last two inflators let me down, so it was time to change things Characteristics of cheap inflators: Inaccurate Break (hoses split, dials break, lose accuracy over time) Chuck falls off the stem Inflates slowly Characteristics of this inflator: Accurate (calibrated from factory) Seems heavy and well built. Lots of rubber protection. Chuck stays on the stem, by itself. Inflates FAST. Thank you, good inflator. The cheap inflators can get F'ed.",

Powering the unit with the two easily changed AAA batteries is a good idea. This gauge consistently indicates 2 pounds less the the Joes's Racing gauge that I use as my measurement standard. That's not too bad, but I do wish that this one agreed with the unit that I know is accurate. I just hope that this inflator continues to perform well with extended use, as it is very convenient to use.",

Finally, this product stated that it has lithium batteries within the package. I have looked through the whole package and i can only find alkaline batteries(AAA) that came with the product. Astro might want to relook into this as this is providing misleading information as air shipping is sensitive towards lithium equipped products.",

I've never dropped the gauge more than a few inches, but it feels very solid and the handle valve works great. It is easy to both inflate and deflate the tire and really saves time if you have many vehicles with dual-tires.",
