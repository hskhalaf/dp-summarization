I purchase this one to use as a hard case for a first aid kit. I like the bright orange color and the size works well for a kit. I prefer the smaller ones for ammo transport and the larger crates for storage. This size ammo can, will easily exceed 30 pounds when full of ammo. So this size is not my favorite for ammo. While I like this ammo can for mixed storage, I would recommend you use the smaller cans or the double handle crates for your ammo transport and storage.",

Right next to this ammo box in that compartment I had a roll of toilet paper in a plastic Folgers coffee can. The toilet paper was dry as a bone.

If you're not going to carry it far, or you're not going to completely fill these cans up, you'll be fine, but if you're planning on packing them up completely like the picture shows, be prepared to have an ammo can that's not easily portable over any significant distance. Personally, I'm going to go with the .50cal sized MTMs for my ammo storage, they seem to be a better compromise between size, ammo weight, and portability. I'll still find a use for these big cans, they're well made.",
