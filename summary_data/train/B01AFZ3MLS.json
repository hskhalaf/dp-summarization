Firstly defective phone disappointed me and then with fate it so happened my wife dropped the phone leaving few cracks on the case and now the vendor had taken advantage not to fix nor send me a new one. I wish good luck who wish to purchase this phone thru this vendor & Amazon combination!!\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e",

Came from the Zen phone max, this is suppose to be faster with less battery but better camera. The less battery part is 100% true. This phone barely makes it to lunch time from 100% after only 6 months of use. I would not recommend this phone to anyone who will use it more than 2 months.",
