      "text": "Sound was OK, much better than TV's, and I was happy with it. Months ago I began to hear a loud 'CLICK' repeated every second, continuously, after using the unit for a few hours. Then after a hour of use it would start CLICKing. Now within seconds of turning it on. This happens an all sources, all volume levels, and the volume of the CLICKing is constant (loud) no matter what the audio volume. So now it's a unplugged expensive base only for my tv. Maybe someday i'll rip out it's internals except for the speakers and add my own amplifier, one that doesn't CLICK...CLICK...CLICK...CLICK...CLICK...CLICK...CLICK...CLICK...CLICK.........",

To watch TV, I have to turn the unit back on again every few minutes. Reading other similar reviews, it would seem that the Fluance AB40 is very unreliable. Fluance want's the customer to pay shipping to have it repaired/replaced. This is a heavy unit and the shipping costs are sky high! I'm very disappointed and would never consider another Fluance product.",

      "text": "The sound is great. I have 2 issues. 1 is your height dimensions are not accurate. They state the unit is 3.9 inches tall, however with the rubber feet it is more like 4.1. I built a shelf exactly 4 inches below my Tv and the unit did not fit. I had to take my TV off the wall and adjust the TV bracket so the unit would fit on the shelf. 2 is you should add a HDMI audio out because some TV's IE: Panasonic do not stream audio from the optical audio out.",
