Everything worked as advertised. Maybe a little WD40 or grease where the poles connect but only a drop at most, you don't want it to bleed onto your canvas. I bought a wrinkle free heavier canvas and it holds it well. If you're expecting to be able to do gymnastics on this, you can't but for simple, even professional photography, it's great. With the clamps, it held up the black sheet I used for the attached photos, along with the white canvas I bought as well.",

First, the cross bar on top does not lock into place when you expand it, which means that any lateral forces will cause it to collapse in on itself. At its fully extended height, it is extremely unstable, even with the provided sandbags. We bought this to use as a DIY photo booth backdrop for our wedding. For those who might have a similar plan, keep in mind that this is pretty short for a photo booth and doesn't extend to the listed height (I measured).",

Even if you're just using it inside, I'd still recommend using the sandbags provided because it is so lightweight. I've almost knocked it over several times just because of how I have to situate it in my room to take videos.",

The bag it comes with doesn\u2019t fit all 4 pieces into the inner slot where they won\u2019t slide out Pros It\u2019s nice and tall if needed. The clips are great to have but could be nicer plastic.
