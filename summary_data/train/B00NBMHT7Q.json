      "text": "I've never been a big fan of SONY headpones; to me they always lacked immediacy and punch... until now, that is. When I plugged these beauties into my CEntrance DACmini, I was honestly blown away! Can a headphone have powerful, in-your-gut bass and have extraordinary clarity and soundstage at the same time... YES, these have that. Welcome SONY to the realm of the audiophile headphone! They're right at the top of my collection (and I own the JVC DX1000i, KOSS ESP 950, and Sennheiser HD700 -- all of which I love for distinct reasons)",

Only problem I had with this is the seal that was so tight my ears would start sweating and then I wished I could jump into cold water! That good the seal is with this thing. I bought this refurbished for a good price. Looked new but not in original packaging. Whole thing was wrapped in bubble wrap. The cable connectors were wrapped in styrofoam. Got a case to put the headphones as basically it was an expensive headphone at time of release ($699) Still not outdated in any form.",

While I usually hate Sony headphones (except the SA5000), this is a major exception. So for me to rate this 5-stars is saying a lot. If I had to name the best aspect, it'd be bass. Typical of high-end Sony's. If you want more details on the build quality or sound, read other reviews; I won't be redundant. BUY THESE WHILE THE SUPPLY IS STILL THERE. THEY WILL BE DISCONTINUED LIKE THE SA5000'S!!",

I like craftsmanship and durable assembly. The price is eyebrow-worthy... but I feel I got what I paid for. This fits the bill... Very impressed",
