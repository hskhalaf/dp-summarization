I bought them to help my son in and out of the car at carpool at school. I wanted a board that didn\u2019t stick out too far for me to bang my shins on and I don\u2019t care for the chrome boards that add an extra chrome strip next to the existing chrome stripe already on the car. That looks redundant to me, but that\u2019s my personal preference. My pics show one side before and one side after.",

Two complaints I have; one of which goes for any product that needs mounting hardware; is that anything that needs mounting hardware, WHY IS IT SOLD SEPERATELY!?! And I don't believe it has anything to do with pricing the product because either way you have to spend the money, so why not just include it? My second complaint is that even though they seem pretty rugged, I feel they would need a middle mounting bracket. They are decently sturdy, I just find that over time that may fade.",

      "text": "If you have a 2016 Ford Edge, don't buy these running boards. The actual running boards are excellent, but the problem lies with the installation kit. To install the brackets that hold the running boards, you have to remove four protective covers that shield the under-body of the vehicle. So now I have exposed sheet metal with holes, exposed brake lines, an exposed rubber hose that goes to the gas tank, etc... If Dee Zee had some form of template that would indicate what to trim out of the panels would fix this problem. So now I am going to have to try to figure out how to trim the panels to reinstall them.",

The Dee Zee mounting kit are single piece bracket, designed specifically for your vehicle. A number of other products required drilling holes into your car frame, who want to drill out their brand new car. The Dee Zee mounting kit required no drilling, in my case, two bolts secure the mount to the chassis. The running boards themselves were easy to install onto the brackets. It took me about an hour to mount and install both sides. I would highly recommend the Dee Zee product.",

Not sure about other reviews about not getting chrome (it says on the specifications on what they should expect to get).",
