I wasn't using my big boy i-5 much as the moment and needed something to give me a little extra graphical edge over the built-in graphics. I used the passive cooling model and didn't need an extra power supply. Worked great for everything I needed it for including some old emulation. Great for epsxe and ppsspp. Not quite up to par pcsx2 or dolphin, though that could probably be put more on my processor than anything. I am considering trying the 2gb model to see if that gives me the performance need for those. So, really a solid product for a good price.",

      "text": "I recently built a server whose PCIe 16x slots were taken by SATA controllers and Network controllers. Since I only needed a video card for basic display, I was hoping to find one that supported PCIe 1x, and this fit the bill. The card works perfectly and its fanless design makes it silent as well. It's a bummer more manufacturers don't make similar offerings, but I'm glad ZOTAC does!",

I was able to connect this via a mini pcie adapter for an Acer Aspire xc-603g, which has built in graphics that have proven to be noticeably lesser than what the GT 710 1GB was able to deliver. The difference was enough to make Minecraft education edition playable. I'd guess a difference in at least 25 fps, considering how ultra choppy the onboard graphics was running it.",
