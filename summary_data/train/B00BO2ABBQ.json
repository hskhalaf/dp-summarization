Despite these beginner throwers often hitting hard things that were not the target, all the tips remained in good shape. No damage at all. They are well balanced and easy to throw. I did wrap a brightly colored tape around part of the handle to make them easier to find since they can get lost in grass when people miss. I like the case that these come with too.
