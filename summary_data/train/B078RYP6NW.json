Both nights she had to remove them later in the night as the warmer her feet that much. I was on the same trip and was frozen, im going to order some of these for me. Ps. These are not for walking on dirt or sand they for sleeping that is it. Miss using a product doesnt decrease the produces awesomeness.",

I've tried multiple socks, nalgenes with hot water in them, hand warmers in my socks, etc. These little booties are the best! Now if these guys would make a butt warmer, I would never sleep cold again. Pros: Pack down tiny Weigh nothing Incredibly insulating THE BEST COLD-FOOTED-BACKPACKER'S ITEM EVER! Cons: Zero! Note on sizing: I have tiny feet. I wear a boys/men 3 and a women's size 5.5. I got the size small booties. When I took them out of the packaging I was alarmed they wouldn't fit, but they were fine!",

It could be partly how big the Small is on me (Women\u2019s 8 1/2 shoe size). But I think it\u2019s mostly because they don\u2019t have elastic at the top. I went and ordered another pair with elastic from 2 different brands, and both stayed on. I will see how they work for my cousin with 9 1/2 feet and if they\u2019re still too big, I\u2019ll give them to my aunt, who wears a 10-11. We all love the outdoors.",
