      "text": "Love this scoreboard! 5th season using it. Always get compliments. No more asking what the score is during our many softball games. This is NOT flimsy as one review said very sturdy and has endured the weather, and constantly being thrown in the back of my van or stuff put on top of it. Only negative is even tho I used dry erase markers it doesn\u2019t wipe off so the team names are permanent. I\u2019ll have to used paper to cover it when I have to use it for other daughter\u2019s games but Worth the price!",

So I\u2019m not sure what you are supposed to do with that space. The board is way bigger than you would really want it to be to use on a backstop . Not impressed.",
