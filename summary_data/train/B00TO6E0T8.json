It also has a plastic seam that, at least for me, kept rubbing on my forehead and became quite uncomfortable.

The head sticks up pretty high, I ran into tree branches and it didn't rip. Just remember how tall it is. The blower did what it was supposed to do. Highly recommend for lots of fun.",

However, the top of the zipper area was improperly sewn all the way, leaving an area for air to escape, and the fan motor was noisily laboring a bit with a slight burning smell, well beyond what my similar previous T-Rex costume did. The inside packaging it came in was also opened when delivered, so I am not sure if it was a returned item or not. Really too bad, because it had great potential and I think would have been just as good as my T-Rex. So sad! Now too late to get a replacement in time for Halloween.",

The costume hasn't been affected by it at all as it still inflates just fine. This is a hilarious costume and got nonstop laughs both from myself and other people at a small nerdy type of convention.
