      "text": "Job well done to authors Jennifer Greene and Andrew Stellman on creating another wonderful Head First reference, this time for PMP prep. I was dreading ordering the new PMBOK because of how poor the reviews were for formatting alone and it dawned on me that there might be a better alternative. Enter Head First PMP. I loved the format so much I gifted my copy to a colleague who is taking a PMP prep course and am ordering another for myself! Highly recommend this book to those who want a more \"brain friendly\" approach to PMP prep!",
