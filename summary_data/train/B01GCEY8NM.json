      "text": "Other reviewers have mentioned Poundland and I rate these lower than products not intended to be all that good. The published claims for these are all false and the reason is that cheap plastic parts distort the circuit board so charging is hampered. Charging with the transparent part removed gives a slightly better score but once re-assembled the distortion makes the lights unreliable. Removing the top and pressing off-on can cause them to work but when the 'glass' is put back on they die. These are not water resistant unless wrapped in clingfilm whereas ultra-cheap Poundland garden light sticks usually are for a few months. These lights are trash. Avoid.",

My only problem with the lights are the fixing screws that come with the product are very poor qaulity and two of my screws broke on installation. Save yourself time and effort and use better qaulity replacement screws when fixing. But other than that I'm very pleased with the lights.",
