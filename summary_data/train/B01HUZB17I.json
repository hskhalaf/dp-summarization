They contacted me and were determined to make me happy either through refund or replacement. After some friendly discussion, i became clear that my original purchase plus my dogs (6) there might have been of a minor defect plus heavy use with the dogs that led to some detachment fro the screen/magnet.. The seller went way above and beyond to make me happy. I go the new replacement in 2 days and it works perfectly! This is the kind of Sellers Amazon needs. Highly recommend product and Seller!",

We used additional double sided tape, but it was no match for our recent heat wave and after a month or so melted off. It's been sturdy every since we added the pushpins. Also, the other reviews complain about the magnets not sticking together. Just remember to mount the middle (where the doors meet) slightly higher than the corners (an inch or two) and the magnets will close just fine.",

Then make put up the other side to the top checking to be sure the magnets will fall in place from top to bottom. Now begin attaching the sides from the top down, do not pull the screen to tight you want a slightly loose screen so that the magnets will easily attach to each other after you pass through.

      "text": "One of the keystone features of this product is the durability and 'extra' stitch reinforcement. The reason I knocked a star off is because the stitching where the two sides meet, at the top, is a little too restrictive. This leads to a less 'fluid' time passing through the screen. Overall not a huge issue, but if you are not careful it would be easy to get caught and either drop what you are carrying or potentially pull the entire thing down if you have enough force. Overall a good product, but where you feel tension when going through it is a little awkward.",

At the same time, we have not accidentally trapped a single bird since this product was installed. It has remained attached to an exterior door frame all summer without peeling or in detachment. I would definitely order another one of these for next summer if this one does not last through the winter.",

This is our second magnetic screen, but the reason we had to replace it was not the product's fault but our dog and 4 year old's doing. I would replace this 1000x if need be because it is SO helpful, easy to install and durable (except against excitable canines and mischievous little boys).",

If you don't create a peak in the center the magnets will not catch every time. I ended up using some small wide head screws to gets this to stay in place. The adhesive no loner works so there are small gaps in places. But over all it does what I wanted.",

Great adhesive and the magnets are strong. it closes every time. It worked for a 225 lb Mastiff. It became our dog door from our pool screen to the yard. We just removed a 3 foot area of our screen panel and hung this at the top and of the cage and it was perfect.",
