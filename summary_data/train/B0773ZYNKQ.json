I am always weary of buying any glass product because of the possibility of damage in shipping but these were packaged well. The stopper fits tight and so do the lids. I like the darker color of the glass as well. The only improvements I can make on this product is 1. a larger version to hold more oil and 2. some way of differentiating bottles maybe with a colored ring because I like to infuse my oils for cooking. Some with assorted seasonings others with hot peppers. Overall, a great product for a good price.",

I only use the flip top spout and funnel. Taking the plastic cover off of the other spout is too much and invites the piece getting lost. All of the extra pieces are just sitting in the box it came in. However, I didn't deduct a star because I like that they are allowing us to decide how to use it.",

I had been wanting easier access to olive oil for a while and finally just spent the little bit of money. It was completely worth it, let me tell you. This very aesthetic bottle now graces my counter and I get to feel like a true chef -lightly- drizzling olive oil into pans. Maybe it was just me that always accidentally poured too much into the pan before and had to pour it back into the bottle, but this thing SOLVED my PROBLEM. buy it.",
