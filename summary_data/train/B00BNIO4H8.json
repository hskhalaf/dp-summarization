I'm well pleased with the sound. Bass is better than I expected. I purchased it because I heard one that a friend has versus one of the high end Bose jobs.

The sound is really good and does not distort when they turn them very high. These may not be the best fit for those who like professional quality but they were better than expected for my young adults. Great value for the price!

Just note that it sounds much louder indoors than outdoors, but it can still get pretty loud.",

I didn't want to spend a lot of money and this speaker fit the bill. For the highly critical listening individual, like I used to be, go bigger and spend a little more money. For the casual listener, I recommend this speaker.",

Decent size that you can put it on a bottle cage of your bike if you want. Only hing that is missing In my opinion is a 2.5 stereo output so that you will be able to use another jbl charge simultaneously. As you know you cannot use two blutooth device at the same time from one source.",

The shadow sounds good but needs a little more treble or JBL needs to make an equalizer app. I give it two thumbs up.",
