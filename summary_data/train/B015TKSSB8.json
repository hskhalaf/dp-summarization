Original review: Amazon is selling old stock or their improper storage has damaged the battery upon arrival. These are suppose to charge to 12.8 volts per the label on the back. First one charges to 12.5 volts. Second one to 12.3 volts. This equals about a year of use in my mind. Since I'm paying full price I want a fully charged jumper and not something that is the equivalent of a used 1 year old device.",

      "text": "This is an absolutely fantastic product!! Fortunately, I bought this in October before a strong cold snap out of Canada. My diesel Jeep Liberty would barely even crank-over. Used the GB150, and in just a few cranks, the diesel came to life !! Also needed it again today for a diesel VW and a lawn tractor. Instant start for both. Charge drop on the GB150 after these 'starts' was minimal, as only the 100% green light was blinking. USB charger on 5 volts brought the charge back to 100% in less than an hour. I love this thing !! Good job NOCO",
