(Hold the blue tooth button 5 secs to disconnect another phone which may be preventing you from connecting your phone). Battery lasts a long time, like a least 10 hours without a charge (and without sunlight). The best sound I've heard from a portable bluetooth speaker. One is to get great sound. One warning though, if you turn them up too high, especially with loud bass, they blow easily. Then they sound super fuzzy with each bass beat. This has happened twice to me.",

So frustrating to spend over $200 on this and it dies three weeks after the return window. Buyer beware! Do not buy this product. You are better off taking a pile of cash and setting it on fire.",
