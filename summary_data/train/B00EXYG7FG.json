      "text": "Melissa and Doug used to be quality products. The tree was glued to the base with too much glue, causing it to lean forward, a few of the ornaments are chipped, and this is straight out of the package. There was no damage to the box or anything, so that leads me to believe that M&D's quality control department was on break that day. Definitely not the same quality as the puzzles we've had for 10 years.",

I was wary of buying this because of the quality issue I've had in the past. I didn't need to be - this tree is absolutely lovely. The ornaments and tree itself have glitter on them, but it doesn't shed which I appreciate. It is super pretty and a great toy or advent calendar for children. All of my kids (1.5-7) enjoy playing with it and I am considering getting another one for the oldest two to keep in their room.",

The types of wooden advent calendars with the small wooden boxes or drawers are expensive! So this is a great price, made of wood also and helps your child with counting the days and deciding which ornament to place on the tree each night. We're a busy family, so I wanted an activity that can be quick but still mark the days, and this is definitely it. I could see this being enjoyed by our family for many years to come.",

It\u2019s fun for kids but, it\u2019s also fun for adults who don\u2019t want to open something everyday but still be able to have an advent calendar. Perfect for all ages !!!!!!

I like starting from the bottom but this year I might go from the top. I love how it brightens my office space and placing an ornament at the end of the work day is sl much fun.

Unlike regular advent calendars, this one is made for play. It also has a lot of replay value because the wooden, magnetic \"ornaments\" can be placed on any date on the tree. My niece enjoyed decorating and undecorating the tree over and over. The decorations are a nice size for little hands and the attached wooden tray at the bottom of the tree is generously sized to hold all of the ornaments plus the star. I know she'll enjoy this advent calendar for many years to come.",

This countdown tree was perfect. Each ornament is uniquely painted, making the selection of the day\u2019s ornament exciting for her. The ornaments are lightweight but well made. The magnets and metal surface are not obvious at all, it just looks like a wooden decoration. The magnets are strong enough to make the ornaments adhere, but not so strong that they can\u2019t be easy moved. This is a winner and will be a tradition for years to come.",

I'm unfortunately disappointed in the product construction and a little surprised because it's a quality brand. While it's held up for the first couple of weeks, it's obvious that it was not built for durability and I'm certain the graphics will start to peel off with continued use. Additionally, the magnets are not very strong and fall off very easily and slide down the tree if nudged by little fingers. Hopefully it will last a few years at least. There really isn't anything else similar to this out there.",

I like that it's a countdown and not an advent calendar, as Christmas is already enough about gifts and treats and they don't need more. I also love that it's reusable. The only negative I have, this 4 stars instead of 5, is that the green of the tree is paper and can peel. Our tree is peeling in the corner a little bit already. Probably because my younger son enjoys playing with it and putting the ornaments off and on.",

    "description": "Add some kid-friendly holiday cheer and a charming yuletide ritual to your home with this wooden magnetic holiday tree! The set includes 24 magnetic ornaments plus a shining star for Christmas day-all of which fit neatly in the attached box at the base of the tree. Kids can pick a favorite design to place on the tree each day, following the numbered outlines to fill the tree right up to Christmas. They'll also love to switch, move, and rearrange the pieces to customize their very own tree countless times. Decorating your Countdown to Christmas Wooden Advent Calendar will not only become a highly-anticipated annual tradition, it can also be a great way to help promote and reinforce many developmental skills as children grow. Use the numbers on the tree to help young children with number recognition and to learn to count both forwards and backwards; as they get older, ask children to add the numbers in a row. Play games with the ornaments to help develop color recognition and memory skills. For example, have kids find all of the ornaments that have red but no green or name all of the colors on individual ornaments. Or, ask them to choose five ornaments and study them carefully; then, have them to close their eyes while you remove one ornament. Can they guess which one is missing? The learning possibilities are endless! For more than 30 years, Melissa & Doug has created beautifully designed imagination- and creativity-sparking products that NBC News called \u201cthe gold standard in early childhood play.\u201d Today, Melissa & Doug is proudly partnering with the American Academy of Pediatrics to foster early brain development and help children build important life skills through play.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nFrom classic wooden toys to crafts, pretend play, and games, Melissa & Doug products provide a launch pad to ignite imagination and a sense of wonder in all children so they can discover themselves, their passions, and their purpose. \n\nSince the company\u2019s founding more than 25 years ago, Melissa & Doug has consistently delivered innovative products that inspire open-ended thinking, encourage kids to see new possibilities, and offer Countless Ways to Play.
