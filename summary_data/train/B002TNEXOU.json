      "text": "Without these boots my old dog would not be able to walk around the house at all. She is arthritic and has weak hips, and without these she cannot walk or stand on hardwood floors. She wears these morning to night all day. The first pair wore out in about 6 months and she's on her second pair. I tried another brand, Ruffwear, I believe that had a single strap and more traction thinking it would be better. While it did have better traction, it rubbed sores on her ankles in a few days. The ultra paws design with two straps and a soft foam on the ankle portion allows for long term wear without causing sores. Thank you!",

I think the product could be improved to have some more flexibility at bending points. I should add that there is soft neopreme foam padding around the inside, which cushions the pay. The no-slip bottom does the job its supposed to. Overall, we'd purchase this again as we've found nothing better.",

I am returning and ordering the medium, in hopes that it is actually slightly larger than 2.75 in, and thus a better fit.

She doesn't seem to mind them at all and leaves them on. I let her walk around with just one on for awhile, then two until all four of them were on her. She did \"wave\" at first and looked like a Tennessee Walking horse, but she seemed to adjust to them quickly and even seems to like them.I would highly recommend them...great product.",

The boots fit well and protect his nails (which had previously worn down to the point of bleeding). They also offer great traction on hardwood and linoleum floors, where he has the most difficulty with slipping and maintaining balance. However, the drawback is that the top seam (where the rubbery portion meets the nylon portion)rubs on the tops of his toes and has caused painful lesions. I'm not sure what to do... he needs the traction help and foot protection, but this boot is causing a new source of pain for my poor pup who is already suffering enough.",
