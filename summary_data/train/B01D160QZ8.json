But so far they are holding up well. I do hand wash, so I do not know how they will do in a dish washer.",

Be advised, however, to not use a pizza cutter on this if you're making dumplings, it will slice right through the mat.",

I will also begin using this with my new induction cooktop. Check it out! You can use these between the pot and the glass to prevent scratching. I love that it comes with two sizes! My granddaughter will use this with playdough. This is a wonderful deal.",
