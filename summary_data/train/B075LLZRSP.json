The cover really needs two people to snug into place. Tight fit but easy with two. Due to snow added four PVC rafters zip tied into ceiling. Also added power for lights and battery tender. My 2018 Kawasaki Versy 1000 with top case fits inside perfect!!!! Well made! Also added floor mat. One light heats the whole area when closed!",

Directions (photos only, no text) are clear and very easy to follow. All pieces present - but suggest a few more stakes are provided. Plan to go out and buy more to secure the legs better.

I\u2019d keep it out of heavy sun load if possible, but overall it seems worth the price for an outdoor storage option.",
