This has been the worst!!! All the positive reviews had to have been the company or paid. After 1 use the handles ripped and began to fray. It wasn\u2019t even overloaded! I didn\u2019t even use it because it looked so bad after 3 uses. I left it set in my car for emergencies and use my old one or a backpack. See these photos. It wasn\u2019t actually carried more than a few times.",

Don't even bother as they come off all the time and then one snapped due to the weight of the bag (which had only the usual things in it and was not excessively heavy). Buy stroller clips from Freddie and Sebbie if you need them, because once the JJ Cole clips break, you can't even purchase them again separately anywhere in Australia or for online delivery.",

I LOVE the look of it; great accessory when dressing up or down. Great Bag!",

I've used daily for 4-5 months, and the zipper completely broke off (metal part snapped) the main compartment, and the zipper tabs keep falling off the other zippers (tightening the metal piece increases risk of those snapping, too), and the handles are showing significant wear. The bag didn't even come with the detachable shoulder strap -- something I was initially willing to overlook, but this is just one more compounding issue. Great bag in theory -- not so much in practice.",
