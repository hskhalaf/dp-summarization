      "text": "First I must preface this with - my baby has never pooped in the pool. We regularly attend swimming lessons and we'd been using Huggies everything including swim diapers which worked just fine. Baby is 2 now and he said he wanted \"the Dora ones\" so I decided to give these a try. They're SO easy to get on and off and the size 6 fits my kid perfectly (35lb 38.5\" tall) Not super bulky like the Huggies. I'm a fan - until he poops - then we'll see what happens. :-) My only complaint would be that when they arrived they had Elmo on them...so not \"the Dora ones\". Luckily he either hasn't looked or doesn't remember.",

Thankfully we have not had an accident at the pool, because that would be embarrassing to see \"lil floaters\" from your litter floater. So, for a sense of security I choose Pampers... also they give you the codes to redeem for items with their Points to Grow program (I believe Huggies has something similar too).",

Diapers should be changed whenever they are wet or soiled. Your baby will often (but not always) let you know. With a super-absorbent diaper like Pampers, you can tell if it's wet by feeling for lumps in the absorbent material.\n\nHere are some common times for changing diapers:\n\n * Right before or right after every feeding\n * After every bowel movement\n * Before bedtime\n * When your baby wakes up\n * When you go out with your baby\n\nIs there anything special I need to know about changing a diaper?\nPampers Diapers are designed to adjust to your baby's shape for a snug, comfortable fit. While you\u2019re changing diapers, there's no need to fold the waistband in or out or to adjust the leg cuffs.\n\n * Place tabs parallel to the waistband and centered on the character strip.\n * Use the characters as guides to ensure the fasteners are evenly spaced.\n * Keep baby products such as powder away from the fasteners so they maintain their stickiness.\n\nWhat size diaper is right for my baby?\nJust like you, babies like to wear things that fit just right. Choose a size that does not sag or gap, even as your baby crawls and plays. This will help prevent leaks. Each product description on this site gives guidelines that represent the average weight for a particular size. And remember, when you move up a size, you gain absorbency.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best method to weigh my baby?\nThe easiest way to weigh your baby is to first hop on the scale yourself. See how much you weigh, then see how much you weigh when you hold your baby. If you subtract your weight, you'll know how much your baby weighs.\n\nIs there any safety information I need to know about diapers?\nYou buy the latest toys, and babies wind up playing with silly things\u2014like diapers. It's important to keep diapers where they should be, on your baby's bottom. Don't let your baby put the diaper in his mouth. Discard any diaper that has become torn or unsealed, and read the warning label on all bags.\n\nHow do diapers absorb all that moisture?\nAGM is the absorbent gelling material widely used in diaper padding to absorb wetness. It is perfectly normal to see some gel on the skin from time to time, especially if the diaper is heavily saturated. It can easily be removed by wiping your baby's skin.\n\nThis material has a long history of safe use in a variety of products and has been in diapers for more than a decade. Absorbent gelling material is closely related to ingredients widely used in cosmetics and in food processing.\n\nDo unused diapers need to be stored anywhere special?\nStore your diapers in an area protected from extreme heat and humidity and away from products with fragrances. We recommend the diapers be kept in a dry storage area where the temperature is 85 degrees or less.\n\nALSO TRY\nview larger Pampers Extra Protection diapers help eliminate nighttime leaks.\n\nGOES GREAT WITH...\nview larger Pampers Soft & Strong wipes, available in Baby Fresh and Natural Clean.",
