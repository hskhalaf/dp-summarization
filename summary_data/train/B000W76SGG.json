Due to cracking of wood and extra work needed to finish the wood the lower price would make this a better value. As it is, overpaying is unfortunate and reduces the satisfaction level.",

However, it's been up one week and the wood is already splintering and wood slats that make the table top had obvious chips out of them that were glued back on ( not very well). I also see the price dropped since I bought it, so I'm a little bothered by that. It is definitely sturdy enough to use as a server for a cook out and a bench for potting. If you keep it in a sheltered part of your patio or deck it should be fine. I won't know until the end of summer about the durability of it.",

This is relatively lightweight, but it doesn't even shake in a 25-30 mph wind in our yard. It is simply the greatest Mother's Day gift ever! (well, okay, one of the greatest :D)",

I plan on buying another one as I've filled this one already. It's not overly heavy and I would understand anyone thinking it a little flimsy, but for the money I think it's great. Add a cheap trellis to the back and you've got an instant privacy screen too As it folds up, it will be easy to store for winter if necessary.",
