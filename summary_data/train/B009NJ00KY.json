They are very solid and sturdy and are much easier to clean than I expected. I had initial concerns that they might allow too much steam to escape when baking for an extended time, but that is not an issue at all. It is terrific to have a completely non-toxic set of cookware with no concern over leaching of metals or chemicals into the food. These have worked beautifully and reliably!! I highly recommend them.",
