For those who don't know, there is typically an eventual odor associated with self tanners. That's not what I'm talking about. The lotion smells like coconut or something but it is very strong. I'm guessing it was added to help mask the self tanner smell but it has made it so much worse. As I said, despite rave reviews by my friends using \"the old?\" product, I will probably not be able to get through my first order. Too bad!",
