All the appliance repair places say they will not work on them. The companies LG recommended can't buy parts because their account is \"on hold\". Got a repair estimate today for $1,200 and he said we had to buy the parts ourselves. LG will not sell us parts. We still had to pay for the service call. We have lost most of the food in our refrigerator over the last 2 days. Please do not buy LG.",
