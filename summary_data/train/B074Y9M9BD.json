The barrell of the grill is taken up almost entirely by the bird and this causes uneven heating even with frequent rotation. Turkey was still good though. Im going to try a smaller turkey later... I bet it will do fine. The firebox takes smaller wood than i would like but uses wood slowly and smokes great. So if you are smoking turkey sized meats frequently get a larger grill. For ribs, boston butts, pork loin, shoulder, etc this smoker is perfect.",
