      "text": "Excellent picture, easy to use Roku operating system, fantastic value, factory settings we're almost ideal. I've had the set for a month and I'm more than satisfied. Haven't seen any of the ghosting or picture lines that some reviewers noticed. Only issue involved remote unable to turn on TV twice after being off. I called customer support (easy to contact) and they said to try turning on set manually using on-off button on lower right of screen. That worked and diced the problem. No further issues at all. The factory sound/speakers are only adequate, but after connecting to my 5.1 surround AV receiver using optical cable, sound is outstanding. Highly recommend this system. You won't be disappointed.",

And the TV speakers face down/back so they sound reflected, because they are. I will likely get a sound bar because of this. Still, I'm very pleased for the price.",

I can only see the a muddiness around the outer edges of the TV when the screen is completely white (during commercials) but that's forgiven by the BLACK this TV produces. I used Rting,com's recommendations for obtaining the best picture quality and I can say this TV is a steal at $650. The sound is mediocre, so I bought the Visio soundbar and subwoofer SB3621N-E8 which sounds Great!!",

The product was unavailable for a couple weeks and I was hoping TCL was fixing some of their manufacturing or quality control issues. When it was for sale again I quickly bought one. Image out of the box is amazing. Really can not ask for anything more for how cheap the TV is. However I do notice the banding issue with some scenes. Its not enough where I am upset and want a refund, however it is easily noticeable in some scenes.",

Once that happens, you have to take the batteries out, turn the tv off, turn the tv back on, replace the batteries, etc. If this happened once every 6 months, it wouldn't be a big deal, but it happens frequently. There are also HDMI ARC issues with how it communicates with an AVR. That issue can be mitigated slightly by turning things on in a certain order, but honestly, watching TV shouldn't be like the Apollo 13 mission every time.",

This is all well and good, but it's not great when someone sits on the remote and you get immediately taken out of what you're watching and thrown into an entirely different app. But if you're disciplined enough to leave your remote on the table (obviously, I am not), I can't see a reason not to grab this TV.",
