I ordered this product to another region, and after receiving the opportunity to return it was no longer possible. The main problem is that after putting on clothes under the jacket there is a lot of fluff left, and when you come to the office, take off your jacket they look at you like a duck !!!! and at the seams hung a lot of threads that had to be pulled and cut",

      "text": "I purchased two of these coats. The Navy is a true navy, and the Royal is not too bright, it is exactly as pictured. The large jackets fit both guys well, one is 6' 2\" and slim and the other is 5' 10\" and average build. There is plenty of room to layer underneath, they are not bulky at all, and the jackets are very warm. We live in winter 6 months of the year and a warm jacket is a necessity.",
