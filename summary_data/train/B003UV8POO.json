It dries pretty quickly so they can draw on it all over again, but not so fast that you can't admire your creations for a bit. If you have more than one child using it, I'd recommend buying an additional water pen so they don't fight over whose turn it is. Or, if you already have them, you can also use other water pens that come with other water doodle sets.",

My only complaint was there weren't very many pictures or designs after you color in the mat, just flat colors. There are numbers and letters around the border, but otherwise it's fairly blank. If your child prefers to color in rather than free-hand draw, they may get a bit bored with the mat.",
