Until recently, I\u2019d been using regular B12 and couldn\u2019t understand how other people said it gave them energy and made them feel better. It did nothing for me. Then I did some research and read that methyl B12 was different because it was already broken down and useable immediately. I decided to order this and try it. After 5 days of use, I actually can tell a difference. I\u2019m not ready to run any marathons, but I definitely have more energy and better focus than before. I will definitely buy this product again.",

This methylcobalamin form of B-12 can bypass the liver and absorb in to your bloodstream much better. The other form of B-12 is mostly wasted and gets passed right through the urine. The flavor is great and they are easy to keep in the mouth for a minute or two, then chew. I am definitely buying more. A+++",

I was a total skeptic but with all the positive reviews and the cheap price, i didn\u2019t have much to lose, lol. I\u2019m so, so glad i tried this out! 10/10 recommend. You\u2019ll feel the difference in yourself in about a week (in my opinion). Try it!",

      "text": "This product has XYLITOL in it, which is an artificial sweetener and a chemical compound. The problem is that one of Xylitol's known side effects is very soft stools and additionally (in my case) lower gastrointestinal issues/discomfort. If I am taking daily dietary supplements, that means I'm concerned about what I'm putting into my body. I refuse to ingest artificial sweeteners like Xylitol, Sorbitol, Sucralose, Aspartame, and Saccharin. I consider Xylitol/Sorbitol to be the worst of them due to its side effects on my poop factory (Xylitol and Sorbitol are almost identical).",

What It contained though are pink lozenges that do not taste like lemon, more like cherry. So I feel that I received the wrong lozenges and therefore unsure of which dosage I received, the 500mcg or the 4000mcg, since both are listed as cherry flavored. Now, as a result, I don't know how to dose myself. And even scarier, did I receive something other than B12? Just not sure. I will not order these again.",

I have to take high dosage for some reason and these do the trick.",

I'm sure the B12 form is fine and for some this is a good value but I personally would go for something with no flavor or a very mild flavor.",

Although the research says it's fine, I'm not comfortable taking the higher mcg options that Jarrow has available, but that's just my personal preference, and the 1,000 is great for me. B12 is critical for improved mood and the B vitamins play a key role in preventing aging. They are especially necessary if you on a vegetarian or vegan diet, which I tend to be.",
