We had 2 of these in use on our PCB assembly line and after months of mysterious Microcontroller failures we finally traced the issue to this soldering iron. There is 30-volt AC running through the tip, see pic. This fried approx 30% of the Arduino Minis we backpack onto our PCBs. We thought we had a bad batch of mini's but finally found the issue. This soldering iron. Both of our identical units have this issue. Do not buy if you are using on anything remotely electrostatic sensitive.",

Since you should turn down the heat when resting the iron in the cradle for more than a few minutes that means doing 5 minutes of soldering, 10 minutes of resting to install components, and 5 minutes of more soldering, takes more like 40 minutes. Once it heats up, the heat does seem to be pretty sable. That's good. But overall, pretty useless.",

Love how the iron plugs into the station so if it fails I could just buy another one. For the price weller did a good job! First soldering job completed with it and I expect many more.
