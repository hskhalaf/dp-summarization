I use it 15 minutes a day on each side of my lower face and about the same on my throat. My skin FEELs significantly smoother but the lines and wrinkles are still there. I gave it 2 stars based on the feel of my skin but I wouldn't give it any stars of doing what it was advertised that it would do.",
