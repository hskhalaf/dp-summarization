Once I saw this had Delay as it's only effect I knew this was good, no other effect would have the same bang for buck. It's well built, comes loaded with batteries for those xmas mornings or for me lack of patience to turn it on. It is way louder than I really needed, the cleans, the crunchy and the Lead/OD are all good. It has all the necessary features to dial out a bad tone. The only wish is for a multi-knob EQ configuration, this has one to sweep through hi to low predominance.",

I read the entire outside of the box the unit comes in. Nowhere does it mean mention that the power cord isn't included. When was the last time you bought something that could be plugged in or battery powered and it came with the batteries but without the cord? For me the answer is never. Will return the unit.

ISF feature's interesting, but doesn't seem to add much variation absent separate bass, treble, mid controls (maybe more/less \"crunch\", which is nice). Connecting my guitar to the amp through a VOX AP2AC amPlug AC30 G2 makes for bigger and more versatile sound. Would have issued five stars, but the Planet Waves 9V power supply Amazon recommended (and I bought) did not fit the amp. Amazon refunded the power supply purchase, however, but I had to chat w/a rep to get it done--no \"automated\" return for the power supply permitted online.",

Sure, in terms of portability it's an achievement, but what's the point if the sound is horrible? The clean signal is somewhat palatable, but it all goes down the toilet once the overdrive comes in. Awful sound. I can only imagine in hindsight that most of these positive reviews we're written by happy parents buying their children's first amp. If you're even remotely serious about your guitar-playing, this is a novelty at best; a toy at worst. I'd recommend literally anything over this (especially at near $100!).",

      "text": "This is not a toy. If you're a guitar player don't hesitate. This little sucker packs some big tone and is quite loud given its size. IF you're looking for a great little amp to travel with or jam in front of the tv...this is the one. The on board effects are very effective...from clean to fairly crunchy. (No Pantera or Exodus) but it does deliver some very warm Zeppelin and classic rock tones. All around GREAT little amp for 60 bucks. Worth every penny.",

I also love how portable it is and how we can take it on road trips if we want to. Gave my son the chance to play for his grandparents when we went to visit them. So if you're looking for something cheap and portable that still has a great sound then I think this is perfect.",

There is automatic noise suppression, a tone control knob that changes the amp emulation, delay function, gain boost button.
