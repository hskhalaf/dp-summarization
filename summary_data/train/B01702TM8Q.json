I notice that people complain about their skin being peeled off from the adhesive etc... well, you're not doing it right if it tears your skin. You are not meant to pull it off fast, like a band-aid. The best way to remove this tape is to soak it in warm water (or coconut oil) before carefully and slowly peeling it off. If you swell or get a rash from it, then you are simply allergic to the adhesive. This is the same tape my physical therapist uses. It's no miracle, but it definitely helps with the healing process!

Here's how to do it: Start with a strip in the center of each breast, adhering it to the underside. Gently lift and then stick the rest down when you've achieved the kind of life you want. Then, use two or more strips on each side of that center piece of tape until you have the smooth/round shape you want. I recommend putting on the garment every so often so you can make sure the tape isn't showing as you go!",

      "text": "I have tried Physix tape, KT tape and Rock tape. Physix tape is my go to tape after trying all three. I don't feel like the KT tape offered as much support as the Physix and Rock tape. I have no complaints about the Rock tape and it did seem to be a little thicker, but at almost twice the price it wasn't a significant difference at all. The Physix tape adhears well...when wearing it on my back it was still stuck after three days which included 2 workouts and 3 showers. When I wear it on my arm for tennis elbow I remove it everyday. A great tape at a great price!",

We will continue using it. Really like the color options. The neutral was a great choice for us since my son didn't want attention drawn to the injury.",
