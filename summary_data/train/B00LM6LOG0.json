If a drive becomes bad you'll lose all your data even in raid 5 and 10. It's slow, very very slow. The user interface is slow, the transfer rate is slow, everything about this device is very slow.

Had minor issue with it \"disappearing\" from network. After reboot, it has been stable and running flawlessly for past month. Check list for supported drives otherwise you will have stability issues.",

Easy set up \u2013 better pack a lunch, takes over a day to initialize four 2TB (simply raid) drives. One (chicken-ship) downside, the physical drives are not accessible via windows after after simply raid initialization. Lighting strike, Pepsi Syndrome or hardware failure could provide a single point of failure. So for reliability best mirror the server on another hard drive(s). We have local server backup relaying off-site backup via Carbonite. Good unit we will likely buy one or two more.",
