      "text": "this is my first projector. I am NOT tech savvy. the set up was simple and according to my son, who has had a BenQ projector at his house for over a year, my HD161X is far superior. There is smooth action with no image jump. The only thing I did not like was the fact there is no speaker or audio function for the projector. I bought a sony surround sound Blu-ray. The picture is fantastic. I coupled it with a 128\" Elite screen. I also like the 2d to 3d function which converts any 2d program into 3d. The live sports programming did not up-convert well, but recorded programs and dvd/blu-ray are great.",

Only downside is that for some reason, its trigger works for a second when I turn the projector on, then turns off for a few seconds and only then comes back on. this makes the screen start to go down when I turn on the projector, then go up again and only afte rabout 5-10 seconds go back again for good.",

I spent several hours researching all brands and models looking for he best projector regardless of price. I couldn't be happier with the quality of the image and the price I paid. I don't know what the life expectancy of the bulb or replacement cost is but up to this point we give it 5 stars.",

Note that there is no audio outputs on this projector, so you will need to link HDMI through a sound bar prior to connecting the projector, or other means for sound. Got this on prime day for $680, and it is one of the best purchases I have ever made",

Motion is very smooth and it has several functions to make fine picture adjustments. I sit ~ 6 ft from the projector and I cannot hear it running while in Eco. mode. I would love to keep this unit; however, it is a little too expensive here in Canada. I see no reason as to why this projector is ~$150 more expensive in Canada and I am not willing to pay the extra money, so I will be returning the unit - too bad...it's a lovely projector.",
