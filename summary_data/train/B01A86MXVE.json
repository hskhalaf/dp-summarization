When we were setting up the camera, we encountered a few problems that had nothing at all to do with the camera itself. I'm a senior citizen, and even with eyeglasses, I was unable to read the instruction manual or the tiny print on the camera screens itself. In the end, we couldn't set it up nor take a single image. We were so disappointed and had to return the camera. So, folks, if you have any issues at all with reading small type, this camera might not be the best for you.",

Also failed so will only focus on a tiny section in the lower left of the field of view. Due to weight constraints had only one camera -- I'm furious as I was counting on this camera for capturing photos of a once in a lifetime trip.",

As usually with all cameras....you really need to get one or find a place like Best Buy that has them on Display to try out and see which works best for you. Thos did not work for me. The Fuji camera.....it was really expensive...but took great pictures....and loved that the major adjustments were on simple rotary knobs for access.",

Picture quality is pretty good, and it has good low light performance. I've also had good luck taking pictures with this at concerts. It's definitely better than a typical point and shoot, but not as good as a full size camera.",

However, if you want outstanding photos, especially in low light, you'll have to spend a good deal of time with the manual and the camera, as the controls are a long way from being intuitive. 3. Price. At the normal retail price, this isn't a terrifically good buy. I bought mine at a heavily discounted price, which made it a good value for the money spent.",

Except for the lens softness and an AF system that sometimes misses the target, this is a good travel zoom camera.",

      "text": "My brother has owned this camera since release and I got to use it during my trip to Japan and Hong Kong. Did it all great in a small package. Previously I owned the Sony RX100 mark I. Strong enthusiast point and and shoot. Lumix just gives me a bit more reach, great f2.8 lens, ibis, and touch screen. As a travel cam it does it all for me. It will be used on trips where I do not want to take my fujifilm XT2 setup that btw is superb. Would definitely recommend this Lumix zs100 to anyone looking for an almost all you can do small package camera that delivers great results.",

Also, the post shot focus is very useful. I have shot several stills for products and am able to fine tune the focal point. The video feature is good not great. The only feature I wish it had was a higher frame rate video to do ultra slow motion video. This camera also has an amazing zoom. The Sony was not even close. It is small enough for travel. While I can't fit it into my pocket, I purchases a leather case that fits on my belt.",
