I bought both and tried them out together. Now I'm sorry that I bought this powder. No matter if I use too little, just right or too much, it makes me look old, wrinkled, and corpse-like. My friend agreed, asking why I looked like \"a morgue.\" I have normal skin, combination skin. Maybe it's just my chemistry. But I'm never going to use it again.",
