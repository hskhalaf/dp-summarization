My eyes and ears even swelled shut. I\u2019ve never had such a severe allergic reaction to anything in my life. Do not buy this product if you have sensitive skin!",

Septic safe AND Tide cleaning power! I will use Purclean forever. Awesome product! Sorry about all of the exclamation marks, but, it was a very good surprise. I am happy.",

Definitely not lavender smelling anymore. And it's strong. I have just-cleaned clothes hanging up on a drying rack and the detergent smell is wafting through the room. Wish the manufacturer had noted the new scent on the bottle. I'll be switching to another version of Tide, maybe just their free and clear so i can avoid the same problem happening again.",

I strongly suspect that the original authentic detergent was poured out and replaced with counterfeit product at some point before reaching Amazon. This would corroborate the skin rash that other customers reported for this product - I am discarding all of the detergent that I purchased through Amazon. Hopefully Amazon takes action to address this.",

TIDE, you lost yourself a customer. Original: Growing up, I could swear that Tide had a particular scent. Clean. Not sweet or fruity. But these days regular Tide doesn't smell the same. This stuff, the natural lavender, seems more like old school Tide to me. It also smells more like real lavender more than any other product I have encountered.",

Especially when your household is mostly boys who smell like the earth, I prefer at the end of the day their garments smell fresh. The scent is so pleasing and not overwhelming.",
