If you loved this product as much as I DID, try to scoop up the old formula tubes off your local store shelves before they are gone. I can no longer use it, therefore I cancelled my subscription for it. Please contact Burt's Bees via their website and ask for the original formula back!!!",

I love all of Burt's Bees products so I'm disappointed about how this one turned out. My baby has never had a reaction to any other products.",
