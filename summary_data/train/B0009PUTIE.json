It also keeps coolers cooler to keep foods and drinks cooler too! We like the fold out section in the front/the mat area. It offers extended room outside the roofed area, to put/rest messy items and feet! :) The tent materials feel sturdy and work all right. It's kinda snug (but not difficult) getting it taken apart and put back into the bag that it came with.",

Very happy with this shelter. Now it\u2019s more complex than the pop ups, but they are inferior when it comes to stability. So for me, stability in the beach wind is a bigger requirement than pop up convenience. Love it. In the picture you can see it\u2019s tall enough for full size folding chairs.",

      "text": "We use this every time we go to the beach. It provides a nice break from the sun. Only you know if you need it, but here is what I think about it after using it for 5 years at least a week per year. I am way more comfortable at the beach with some shade. This tent is ventilated well, sets up easy, has been very durable, and holds up to all levels of typical beach wind. I will buy one again if it ever wears out. I love to nap in the shade on the beach in this tent. I\u2019m cooler and don\u2019t have to worry as much about sun burn.",

The screen at the back makes the wind a non-issue and the pockets all around are great for storage. No sunburns this year, so I think this was an A+ purchase.",

      "text": "We loved having this on the beach this summer. It provided excellent shade and shelter from the wind once it was up. Some areas for improvement: I'm glad I'm experienced with pitching tents- this was not that easy to figure out. I would recommend a trial run to learn how to get it upright without wind and sand. The poles are tethered and that's great, but their a little chunky and stick a little. I feel like I'm being nit-picky because my family really valued the features this offered while on the beach.",

      "text": "Broke on fourth use, fifteen months after purchase so outside of warranty. One of the pole segments just split down the middle. Even when it wasn't broken it was not particularly to my liking. Having poles that slide through a long sleeve instead of slipping through a series of clips makes it far more difficult to setup than it should be. I have set up many, many tents in my life and this one is the most frustrating by far. Once it is setup, it is quite nice and convenient but now that I have to replace it I will definitely be looking for something else.",
