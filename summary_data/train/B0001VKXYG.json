      "text": "It's OK. The reason I can't say better is because I was very specifically looking for Fermented CLO and this appears in the search results. After reading the description, it doesn't specifically say fermented but it is \"olde world\". In the \"Olde World\" CLO was always fermented, so I assumed wrongly that was what they meant. I took the entire bottle as directed without noticing any positive results. I've since switched to Green Pastured FCLO and was shocked with a noticeable difference within 2 days,which have only gotten better over the past few weeks. This product didn't hurt/help, so I can't recommend.",

      "text": "I can't stand fish so I started taking the capsules to supplement what I couldn't gag down in real form but no matter what brand I would get the horrid fishy burp. A friend had recommended this and I unwillingly ordered it. I almost started gagging at the thought of having to swallow it but surprisingly it's not bad. It tastes like lemon flavored olive oil and I've been taking it for six months without any fishy aftertaste. My kids will even take it without complaint.",

GOL is also a very good company that I trust.",
