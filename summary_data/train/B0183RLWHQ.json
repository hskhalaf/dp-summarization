Splitting hairs, the selector switch for torque is very tough to switch.The directional switch is a bit loose. But is NOT a deal breaker at all. THIS IS THE ONLY DEALBREAKER: Amazon or whoever, raised this price from under $200 to around $250 almost overnight it seems. BOO. HISS. Price WAS $185 Out The Door!",

They have been much improved over the years and I can't say enough about this model. You know its great when you only need this one tool to do everything possible to install a garage door. It can handle anything any other drill or driver can handle in any brand. If it had just a hair more torque you could take tires off with it on a truck. It's the ultimate do it all tool.

I live that this is lighter weight than a full sized drill, but heavy duty enough to actually drill a hole. The battery is super long lasting. Couldn't live without this now.",

      "text": "I bought this drill for small jobs like engine rebuilds and around the farm work!! I really like the 3 different speed/power modes! Each mode has its place in my opinion!! Mode 1 is great for running fasteners without torquing them or worrying about stripping threads out!! It is really gentle and controllable and saves lots of time!! Mode 2 and 3 is great for pesky bolts that you just want out!! Just pull the trigger and its out!! I rarely find myself reaching for my 1/2 impact anymore unless it's really rusted in there!!",

      "text": "this impact driver performs great, but the ergonomics are not the best. the reverse switch is to far forward. it also is loud, overly so. but all in all it is the best impact driver dewalt has put out. it can drive a screw almost as fast as makita's xdt09 which is speaking a lot, although it is not as ergonomic and light or as short ( 7/8\" longer). it can drive a big screw through hard wood faster than xdt09. i would say that it is almost half again as fast as dewalt's dcf886",
