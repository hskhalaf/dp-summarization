Used Prime to order for an event in 2 days after not being able to find anything locally. They arrived with glue on the toe strap for one shoe. In trying to remove the glue the gold was removed. No time to return so I'm stuck wearing a messed up shoe. Incredibly disappointing, especially at this price point!!",

It is very sturdy, which is great for my weak ankles (from numerous sprains over the years). I can stand tall with no wobbling, which is more than I can say from the similar pair from *VC* that I purchased recently. They aren\u2019t the most comfortable heel I\u2019ve ever worn as they are 4 inches with no platform, but they are sturdy and I can walk in them with no problem. Definitely going to buy more soon.",
