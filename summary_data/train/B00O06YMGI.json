Nice design, burns fast and long, best grill I've ever used for grilling vegetables. Here's the problem; the grate is ceramic coated,it needs to be cleaned differently than other grills, I cleaned it according to the manual, but with use, the ceramic started to chip and flake here and there, eventually it rusted, \"no big deal, I'll just buy another grate\" , sorry, out of stock! Has been for a while now,(over a year). And this grill only works as advertised with the right grate. Buy something else, I wish I had",

The directions are very clear, and the parts come labelled and separated for you on a shrink-wrapped bit of cardboard. All of the parts look solid, well made, and well designed. It's awkward to roll around because the only handle is on the lid. There also isn't much room between the coal rack and the cooking rack; you basically get one layer of charcoal. Since it does use less charcoal, that's not really an issue, but it would be nice if you could vary the distance between the fire and the food.",

The design means it does a good job at a lot of things, but you really have to be creative to control the heat on different parts of the grill. You have to plan ahead placing the hot coals, because you don't want to have to take off the hot grill grate to add or move coals. So hope you get it right the first time. This is your only means of control, the grate height is fixed. That said I have made burgers, chicken, sausage, large beef roast, whole chicken, veg, even a pizza or rwo and overall it's been a blast.",

I have to shake the entire grill or use tongs to brush them down into the pan. Not a huge issue, but I noticed the Webber has a lever that does that. The hinged lid on the Kettleman along with the cooking grate are best features which to me were superior over the Webber. I've done roasts, whole chickens, ribs, steaks, shrimp and fish. It all comes out perfect. The grill is large enough that you cam move the coals to the outside edge and cook in the middle with indirect heat. I'm a fan!",
