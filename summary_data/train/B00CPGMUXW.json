I like the electric pressure washers since you don't need to remember to have gasolene on hand and it's far more quiet than a gas model. The trade off is the cord and it sometimes gets tangled with the hose but that is the case with any electric pressure washer. I will buy another just like it when, and if, this one dies.",

This is also highly sensitive, it will pulse randomly sometimes and I havent even moved the hoses or anything, its not a pressure problem.

A few things- the instructions state attach the handle with 4 screws, but there were only 2 screw holes on the handle, and it works with two. I spent a few minutes investigating for two more screw holes. The hose holder could have an extra 1/2\" to hold the hose more securely. And the cord holder could have been up higher so the wheels don't run over the hanging cord. I spent an enjoyable afternoon cleaning my deck and vinyl siding. I used plain water to see how well it cleans, and it does a fine job.",

It is perfect for women or people that have a hard time pulling on a cord to get it started. It will do a smaller job nicely but I find for heavier jobs it is not the best one to use. We have a gas washer as well and it does a much better job for tuff things to clean, but once again it is much harder to operate. Overall it is a handy item to have for the people that need an easier washer to operate.",
