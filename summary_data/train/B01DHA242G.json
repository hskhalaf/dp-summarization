Normally I can run through a mascara in a month or so, the packaging gives you so much actual product that I had my first tube last me three months. Yes I bought it again and Ill by it again when I run out. Please remember that this is for natural lashes.",

      "text": "I used to buy They're Real! Lengthening mascara regularly, but wanted to try something new. After trying this mascara, I will not return. Compared to They're Real, Better Than Sex mascara is so much better and not at all clumpy. I was really impressed by how long and pretty my eyelashes look after application. Highly recommend this over They're Real!. (In case you were trying to decide)",
