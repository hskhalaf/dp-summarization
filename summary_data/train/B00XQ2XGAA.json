It tamed my constant hunger and cravings for sugar to the point I have no interest in desert even when it's in front of me. I feel very satisfied with small, healthy, simple meals. No more processed food. No more diet soda. No more carbs and salty snacks. Thank you for this true miracle in my life!",

Upon opening it I noticed that it\u2019s more yellow in color and finer in texture than the one I received. The scoop is also different. I don\u2019t understand why the same product, same amount comes in different sized tubs, with different scoops, and are different in color??? I\u2019ve only taken it a few weeks so I can\u2019t say if it works yet. I will add to my review after I finish the product to see if it helps.",
