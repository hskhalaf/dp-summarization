It might be helpful for designers and artists to look at this book as something that requires discipline to get the most out of it. That means you\u2019ll have to make a commitment to working the projects and then set aside regular time in your schedule to do so. That\u2019s not always in the wheel house of some artistic temperaments but if you make the commitment and follow through, it will be worth the effort. In fact, giving artists a foundation for regular self-development may be the best benefit of this book.",

Beyond that I read the book just making some mental resolutions of the design and comparing them to the examples developed by the participants. I have to confess many of them were quite specific and a bit boring as, then again, they are not related to my work. But I am happy to have read the whole book: it is useful. In the visual aspect the design seems a bit dated, and I include in this appreciation the cover of the book too.",
