A laptop fits easily in either the vertical or horizontal position. They hold an astounding amount of groceries on those days I stop and shop on the way home. If you're having issues with them rubbing the spokes, you have them set too far back on the rack. Set them forward on the rack and they secure easily with the strap-n-clips. The stitching is heavy-duty, too. I should have gone straight to these because I spent as much on two trunk bags that last all of two weeks each before the stitching tore.",

CONS: I had to replace my existing bike rack with an \"Ibera Bike Rack \u2013 Bicycle Touring Carrier with Fender Board, Frame-Mounted for Heavier Top & Side Loads\" because the floppy bag would rub against the spokes of my rear tires if I hit a bump. Be sure you have a \"side fender board\" on your bike. Straps are loose and can easily end up in the spokes of your rear tire",

It's so watertight once water does spill in there you have to dry it out, it won't leak out or absorb. Which is great because I put my computer, cellphone and costly textbooks in there everyday and have ridden through torrential downpour rainstorms with no issues.",

I've tried stuffing the pockets full and clipping them in the back, but both were unsuccessful. I will try what another reviewer did and see if putting some cut sheets of plastic inside to keep the pannier pockets from bending in toward my spokes. Also, if you're just a commuter, it can be a bit annoying to have to deal with all the straps this pannier has on it, just to put it on and take it off your bike.",
