BTW, you can use the trial version of Acronis True Image to get your old drive data (including the little recovery partition) onto the new drive by performing a backup of the old drive and a restore onto the new drive. Otherwise the trial version has disabled all the useful copy/clone drive functions you need unless you pay for the full version. Didn't have to!",

BUT................Beware the one that I ordered from Amazon had to be returned because it wasn't even in the box. There was an old 2.5 inch drive inside and the celephane was sealed when it arrived. Seems to me someone at the seller or wharehouse did a swap. I did though purchase locally afterward and I would recommend this to anyone.",

This model of the 2.5-inch Vertex 4 SSD (VTX4-25SAT3-256G) offers 256 GB of storage capacity, a 510 MB/s maximum sequential write speed, and 120,000 IOPS maximum I/O performance. It's backed by a 5-year limited warranty.\n\nEXCELLING IN PERFORMANCE, NO MATTER THE FILE TYPE\nMirroring real-world performance scenarios over a broad spectrum of consumer desktop and mobile applications, Vertex 4 SSDs are designed to provide a superior user experience and extreme performance over the other current solutions available on the market.\n\nWith the cutting-edge Indilinx Everest 2 platform, Vertex 4 is optimized for consistently high speeds with the complete spectrum of file types and sizes including both compressible and incompressible data for balanced performance like no other drive you've experienced.\n\n\n\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\nINDUSTRY'S HIGHEST IOPS \nYou'll get incredible performance in workstation and heavy-duty environments with multiple data threads and performance up to 120,000 IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second, pronounced eye-ops).\n\n\n\n\nNO COMPRESSION-RELATED PERFORMANCE LIMITATIONS\nBetter performance with \"real world\" data streams of varying \"compressibility\" as well as fully incompressible data such as videos and multimedia files, encrypted data, archive files such as .ZIP files, and software.\n\n\n\n\nINDILINX INFUSED EVEREST 2 PLATFORM\nIts leading-edge, dual-ARM controller architecture enables faster performance like nothing else you've experienced.\n\n\n\n\nFAST BOOT TIMES AND ULTRA-LOW LATENCY\nBoot up in as little as 9 seconds, and industry-low latencies of .04 reads and .02 writes enable superior multitasking and flawless performance.\n\n\n\n\nNDURANCE 2.0 TECHNOLOGY\nAdvanced suite of NAND Flash management to increase durability and reliability to expand the NAND's lifespan.\n\n\n\n\nINDUSTRY-LEADING WARRANTY\nLimited 5 year warranty backed by OCZ's renowned service (with toll-free tech support and 24-hour online forum support) for ultimate peace of mind.\n\n\n\nMORE SPECIFICATIONS\n\n\nDesigned with a superior user experience \nand extreme performance (view larger).\n\nRELIABILITY/PROTECTION\n * Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF): 2 million hours \n * Data Path Protection: ECC corrects up to 128 random bits/1KB \n * Data Encryption: 256-bit AES-compliant, ATA Security Mode Features \n * Product Health Monitoring: Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology (SMART) Support \n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n * Serial ATA (SATA): Fully compliant with Serial ATA International Organization (Serial ATA Revision 3.0) and ATA/ATAPI-8 Standard Native Command Queuing (NCQ) \n * Operating System: Windows XP 32-bit /64-bit; Windows Vista 32-bit / 64-bit; Windows 7 32-bit / 64-bit; Linux; Mac OS X \n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\n * Performance Optimization: TRIM (requires OS support), dynamic and static wear-leveling, background garbage collection, Indilinx nDurance 2.0 Technology to extend SSD lifespan \n * Other Performance Features: Ndurance 2.0 Technology (reduced write amplification without compression, advanced multi-level ECC, adaptive NAND flash management) \n * Service & Support: 5-year warranty, toll-free tech support, 24 hour forum support \n\nTHE SSD ADVANTAGE\nWhether you're refreshing an older laptop or trying to maximize the potential of the latest platform, SSDs provide substantial benefits over traditional hard drives.\n\n\n\nGREATER DURABILITY\nSolid State Drives feature a non-mechanical design of NAND flash mounted to circuit boards, shock resistant up to 1500g. Hard disk drives consist of various moving parts making them susceptible to shock and damage.\n\nFASTER PERFORMANCE\nSSDs have 100 times greater throughput and instantaneous access times for quicker boot-ups, faster file transfers, and overall snappier performance than hard drives. HDDs can only access the data faster the closer it is from the read/ write heads, while all parts of the SSD can be accessed at once.\n\nLESS POWER CONSUMPTION, SILENT OPERATION, AND LIGHTWEIGHT\nSSDs use significantly less wattage at peak load than hard disk drives--less than 2W versus 6W for an HDD--delivering longer battery life in notebooks, less power strain on system, and a cooler computing environment. With no moving parts, SSDs run virtually silent in your notebook or PC case to eliminate distracting noises during gaming or entertainment. And SSDs won't weigh down your laptop, netbook, or tablet PC when you're on the go.\n\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n\nAs the fourth generation of the legendary Vertex line, the Vertex 4 Series pushes storage performance to the max and redefines the modern day computing experience. Vertex 4 SSDs are innovatively engineered to deliver industry-leading file transfer rates and superior system responsiveness, all while providing a more durable, reliable, and energy efficient storage solution compared to traditional hard drives.
