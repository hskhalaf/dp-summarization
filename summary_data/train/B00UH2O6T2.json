That aside, as a streaming and media device it was very good, and I ended up giving it away to a good friend who was extremely appreciative, and to this day still uses it for her media consumption.",

Once this is complete the TV works flawlessly, takes no time to startup and operation is much smoother than the Amazon app on my Sony Bluray player. Overall a great product which substantially expands the range of available viewing material. Amazon need however to work on providing a greater selection of factual programme material.",

Virgin doesn't support Amazon Video, so I had to use the app on my smart TV to use this. This was very clunky and searching for films was a slow and laborious process. Both work superbly on the Fire TV. Its worth the money just for that, so accessing music and photos along with all of the other extras is a bonus. I would thoroughly recommend it.",

My only gripe is there's no HDMI cable and the product description doesn't warn you either, so had to go and buy a cable. Not a biggie but would have been nice if Amazon made this clear so I could have ordered it at the same time.",

We live in a poor broadband area so streaming can sometimes be a challenge. If I could download - even for a 30 day period - then this would be 5 stars",
