And while it corrects itself, when reclosing the zipper, it happens again, without warning or cause: thus, not reliable. Called Samsonite customer service, explained situation, and told that I must ship it to one of their repair centers, to distant states, which is not only very burdensome, but costly, particularly in view of a replacement of only $80 or so!

It opens right down the middle so a) You have to be careful of things spilling out and b) It's difficult to prop open.

      "text": "I bought it mainly for the Samsonite name.....my old Sams piece that I am throwing away lasted 45 years. It's a little tough to rate new luggage........one hasn't used it yet, so it hasn't withstood any test of time. It looks great, but surface looks like it will scratch easily. But, that's OK, I didn't but it to put it in a beauty pageant, as the airlines will massacre almost any piece at their discretion. Med fits into the large for E Z storage. Locks are plastic. Zippers look sturdy. Has all the features that I wanted, I am not a frequent traveler, will only use it 3-4 times per year. Sooooo, check back with me in 4-5 years, LOL.",

      "text": "I bought this for my husband as a replacement to his very old soft side suitcase. I am very happy with the amount of space for the size of the suitcase. My husband didn't want to move up to a 27\" or 28\" suitcase, but he wanted to have enough room to pack for a week. This suitcase has tons of room on both sides when opened up! The finish on the outside is also very nice looking and will make the suitcase very easy to identify on the carousel even though it is the slate gray color.",

Also has the TSA lock of course that they can open so I can lock it to others. Also expandable with dual zippers. Will put some decals on it to help me quickly ID it at the luggage carousel.",

I almost cried when I turned it over baggage check, knowing it wouldn't be the same when I got it back. As expected, I came home with it scratched but that's not the company's fault. It's a beautiful blue color, very sturdy and has a cool lock. I couldn't recommend another suitcase higher than I would this one. Beautiful finish and extremely well-made.
