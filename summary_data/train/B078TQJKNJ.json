You have to get a good fit with the earbuds, as otherwise the speakers get wet and won\u2019t function until dry. The receiver being strapped to goggles works okay.

The feature of the device talking to you after pressing key buttons is wonderful. I suggest the manufacturer put some \"how to\" for care and maintenance. So as you may not know Bluetooth does not travel underwater, I've been keeping the strap/player high on the \"downward facing point of my head\", this helps to prevent the Bluetooth from cutting out and keeps the device out of the water. I did buy with extended warranty. I will update.",

Invest in an air compressor can to blow out USB port if you plan to connect to your computer shortly after swimming or otherwise submerging in water. Otherwise may not connect to computer.

I waited to write the review until i\u2019ve used it about 15 times and it still works good as new. It makes swimming laps much more entertaining, time goes by faster, and I get a better work out. Plus everyone at the pool is always asking me about them!! \ud83d\ude0a",
