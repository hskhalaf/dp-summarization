      "text": "Its a good headphone for the price except couple of drawbacks Corns: - Not really comfortable to wear for long time. I initially thought I need to get used to it. But even after one week it stand the same. I have a Sennheiser PMX 686G, that fits correctly in my ear but not this one as its not fit in my right ear and loosens out after some time. - Its picking lot of background noice while calling and the caller on the other side can hardly hear when we are on public. These are the reason to return this item Pros: - Good Sound quality - Battery Backup is good - Good build quality",

They sound quality is not out of the world, but as good as it can be for the price. The touch controls are pretty sensitive but you just need to get used to them. I'm not sure how long exactly the battery lasts but I do not to have to charge them too often so it is good. Overall I am extremely happy with the purchase and would recommend these as a great workout headphones.",

They're waterproof, which is essential for sports headphones, but the sound doesn't get too loud because of this. Might be good to not damage your audition though. The only negative IMO are the finnicky touch controls. All in all I would give them 4.5/5.",

      "text": "I've had a few bluetooth in-ear earphones in the past. What is great about these is that the two earplugs (while being somewhat larger) are really everything there is to these, so the cable can move around freely. This makes them very well suited for sports that involve a good deal of movement, say running. Unfortunately, I had high hopes that a JBL product (which is significantly pricier than its competitors) would be more durable. That's not the case. I've been very careful with these, but after just a few months (and usage only during workouts), the left earplug has ceased to work. Not good enough!",
