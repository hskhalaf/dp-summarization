I like my bass controls within reach so I kept my amp's subwoofer controls near the driver & just fine tuned the radio & amp's subwoofer frequency to it Great buy & did I mention it came fast in delivery & was adequately packed.",

Installed this in a 2015 Honda Civic using the high level inputs but only had the chance to test out the sub channel, but nonetheless brought a smile to my face. Will update when I get the rest installed EDIT: 2/8/2017 - I finally ordered some midbass speakers so I can use the front & rear channels on the EQ. Loud and clear! I had to turn my amp up due to the speakers but not by much! Heard my car clear across a parking lot. Will update again after I set the gains on my amp properly.",
