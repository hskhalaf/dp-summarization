However, what bothers me the most about this product is the constant barrage of emails from the seller, asking me for reviews. I initially wasn't going to leave a bad review, and just quietly return the faulty product. But they just kept messaging me over and over again even after I asked them to stop.So here it is: The strainer doesn't work and the seller is annoying and harasses the customer. Maybe now they'll stop sending me emails.",

It's silicone, so I'm not sure how long it will hold up, but for now we're very happy with it. So much easier than pulling out the big strainer and it fits in the dishwasher a lot easier. Fits more of our pots.",

This clips on with very tight clips so you won't have to worry about it coming off. The slots or narrow so you don't have to worry about the pasta slipping through. It can be thrown in the dishwasher or quickly washed by hand. It's silicone and stands up to the heat well. Would buy again.",
