I had no problems with it draining too quickly probably because I had a lot of grounds in the filter. I did preheat both the tumbler and the ceramic cone with warm tap water prior to using.

It's a very affordable brewing system and doesn't create the waste that the coffee-cup machines generate. I upgraded and got the porcelain, which I really like.

It does have the small, single hole at the bottom, which is what I was looking for to replace an old Melitta plastic cone. Prefer the Hario for slower \"pour over\" brews with a gooseneck kettle, but I can see the utility of this Melitta as well.",

Coffee is weak unless I put in 2-3x the recommended amount of coffee per cup, which gets very expensive very quickly. - There is no \"window\" on the bottom/foot of the cone where it sits over the mug. So if I'm using this over a mug, I cannot see when my mug is full. TL;DR - my hunt for an upgraded pour over cone continues. Save yourself the time & money and look elsewhere!",

It is quite a bit larger than I thought it would be, but that is no problem for me - the bottom ring fits nicely into the inside rim of all of my coffee mugs, so it feels very secure on top of my mug when i do my pour over (use it at least once/day).

      "text": "Works great for one or two cups of coffee. I loved the plastic mellitta brewer for one cup, but thought porcelain would be better than plastic. It takes a number 4 filter, but still fits nicely over most coffeee cups. Just bought the mellita cone and pitcher combo and that cone, though bigger does not fit on my cup since that cone actually has a smaller diameter base. Therefore, this cone is nicer since it is bigger in diameter and fits on the cup.",

It is somewhat old fashion, but there is nothing to fail in a manual brew. I do miss the convenience of push a button and walk away, but I am used to it now and love the consistently of a Great Melita brewed cup of coffee. And, you get to use your own coffee!!!",
