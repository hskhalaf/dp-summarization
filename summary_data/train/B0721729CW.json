I woke up every morning covered in gold sparkles. The pattern has completely faded to the point that the sheets just look pale pink. Do not buy this unless you intend to just look at it and not use it. Otherwise, enjoy being covered in gold sparkles and enjoy your new, faded, pale pink sheets! 0/5",

The only defect I've noticed is that on one of the small decorative pillows there's a tiny spot on the corner of the pillow. Hopefully I'll be able to remove it easily. But other than that, I absolutely love it. Its pretty, soft, light weight, and looks just like the product picture shown.
