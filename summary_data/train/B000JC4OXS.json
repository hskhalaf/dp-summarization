I made myself do it for 5 minutes every day to start out with and gradually increased 1 minute per week. I love it and it makes my legs feel like jello by the time I\u2019m done. It folds up and stores perfectly if needed but because I use it every day we don\u2019t store it. I\u2019ve had it for just 4 months now, and it\u2019s very affordable, I would pay way more for a gym membership for 4 months and wouldn\u2019t use it as often or conveniently! Highly recommend!",

This machine is as close as that gets with the parameters outlined.

My only complaint is that the steps are on an incline, unlike gym steppers, so sometimes when i finish my workout my feet hurt in odd places. Besides this, it was well worth $120. That's about 2 months of a gym membership, so if it lasts longer than that, it will turn out to be a great value.",

      "text": "The stepper worked well for the first week. Unfortunately, the right piston broke after the first week. Other reviewers described this problem. I only needed the exercise equipment for a few months so for $100 it was worth the gamble. I am still using it, but now it is clumsy and awkward. If you need a temporary exerciser and will not be upset if it breaks, this stepper is a fair deal. Before the stepper broke, it was a good piece of equipment",

At this price - aggressive use could be a good deal, but I would suspect replacement would be required at some point. Amazon responded and shipped - excellent as expected.",

And of course leaving it up is a constant reminder to use it, which after all, is the reason for having it. I would definitely recommend this stepper to anyone.",
