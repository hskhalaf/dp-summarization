      "text": "So I got my 55-Inch Veranda TV just last week and was able to install it on Saturday easily. Hooking up both cable and Roku were simple. We just finished a complete overhaul of our backyard \u2013 new covered patio and pavers, and the TV was the final touch. We had friends over to watch the Stanley Cup finals and then the NBA finals the next day, and the picture was great. Everyone around the backyard could clearly see the action and hear the games. My daughters are already setting up movie nights with their friends. I would recommend this TV to anyone trying to create an entertainment area in their backyard.",

Sound isnt perfect (to be expected) so add a good sound bar and you are good to go.",

A bit pricey but hopefully worth it as our last tv got hit by the smallest amount of water on the screen and stopped working properly.",

The TV arrived several days early (very nice). The wall mount Amazon recommend for the TV was easy to assemble and attach to the TV. Set up was pretty simple. We have an antenna and a Roku running on it and the picture looks great. Like other reviewers I agree the sound could be better but I\u2019m planning on running a jawbone speaker through it. I can\u2019t wait for football; this is where I\u2019ll be living all football season.",
