He appears totally comfortable and secure. Also this seat is really easy to move from room to room with me as we keep my 3 year old entertained all day :)",

We secure it safely in a bedside bassinet so it doesn\u2019t move and there\u2019s no fall or tumbling risk. It\u2019s nice because it keeps him elevated slightly after eating and also cradles him. My son also had to have surgery and it was perfect for post-op because he needed to keep his head elevated to help with swelling. Family members bought us this as a gift and we\u2019ve already gifted one to someone else. This definitely goes in our Top 5 must have items for a new baby!",

On the bed, couch, floor. Brought on trips. Easy to clean slip cover. Just absolutely excellent. I've now gifted this lounger to 3 new mom's and they all RAVE about it. Unlike everything else that they grow out of in the snap of a finger, THIS is the must-have item.",

Once baby is done with it my cat will happily keep it. The cover easily comes off. My only suggestion would be that they make a waterproof liner option like the boppy has to put between pillow and cover bc my baby is a puker!",

One thing I don't like about the Podster is the fact that the sling seat is super thin, stretchy fabric without any cushion, which means you can't really set your baby in the Podster on top of a hard surface like a table. My 3 week old prefers the Boppy- not sure why, but he does. The Boppy is a little bit cheaper, so we ended up returning the Podster.",

He unfortunately refuses to sleep on flat mattresses (crib or bassinet) and would ONLY sleep in my arms, on my chest, or in his swing. None of those things are ideal (or very safe) when you are dealing with a nursing newborn and a VERY sleep deprived momma. Little guy had previously been waking up every 1-2 hours (I believe 3 hours was the longest stretch) to nurse or just to fuss. With this thing I actually got two 5-hour sleeps from him! *mind blown* Would highly recommend for new mommas who have fussy babies!",

I highly recommend this. We were using a boopy at first but there was no lower back support so we used pillows but it just wasn\u2019t safe. This has been the safest and most comfortable way to keep him propped after feedings. He loves it and so do we.",

Since my daughter always has to be swaddled to sleep this pillow is helpful because it makes then feel \"secure\" and not to free. She sleeps so soundly in this! The great part is that it can fit in a bassinet, we have it in our Halo. Would highly recommend this item to parents!",

Perfect cushion around her so she can't roll out and I feel comfortable setting her down to go make a bottle, clean etc",

It is heavy ( in a good way- can pick it up with one hand when empty ) and substantial, and can be used until they start to roll over and become mobile. Much more stable than the Boppy -- can park the baby on a couch or bed, ( while watching her ) - and it feels safer than an infant seat or other cushions. Cover washes easily and looks new. It has a solid feel- so even with dogs and other kids around- doesn't give the feeling a bounce on the couch would shake the baby.",

It's also great to take to friends' houses, because it's light weight and very portable. When my son started spending more time awake, he no longer enjoyed the pod. I think it's because he can't really move in it and feels confined. It was well worth it, though, for the first month of his life.",
