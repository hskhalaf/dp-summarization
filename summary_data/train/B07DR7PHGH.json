Solid solid paddle very pleased with this. I wouldn't ride giants with it but I was tearing up 4 - 5 footers all day with it.",

    "rating": 4.5,
    "feature_bullets": [
      "The Own the Wave 3-Piece Adjustable Alloy SUP Paddle delivers a strong aluminum shaft, a durable nylon composite blade, and a super comfortable ergonomically designed handle. It is super light (2.1 lbs.) and is built to deliver years of fun; plus, you have the option to choose the blade's accent color. All of that at a brilliant price!",
      "This paddle easily adjusts by popping out the paddle clip and the height range is simply huge: around 66 to 83 inches (1676 - 2108 mm) - to suit almost all paddlers. Aside from being light and durable, it can adjust more than most other paddles. The lightweight really reduces paddler fatigue and makes it easy for virtually anyone to use - important when being used by children or lighter adults (in which paddle weight really matters).",
      "It takes just seconds to assemble or break down (with the longest side being around 900 mm / 35.43 Inches ) for more convenient storage/transport - excellent for going in the back of vehicles. Every buyer will be emailed a photographic e-guide, written by an experienced paddle boarder to introduce you more to this product. It is guaranteed to float in both salt and fresh water when the parts are together - we always recommend buying a paddle that floats. Two-piece version also available.",

All Own the Wave products are 100% guaranteed -- if it doesn't deliver what it is supposed to at any time within 12 MONTHS of purchase, it will be replaced or you'll be refunded -- your choice!",
