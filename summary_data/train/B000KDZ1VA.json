No glass or plastic to break. I will probably have this for years to come.",

It is very, very sturdy and feels well made. It comes with two needles, one for granular, the other for liquid. I have used jot twice and it is a pleasure to use. Cleanup is easy as well - just draw soapy water in, squirt it out, then run through the dishwasher. Great product.",

It handled the big job perfectly. as I had to inject a lot of marinade into all of the pork and it weighed about 70 lbs. This stainless steel heavy duty injector did the job without any problems. I recomend anyone who needs to do a big job like this or even a large turkey or big piece of meat this is the one for them. Very happy with this injector. Julie Esquivel",

Shipping was very speedy and made it for use on the day. Parts are detachable into 3 pieces to wash so cleaning is very easy. Also it's easy to put it together again. Although you have to squeeze tight to put it together, otherwise it doesn't go air tight and it's not going to suck the juice in proper way. Once it is air tight, it works very well and can inject yummy juices back to the turkey. This product is not so cheap but it absolutely worked great.",
