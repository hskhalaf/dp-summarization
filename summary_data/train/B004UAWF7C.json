      "text": "I bought this on March 2015 for my wife. She loves plain shaved ice and this provides a nice \"snowy\" texture that is far better than the ice crushing feature on the fridge. We've been using it 1-2 times each day for 2 years and it's still running great. Lately the ice is slower to come out, so I'll be buying a new replacement blade from their website. Can't recommend this little guy enough. As for noise, yeah...it's about as loud as a normal blender crushing ice. You'll need to talk loudly to anyone nearby so they can hear. But for thirty bucks? Awesome deal.",

Once herdened, they are shaved like usual ice and the kids adore them!)",

You don't really have to clean it, since you are just putting ice in it. The unused ice will melt and drip out, so I highly discourage people from putting anything but cubed water in this. I can really see how juice could guck it up. I have had it about two months now and I have had no problems. I really look forward to making some icy treats over the summer.",

Simply remove the lid and place ice into the hopper. Then, replace and turn the lid to engage the motor.

This attractively designed snow cone machine makes it a great looking kitchen countertop appliance. However, because of the machine's design, it can be quickly disassembled for easy storage in a cabinet or pantry. The S700 machine plugs directly into a household electric outlet (120V) and features an adjustable stainless-steel blade.
