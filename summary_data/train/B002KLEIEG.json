They don't like *us* better, but at least they're enjoying their food more.",

They are in perfect health, so it is not a soft beak issue. If i could make a suggestion to the zupreem family is maybe make a softer or smaller pellet for these little guys.",

At the same time, parakeets still throw this stuff around just as they do with seed, so the cage bottom becomes multi-colored, and since we still use seed as well, we see the brown seeds but mixed with the multi-colored nuggets on the floor of the cage.",
