      "text": "This is a decent appliance. Does really well with boiled eggs. I was disappointed with it\u2019s poaching abilities. Tried adjusting the water quantity to control how runny the egg was but it always came out too runny. The poached egg container is too narrow which might possibly cause this. Finally, it has a really loud whistle when the eggs are done . I am not sure why they couldn\u2019t come up with a more graceful sound rather than a loud whistle that scares kids and sounds more like an alarm. I am sure there are better egg cookers out there. I wouldn\u2019t buy it if I could redo my purchase.",

In order to get the whites cooked well enough, the yolks end up solid too. The plastic doesn\u2019t allow the white part in contact to cook that great. Of course, maybe I\u2019m wrong and poached ends have a slightly runny white part. Hard boiling eggs was a breeze. Haven\u2019t used the omelet part. The water measuring is pretty close to cooking the eggs right on. I usually add a little bit more so the auto shut off cooks them a little longer.",

It took a little time to figure out exactly how much water to put in it for that perfect egg. I finally got it. For me, it was a little above the poached line. I marked it with a sharpie for future use. I use this every single day. It's easy to clean and small enough to leave on the counter next to the coffee maker. I can't think of a single con. I've been using it for a month now.",

We happen to have a chicken coop and our hens are mostly laying enormous eggs, double yolks etc. which are much larger than Grade A. We've found that we can't load a full rack of six of our hen's eggs into the machine as the dome is too small. Shouldn't be an issue for most folks that get their eggs from the grocery store. Please keep this issue in mind if you plan to cook colossal home-grown eggs in this cooker!",
