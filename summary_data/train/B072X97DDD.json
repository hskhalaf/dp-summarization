I recently had to open up and solder some cables back together and this provided everything I needed. This is a beginner quality kit but that doesn't mean it won't get the job done. The case is so cute too.. Yeah, I said it. Cute. It looks like it a giant tool box, but miniature. My gf said it was \"cute\", then I fixed a pair of her headphones, and then she called me her HERO. This kit will help you go from \"geek\" to \"HERO\".",

The tools & extras turn out to be much more useful than expected, and I love that it's all folded into a convenient little box. While everything was sturdy and effective, the aesthetic quality did seem minimal; has a plasticy feel to it. I also felt the selection of tips could have included more options for smaller arduino-type projects. A sharp, tiny chisel tip would have been spectacular.",

Everything is made of horribly brittle plastic. The tip of the iron lasted for about 30-50 solder joints before it corroded to the point of being unusable. I realize this is a cheap kit and you get what you pay for to a certain extent but this product is a waste of everyone\u2019s time both manufacturer and customer alike.",

I suggest practicing with the soldering iron on junk boards to get the temp right before moving on to the actual workpiece. Lots of tools to choose from while working. Replaced 4 pots on a bad power supply the first day saving me $100. So far I'm really happy with this purchase. Thank you Volador.",
