They are so cute and well crafted, although a bit on the pricey side, but the quality is wonderful in my opinion. I'm actually a toy collector (no judgments lol :) ) and I have wanted one of these Calico Critters sets ever since I was a little girl. I'm very impressed with this purchase.

If it bothers anyone, the grandparents are slightly smaller than the standard 'adult' size critters...but still taller than the kids.",

      "text": "Bought these to go with the Calico Critters school bus. The glasses on these critters are made from 2 pieces of delicate plastic which come unhooked much too easily. I tried to jerry rig the glasses around their heads with rubber bands but that didn't last long before coming apart. Even if the glasses are attached properly by the plastic hook they do not fit snugly on the face and move upward. Overall the quality of both the school bus and critters seems cheap.

Super impressed with the quality of them from their bodies to their clothes! The nursery and bus we got are quite cheaper in how they go together.
