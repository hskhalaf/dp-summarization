The tines on this comb were a bit too sharp and thin, and would actually bend and break off while I combed, scratching the poor critters. They would cringe or just run & hide when they saw me reach for it. I finally tossed it and bought one with shorter tines and more rounded tips. The pets seem pleasantly surprised. If you're a vigorous comber, watch out.",
