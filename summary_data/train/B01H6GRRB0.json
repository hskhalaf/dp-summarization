But you won't find another board that looks as good as this one. It is Sexy. FYI you can leave the marker tray off (I think it looks better) & hang it vertically.",

We are going to order more so, I would certainly order this product again and I would certainly recommend this item. Great product, very easy for me to mount this but, I am a contractor and I know it may be beyond other's skills set but, it was very easy for me. It is magnetic, erases well and is a great size.

Normal magnets don't work, I had to buy special rare earth magnets which hold fine, not the best. Only looks good with black markers.",
