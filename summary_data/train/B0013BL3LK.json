      "text": "Gave this as a gift to a 9 yr old and loved it! In this generation when all they play is the ipad, it's refreshing to see kids tinkering and figuring out stuff like this circuitry set. My 6 yr old has the jr set and loves it. Upgraded hers from sc 100 to 300. But when we saw this set, it doesn't have the same parts and projects as hers. This ones has a compass, magnet and magnetic powder to name a few. She loves playing with her jr snapcircuits so this particular set is also going on her wishlist! It's a great gift and toy!",

I like that the instructions are user friendly (even for a layman like me) and it is set up to explain in different methods (ie: written instructions, step-by-step, a diagram), so many different learning types would benefit from this set. Great purchase.",

Also I love that you can buy more kits and put them together if you want. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the button style connections system is a little too tight IMO and kids have a hard time snapping them and can even end up breaking the plastic surface it all mounts on, otherwise, still a great toy/educational/learning tool.",

This is a great teaching instrument but it will take real motivation on the part of the child to spend the time to go through all the demonstrations and begin to understand basic electronics. I think it is a great device and has real learning potential especially compared to all the other toys etc available for children.",

You do have to be careful to not lose the many pieces in the set or you may find yourself unable to complete one of the projects.
