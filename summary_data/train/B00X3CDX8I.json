Amazon failed to support any refund / replacement and pass the buck back to Linksys to resolve. not really customer centric as suggested!",

I had no problem with this as I already had a previous, older, Linksys route, and connect to the internet via a Virgin Hub. I just use the Linksys router for its wi-fi reach. Which is excellent. I had problems with the old wi-fi router as it did not have 5G, and did not have 'one-touch' button connection for accessories like printers. Set up was quite straight forward, if taking a little time. Very pleased with the unit",

I am sadly still on regular broadband and so cannot make any use of this router, and can only suggest that you make sure it will suit your system before purchasing.
