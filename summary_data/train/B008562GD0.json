      "text": "Ade Advanced Optics Brix Refractometer RF15. I have used this oftem for the last year. I test various fruits and veg for their BRIX. I believe that the higher BRIX food is healthier, and gives you more nutrition for the dollar. Most used for measuring wines, I use it on all my fresh foods. Test my own garden food to see if the soil is good or poor. It's easy to use, and a great tool for anyone health-conscious, or just making some homemade wine!",

Instead, it came with a soft case that does fit all of the additional components nicely. It would appear that the instructions were originally written in another language and then translated into English, making them a little hard to figure out at first. While I did not get the chance to test the unit out with a known standard yet, I was able to easily calibrate it with distilled water using the screw at the top of the instrument. I look forward to being able to use this on an upcoming batch of wine must.",

Yes, a hard case. So, either they have gone back to including a hard case because of the complaints, or it is just sometimes included depending on what they happen to have. I calibrated it easily and tested it out on some Vernor's ginger ale. Worked great and it is easy to read as well. Looking forward to using it on my next brew day to check out the SG of wort as it comes out of the mash tun. With this, I'll be prepared to do a patrigyle brewday sometime soon.",

Mine came in a loose cheaply made zipper bag not too different from your typical kids pencil case. Not particularly thrilled about that.

      "text": "If you are an all grain home brewer or of you make your own mead, wine or hard cider then this is a tool that you should have. Ignore the bad ratings for people who didn't know this is a Brix only refractometer. There are plenty of brewing calculators (all decent brewing software packages have them) available for Windows/Mac/Linux/iPhone/iPad/iPod/Android that will quickly convert Brix to SG. Using this refractometer is a simple way to check your running and avoid over sparging. This is of course only accurate BEFORE fermentation. Alcohol will skew the reading. While there are calculators to compensate for it after fermentation a hydrometer is the best tool for that job.",

I ordered it knowing it only had the BRIX scale, for a future model, it would be nice if they added a SG scale on one side. Great product.",
