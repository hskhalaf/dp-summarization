One nice thing is that Delta ships ALL the parts you'll need for installation, so that you don't have to visit the hardware store for missing ansillary parts. As this is an exterior faucet get back to me inext year for a performance evaluation as its only been inplace for a couple of week. Up to now very pleased",

This is a bucket filling, washing station in our floral shop. This will be the fourth Faucet in 15 years. Big mistake was we kept same brand for replacement each time expecting different results. This is much heavier built and is a commerical quality!!!!",
