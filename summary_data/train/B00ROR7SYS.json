We rented a condo for several months and the furniture they had in it didn't include any way to put your feet up and relax so we ordered these. They were exactly what we needed to make our stay more comfortable. They were so much better than what we expected for the price we paid for them. At the end of our stay, we folded them up and put them in storage for next year when we will need them again. So glad we had them.",

You can also use this unit as a spare place to sit. I'd recommend sitting gently though. The cube is easy to put together too. Recommend.",

Now we use it as a foot rest near the couch in the living room and keep our dog's clothes in it.",

Only downside is that it is difficult to pick up and move since there are creases built into 2 of the sides that allow it to fold up. This makes it hard to get a grip since they naturally want to fold in on you when picking up. Not a deal breaker though. Overall happy",

It's prettier than a traditional shoe rack because it hides the shoes, & it keeps our entryway looking neat. I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 because I think it could be made of stronger material. However, it's holding up so far. It could be used to store many other things, too, because it holds a lot. It would be pretty & functional in a living area as extra storage & seating, or with a tray as a coffee table, especially in a small space.",
