      "title": "Goodbye disposable razors",
      "text": "Prior to owning this razor, I would usually shave in the shower with cheap disposable razors without a mirror. It was just a chore to do, so there was little enjoyment to it and often led to nicks and minor breakouts. The Weishi safety razor is enjoyable to use as you easily, effortlessly, and painlessly cut away stubble and longer facial hair. I don't blame Mr. Gillette for inventing his disposable razor, but I no longer need to buy them anymore. If you're timid about using the Weishi safety razor, watch some youtube videos and you'll see it's not that complicated. Don't expect perfection your first time, though.",

I've had 0 razor burn and a much closer shave since using this product. My wallet also appreciates how affordable blades are now!",

The only drawback is the knob at the end of the handle which is used to release the blade; it turns often during normal use. I have to regularly stop mid shave to tighten it.

That's good, I guess, but I am a little disappointed. For real, it gives a smooth shave, but I find that I need to shave slightly more frequently than before to keep up with it.

You need to adjust the cutting angle a bit, compared to any of the multi-blade razors on the market, but it's not a steep learning curve. The butterfly design allows you to change out the blade at ease and secures it without any risk of accidents. My only minor gripe is that I notice a bit of rust/patina(?) on the razor after a little bit. It rubs off with a little effort but I think this is more of an issue with my home's 'hard water' and not a defect with the razor itself (I hope).",
