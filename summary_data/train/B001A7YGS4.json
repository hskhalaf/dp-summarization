But recently I\u2019ve noticed that the XFusion I\u2019ve purchased in the later part of 2017 to early 2018 doesn\u2019t have the same quality as the regular XFusion. It feels just like Topik...perhaps because XFusion is owned by Topik now? Whatever the reason it\u2019s not the same product I\u2019ve used and loved for years. It\u2019s Topik quality powder at a higher price than Topik",

I spray a light holding hairspray on the spot/area I want to cover and then (with the pump) apply the fibers. If you are at all self-conscious about your thinnning spots, this is the product for you. I'm serious. This is an amazing product for those of us with thinning hair as we age (or at any age with fine/thin hair).",

My hair is long and wavy and lifts up away from my scalp, so the thinning underneath is apparent. I don't want the XFusion directly on my hair, since the texture is dead matte, like talcum powder. So I part my hair and put the fibers on my scalp, and I have enough hair to cover. It blocks light from reflecting off my scalp, which is what I wanted. I don't think this would work well on bare skin patches unless you have super short hair and a way to get the fibers to stick.",

It more or less just sits on the scalp. I don't think it looks that natural either. If you sweat at all, it will clump up and become noticeable. Also, when applying it clogs up the holes in bottle, even when i tapped it sideways slightly with my finger. I never had this issue with Caboki.",

So, in lieu of some freaky hair transplant, I use hair fibers in my daily routine. It is not at all messy and not only does this stuff easily cover the spots where my scalp is visible (I'm very pale with very dark hair - bad combination), it also does a fantastic job of giving some additional body to my hair. One bottle of this lasts a good 3+ months, and it only adds on like, 45 seconds to my routine each morning. I highly recommend this stuff.",
