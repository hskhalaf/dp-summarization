It is key to spray and let clothes dry at least overnight, better yet 24-48 hours (smells like gasoline) but the smell does amazingly vanish and is not an issue after drying.",

Permethrin on your hiking gear, combined with DEET on your clothes, is the BEST solution for warding off ticks, plus mosquitoes, other bugs, etc. One caution. CAREFULLY follow the directions. Apply it in a well ventilated space, like a garage with the door open. Allow your clothes to dry completely before you put them on. NEVER put permethrin in liquid form on your skin. But, after it dries completely it is harmless to humans and deadly to ticks.",

      "text": "I treated a work shirt, pair of jeans and socks before I started clearing some land. Product worked well, no ticks in a location where I had gotten them before. But when I need to re-apply after 6 weeks, the sprayer broke after just a few sprays. Sawyer calls this a \"premium\" product and it has a \"premium\" price. Wish they'd spent a few more cents and got a quality spray bottle. I'm not really comfortable pouring pesticide into another container, so I guess I lost the rest of the bottle.",
