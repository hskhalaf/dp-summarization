The hard rubber (or maybe its plastic) does its job and it does break or crack. Be sure to check the thresholds in your doorways and the amount of space between your door and it. Do a 'test run' by taping this unit to your door and open and close your door. This will give you an indication of whether you will need to adjust it (higher or lower) to your taste and/or liking. You might need to cut this unit to size as well using a sharp knife, saw, etc.",

Additional weatherstripping is needed in corners of old door to help, but this effectively stopped all the air blowing under the door. I installed with just a small amount of \"flex\" or interference to allow the door to close without too much more force. Build quality is good, came with matched screws to install. I cut metal with a hacksaw to fit door, and poked holes (with drill) through rubber for screws before installing.",

It does the job, looks seamless, and I doubt anyone will even realize something is different about the door.",
