Skates were delivered on time, were as advertised and a fair price considering the quality of the skate. So...it's a win/win",

My two daughters 12, 10 who aren't great skaters yet, but have been a few times are doing great in these. Very glad we didn't settle for the 'beginner' ones. They also like them much better than the inline skates we tried. Much more stable and fun for inside.",
