      "text": "Good for when you want more than just quick snapshots. It takes a few seconds to start up and sync with your phone, so it works best when you are intending to take photos. The smaller lens (this one) is perfect for wide shots and vistas. Photos save both on your phone and to a micro sd card. The images on the card are much larger files, so you can really blow them up. YOU DO NOT NEED WIFI TO USE THIS! It communicates with your phone on its own network, so you can be in the middle of nowhere, and it'll still work. Works best in fair-strong lighting situations.",

It is also nice for group pics to mount it and see our picture and fire from the phone instead of running back and forth.

So every so often right in the middle of shooting it will freeze and you have to turn it off, close the app, and start again. This can take a few minutes of your time to do. My other complaint is that in program mode you don't have enough control. I realize that this is really just a point-and-shoot, but at least a little more control would go a long way.

Where PDF was supplied, it was formatted for a large display, totally unsatisfactory for copying to my smart-phone for travel. WAKE UP, SONY - think \"usability\"!",

Don't try or you will miss lots of shots and be frustrated. However, it works well for stills and portraits. The ability to remove the lens from the phone allows for some interesting perspectives. Zoom quality over the regular iPhone camera is excellent. App for iOS7 is very poor and would only give it 2 stars. Does still freeze sometimes.",
