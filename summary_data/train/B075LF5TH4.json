In the pictures it looks big and puffy like coats I've gotten from Mountain Hardware and North Face in the past. My recommendation would be to buy those brands because I don't know where the 700 fill went, but it appears to have not gone in the jacket.",

The pockets and hood are lined with down making them very warm. I don't even need to have a hat because the hood is that warm. I still don't like winter in Chicago but this coat will help a lot!!",

That is easily corrected by fluffing on low temp in the dryer with tennis balls or dryer balls. I washed my jacket right away with Nikwax Down Direct followed by Nikwax Down Proof (fantastic products). I called Marmot and they recommended these products. Once done, I couldn\u2019t believe how the jacket puffed up and is super rain repellent. Highly recommend this jacket and Nikwax product line (sold here on amazon as well).",

Love the lined pockets and that the draw cords are stowed in the pockets instead of dangling around elsewhere. Two way zipper is fab. No complaints, super happy to be so warm on cold days.",

This lightweight winter coat and its attached hood are both insulated with 700 fill power down and protected with Down Defender\u2014a moisture-resistant treatment that keeps the jacket's insulation from clumping and losing its loft when exposed to wet environments, thus increasing its ability to keep you warm when the weather takes a turn for the worse. Additionally, the Guides Hoody features zippered interior and chest pockets for storing small items, zippered handwarmer pockets for thawing cold fingers, adjustable Velcro cuffs and drawcord hem for superior fit and temperature regulation, and Marmot's Angel-Wing Movement for full range of motion.",
