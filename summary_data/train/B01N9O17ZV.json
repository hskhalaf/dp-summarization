They took a little getting used to because I've only ever been on small wheels and it's been a few years since even that, but they go over sidewalk cracks and small debris really smooth and that's exactly what I wanted out of them! AND they're shiny, which pleases my simple lizard brain. Fit is alright if you size up but the lining isn't the most comfortable. I got a nasty rub burn over my right ankle and will be using sport wrap to cut down on the friction until I can replace it.",

They are pretty fast especially after you replace the original bearings and they definitely roll over just about anything .For under 200 dollars I think this a good triskates I think it could do with a wheel/ bearing upgrade . All in all a great skate for what you would pay for some frames by themselves .also the wheels are not reveted THEY ARE REMOVABLE the Allen head is recessed I know because I have removed them often",
