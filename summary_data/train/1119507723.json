I bought it a couple of months ago but didn't get the chance to read them/use the online access until now that the semester is over. First, I absolutely love the books! Everything is easy to find and well organized. Second, I am in love with the online questions because I get to choose how I will take the questions, how many, the difficulty of the questions, and make notes on each questions and review everything at the end. It's really fun and I feel that this will help me get a good score on the GMAT (fingers crossed!)",

Is there anything that can be done to help this situation? Thanks!",
