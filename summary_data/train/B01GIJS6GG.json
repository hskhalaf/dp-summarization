Still, the majority of the testers believed that it\u2019s a solid option for those with overpronated foot motion.",

The Hurricane ISO 3 features ISOFIT that helps lock the foot down, while increased cushioning and lasting stability benefit your long run. All that's left are the miles and an EVERUN continuous cushioning delivering more energy return to get you through more of them. Saucony Hurricane Iso 3 Running Shoes Breathable Upper The Saucony Hurricane Iso 3 running shoe has fantastic breathability due to the upper. Breathing is good whether your a human or a piece of running gear. The materials in this product are designed to move moisture away from the skin, to keep you running dry and comfortable. Equipped with ISOFIT which is an ultra-soft inner sleeve crafted out of stretchable air mesh and morphs to the foot for a sock-like feel. The floating support cage cradles the foot to give maximum support. Everun Midsole Featuring EVERUN construction where the topsole layer positions Saucony's best cushioning material closer to the foot, combining smoother landings in the heel with reduced pressure in the forefoot. It produces a dramatically, livelier and more responsive feel with 83% energy return and it maintains it's properties 3x longer than standard EVAs. The Hurricane Iso 2 provides plush cushioning which provides the up most comfort to the wear. The underfoot feel and amount of impact protection provided by the compressing materials between the foot and running surface. Stability support is given to the Saucony Hurricane as it is engineered for moderate pronation. Pronation is the inward rolling of the ankle through the gait cycle. Equipped with an 8mm offset which is the difference in height between the heel thickness and forefoot thickness of the shoe. The cushioning is distributed more evenly between the heel and the forefoot in shoes with an 8mm offset. Your body stays in a more balanced and comfortable position with every foot strike.
