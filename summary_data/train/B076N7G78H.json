However, wearers settling for simply its good looks would miss out on its exuberant comfort, outstanding waterproofing, and excellent durability.\u00a0With all that said, its subpar midsole is just one of its cons which drove it away from perfection. To sum up, if taken for the things it so lavishly offers, the Adidas Terrex Swift R2 GTX can be considered as one of the reliable hiking shoes for tackling challenging trails.",

I'm still really not sure if I like pull- chord laces to be honest but I have no complaints about the performance of these shoes. Upate 7 months later: Still tough and waterproof. However, I find I can't get on with these. The heel rises and falls even when the questionable quick laces are pulled tight. I also find them a little tight in the toe box. While I don't hate these, I think I'll have to try something else. Looking at Salomons.",

I've marked them down as they are very rigid with limited give. The inner sole has no cushion so after several long days of walking they feel a chore to wear. Hopefully they are just taking longer to break in. Update: took longer than expected but they've been broken in and are quite comfortable now. Rating increased to 5 stars.",
