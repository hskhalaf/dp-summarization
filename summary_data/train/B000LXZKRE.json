The quality of the Minolta's images, of course, are superior. In addition, whenever it's turned on you have to cancel that annoying set-date-and-time screen that pops up, every time, and before you can start using it. Lastly, ISO settings are non-existent, and for a 7.1 MP camera at that. In the end, I cannot recommend this product.",
