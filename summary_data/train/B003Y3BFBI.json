I like it and the only thing I would change is the bright light when you put the device on the dock; I have to cover it at night to block out the light. I wish they still made these (without standby feature) for new devices, because as far as I know they are now discontinued. The sound is good for being so small and it's light and portable.",

When a song played at a softer level (mostly instrumentally), you could barely hear any sound through the speakers at all. I wouldn't recommend this product. I had it for one day & knew this product did not perform up to it's advertised standards. I actually got it for under $60, which sounds like a good deal, but if it doesn't perform, it's no deal at any price.",

The sound isn't breathtaking, but it isn't a detracting feature (nor are there any detracting features of this product). I wanted to clarify a few things that I thought were nebulous before I purchased it: - The unit does have a bright LED that designates that it is on. However, the unit goes into standby mode automatically after 10 minutes (or 5 minutes on battery power) of no sound input into the speakers. - An iPhone 4 can connect to the dock, even with the Apple Bumper, as long as the removable support is not in place.",

They do sound nice and clear and any kind of light, mellow music that uses natural instruments like acoustic guitars will sound pretty great.
