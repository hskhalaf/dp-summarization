There is a plastic part (shown on manual) that regulates the auto-feed function of the trimmer. Thin, cheap plastic. So my trimmer is useless after one season. I implore you my fellow Amazon buyers, buy a different trimmer. BTW, my purchase was probably a year ago and I don't know if I'll still be a certified buyer but I did buy it from Amazon so please be assured this is an authentic and sincere review",

The one I just received is cheaply constructed with thin lightweight plastic used throughout. The black handle does not stay locked in place. The entire handle would bend where it connects to the orange shaft. Lucky I saved my old one in case I need repair parts. I didn't think I would need to be fixing it the first day I used it. The new unit is overall lighter than the old one, but I would prefer durability over weight loss. We'll see how long this one lasts.",

It was running perfectly, then I unplugged it from back yard outlet to move to front yard, and it just wouldn't start. Smells like motor burnt out. I was using it for maybe 10 minutes. Probably a motor made in China. So I guess that's the going rate of duration for yard trimming for a Black and Decker cheap motor. You get what you pay for.",

Being corded, it was much more powerfull than the Worx unit, but used more line in less than one year than in 5 years of useing the Worx. The whole issue with spitting out line is a serious design flaw. I couldn't even complete the edging, let alone the weed waking with a single full spool. Then 11 months after having it the motor has seized up. Going to go with another brand now.",

The line must have some inertia feed or something lots of stop and go uses up the line quickly. Also easy to replace spools. Just know the spools are tight and if you slip it instantly unravels. All in all very satisfied The price was very competitive with the box store",

Oh, the auto-feeder function was wonderful, with my old trimmer I would stop every 5 minutes to feed more line, never had to stop once, this trimmer fed the line out when needed, never noticed it slow down.

Highly recommend this trimmer the only downside is the trimmer line they supply isn't a full reel it will run out pretty quick. I would recommend getting the 3 pack of trimmer line with the trimmer so you ready when you have to replace it. If your concern with cost then buy the 3LB spool of trimmer line and wrap your own line on the spool.",
