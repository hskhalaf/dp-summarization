      "text": "My son loved this board, he has ridden it many times in the last few days and loved it. The board has very good float even in deep water. Good fishtails ,180s, 360s and sand skimming. Board has a good amount of control and my son is yet to get the wave riding down but other than that it is a great product. There were a few flaws on the board and traction. The deck grip is slightly crooked and they grinned too much fiberglass off the side and you can see the foam but it does not effect the board\u2019s preformance. Overall a great board. Would buy again.",

I love the artistic attention to detail, even of the stomp pad their is a detail of a fish that really made the design a peace of art. The preview pictures really don't do this board justice. Great to see some unique skim brands, would buy again.",

    "title": "Slapfish Skimboards - Fiberglass & Carbon - Riders up to 200 lbs - 48\" with Traction Deck Grip - Kids & Adults - 4 Colors",
    "description": "SIZE: 48\" for riders up to 200 lbs. The board length should reach the top of the riders rib cage (within 1-2 inches) for the right balance and center of gravity. PROFESSIONALLY INSTALLED TRACTION PAD: 3M guidelines specify that your pad should sit for 24 hours to allow the adhesive to release enough to truly stick for the long haul. That can be a long wait when you are ready to hit the beach. Let us handle that for you! Our pros will prep the surface, snap a chalk line dead center and place the pad for you. By the time it arrives you're good to go! TOP GRADE COMPSITES - American made Poly PVC core will never gas out or delaminate like an EPS (styrofoam) core. Interlocking fiberglass mat, plus nose and tail carbon fiber reinforcement, will fuse to that core with high quality ultra clear gloss resin, creating a seal with unmatched durability. Water tight and solidly sealed. STRONG AND LIGHT - Under 5 pounds this board is light to carry and light to glide across the water. The 21\" wide deck allows for an comfortable arm span. Together these set you up to focus on picking your wave, running and sliding with nothing to weigh you down. Fluid motion and smooth performance. TRIED AND TESTED - This board has been tried and tested in all conditions and as performed true to promise.OFFERINGS: First quality boards, and on occasion, factory blems. A blemished board has a minor cosmetic imperfection or has been used very lightly. Our standards are high so many of these are truly minor flaws.",

      "FEATURES: Polished deck, ultra-glide bottom. Perfect sweet spot for long rides and fast motion. The right amount of rocker to avoid getting caught in the lip of the wave, yet not slow you down. Slapfish traction is a closed cell, fully sealed EVA grip secured with 3M waterproof adhesive.",
      "DURABILITY: Handcrafted with precision. This Slapfish board is fiberglass. Carbon reinforced at the nose and tail. Double reinforced at the rails. The Poly PVC foam core is supremely light weight, structurally dense, impact/fracture rated beyond the board weight limit and is waterproof. This is NOT a EPS (styrofoam) core which will gas out and delaminate over time. No fear of delamination or separation \u2013 ever.",
      "PERFORMANCE: Sand sliding and wave riding from beginner to experienced. Consciously tapered for balance and support of varied stances. Unlimited skim potential! Light weight. Floaty enough to support a wide range of riders. Performs in all wave conditions from mush to surging swell. Long liners, smooth wave wraps, 360 spins and more.",
