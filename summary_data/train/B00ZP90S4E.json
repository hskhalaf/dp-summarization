To the point that we have unplugged it and disconnected the water supply to it. Now it is nothing more than something to plug the hole in our sink. Sure, I can remove it and probably return it, but why... only to do it all again a week or so after installing the replacement.",

Troubleshooting by a handy husband didn't work and the warranty is only 1 year. So, we purchased an entire second unit to replace the faucet as they don't sell it independently. 18 months later and the faucet is broken again in the same way, again out of their short warranty for a plumbing fixture that should definitely last longer than a year. I'm on the hunt for a different product, but insinkerator has a bit of a monopoly for instant hot water.",
