It is the Mumba case which I also love. Fits small accessories as well but nothing big such as a charger or the small controller thst came with the console. Otherwise all is great like others have said. Good quality, pretty tough shell and good storage like the others.",

Keep in mind that if you do use the grip, it raises the switch a bit in the carry case. so less room on the top mesh pocket for large accessories like the Hori stand. There is a chemical smell when you first get this case, so I recommend leaving it opened up overnight so the smell will dissipate.",

I'm very disappointed because I have several cellphone accessories like cases from Orzly that are great quality... but this case??? Not so much, I had to return it and try another one. Maybe I just got a lemon, but to us it was definitely not worth the $20 we paid for it.",

So far, he says everything is just fine, but he noticed right away that the inner elastic, net pouch is positioned so that it is facing DOWN when you are carrying the case by the handle. Anything placed in the net pouch will probably slide part-way out during use. However, my son (14) does not want to return the case, because he thinks he will only be carrying chrging cables in the inner pouch, and doesn't care if they slide around. Otherwise, no complaints.",
