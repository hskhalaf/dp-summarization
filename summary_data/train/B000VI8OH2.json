Mostly in the kids section. I had to check to be sure they were authentic. This may or may not be an authorized dealer but-business is business.",

      "text": "the design flaw is this: at the lace holes closest to the toes it is tight. the shoe needed to have more room for the foot to enter there. regardless of whether it is the right size for the foot, it needs more room at this point. it could be a cutting mistake. I don't think it is. Perhaps you could stretch this out if you wet it. my kid does not have much arch at all and foot isn't too large for the shoe.",

Bought for my daughter for xmas is says toddler/little kid/big kid so I thought she petite 6 is her size perfect! NOT the shoes fit me & I am am 8.5 now I can even get her size for the same price. Great quality though just need to work out the sizing issue",

Thought I found myself ahead of the game only to be set behind schedule. I swear, I took one look at them and didn't even bother having him try them on! DISAPPOINTED TO THE MAX! You can tell by the soles they weren't \"obviously previously\" worn, SO WTH HAPPENED???! I don't even know where to start. The pictures will have to speak for me. Needless to say, I'm a BROOKLYNITE.
