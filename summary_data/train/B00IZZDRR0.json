      "text": "I would love to give this a 5 star. The structure is well built and exactly what I needed for some of our buses but being in Las Vegas this product get tested to the extreme here. With summer temp on average 113F degrees and the anti-slip that's glued on top of the platform did not last especially when left inside the bus and temp shoots up 145F inside. The glue eventually melted off and lost its grip power so I improvised, removed the original anti-slip and installed 3M version from Home Depot. I also bolted the rubber pad on foot stand so it wont come off(lost one of 'em already)",

As its only drawback, when the legs are folded up for a shorter step, do not get too close to the edge. The product will tilt and may cause an ankle injury. We've used it several times so far this season and on at least 2 trips, I've come close to rolling my ankle because of this. Just pay attention to were you're stepping and you'll be fine.",
