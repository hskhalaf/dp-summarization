However, we have discovered, after he used the rails to help himself arise from his throne, that if you are NOT able to exert EQUAL pressure constantly on BOTH sides at the SAME time while PUSHING up (he has partial paralysis on left side) the support WILL TIP sideways. He took a bad tumble into the bathtub head first. This is a very $$$$ item and is unreturnable!!!! I can not recommend this product for anyone who may have weak sided issues.",

This sits EXACTLY smack in front of the toilet lever on my Kohler comfort height toilet. VERY DISAPPOINTED with product seeing it said it is for ALL toilets. If I would of known I would not have purchased this product! Can't flush toilet without moving the safety rail unit away from the toilet.",

Only concern with the product is it does wobble slightly. Must put equal amount of weight on handles when using. Like that it's not bolted to toilet so it's easy to move when cleaning bathroom.",

The absence of a cross bar going in front of the toilet has the advantage that there isn't something getting in the way of your feet when you're sitting on the toilet. During assembly, I had to use the lowest setting (for the legs) for my mother who is on the short side (4' 11\"). Overall, I'm quite satisfied with this product.",
