Easy to set up rode around for a couple of hours and no mechanical problems. Great bike in my opinion. Will update if anything changes",

He jumps it, does downhill, uphill, snow, mud etc. and has had zero problems. The gears shift smoothly and silently. The hydraulic brakes are extremely responsive and allow you to stop on a dime. The aluminum frame is sturdy and lightweight.",

The guys at our local bike shop were even impressed when building it and tuning it. Definitely recommend this bike for kids as they begin to get serious about mountain biking!",

    "title": "Diamondback Bicycles Line Hardtail Mountain Bike, 120mm Travel Bike Fork, 27.5-Inch Wheels",
    "description": "There was a time when every mountain bike was an all-around hardtail. The Line follows in that great tradition \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s some kind of crusty throwback. We\u2019ve equipped the Line with a cutting-edge 6061-T6 aluminum modern frame that\u2019s lightweight, yet stable under pressure making it the perfect mountain bike for when you\u2019re looking to boost a little air or hit that next corner a bit faster. The frame is also compatible with internally routed dropper posts, is custom-formed, and has butted tubing for added strength. The Shimano 1\u00d79 drivetrain lets you blaze through the gears with pinpoint precision every single time. And because we know hard-charging riders tend to gravitate to these progressive trail bikes, we\u2019ve also added a bit more security in the form of a chain guide with roller, a capable SR Sun tour XCR 120mm travel fork (with a lock-out for those big climbing days) and powerful Shimano MT200 hydraulic disc brakes to help bring you to a stop. Although, we imagine that stopping is probably going to be the last thing you want to do when you bring this bike up to speed. Climbs, descents, berms, a bit of jumping \u2014 the Line upholds the do-it-all hardtail tradition without being traditional at all. At Diamondback, we know that a \u201cepic ride\u201d isn\u2019t a destination, it\u2019s a state of mind. Turn onto the gravel road and explore bike trails that aren\u2019t on the app. Pack extra water and a snack in case you\u2019re having too much fun to head home. Make epic happen. Own your adventure.",
