After purchasing this, and for such a low price now, I think I should've invested in one of these sooner. Do yourself a favor and don't hesitate",

      "text": "I love this inductive charger! It looks good on the back of the desk, and works well with my macbook and dual monitors. It allows me to easily charge my wireless keyboard and remove it to place on my lap or edge of desk for typing. I don't have to mess with cables falling down in the back or being in the way on the desk. Seems to charge fast, and hold a charge really well. It's great to have the rechargeable battery instead of replacing batteries all of the time. The finish also matches the Apple product really well, so everything looks like it was made together.

I'd get a green light for charging for about 1-3 minutes and then it would go red. I contacted support via email and they asked for my mailing address to mail me a new battery pack but instead I returned it. I purchased 4 eneloop rechargable batteries plus a charger at the same time to use with my mouse and these worked fine so I am going to stick with them.",

Sadly the batteries that I received don't charge beyond the levels they supported when they arrived (about 25% on one, 50% on the other). One of the two shows a constant red failure light when connected. As I don't want to have to keep them constantly connected to avoid eventual battery death I gave up within a day. Even if these do work you have extra cables on your desk. I'm happier with a more flexible, standard rechargeable battery solution now.",

Well, the Mac warns me when my battery is getting low, so I just stick it in the charging base overnight and my problems are solved. Inductive charging is the wave of the future.
