These look like smaller versions of farmhouse lights but different enough they won't be mistaken as replicas, they have their own simple design. Using two as patio lights and another at each door (front and side) as entry lights. I use Phillips soft-white LED bulbs equal to 60 watt incandescent; they give a warm light and last for thousands of hours even outside. My photos show some dust that collected on top, probably from using a leaf blower in the backyard. It's unnoticible normally. They hide dust pretty well, clean up easily with a damp paper towel.",

They do not shine light upward (I knew that) and give a nice glow to the wall and room area below.

Should have just bought this to begin with and saved my time!",

Would buy again if we had more outdoor needs",

I installed it to minimize stray light pollution for astronomy, and the design is very good for directing light in a downward cone and not wasting light pointed at the sky or far away.

It's not strong enough to hang from it like a monkey, and a direct hit from a basketball would probably hurt it ... so don't hang from it or throw basketballs at it!",
