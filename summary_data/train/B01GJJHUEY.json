Sure I can get cheap soft treats in the supermarket with all their artificial colors and ingredients but at this stage of his exceptionally long life, he deserves the very best. Hey, maybe these treats are keeping him going? Who knows? He loves them, gums down without difficulty and is overall a happy camper.",

I use these every day after giving the dogs their pills, and at training class with the puppy. Even my most picky dogs gobble all of the flavors up. Definitely recommend these and I've tried MANY, many different kinds. Love the Wellness brand too.",

But this bag of treats was delivered as a bag of crumbs.
