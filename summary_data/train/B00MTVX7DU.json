The headphones do fit me as around-ear, but I am sure that some others will find these more as an on-ear headphone.",

These used to sell for $299.00 so cant beat the value. Give them a shot Im sure you will be pleased. There are a couple videos on youtube about these too.",

They're built well and a little on the heavy side as compared to a typical plastic headphone. Sounds is very good, especially with the bass boost feature on. I would highly recommend these at this price point! You really can't go wrong..",
