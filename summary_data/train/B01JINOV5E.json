Well... I decided to order this 4-pack and they are completely different again! Not nearly as soft, squishy and light :( * edited to add that after reading the reviews I believe that these are fake. If you use the real ones and then use these, you will see the difference & how much worse these are. Go buy them from target instead!!",

BeautyBlenders are the original and it's hard to compete with them, but considering the price of a single BeautyBlender at $20. It's just an unrealistic expense, especially when you can get 4 Real Techniques Sponges for the same price. I've tried everything under the sun, and honestly the RT sponges are the closest to the real thing I've found.",

    "title": "Real Techniques Miracle Complexion Beauty Sponge Makeup Blender, Set of 4",
    "description": "Style Name:ComplexionOptimize your beauty routine with the #1 branded makeup sponge. This versatile beauty tool was designed with a revolutionary foam technology to evenly blend makeup for a smooth, enhanced finish. Use damp for a dewy glow or dry for a full coverage. Samantha and Nicola Chapman grew up surrounded by makeup. Their aunt was a top makeup artist in London, working with clients like David Bowie and Princess Diana. Their mum was makeup-involved too, always trying out the latest trends and being creative with her looks. As young girls, they experimented on one another, and of course Nic was the test subject, since Sam was the older sister. When it came time to choose their career path, it was clear that makeup artistry was the way to go. They were talented, creative, and keen to follow in the footsteps of their successful aunt. But, most importantly \u2014 they were passionate about beauty. In 2011, the Real Techniques brush collection was launched. Unbelievable brush quality was paired with professional, interesting, fun education from Sam and Nic. The launch day was memorable, as women from around the world started pouring to the website to learn more about this new brand. Fairly quickly, a global community of women who loved makeup began to form. Not only do they have a strong connection to Sam & Nic, but they also connect with one another \u2014 piping in on social media to answer questions and give input. Today, the brand has taken off in the US, UK, and around the world. Sam and Nic continue to grow as top makeup artists, writing columns for national magazines and newspapers, appearing on major network television as beauty experts, and editing their own digital magazine. Through Real Techniques, women everywhere are transforming their makeup routines, and themselves, with the approachable expertise, friendship, and tools from Sam & Nic.",
