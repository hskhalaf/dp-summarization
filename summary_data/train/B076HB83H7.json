Even using them like this, without support of the fingers, they work quite well. I am able to do so many more exercises without having to substitute workouts. I've used them for deadlifts, shrugs, rows, pull ups, and many other workouts that would have been impossible without them. Amazing product that gave me amazing results!",

This is for more fitness and physique training to rep out. Great for women, too, since the can save their hands a bit from callouses, and to lift more weight without grip failing too early. I am a former power lifter competitor, but have a bit of nerve damage in my fingers and elbows. With these, I can still lift as heavy as I am capable of. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",

I noticed that I still had a little left in the gas tank but my hands were fatigued. In came these puppies. Using these to relieve the work on my hands in the later end of the workout and isolate my back, allowed me to push to get more reps in. That's where progression lies. Buy these!

I don't use them all the time but for shrugs and pull-downs or last sets of pull-ups these can be a great addition to your gym gear. No compensation whatsoever for this review.",

I\u2019m 220lbs and have been able to do pulls as well as deadlifting up to 275lbs. If you\u2019re using them to support most of the weight I wouldn\u2019t go much heavier then that. Just my opinion. The cuffs are comfortable and the hooks fit around a standard barbell no problem. They feel very well built and I think they\u2019ll hold up pretty well for awhile. There are more expensive hooks out there but I would save your money and go with these.",

The hooks hang past where you would grip the bar so you would have to not hold the bar with your hands at all and just let the hooks hold them. We have tried to wear them diff ways and nothing works. The straps seem like nice quality but unfortunately its a faulty design.",
