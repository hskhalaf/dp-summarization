(yes, I should have paid more attention to the measurements.) This is a teeny tiny set. Maybe 25% as big as the tree house. Once you put a pet in the room...the room is full. It's not like you can move the pet around to pretend it's doing anything. And the whole things is smaller, flimsier, just not as solid and sturdy as the tree house. My daughter does like playing with it - which is why it got the 3 stars it did. I was unimpressed and would not recommend.",

I was kind of embarrassed when the kid unwrapped it & even more when she couldn't figure out how to set it up without the help of her dad - who had to guess what went where. In the end, I guess she was happy with the gift.",

    "description": "Product Packaging:Frustration-Free PackagingThere really is no place like home \u2013 especially when that home is a flat in the fabulous PetUltimate Apartments complex! There sure is plenty for pets to do here. Kids can imagine them swimming in the rooftop fishbowl, playing on the swing or zooming down the slide! Beds and nooks abound, giving pets plenty of places to rest after an action packed day. Cat towers on the roof allow pets to keep an eye on all the action, while a swinging perch is just the right spot to sit for a bit. Top and bottom level doghouse doors are convenient for a canine resident (sold separately), and it looks like management provides a water bowl and food dish for the pets and their friends! The playset comes complete with 2 pet tenants (a kitty and her goldfish bestie), and fits up to 30 pets of various sizes (each sold separately). Best of all, the playset closes up and can be taken just about anywhere for on the go fun! Littlest Pet Shop and all related characters are trademarks of Hasbro.",
