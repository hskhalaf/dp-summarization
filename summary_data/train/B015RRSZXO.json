We now have seven kittens in the cage, that we're fostering and waiting for adoption. The multiple levels give them all space, and they love the hammocks to sleep in. The cage clips onto the base, and lifts off very easily when a more involved cleaning is necessary. Each level has it's own doorway, which makes it simpler to round up and replace the kittens in the cage after their exercise... Very simple to assemble, and easy to disassemble if fewer levels are required. I would definitely recommend.",

      "text": "We were going to add two kittens to our house and we wanted a safe and secure place for them.. My wife found this kennel for a reasonable price. I assembled it easily ( I do read instructions). It is well made with clever reinforcements. The kittens enjoy it with plenty of space for food ,water, bed, and a litter box plus a sling bed. The gal we adopted the kittens from came over to do some paper work and she immediately started asking about it, wanting to know where we bought it etc. This is a woman who runs a cat adoption service so she knows kennels. She was very impressed with the size , construction, and cost.",

I have ordered extra shelves so I can make an upper level and will still have the double lower level which is plenty of room for my foster kittens. Cons: The wheels are a joke. They look really nice but the wheel is too small for the locking mechanism and the design of it catches in the loops of the rug and pull it out as you try to roll it. If the wheels were large so the locking mechanism didn't drag the ground I would have no negatives.",

Able to fit a regular litter box, food and water. Our cat did not like the hammock so we removed it and that made it a little more open. I like the curved edges and the removable bottom tray (some effort needed). We ordered the one with locks on the castor (or atleast thought we were) (not clear from the description) but did not receive the correct one. It rolls around when the cat is active. But overall it is a good buy.",
