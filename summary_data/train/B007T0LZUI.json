The directions were extremely vague- it took about 5 hours from start to finish and lots of frustration. The end product looks good, I gave it 4 stars because of the quality and value for your buck. Good luck putting it together. If I had to do it again, I would pay a little extra to have it assembled (and I've assembled many, many things before- from ikea to furniture I've bought online).",

We did have some difficulty figuring out how to put it together at the beginning, but once we got the right piece attach, the rest just fell into place. It did have a broken piece, but I was able to glue it back into place. It was wrapped and boxed really well, so I was surprised that a part of the top was broken off (the trim underneath). Despite that, I would recommend this product. It looks great in our room!!",

The locks typically make a click noise when you have turned it completely. These ones don't they just break if you over torque it. Luckily they include 2 extras (must be common) as I used them all.",
