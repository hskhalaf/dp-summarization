The materials just seem cheap, but I guess that's to be expected considering it's the cheapest one I could find (still not sure why these are ever more that $10). It does work for what I want it for and I will be keeping it for sure, but if you're looking for durability and a nicer-looking stand, maybe go for a more expensive one.",

It doesn't have enough weight enough to stay in place, plus the little feet don't stay in, which makes it really difficult to use as a touch screen loptop stand/ergonomic lift (I have a wireless keyboard, so there isn't much movement). It's a cool design, layout, just wished they constructed it with a bit more heartiness. After I glued the feet, distributed the weight with a stand, and have a non-slip liner under the feet I can use it, but I gave up using the drawers, they stick and then all the little things inside get messed up.",

Smaller than I imagined (didn't consider the dimensions), but perfect for my desk. I use the feet so the drawers come out over my keyboard. I love the idea of controlling the clutter on my desk and making certain supplies very accessible (pens, paperclips, business cards, etc.). Wish I could make the interior of the drawers adjustable to fit what exactly what I want to store but it's not a big deal. Overall very pleased!",
