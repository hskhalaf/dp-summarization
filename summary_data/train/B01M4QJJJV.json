So if someone is looking at you when you're locking/unlocking, he/she can see the combination from the other side of the lock (if you're not careful; and the numbers are big). I'd recommend you put dark tape on the other side to cover the numbers. Overall, it's great value for the price and functionality.",

The first lock I purchased was awesome! I use it all the time. I bought another lock for another bike and after only a few uses this one stopped working. Now I can't even open it, it's ridiculous! I'm scared that I will not be able to get the lock off of my bike, so now I just don't even use it. It's a shame. I would say if your lock starts acting funky at all, return it immediately!",

Perfect for your kids who've invested a mint in their scooters :)",

I purchased the 14mm lock, and I will admit it it just too small to lock your frame and tire to something. I've had the lock for a year and it is holding up well.",

The manufacturer should get rid of the holder, and charge the customer 3 cents less, which I imagine is what it cost to make the holder.",

Also the shape of the bracket only works well on a certain shape of bike frame, less round and a little more oblong. Bike lock works great, but it is less neon than it looks like in the picture.",
