      "title": "Stunning",
      "text": "A flexible pro camera. Images are stunning - especially the jpg processing is fabulous. If doing raw files start with Olympus' own Workspace software to get a quality image. Its better than Lightroom for the initial settings. Overall, it's basically as good as the M1 except for continuous auto focus. Feels solid in hand and the controls fall right where they should. The only difficulty is the flexibility in setting this up. There are so many options that you can set it up anyway your like. I especially like the 4 custom settings. Check out Rob Trek's videos on youtube and he can help you make good choices for setup",

The camera is intuitive and a pleasure to manipulate. I bought Olympus M. Zuiko Digital ED 12mm f/2.0 Lens to use for family pics and random street shooting and the tandem has really impressed me. I have 2 complaints I wish the camera shot 4k keeping inline with its contemporaries and the app on the iPhone looses connectivity to easily. However, I still rate this camera 5 stars because I just love to use it!",

      "text": "This is a great little camera. I wish some of the knobs were a bit more ergonomically placed. Compared to the EM5 it's not as intuitive or convenient, especially the exposure compensation knob. The WiFi is also just barely functional, and only works about 30% of the time, so it's not as convenient as I had hoped. Still, the larger sensor is a nice upgrade for me and the jpeg processing is pretty sweet directly out of camera.",

The articulating screen is nice to turn it around and protect the screen while in bag or even just to leave like that to force me to use the nice viewfinder. I also really like the ability to switch to black and white with the turn of the knob on the front of the camera. Overall this camera is just well thought out and makes it easier to switch modes without really thinking too much or fumbling through menus.",
