I had been thinking about switching out my radio but this saved me not only time but money. I've had it for about a little over a month and it works great. Sound is clear, shows me how much voltage is in my car battery, easy bright display and I like how I can change the songs on the device itself instead of unlocking my phone and having to do it that way. I have a 2001 toyota rav4 and it works perfectly.",

Even in areas with not many vacant FM slots as well it worked great. The phone microphone could have been better, as when you respond to calls you need to yell on top of your voice for the other person to hear well, so i end up using my headphones for talking. That is the reason for the 4 stars. That is the only issue, otherwise for the price this is a great transmitter.",

The FM transmitter has an SD card slot so i can download music on that and play it from the transmitter itself. I was skeptical but now Im a believer!!! -So for the Nulaxy KM22 I give it ***** stars!!!!",

Now, for about 10 minutes (more or less) I have to listen to radio static until it connects to the frequency I have it tuned to and then I can listen to music.

Unit works well, sturdy lighter connection fit, volume knob is handy, dedicated off switch is nice, screen is nice size and easy to read, gooseneck is on the short side so sits mostly upright rather than bent in any posable direction. Would be nice to have rubberized buttons instead of slick plastic. The real key is finding an open and consistently available radio station to connect with, but once paired sound is clear and good. Have not yet used phone answer feature so can't speak to that.",

If using bluetooth, it pairs before you even get your car out of park. The expanded FM range is extremely helpful in removing to possibility of interference. The power button and fast charge port is just icing on the cake. I also like the battery voltage checkerwhen you start up. Very convenient for an older car. All on all, huge hit",

There is only so many times that you can listen to your 15 + year old cd collection. I learned after using it that I can even have bluetooth phone calls with it so \"winning\" in my book. Highly recommend this to anyone who does not want to go out and buy a new stereo system.",

Changing the volume and song is very easy, the buttons and knob are easy to find without looking at the transmitter. This model also has a button allowing you to turn off the transmitter so it isn't draining your battery.Overall a great product that has made driving more enjoyable.",

Do note that this does transmit from an FM channel, but make sure to find an FM channel that is out of range from your city. I personally find this an issue because every time I use a channel around the 87.5 area, there's always a small static sound. I know it doesn't come out from the transmitter, but there's a frequency within the city limits, which causes it. Overall, the small static sound doesn't bother me too much, as I am still able to listen to my music.",
