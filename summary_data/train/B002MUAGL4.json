It screams out \"I will survive the brutality of this job site\" while sending classic notes of music for everyone to enjoy. With a heavy heart I have to give it 5 stars because as much I don't like sharing space in an already overcrowded work vehicle this beast earns his keep and gets come along to provide tunes.",

Jobsite radio for work . NAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not on regular construction sites . Maybe your more quiet ones",
