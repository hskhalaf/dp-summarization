Had to correct a blade issue a couple months ago, then today at a job it slowed down and started smoking. We have contacted Lackmond, lets see how they fix this issue. It has a 3 year warranty so we shall see. Hopefully, I can come back and update this post with a better review.",

Ordered the Beast based on the reviews, and to be honest, the cost. I didn't want to spring for an MK, and this actually seemed to be a better deal for the price. Used it for the first time today, and was thrilled with the ease of use, consistent precision of the cuts, and the surprising light weight of the unit. If it keeps performing the way it did today - and I see no reason why it shouldn't - I will be a confirmed and enthusiastic supporter of this tile saw brand!",

Cutting 12x24 cuts straight. The plunge feature works great. Water spray is well controlled with flaps and extension tray. Laser and Led light help to make your work easier. The stand is sturdy and mobile and breaks down quick if you had to take it apart. Powerful saw will cut anything you dare accurately. I ran the pump out of a bucket to keep clean water supply .

This thing was sent through the Breach with one intended purpose, to reduce large tiles into slightly smaller tiles!
