I do wish I would have gotten the petite length instead of regular ( I'm 5'5\" ) so they are a bit long but no big deal...cuz I love these pants!!! They are just right for the thickness so nothing shows that shouldn't.",

I'm nearing the end of my pregnancy, but the all over support from these pants makes me feel less pregnant and more like myself in my own body. I'll enjoy them as much after I deliver too, will need the support with post-baby body as well. Really love these pants. :)",
