OSMO is very interactive and my son laughs and enjoys everything about this as he sees his creation up on the screen. There is a story that helps understand what he's drawing. It's fun for both parents and kids Side note: Osmo creative is not just drawing but there are also different games he can choose to play. I limited screen time so he can be creative creating his creations. :P",

It\u2019s actually quite clever and she has a lot of fun with it. The app allows a parental account with reports and some control. There are also other expansion packs you can buy for other games. I highly recommend.",

I\u2019m competing against Roblox, Tik Tok, and You Tube Kids, so even just 15 minutes with this was a huge win for me. I would like to add more of the games, but they are terribly expensive. I would say this was worth retail price if your kids are into drawing and art, if they can sit and color for hours. Otherwise you would have to think of this as a starting set and add other games to keep their interest as they age.",
