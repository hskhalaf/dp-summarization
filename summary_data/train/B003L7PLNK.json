It was very easy to punch the metal. The only thing is they do mark the metal slightly. To get around this you can place a piece of card stock in the punch (slide over the metal punch part) to cushion the metal. This way the metal will not get marked.",

The problem is, that hole is too big, leaving space for the silicone to squeeze by, so it doesn't actually cut anything. I'll keep it for possible other uses, but for me, it's a dud...",

It worked well on 30g bronze sheet (half hard), hammered bronze & silver wire up to 18 gauge soft (I did not try 16g soft) , 20g hammered half hard bronze. I tried it on hammered 14g half hard bronze and bent it slightly. I was able to straighten the bit again, but it is not suitable for harder, heavier gauge metals. The 1.8mm punch is a little sturdier, but I would not push it with heavy gauge either.",
