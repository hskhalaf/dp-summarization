Terrible seat though. It's a fixed post seat at an angle so you can't level it out. For now I put on a seat from an old bike and had to order a new seat and post to have an adjustable seat. Disappointing for the price you pay, especially when models below this one come with adjustable seats.",

Pros The frame, forks, and cranks are really strong and I don\u2019t see myself breaking them anytime soon.

My son and I had a VERY hard time putting the handlebars on because the instruction pamphlet shows a completely different style of brakes/handlebar configuration so we had to guess. Also, possibly a piece or insert missing in the handlebars. We assembled as instructed. My son was riding and the handlebars turned down, stopped the wheel, and he was thrown off his bike. Not sure what to do now...will probably have to take to a bike shop to get it repaired if possible. I would not recommend this bike. I feel like I wasted the money.",

It come with a U brake and is suitable to install Gyro, but I took off the brake cos I run brakeless at park. Cons: Made in China by pacific bicycle, and 21 inch frame (suitable for 5'11 or above I guess).",
