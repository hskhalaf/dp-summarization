      "text": "Though it seems silly, the proper hair gel does matter. You want something that goes on easily without leaving residue or making your hair feel like you're wearing a helmet. After trying numerous different brands, from Target to Salon quality, this is far and away my favorite one. It makes my hair stay in place without feeling like I can't mess with it. It's just the right balance of strength and flexibility. So I bought 3 right off the bat to make sure I didn't run out before Amazon sold out or something. And thankfully, I'm still on my first bottle - the stuff lasts a pretty long time. Well worth it.",
