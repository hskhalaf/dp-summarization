At first, I thought it was because it arrived on a warm day. It never regained the correct consistency, never smelled right, and certainly doesn\u2019t moisturize like the body butter. I\u2019m finding a new supplier for my next order.",

The only downside is that it is a bit pricey, but that is probably because of the quality products that they use to create it. I feel good about putting this on my body.",

I put this on right after i shower to retain the moisture and it does an excellent job. Completely absorbs into the skin and does not leave a sticky residue. One container can easily last me over a month if used daily. I\u2019ve tried other scents by the body shop but always go back to this one. Best body butter out there for your money!!",

I recommend using it before bed. I also recommend buying it from here instead of Ulta, because you pay 6 dollars less (as of this moment in time.) One last note - the coconut scent is out of this world. It smells like sun tan lotion or a coconut sno-cone, which is pleasant and calming.",

When the package arrived, the item was not sealed whatsoever and the lid was off. There was no coconut scent. The consistency was off. When I tried it on my hands, the product was flakey and difficult to absorb. All in all, there are no redeeming qualities. Big disappointment.",

The cream seems like it will go on greasy but it quickly absorbs into the skin leaving it feeling luxurious and smooth. It's too early to tell exactly how long the container will last, but I imagine it'll be good for at least 2 months. Highly recommended for its moisturizing properties and scent.",
