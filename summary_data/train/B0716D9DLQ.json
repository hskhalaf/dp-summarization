      "text": "I bought it to try out some new hairstyles for myself. After using the curling iron, the result turns out to be surprisingly good! It makes my hairs look wavy naturally. Also, I like this iron wand set, especially its rose gold color and the 3 different sizes/patterns of wands. Bonus: It reflects the real-time temperature and is adjustable to the temperature best-suited to your hair. This set comes with 2 different sizes of gloves. Be sure to wear the glove provided!",

      "text": "These are so cool! I have never owned a wand before so i was very excited to get them in. It was nice because the booklet tells you which wand to use based on hair type and what curl you want. It also explains how to use it. I am not normally good with hair tools but it worked great and created really nice lasting curls. For a beginner they are great! However they do get really hot (duh) but there is no stand so be careful what you set it on because there is nothing to prop it up.",
