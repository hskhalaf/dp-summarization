I am not sure it should actually come off but ours did within a few times of use.",

      "text": "Buy this. Seriously. Rather than letting your red wine breath for a few hours, this instantly removes the flavor of the tannic acid in younger red wines, making them instantly taste like mature and way more expensive wines. Even someone like me who is not that picky when it comes to wine will appreciate the difference. This plugs into the bottle (push it in firmly), and then you just pour aggressively for best results. Rinse the aerator right after you use it and it will never really need cleaning. I also have the Vinturi, and they are very similar in results.",

We have tried it with multiple wines (with & without aeration)- seems to smooth out the taste and bring out more flavor in most of the ones we've tried so far. Does need to be hand washed of course, but fits well in the bottles so far & the fact that it's a nice clear plastic instead of glass makes my mom feel more comfortable that it's not going to shatter while pouring. Came in a very nice storage case, so far no complaints!",

We are not fully convinced that it adds dramatically to the flavor, but we enjoy a nice bottle of red and this is a fun accessory. There's nothing to it, just plug it into the open bottle, invert the bottle mostly upside down so the wine swirls in the globe. It doesn't pour too fast and splash, which we were a little hesitant of at first. Easily rinses under warm water. It is plastic which may not be obvious if you don't read the details carefully.
