They got really dirty but hosed off well. The zipper is hard to open and close, I dreaded getting a drink out so would always ask my husband to open it. By the end of the trip, both our friends Yetis zipper was split/broken. For the price you pay for these, that should never happen. So, in my opinion they are a bit over rated for their functionality. A subsequent cooler knock off would work fine for a fraction of the cost.",
