It comes with some extra accessories which were quickly lost - but the toy itself is holding up well. It seems to be slightly sturdier than the other rescue bots we've gotten, and those aren't exactly flimsy so I see this lasting a long time. It is also slightly more difficult to transform than the other smaller ones, but he is still able to manage to do so without assistance. If your child enjoys the rescue bots they will enjoy this toy.",

We had some smaller toys that \"transformed\" but he was constantly pulling parts off or crying for us to help bc he didn't have the fine motor skills for their tiny pieces. That is why we welcomed Heatwave into our home. Not for my child, but for our own sanity. Kiddo loves it. Only day one in but the toy seems to be fairly robust and transforms easily. He has already saved some duplo buildings and several members of the paw patrol. I will likely purchase more in the future.",

The plastic material is shiny, they stay together better when they transform, they have an accessory and the colors seem brighter. We will be getting the other characters for his birthday in March.
