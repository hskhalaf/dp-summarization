      "text": "The 10.25\" Westinghouse cast iron pan I had split in two while heating up for its fourth use. The first three times I used it, it worked fine, browning meat nicely and cleaning easily. The fourth time though, I was heating it up to 440F degrees on an induction burner as I had before, and soon after I put the pan on, it just split in half. Fortunately I also had the 12\" pan, and it worked fine as a replacement. I don't know if my 10.25\" had a manufacturing defect or not, but be aware that if it happened to me, it may also happen again to someone else.",

The surface, inside and outside, was always smooth. It's impossible to cook with this pan because everything will stick, and food like pancakes would just fall apart when you tried to turn them.",
