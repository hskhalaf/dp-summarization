We have got it set at just above 2 for our preferred toast, which is a medium dark brown. The spring is a bit strong as well. More than one slice of bread has flown completely out of the toaster, so don\u2019t keep close to the edge of the counter or your toast may end up on the floor. Otherwise, it works very well. :-)",

This in counter/intuitive, since most toasters use the center elements only for bagels. I also use the bagel function to toast hamburger buns. Use 4 for whole wheat,?3 for white bread/buns. Darkness control numbers are a little hard to see. Could benefit from ejection alarm for cooks who are busy doing other things besides toasting, and can\u2019t constantly monitor the toaster. With all this, I still consider it a superior toaster.",
