What a time consuming PITA (esp when you have to do this all the time). My Mini is no longer reliable... Its been over 30 days so I can't send this defective PIECE OF S*** SSD back to Amazon :( I guess I'll see what (if anything) SanDisk will do about this malfunctioning SSD.... Sorry I bought this.... Next time I'll get the Samsung Evo 850 PRO Drive....",
