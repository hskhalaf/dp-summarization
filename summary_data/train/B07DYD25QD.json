      "verdict": "Ladies have a lot to love about the Siren Strap Q2 from Merrell. Its has posh looks and is amazingly light, comfortable, and versatile. On top of all that, its fit is nothing short of exemplary. It is not at all bright and sunny, however, as its problematic straps and depressing lack of arch support smear its brilliance. Overall, the Siren Strap Q2 makes for a captivating product, thanks to its defining qualities that go beyond aesthetics. A bit of compromise concerning its slipups, however, is necessary.",
      "pros": [
        "Quite a number of loyal Merrell supporters had their expectations exceeded by the Siren Strap Q2\u2019s enchanting level of comfort",
        "Many of those who bought this strappy hiking gear couldn\u2019t help but describe it as an insatiably cute sandal",
        "Dozens of wearers found a perfect fit in this Merrell footwear",
        "This sandal, based on numerous reports, is as useful for hiking as it is for virtually everything else",
        "The Siren Strap Q2 enamored a moderate percentage of owners with its excessive lightness",
        "Some wearers considered the sandal\u2019s break-in period nonexistent",
        "With this sandal on, users by the handful didn\u2019t dread losing grip over challenging terrain",
        "According to a couple of buyers, the Merrell Siren Strap Q2 is undeniably a worthy purchase"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "A considerable number of owners with wider ankle girth expressed their dismay concerning the sandal\u2019s ankle strap",
        "They said that it could use a bit more length so that they could strap it in more securely",
        "The Siren Strap Q2 didn\u2019t win the favor of a select few for lacking arch support",
        "Based on a couple of reviews, the sandal\u2019s diagonal (instep) strap becomes too tight, especially once the feet start to swell",
        "A tiny fraction of verified buyers detested the footbed\u2019s toe bar\u2014the ridge right below where the toes flex"

However I much prefer the soft microfibre footbed of the Terran to this \"Textured EVA Integrated footbed\" which feels a bit rubbery and faintly sticky.",

I deduced that over time, the strap going over my little time would really start to aggravate me. So on that basis I sent them back and bought a different pair of Merrells. Also the velcro fastenings are a little short.. I forsee loosening if I'd bought these.",

I have size 5.5 feet and the size 5s fit me, but not much room to spare. So I think they would also be right for size 5. They are possibly on the narrow side, but the straps are adjustable and they hold the foot really well in place on the footbed. The colour is a dusky dark red. Pinkish rather than brownish red, but very muted. Works really well with the black.",

They were all really big and unflattering, so when i saw these, I knew I\u2019ve hit a middle ground. Not too big, but still the necessary straps ect in place to make them practical for moderate walking. I will be testing them soon when we go on holiday.",
