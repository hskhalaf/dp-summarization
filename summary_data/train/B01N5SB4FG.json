I will update this review after some usages. update: Smoked a 5 lb pork shoulder yesterday and it came out perfect. It controlled the temp very well and the pulled pork was fantastic.",

Only reason I gave it four stars is because when you need to reload the wood chips you have to open the main door and all the smoke goes out.

      "text": "The unit arrived and the electronics were completely dead. After executing the troubleshooting in the manual, I called the manufacturer and after 45 minutes waiting for someone to answer the phone, she stated that something is certainly wrong with the electronics and we'll start by exchanging the main computer board, but if that doesn't work then call back and they'll send the next component. I'm just sending it back and will try something else. Looks like a good, solid unit, other than the electronics not working, which is a fairly significant issue for an electric device.",

When I went online I had to fill out a page and email it to them. After a week I never heard back from customer support from either a call or email. At this point I decided to send it back. I will never buy a smoke hollow product again. I highly recommend looking elsewhere for an electric smoker. I was extremely disappointed in their customer support!",

We had heard horror stories of certain smokers that are really time consuming and difficult to use, so you end up only using it once and then it sits in your garage. That is most definitely not the case with this smoker! It simply plugs into the wall, you set the temperature, and then you change the wood chips and water out a few times throughout the day (depending on the length of time you are cooking your food.) It is really that simple and yet the food comes out super flavorful. I would highly recommend this smoker!",
