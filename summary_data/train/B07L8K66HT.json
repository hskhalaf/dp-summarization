The pages are chunky like a board book. If your baby likes baby shark, they will LOVE this book.",

Also it's nice for parents because you can easily turn a song off whenever you want; you don't have to let the song play out all the way to wait for it to finish like some other annoying toys. There are I think 8 different types of songs (one of them is the regular baby shark song) that she likes to rotate through and keep her busy with a BOOK not an iPhone.",

The only thing I don't like, and the only reason for 4 stars is because of the Christmas song. Not everyone celebrates holidays. And not everyone wants their children to be exposed to that. There should be a baby shark book without that option. Other than that, the book is perfect.",

I only Wish there was a quieter option for the songs (initially, she was afraid of the volume of the songs) and I wish The buttons were a little easier to activate when pushed (hard for a 19 mo old to push and get the song herself- mom or dad usually ends up doing it for her). But because of the quality of the book and the lovely song suggestions, I still Will give it 5 stars.",

We love that the cover is different so we don't mistake both, although the rest of the insides are the same design. Love that we can turn off the song if need be, to avoid any sound accidentally comes off when my son is sleeping. Great buy for any Baby Shark fan.",
