The tube it comes in is also the shipping container and it doesn't allow you to rip off the shipping label and tape without ruining the outside tube which kinda sucks. The map itself is really nice! It has a prominent border around the countries so you don't over color anything. With that being said, it is tough to scratch off. My friend was scratching off four or five different counties and it took her about 30-45 mins to do with a penny but it sure looks good when it's all done!! Because she liked it so much, I'm going to be buying one for myself!! Great purchase!",

As far as I'm concerned, it seems to be fairly good quality and it's a good looking map as the gold leaf is scratched off. Buy this for the right person and you'll be in with the gold. :)",
