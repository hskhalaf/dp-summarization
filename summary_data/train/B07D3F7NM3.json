I compare the calendar to my Phone\u2019s and lo and behold the month of October is incorrect. The page is actually from 2018. The rest of the calendar is 2019 so I\u2019m not sure how they just mistakenly used a 2018 sheet on this one. I\u2019m really disappointed and considering throwing it away. It looks so stupid on my wall with my corrected dates.",

Definitely glad that I noticed now and did not plan anything important for next month based on this page. Hopefully they caught it before printing too many copies! Otherwise, the set up is nice and the boxes are a good size for adding activities and appointments.",
