Once you get a magnifying device to read the instructions, they are poorly written and confusing. There is no return policy through Amazon but perhaps through the seller. The idea is good, the execution of instructions is poor. However, an enclosed card does give a phone number for assistance as well as a website and email address. What accounts for a good evaluation is that there is an excellent instructional YouTube Video titled ThermoPro TP60 Indoor and Outdoor Thermometer that should answer all the questions you might have.",

So, while it looks good, I have to give it a 1 as by their own warnings it has to be closed, which obviously is impossible if you have to crack it open like an egg to get the batteries in in the first place.",

I'm not sure how much to trust the humidity readings, that measurement tends to be unreliable with most such instruments. The inside unit hangs nicely from a nail, the outside unit does so similarly, and seems pretty weatherproof. I'm not sure how long the rubber seal might be functional, it will certainly deteriorate over time. I'll know in a few years. :-)",

As I needed to monitor temperature and had no concerns about humidity, this is not a big problem. It does have me concerned that the temperature sensing may lose accuracy too - but hopefully not. Customer service has been good - and I have not contacted them about the humidity sensing problem (because I don't really care how humid or dry it is in the greenhouse).",

I do not understand complaints of inaccuracy; I have compared them both with an old fashioned glass thermometer and with a 70-80 year old steel with 10\" arm (which I believe once hung in a service station window)...and all units are within 1-2 degrees (The ThermoPros have identical readings!). I also complement the customer service which promptly corrected MY OWN ERROR when I ordered a wrong model #.",

April 2018 Update: in 5 months the outdoor unit stopped working. I contacted the company and they sent some trouble shooting ideas. I tried them and after about 4 tries following the prescribed trouble shooting technique the outdoor unit started working again. Unfortunately, in a few days it stopped again. I contacted the company again and they sent a replacement unit quickly. I am impressed with the customer service. Hopefully, the replacement unit will not fail like the first one. I am leaving the 5 stars because of the customer service.",
