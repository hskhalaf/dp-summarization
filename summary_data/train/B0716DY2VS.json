Also wrinkled from folds.....see pic.....should be shipped rolled not folded. Terribly disappointed in the color \"gray\".......It's more like gunmetal or stainless steel.....see my pic vs. then pull up amazon's pic. Color was important because the darker gray in the Amazon pic matches our storm-door hardware. If I had known color issue I would have ordered brown which would have matched our siding. Quality, delivery, price .......5 stars Misleading color, smell, fold marks.......2 stars Three star overall. Extremely glad it's a \"made in the USA\" product.",

I recently bought a third one for my utility room, which has an entry from the garage. It keeps the garage floor silt from tracking into the house. The mats are everything claimed in the ads. They are easy to clean, lie in place without shifting, are very durable. (The first one I bought more than a year ago and still looks like new.) The price is certainly reasonable. I recommend them highly!",

My front yard is currently dug up and it manages to trap the massive amounts of dirt being tracked in. Its also much easier to wash off when my puppy has an accident by the door.
