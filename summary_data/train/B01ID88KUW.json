Have had the lawn mower and tiller for years without a single issue. May go with another company or gas system after this. Luckily the battery is on the other end of the unit.",

But it was only 14.00 on Amazon. I Love this system. Need to purchase the weed eater with the battery next. That way i have all of it. Plus 2 batteries. Highly Recommend this.

      "text": "Be very careful when comparing the weight of these battery units. This tool's cutting appliances are said to weigh 11 pounds, which is fair. The issue here is that the 11 pounds is at the end of a pole that makes it feel heavier and more difficult to handle and use. I am over 6 foot tall and over 200 pounds and I found the cutting configurations difficult to manage, especially for any period of time. As such, I returned the product.",

The hedge trimmer on the longer handle allowed me to cut hedges I used to need a ladder for. In short, I love it. I can't wait to get it back from my brother who borrowed it, and also loves it!",

Then...Next day I tried to finish up and wasn't long before the power stopped and started clicking. I thought it was battery low...so I charged and tried again later. DEAD. Nothing. I thought bad trimmer, so put the saw attachment on. Nothing. I'm PISSED. I see no serial number anywhere on unit and it came with Manual, but no paperwork whatsoever.",

So far (1 use) the battery life is quite good and the trimmer cuts as well as my Black and Decker corded trimmer. While the reach is fantastic you have to stand back a bit from what you are cutting because of the length of the shaft, but that is quite OK. I also like the adjustability of the head which makes trimming that much easier. I really like it. Great Tool. Thanks",
