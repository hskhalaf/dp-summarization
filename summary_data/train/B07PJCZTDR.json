He only uses these shoes to work in (he works as a mechanic on cars) so the only abuse they've seen is repeated motion of bending at the toes when he is kneeling down. We are disappointed that for nearly $100 we only got about 1 months wear from them before they started falling apart. We will not be buying this brand any longer.",

Last fall I got this pair (the Accentor series) and am back on the \"loving it\" trail once more. I hunt, fish, hike, and play hard & often; and without my Merrells, I doubt my feet would still love me for it. Thanks very much for restoring my faith in the company & in great-affordable footwear!
