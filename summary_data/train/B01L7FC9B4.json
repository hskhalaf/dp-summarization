The Doughnut Store was the perfect edition to our Calico Critters Luxury Townhome Gift Set, as it was cheap but great quality and had tons of things to play with. The critter that the set included was soft, beautiful, and adorable. A must buy for someone needing some sweet treats for the Calico Critters collection.",

And such great quality for the price, especially given the crappy toys that are out there these days. The Critters hearken back to my own childhood of Sylvanian Families and Maple Town. And I think these are even cuter and better quality, if that is possible these days. Buy them...you (and the kids in your life) will not be disappointed! Heck, even my nephew LOVED the Critters present I got for my niece! I think he was a little jealous! So, yeah...good for girls AND boys!",
