This has happened a few times at recreational areas around here. I didn't want to get stranded, and figured if I had The Club, theives would move on from my car to an easier mark in the parking lot. I only really use it when I park at trailheads or in unfamiliar neigborhoods. Is The Club effective? Who can say. But it's easy to use, and 2 years later, I still have my car.",

I can't think of many plastics that wouldn't fade in the sun.",
