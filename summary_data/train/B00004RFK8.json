      "text": "I've been regularly using this pot for over a year now and am very happy with the purchase. The standard 6 q. pots were never enough to make chicken stock. Trying to make stock out of a turkey carcass was barely an option. This stock pot is huge! I can have couple (maybe three if I'm lucky) gallons of stock and I love that the pot comes with a lid. I have not had any problems with discoloration but I wash the pot promptly after using it. Besides making stock, I have also used this to make gallons of pasta sauce and other dishes such as halupki (stuffed cabbage rolls).",

I think it does not have a thick enough stainless coating in it to prevent chemical reactions with the aluminum underneath from tomatoes and acidic foods. Ingestion of aluminum causes health problems. I would definitely not recommend purchase. I will be returning.",

The lid fits well and directs condensation back into the pot. So far I've used it for cooking tomato sauce and chili- cleans up very easily. The handles are welded to the pot (no rivets), so I would use care moving the pot when it's filled. P.S. Make sure you wash it thoroughly before using the first time to remove any oils used during manufacturing- it looked absolutely clean but shed gray water in the first washing.",

I would have given it a 5, but I would be happier if it had a vent/adjustable opening to allow steam to vent somewhat without boiling over. The lid fits with a very slight bit of room, so steam comes out the edges. This is not preferred since it's easy to get burned even when using the handles if there is a large amount of steam.",
