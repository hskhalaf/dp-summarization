Beyond just practicing, they have become a huge hit with the neighborhood kids who come over when they see these set up in the yard. Pickup games have been the staple of summer! I find these easy to fold up. Fit in any trunk so great to take to the park or beach.",

We don't have a lot of extra room for traditional goals, so I was looking for something that would fold up and store easily. These are PERFECT! Took all of two minutes to assemble and seem to be made of high-quality and durable materials. They are perfect for our needs, but are quite a bit smaller than traditional goals - just makes him work harder to aim! :-)",

No need to stake them down unless you play extremely high-scoring games and get tired of realignment. I think by not securing them with stakes it will prolong the life of these seemingly well made pop-up goals. They \"twist to close\" easily enough and slide nicely into a convenient carry pouch that will fit into just about any small car trunk/boot, I would imagine. I'm happy with the value.",

They sometimes snap in half when you're trying to clamp down on harder soil. But they do come with replacements so there's that. The goals themselves last forever, they still look as good as new. They are super light to transport and very easy to fold once you get the hang of it. They fold into themselves like those collapsible windshield covers",

Sometimes when we take to the fields for practice and all the fields are taken up I immediately set up in a sace large enough for a small practice and cone off.. I pop these nets up and were all set! Practice will never have to be canceled again due to no fields/goals available! Shipping was excellent. Very satisfied!",

We have used these goals many, many times and they have held up amazingly well. My sons' teams also use them for training and their coaches prefer them over competing brands. The best part about the goals (other than how well they've held up) is that they really are VERY easy to fold up and put away. My 6 and 8 year olds have no trouble doing it themselves. I highly, highly recommend these goals!",

    "title": "PUGG 4 Foot Pop Up Soccer Goal - Portable Training Futsal Football Net - The Original Pickup Game Goal (Two Goals & Bag)",
    "description": "The 4 Foot PUGG Pop-Up Goal is designed for maximum portability and performance. Its intuitive twist-to-close design folds down to a 1\u201d flat oval, allowing it to fit compactly in its carrying case. Weighing only 4lbs on your shoulder, a pair of PUGG goals are ready for you to take the game with you - wherever you play.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nHelp your child or adolescent hone his or her soccer skills with this Pugg portable 4 Footer training goal boxed set, which includes two goals and a bag. Also available in 6- and 2.5-foot sizes, the Pugg 4 Footer is ideal for clinics, backyard contests, and even organized games at the park. Each 4 Footer goal is remarkably easy to set up: just hold on to the corners, and then twist the left corner counterclockwise while bringing the hands together. \n\n\n\nThe 4 Footer goal sets up with a quick twist of the hands. In mere seconds, you'll have a fully functional soccer goal, with anchoring pegs to help adhere it to the ground. The goal collapses just as quickly into a flat oval that measures 1-inch thick, with a handy carrying bag for easy transport. As a result, you can vacate the practice field as soon as the weather turns, and without having to break down a cumbersome multi-piece goal system. Each 4 Footer measures 4 by 2.5 by 2.5 feet (W x H x D) when installed and is safe for both kids and adults. The set comes with two goals, one carrying bag, and anchoring pegs.",
