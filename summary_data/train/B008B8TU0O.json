The 160 pcs roll comes out to around 0.40 cents a strip, less that 1/2 that of the retail outlets. Got aches and pains? Give KT Tape a try.",

I work in a theme park that hosts a lot of marathons. One day I stopped a someone with this funky tape on their knees and asked if it really works. I got a resounding, \"YES!\" I agree. I'm not a runner, but my knee sure feels better when I use it. I do recommend this product!",
