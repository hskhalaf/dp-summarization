Actually a pretty clever safety feature. Very pleased with the quality.",

Turn it off and set it pointing up on a flat surface and it will cool it down and shut off. Feels built well. It came with 2 extra attachments. Now just looking for things to melt unnecessarily. Hope I don't burn my house down.",

It did exactly what I was hoping it could do. I put the heat and fan setting on high and in just a few moments I had a nice flame going. Not only does it ignite the coals but the blowing hot air does a great job stoking the fire and spreading it to the entire pile of coals. I have a traditional electric coal starter but trying this out, it worked much faster and was more efficient.",
