This comeback model kitted out with a sturdy fabric and reinforced with a rubber toe cap receives a warm reception for its old-school vibe that\u2019s easy to sport with any casual clothing.This throwback style somehow implies that there is more to the world of rubber-soled sporty shoes than the Chuck Taylors. What makes it even more attractive to buyers is its come-on affordable price tag and rich selection of colors.",

I like the look of these better than my converse too...but that's preference. Neither converter or these have great arch support. Fitting is similar to converse to me...but for some reason there is more toe drag with these...the toe area curves up more in converse so you dont feel converse is as big in toes area. In these i feel like i have too much toe room when they are same exact length of converse...if that makes sense...",

Now, about the shoes, great material and workmanship. The sole as before and they fit as expected, will be ordering a white pair soon.
