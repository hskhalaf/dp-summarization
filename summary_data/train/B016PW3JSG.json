When all the things necessary are not available you expect the information to made clear. Like 'no batteries include' on lot of products we buy. Nest has decided that it is OK not to include charger in the box and not tell any one. The equipment does not operate without a charger. Actually unlike phones these thermostats need to be connected all the time. Does it come in the box? NO. You have to pay \u00a335. That is pure scam. The charger should be in the box and if it did not it should not cost \u00a335!",

I used electricians for the install, and it took them most of the day, they told me this is standard, something I've since had confirmed. We had issues during the instal and called Nest support, they blamed the boiler and that was it. Their documentation and support is poor, and in some cases just misleading. If you're determined to have this installed, be aware of the installation cost - it's not a small cost. I don't see the benefits outweighing this any time soon. I regret buying this.",
