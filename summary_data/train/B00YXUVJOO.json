      "text": "We have loved this car seat because of it's easy installation. We always felt comfortable putting our baby in it. We were in a pretty serious car accident with our six month old daughter a few weeks ago. It was a head on collision going about 45 mph. We inspected her immediately after and she has been perfectly fine ever since. After, we were borrowing another car seat of a different brand while we were figuring out a new seat for her and it just felt cheap compared to the Chicco Keyfit 30. We will definitely be purchasing this car seat for our future children.",

The price may be a bit higher, but it's more than worth it.",

I used to be able to cart my daughters Graco car seat around just fine, this one feels very heavy compared to others.
