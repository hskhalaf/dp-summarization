FYI I did read reviews saying that the muslin ones can be a little transparent, so I bought a blue one and it is not transparent.",

He's a liberated feminist. However, it's easy to use and lightweight. I found the print (Nest) very drab in person.",

I've been exclusive pumping from birth, so I have to regularly check on the position of the pump parts and that's super convenient with this cover. It's very soft cotton and looks stylish. I think I've had a little shrinkage through time in the length, but there is still adequate fabric all the way around.

I've always used the cheaper thinner ones before b/c I couldn't fathom spending $50 or more for the nicer ones like Tommee Tippie etc. I really liked the TT ones because they have the corner for wiping babies mouth, but guess what so does this one! I originally registered for this at BRU where it was around $40. Being an Amazon Junkie I looked here and found it for $25!",
