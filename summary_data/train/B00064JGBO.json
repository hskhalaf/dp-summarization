I recently purchased the two-pack expecting the same one as the picture advertised, but I received a different model. Instead of rubber grips and a narrow tip, the ones I just received has plastic grips and a wider tip. It feels cheaper and not as comfortable to use. Not sure if it is a newer/ older model or a knockoff. The only indication that it is \"Dr. Tung's\" is the little sticker on top of the box. Really disappointed and can't even make a return.",
