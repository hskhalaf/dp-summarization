There should be a way to override this. The manual does warn about the auto shut off, but it's kind of buried at the end of each cooking mode section, so it's easy to miss. The first time I used it for a long broth cook, I woke up to a warm pot. Fortunately, it had only shut off an hour prior, so I was able to save to pot of liquid gold! Just be sure to stop and restart the cooker before going to bed. Overall, great cooker.",

      "text": "My family and I have had a bunch of different slow cookers over the years. Most have been ok. Many have run too hot or too cold and ruined meals. This one is one of the best I have ever used. Cooks food consistently. The cooking probe is a god send. I have actually purchased two of these for special events I do. It is a fantastic product. Having the option to seal the top puts it in a league of its own. No more spilling soup or food all over yourself or car. I will definitely buy these for people as wedding gifts.",

I must say however there is a new oily electrical smell when cooking that I don't like. Even after multiple uses, I still smell it. Still though it cooks fine and does the job perfectly.

It can't be beat for creating tender meat vs. stovetop though.",

I really like the clips on the lid for carrying it without spilling. Also the probe is fantastic for roasts! For the price you aren't going to do better than this unit.",
