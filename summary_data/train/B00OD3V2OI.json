But I am unhappy with the widely-reported dimming clock feature. The clock is amply visible by day, but at night, when the lights are out, it's impossible to see the clock at all, because the brightness dims automatically, and so severely that the clock is no longer meaningfully illuminated.",

After jumping through many hoops with JBL, I returned the defective Horizon. Two weeks later I received a new unit. Guess what? It\u2019s defective too! The speaker sound quality is fine with FM radio, but garbled and full of static with any Bluetooth source. I have never encountered this problem with any other Bluetooth device.

(2) The buttons are horribly designed, you won't find them in the dark mornings, and they are tiny! ... Big flaw. (3) As stated elsewhere, you don't have full control of the alarm volumes. Sounds trivial, but turns out to be super annoying. I'm not bothering to have it fixed. Its just not worth putting up with this disappointing design. I don't recommend this unit.",
