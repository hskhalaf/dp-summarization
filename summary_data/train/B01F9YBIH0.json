Update - Within 24 hours of posting my review, I was contacted by the vendor and was given the choice of a full refund or a new product.

      "text": "We bought this so that we could check our Chico Keyfit infant carseat for a recent flight out of the country. It definitely did it's job and we were able to use our carseat without issue. I bought this item over others because of the padding, but honestly, I'm not sure how much protection it actually provided. That's ok though. It's durable and there's plenty of space to accommodate all types of carseats and even some room inside of the carseat to stuff extra items in (definitely came in handy on the flight back!). Overall, a good product. The only issue we're having now is storing it for future use since it's pretty big and bulky.",

My only suggestion would be for longer shoulder straps - my husband has broad shoulders and he found it s bit snug to fit.",

Arrived undamaged at each destination. The backpack straps made carrying a bulky and combersome item in and out of the airport a breeze. My nephew was a great car seat caddy!! :-P If you travel a lot - or even just a little - this bag is worth the money.",

It's held up extremely well, is padded, high quality and the back pack straps made our lives much easier when we were already struggling to managed to kids, two strollers, suitcases and pack n plays. I fully intend to purchase another to replace our other car seat cover! Highly recommend!",

With just the car seat alone in the bag, it made the bag floppy and awkward to carry, and it sunk down as the bottom of the bag is not hard.",
