There is plenty of space in the bag to make your own additions. Overall it's a great starter kit",

The stock that comes with the bag is acceptional for the price, however, you will need to purchase more supplies to have an adequate and efficient \"Trauma Bag\". I would recommend to line the bag with a dense material on the bottom and the sides, such as \"heavy duty\" Ramboard or cardboard. Right out of the box, it is a bit \"flimsy\", but as you build up your supplies You will begin to see the bag take a more firm shape. Overall, I would recommend this bag.",

However, it seems to be a bit short on some supplies: not enough Kling-type wraps, only one abdominal sized bandage and no sterile water or saline. Obviously, those are inexpensive items but seems like they would have been included. Plus, instead of wood or solid splints, it contained only one (I think) flexible splint.

However the bag is not for constant use. The bag seems to have cheap construction. If this bag is used on a daily basis I believe it will deteriorate quickly.
