There is supposed to be a red light that comes on to indicate when it is charging and it should stay red the entire time it is plugged in to charge. After approximately a month, the red light would only come on for less than a second when plugged in to the charger and then it would go back off again. So it wouldn't charge.",

The bass is a little much and I really have to turn the volume of my cell phone up pretty high to clearly hear the podcasts that I like listening to in the shower.

It will stay on the shower wall for a couple days, then fall off (sometimes in the middle of the night) which can be really frustrating and startling. At least it has a soft rubber shell so it takes a beating but it has fallen off the wall and glass door multiple times so that's why I'm giving it 3 stars.",

So it sits on a ledge or counter top but the case is very durable as it has fallen several times even into water and is still going strong.",
