      "text": "35 years as a machinist I had probable doubts. It is cheap but it worked well repairing a bad bore on an old cast steel rototiller head. It had a little chatter at first with .020 cuts but worked them out with shadow passes. The carbide tool itself has little wear as well. So for me, I'm happy as crap. It was done on a cheap mill too. Had to hand feed it. Good old enco mill. Very satisfied. But I can't yet claim joy yet with the accuracy because I haven't done anything that had to be accurate.",

      "text": "Came with case, wrenches, and wrapped in dragon lard... as expected I guess. As others have said, no flats on the actual boring bars is annoying buy fixable. There is a HUGE amount of backlash in the adjustment screw, so I have to work in small increments. I am hobby machinist, but this set seems to work well for me when I take my time. I have only worked small holes, and in aluminum. 4 stars might be generous... it gets that only because of the value, not because it's high end piece of tooling.",

Based on previous reviews, I milled flats on all of the boring bars to prevent them from binding in the head after tightening the set screws. It looks like the smallest hole you will be able to bore with the supplies bars is around .313\" (although I haven't tried one that small yet).",
