The new enemies were good and different but still held the connection with the original trilogy which was fantastic. The new crew seem interesting and I am eager to see where this will go. cant wait for the next instalment",

It's a nice and fun game (if you like the genre) but I'm finding the aiming a bit annoying (way to sensible in my opinion). Apart from that, the graphic is good and also gameplay is good. Download size is about 64GB which make this quite a heavy game. Recommended tho",
