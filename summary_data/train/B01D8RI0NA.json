One tip, if you're putting labels on, turn the container so the 'sprinkle' lid is in the upper right hand corner. This will keep very fine spices (baking soda, for example) from leaking out when on the steel base. Unfortunately, I discovered this after the fact - I just had to turn the culprits over, so the label now reads upside down, not a big deal.",

Perfect place for all 12! Looks good, and they shouldn't leak. Great space saver for tiny living. **Update** Nothing like Thanksgiving to test the kitchen. While doing some serious stovetop and oven cooking today, I realized the spice containers on the oven hood were getting really warm. I haven't filled them yet, so no spice damage. We moved them back to the fridge for now. May purchase a magnetic plate to wall mount somewhere, or just leave them on the fridge....",

However, I did just buy them again recently to add more and I've noticed the strength of the magnet is much weaker than the old ones. They totally still work and the magnet on the older ones is seriously so strong! But I'm wondering why these ones feel less magnetic... love this product!!!",

One for pouring, one for sprinkling. They dont open all the way up without being held back and the hinges are thin. I dont use them. I just take the lids off and scope out with my measuring spoons.

The two corners where they pour from don't have complete seals and due to that, I will occasionally find a little mess on the counter - usually caused by the removal, use, and replacement of neighboring jars. Just something to be aware of - but if the jars aren't full, there isn't an issue.",

Unfortunately, we were in the process of moving into a smaller place when I ordered these, so now that we are unpacking them and find they are faulty, it is too late to return them. Boo. If you are only going to use them for larger spices or something non-powdery -- and not finely ground spices -- they may work for you.

There are only 3 holes for the \"sprinkle\" side, so depending on what is in the container, you may not be able to effectively season without using the other side with the bigger opening. So far, so good.",

I didn't want to put it on my oven hood b/c I think it would get too warm. Plus they are easy to fill and there are corners on the lid that you can pop up to either pour or sprinkle the spice while cooking.",

The cloves eat away at it, so I had to transfer them to a glass jar. Other than that, I've had no problems, and would definitely buy more.",
