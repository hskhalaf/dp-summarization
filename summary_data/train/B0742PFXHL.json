My only complaint is that it doesn\u2019t have a place to tie a rope to to keep it from drifting away when not using it. UPDATE - The seam where the flap/lid is attached to the raft tore and therefore opened up the raft with an unrepairable hole. This is a very poor design of attaching the lid/flap in this way and this inflatable is now heading to the garbage. Disappointed that this could not be repaired due to the area of the hole which is created specifically due to the design of the lid/flap attachment.",
