      "text": "Only complaint is the closure. First of all, if something has a velcro closure, the velcro should extend the entire length of the strap to allow for the ability to adjust tightness as much as possible. When pulling the straps as tightly as I would like them, there is only a small part of the velcro that overlaps to secure them (picture #1). Most of the velcro is not used which means that snow collects in the velcro which eventually loosens the part that is velcroed together. An elastic adjustable drawcord would be much more effective (picture #2).",

I could not get my son's foot all the way down into the shoe, no matter how I tried. His heel just wouldn't reach the bottom. If the makers of this boot allowed for the boot to be zipped closed or something like that, it might have been easier to get his food in them. So, if your toddler has wide feet and/or their feet are still round in any way, DO NOT buy these.",

Easy for me to slide over pant bottom to keep snow out. He has skinny legs and feet so i wish the velcro would be allow us to tighten a bit more snug, but it hasnt been an issue so i guess its just a preference.",

Not at all!! Fits just right! Other reviews I read before I purchased said to order a size up, and I now agree! From my experience, order a size bigger than your child's current size.",
