This company has other hot sauces that are more in depth in the ingredients. Zombie Cajun is by far my favorite hot sauce in the industry. Ot all has great flavor. 5 stars across the board!!!!",

Bottles 5-10 are all still very liquidy, but better, more consistent with normal hot sauces. Frankly the flavors aren't particularly good. It's heat for heat sake. That, and the scovile units reported are not even close to accurate. The 8th sauce is the hottest, by a lot.",

The only complaint is that I am dumb enough to do the challenge and face the repercussions not once, but twice. Body went numb and started to drool and everything. Would recommend to everyone though",
