The little bright light that turns on once you switch the epilator on makes ALL the difference! I didn't even realize how important it is until I tried another brand without one. The light lets you spot tiny little hairs you wouldn't otherwise see. The cord is super long so it doesn't bother me that it's not a chargeable one. I'll probably never go for another brand again. Then again I probably don't have to in a long time if this lasts as long as my last one did :)",

If I'm good about epilating every 5-7 days then it is far less uncomfortable and less irritating. I am thrilled that his epilator comes with a shaver head, which is excellent for the bikini area, which is way too sensitive for me to epilate, or for when I am short on time or don't want a plucked chicken look.",

      "text": "This little machine is amazing. I hadn't touched my leg hairs in months (winter time in NYC) and it took me about 20-25 minutes on each leg on the slower speed, which I think is an acceptable amount of time. Yes, it hurts but you get used to it quickly, especially if you're used to waxing, which I am. It was very clean and easy to use. Overall, I very much recommend this product!! I LOVE IT",

Of course I wanted to send it back but the return policy ended August 4, 2019. How convenient for the manufacturer. What a waste of $70.00! This company should be ashamed of themselves!",

The hair grow is soft and and gentle and no more scars/cuts of the razor. I shave my legs weekly using this product just because I wear dresses everyday and like my legs to be clean and smooth.",
