Just a little air seepage out of the main valve, but nothing dangerous or deal-breaking. These things are never perfect, but so far it is holding up great and we are having a fun time in the lake with it.",

It may have just been temperature difference making it not as pressurized but I think it had a pinhole leak. Also doesn't come with oars like I expected. But to be fair it doesn't say it does.

Also, it can be easy to lose the oars as there is no catch to keep them there. It is better as a flotation device in a lake with no current, or in a pool. Because it is so wide, and the bottom is not flat and sturdy, you can get swept out by a current, and you will have difficulty rowing back into shore. Definitely not for unsupervised children.",
