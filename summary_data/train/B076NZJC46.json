I have pushed down on tool grade steel at 2\" thick, ground it red hot and disk stayed true, used as stationary grinding wheel to cut odd corners and the wheel produced required results. dropped my grinder on the table when switching tools and the wheel broke through its connection point. they are quite thin and i believe this wasn't a design flaw as much as careless handling on my part. i will buy these again",

Wheel will flex when hard pressure is put on it without breaking which is great. Always wear a face shield when using a grinder to protect from flying dust and debris and in case wheel does break!",
