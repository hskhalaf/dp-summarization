The globe is well balanced- won't tip over easily- and is evenly lighted (with 4 AA batteries). It is well detailed and even has a legend! The frame is plastic- I hope it holds up or we will end up with a detached globe soccer ball! Overall great little globe for learning geography!",

The glow feature is great. The only reason for the 4 star vs 5 star is because it runs only on 4 AA batteries. It was be greatly improved by adding a way to plug in for power. I'll update if the batteries drain quickly or if anything otherwise changes my positive opinion of this product.",
