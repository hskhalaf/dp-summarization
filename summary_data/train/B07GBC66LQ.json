I've changed many, many tires in my decades of cycling and have never had to go through three (hopefully just three) tubes to get the tire on the rim. This difficulty would be easier to stomach in a high-end racing tire -- it's unacceptable in a mid-grade recreational tire. I would have returned them if I had not trashed the packaging getting the tires out. If you are OK with a mid-grade recreational tire, I recommend you choose a different tire that doesn't have the installation issues.",
