Recently bought attachment to run off larger tank so that issue is taken care of. Next issue was the smoke wood chips. They seemed to run out sooner than what I hoped they would so I purchased separate wood chip holder and that takes care of that issue. All in all I am very satisfied with this product and I sure like the portability and ease of use to use at home or tailgating or camping. Very satisfied with my new smoker.",

The temperature was pretty easy to keep track of (has a display on the front)and stayed pretty steady for the whole cooking time. I do recommend upgrading to a full size propane tank and nozzle, it takes 2 of the small ones to smoke meat for a full 8 hours. You have to remember to keep checking it otherwise. Its small, but big enough to accommodate a whole pork and a rack of ribs.",

Be advised, that this smoker does not have a \"door seal\", so smoke containment, could be an issue.",
