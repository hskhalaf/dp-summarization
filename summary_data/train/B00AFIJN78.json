Trying to take the 3g sch5 sanitary weld test you need to see the seam you are welding and the puddle, using this hood depending on how you turn your head it goes from light to dark to light. Luckily i had my old school fixed lens #9 helmet with me, saved the day.",

      "text": "just started hobby MIG welding (with a Hobart 140) and this helmet is great. Fits well, great field of visibility and easy settings for darkness, delay, etc. I would suggest wearing some other type of hat/head covering under this as you will get a random spark/metal spray on the back of your head every now and then. If your sight is not all that great or you just want a little help seeing in the dark environment, I would also suggest that you buy some magnifier lens. I put a Hobart 770276 200x in mine and it really helped.",

But the real deal, how it does to the arc, its instant,you can control the speed (delay) and how sensitive it is to the surrounding light and what triggers its response. The only flaw is i think it should 4 sensors because sometimes it doesnt catch all the arc and it doesnt react if your turned sightly!",
