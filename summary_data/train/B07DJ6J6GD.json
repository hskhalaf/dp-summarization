The time to assemble wasn't bad and the instructions were easy to understand (I'd recommend you watch the YouTube video 1st). Another piece of advice; do not tighten screws with allan key until you have put together the whole set. That way if you make a mistake you can quickly remove a screw. I wouldn't store this set outside either. Keep it in the garage or indoors when not in use and handle it very gently when sitting on it. The cushion isn't the best so you can purchase one for a better experience.",

Second, if you live anywhere that has gusts of wind over 1mph, you can kiss your seat cushions goodbye. They\u2019ll takeoff faster than a 747 never to be seen again. Third, good luck aligning parts to the appropriate holes. Save your money and buy one of the many more expensive, more reliable, and sturdier alternatives.",

Both husband and friends say the chair wouldn\u2019t be as comfy if I didn\u2019t add throw pillows, so those are definitely recommended.

I think overtime I may replace the cushions for thicker padding and add some throw pillows for decoration, but I do not mind how they look and feel currently. :)",
