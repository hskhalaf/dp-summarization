The reason is because there is only one cold feed for - both hot & cold into the faucet, so you would be chilling the water that goes into the hot water tank also (thereby making it work harder, and have a slower recovery time). They have another model (2 handles) that accommodates that (having separate feeds into the faucet. You also have to push the handle - 'downward' before you can direct it to hot 'or' cold.",

You have to push the lever down to turn on the hot water. The under cabinet heater was easy to install and didn't take up too much space. The best thing for us is the convenience of having the filtered insta-hot and cold water but we also like the look of the faucet because it matches our main sink faucet. That being said, this fixture is larger than most other standard fixtures.",
