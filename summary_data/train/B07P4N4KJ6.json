The unit feels secure on the bike with the supplied zip ties and I like how it also comes with rubber backings for both the sensor and the speedometer itself. The multitude of functions are really nice - including the ambient temperature. I'm really going to enjoy having this accessory on my bike!",

The instructions said have it be 1.5 - 3 MM from the magnet and that was impossible. After watching the video again, I spaced it about 1\" (2.5 CM) from the magnet as indicated in the video, and it works perfectly. I think the instructions got CM and MM mixed up and that caused a lot of confusion. As indicated in other videos, I \"walked the tire\" to get the exact circumference to enter the correct settings and tested the odometer with my car and they are exact.",
