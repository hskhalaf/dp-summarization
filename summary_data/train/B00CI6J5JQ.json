But the best selling point is that the kids actually put their stuff away; we no longer have tons of broken crayons swimming around the bottom of a craft bucket and during art, the desired color is always super easy to find.

      "text": "Uhhh this package was stolen from me so I had to go and purchase it from Walmart (since it was a Christmas gift). Not going to lie - my nephew wanted a video game or something more, so he kind of just tossed the thing aside when he opened it. However, he does love art and has gotten a lot of use out of it. It's not like one of the art kits where half of the things inside - like the markers, colored pencils, etc, don't work and you have to throw them away. This is Crayola we're talking about. All the included supplies are high quality.",

I bought her a coloring book which fit inside it easily (it's a big one) and kinda helped keeping the smaller papers, originally with the case, in place. Product enhancements would be to round the corners of the thing (had an owie incident) and to maybe to a simple lid solution for the papers inside.",

The cardboard case last roughly 30 days before it began falling apart. Pretty disappointing :(",
