This has made the entire thing useless because it's impossible to manually move the tabs while the motor is on the mount. Otherwise i had been satisfied with it. It worked great for use on my private pond. It does get caught up on weeds/algae very easy but the weed button or some clever throttle management and movements breaks it loose quickly.",

The MAX lasted through a lake fishing/camping trip over the weekend on one battery. Trolling the whooole weekend. Plus, it had 45lb thrust which helped me \"plow\" through the sheet of ice on top of the water. Moral of the story is.. if your going to drop $100+ on a trolling motor, then get best for a few more bucks!",

First thing I did was get a test light and checked power at the main board and there was none. It turns out it was just a poor solder job. I ended up just squeezing the connector on the battery clip and it works perfect. I will most likely be getting new clips for piece of mind but it was such a simple fix.",

This extremely quiet motor has a digital maximizer control module and water cooling system that supply only the necessary power this motor needs in order to go the desired speed making the motor more efficient and providing longer running times.

Adjustable handle: Handle tilts upward: 45, 30, 15, 0 degrees . Handle tilts downward: 0 - 75 degrees. Handles extends 6 inches (15cm). Handle speed control: Forward: 5 speeds, OFF, Reverse: 3 speeds. Permanent magnet motor: Digital maximizer control module. Water cooling system.
