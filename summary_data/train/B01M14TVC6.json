It seems a bit counter-intuitive, but I was surprised at how little effort it takes. I actually thought it wasn't working, removed it from the container and found the lid was loosened - on both the jam and dressing jars. It's mechanical so no batteries - a plus.

I read reviews of this and other products like strap wrenches and this seemed a good mix of function and price. It works well so far. I had to wait to use it until I bought a bottle of apple juice and it worked perfectly. It has an adjustable gripper that opens or closes to fit the jar lid or bottle top and takes little turning strength to break the seal. I would recommend it without hesitation.",

      "text": "I have had arthritis in my hands for about 25 years. I had been able to open jars with a rubber square up until recently. I saw this jar opener advertised and thought I would give it a try. It works extremely well. I actually was able to finally open a jar of salsa which I had bought a couple of months ago. The little bottle opener also works on the jar by lifting it up slightly and allowing some air in the jar and then opens easily. It was very affordable too!",
