I would absolutely recommend this to someone who wants to get into photography, but doesn't want to spend money on a full blown Cannon/Nikon DSLR. This is a perfect entry level DSLR that allows you to utilize full manual capabilities. I've not owned this camera for over 4 years and after MUCH abuse, it still works great!",

      "text": "This camera has exceeded my expectations. Having owned many 35mm and digital cameras, I was looking for one with excellent resolution, a powerful zoom without having to change lenses, and ease of use, along with the ability to have full creative control. Battery life is good and, with the 2 gig memory card installed, it will take hundreds of high resolution pictures. The menus are easy to use and follow and I was up and running after only a short review of the instruction manual. This camera is an excellent choice for someone who wants something better than a snapshot camera but who doesn't want to go the digital SLR route. It is highly recommended.",

      "text": "The Sony H5/7.2 12X is a great camera if you understand alittle about regular 35mm photography, if not the instructions can be confusing.The zoom of 12X is wonderful for long distant photos.My only reason for not rating the camera 5 stars is, the battery life [2AA] is extremely short if you use all the camera menu options and also the camera is bulky and heavy. This is not snap shot camera, hence the reason for two cameras. Picture quality is great, especially with all options for speed,portraits,night shots etc. Love it if I have pocket full of batteries.",

Now the exact same problem has reoccurred and Sony wants $171.00 to fix it. I'd save my money or buy a Nikon or Canon. If you'll notice this is not the only review that mentions this problem.",

I can hardly find any big difference in both of them. any way as having a bigger LCD screen it suits to my vision. I feel it is more suitable for out door shooting.

For normal people who don't need top notch pictures, this is the best choice. Downside with this camera is the battery life. The specification states 340 pictures per charge (2600mAH battery coming with the camera). However, my experience shows that it only last about 200 pictures. Still not too bad. With a pair of spare, 400 for a day trip is quite enough for normal application. Just think twice before pressing the shutter button. Also, the provided separate charge let you charge extra pairs of battery while you are using the camera.",

PROS: Huge 3\" screen, lots of options, 12X Zoom, great looking camera, best camera software I've ever seen, ability to locate your pictures on a map with additional $100 GPS indicator (search for Sony GPS-CS1). CONS: There is a lot of button clutter (at first you accidently hit different command & function buttons when shooting with the camera), It won't fit in your pocket.",
