These arrived and had a definite sand-cast appearance where you can see the grains of sand from the mold. The main difference, and the reason I find this unacceptable is that cast metal is brittle and forged metal is very strong. The description of the item (Franklin Sports Horseshoe Set - in case this review shows up for something else) very clearly promises \"forged\" horseshoes. I have given them an overall rating of two stars because none of the shoes have broken - yet.",
