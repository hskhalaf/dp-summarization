I use this hub connected to one of the monitor ports to connect my legacy devices. So this hub is daisy-chained through another hub. I know you aren't supposed to do this, but I wanted to be able to unplug just a single cable when I took my MacBook away from my desk. In spite of the daisy chained connection, this hub works great. It's able to work with medium-power devices such as my DVD drive. It is small, light weight, and reasonably priced. Highly recommended!",

Thanksfully the low 900mA power on the hub does not worry me much and have not had any power-based issues so far. I am amazed at how small and portable it is.. and how sleek it looks. I can surely recommend this little hub to use that then-useless type-C connector, especially if it's on sale",

I ended up buying a powered USB hub for more stable data transfer and more ports. Unfortunately this item is ineligible for returns and I am out 15$ plus tax. The cord is also very short. I recommend buying something else Update: After writing this review aukey messaged me and sent another unit. Much better performance this time. Very happy with their customer service would recommend buying from this brand",
