Well, M & D this is one of the very few things I am totally disappointed in. The gems don\u2019t fit in the slot, only the coins. I bought other gems/coins for a fraction of the price to use with it. Then the chest takes in water and sinks. So if you are looking for a complete dive kit, you are in luck. If you are looking for a floatable receptacle to put the gems/coins in, keep on trucking. The description is deceiving. M & D you can do better than this toy.",

Nope ! Because of the coin colors it\u2019s really hard to see in the water. ( My pool is very clean ) And like I mentioned, the treasure chest sunk within a minute! I mean it was super fast and it was under water. Why advertise something that is not true?!? Don\u2019t waste your money !",

      "text": "My 4 year old recently got into diving to the bottom of the pool and he loves this toy. We have to bring it every time we go swimming. The treasure chest sort of floats but if water gets in it will sink after a while. The coins are more difficult to see under water than most dive rings or sticks and they are harder to grab but my son can still get them on his own. It is nice to have variety for dive toys. Sometimes he plays with it out of the water too.",

My 14- month old & 3 year old loved playing with the jewels, coins, & treasure box and the older kids loved searching and diving for them ( it also has suggested games for them included with the toy that were fun). Planning to buy another to have this summer since we have played with this outside of the water at home & have misplaced some of the coins & jewels.",
