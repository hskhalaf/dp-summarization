I returned both carseats and got another Graco 4ever DLX. I do not recommend this carseat for lack of safety features and cleanliness. Mother of 3 under 5 here, take my word for it!",

I would not use this convertible (or any other) for an infant: I had my babies in bucket seats until they were 10-12 months -- it was cozier and more maneuverable.

It's not narrow, so the wideness is the only reason I wouldn't suggest this. (We have 5 kids, so fitting multiple car seats has been an issue at times in our life!) I really like this.

    "description": "Color:OlympusThe Evenflo EveryFit 4-In-1 Convertible Car Seat has been engineered for maximum comfort, safety, and longevity. The EveryFit accommodates your child by adjusting to multiple positions, allowing kids to ride rear-facing beyond 2 years of age\u2014without extending the seat or cramping other passengers. This all-in-one car seat provides a safe and secure ride for up to a decade. Parents and grandparents love how easy it is to use the quick and secure SureSafe Installation System. SureSafe includes easy to use connectors and a set of LATCH guides\u2013 which improves proper installation by 2X (compared to standard LATCH installations). It can be used as a rear-facing car seat with harness, forward-facing car seat with harness, belt-positioning high-back booster, and no-back booster that helps keep children 4 - 120 lb secure while riding in a vehicle. The EveryFit meets or exceeds all applicable federal safety standards and Evenflo\u2019s side impact standard, with advanced side impact protection that reduces crash forces up to 30%. It is designed and tested for structural integrity at energy levels approximately 2X the federal crash test standard. Evenflo works with parents to develop child-safety products that are designed for how they are actually used. We\u2019ve developed this 4-in-1 car seat with comfort, safety and ease-of-use in mind. The one-hand, 12-position headrest and no-rethread harness enable a proper fit during each ride and as child grows \u2013 without uninstalling the car seat. For additional convenience, this all-in-one car seat is designed with removable cushions, machine-washable fabrics, two integrated cup holders with removable snack tray.\n\nFor 100 years, Evenflo has been a trusted source of precision-manufactured, high-quality children products that are engineered for real-life situations.
