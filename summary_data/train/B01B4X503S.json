Even the app being able to restart the router with out even leaving my chair!, I have so much more to say but don't have time as I'm at work, hope this helps.",

Very happy with router now and know there's a lot more under the hood it will run ,,extras like port forwarding ,VPN , good value .I will say the browser tool is a bit slow on opening",

My local backup speeds have almost tripled to 600Mbps when compared with my old NAS. It is also a very good media server as well as a home file server. The wifi is noticibly better even with older devices but I would not buy this router just for its wifi capability. The Plex capability works but too slow.

Router placement really makes a difference, so if your not getting good coverage move your router. Even a few inches can help, but don\u2019t expect good coverage of your router is behind your TV. If a router isn\u2019t visible then you\u2019re not going to get a good signal, it\u2019s that simple. The app is easy to use, router took 5 mins to set up using my virgin hub as the modem. Speeds are the exceeding the suggested maximum speeds from virgin so am a very happy customer.",

The only way to resolve this was to reset the device back to factory settings and reconfigure the unit. This took several attempts before it became stable and usable. This lasted 48 hours and the fault developed again. Up to thi shappening the unit was very reliable and have a good range and performance.",
