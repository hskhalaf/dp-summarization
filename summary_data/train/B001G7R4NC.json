    "description": "Highly versatile laser receiver for basic and advanced leveling and aligning applications\n\nThe Spectra Precision HL700 Laserometer, a highly versatile laser receiver for basic and advanced leveling and aligning applications, is designed for general, concrete and site preparation contractors. The HL700 Laser Receiver is an easy-to-use tool that accurately measures elevations across the site, and is ideal for use with any rotating transmitter.\n\n\n\nThe HL700 Laser Receiver features a digital readout of elevation that provides a numeric display of +/- 5 cm (+/- 2 inches). The readout is displayed on the large front and rear LCD's and shows exactly how far the elevation is from on-grade. Accurate measurements can be made without moving the rod clamp, saving time and increasing productivity. Selectable units of measure can be displayed meeting your application - mm, cm, ft, in or fractional inches.\n\n\n\nA 12.7 cm (5 inch) reception height, more than double the industry standard, allows quick acquisition of the laser beam. An anti-strobe sensor prevents false readings from site strobe lights.\n\n\n\nThe Laserometer is designed to survive the tough construction site conditions; it is totally waterproof and can withstand a drop of 3 meters (10 feet) onto concrete. The HL700 offers a 3-year \"No Excuses\" warranty.\n\n\n\nThe HL700 can be used as either a hand-held or rod mounted receiver for a wide range of applications.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe new Spectra Precision Laser HL700 Laserometer features digital readout of elevation. Large sensing range and anti-strobe sensor, the Spectra Precision Laser HL700 Laserometer features a digital readout of elevation that provides a numeric display of \u00b1 2 inches (\u00b15 cm). The readout is displayed on the large front and rear LCD\u2019s and shows exactly how far the elevation is from on-grade. Accurate measurements can be made without moving the rod clamp, saving time and increasing productivity. The HL700 has a 5 inch (12.7 cm) reception height, more than double the industry standard, which allows quick acquisition of the laser beam. Also included is a patented anti-strobe sensor that prevents construction lights from giving faulty signals and makes it easier to identify the laser beam signals. The Laserometer is designed to survive the tough construction site conditions. It is totally waterproof and can withstand a drop of 10 feet (3 meters) onto concrete. Highly visible LED\u2019s on the front show red for high and low and green for on-grade. The HL700 can be used as either a hand-held or rod mounted receiver for a wide range of applications.",
