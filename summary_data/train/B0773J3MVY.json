In terms of effectiveness, these are strong, seems accurate that they not only freshen the car up, but actually eliminate/suppress odors. The little lever/fan louver to control intensity does not really have an off position, even when closed completely it's basically...fairly strong. Open all the way, VERY strong...it's like somebody doused you and the car with half a bottle of fabreze kinda strong. Not so much a complaint because the scents are quite good, but subtle and controllable...these are not. Even with the fans on low in the car.",

I like the multipack to save a little bit then my wife steals some from me for her car because of how well they work. Great product that does what it advertises!
