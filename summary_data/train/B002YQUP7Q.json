My biggest issue with this bar is that it has been deflecting more and more since I purchased it (See photos for reference).

      "text": "I used to have one of these a few years ago and gave it away when I moved. With gyms closed, because of the pandemic, I needed a bar to continue my workouts. The delivery came within a couple days. I was able to put it together in less than an hour. Of the 5 door frames I have in my apartment, it only fit on one though. Keep that in mind when purchasing and check if you think you'll have enough clearance on all side (left, right and top). It feels sturdy being 160lbs. I put a small thin towel under the foam mounts, so it doesn't leave a mark in the wall,.",

About 5 inches from door trim to ceiling. With this pull up bar I get a clearance of 11 to 12 inches. (More then enough for my big noggin.) so I have 4 stars on the easy set up. Not five because they could have added a bolt or two in the middle instead of the \u201ctwist\u201d locking feature. Hope this helps anyone looking at this product.",
