      "text": "This Hand Truck is complete junk, very flimsy, and NOT rated properly. Right out of the box I was suspicious due to the very thin aluminum construction, small support frame, and very flimsy plastic handles. I confirmed the rating sticker on the cart showed a 800 lb capacity in hand truck mode and 1000 lb capacity in cart mode. I moved a gun safe, well under the 1000 lb rating using the hand truck in cart mode as recommended. The small caster wheels buckled, the frame supports bent, the wheel supports bent, and the rivets snapped. This cart is not engineered properly and will get somebody hurt if moving anything heavy. This is going back after just one use!",

It's a great looking design, sure, which is why I bought it, but it doesn't take the weight. Very thin aluminum. My advice is to buy a steel hand truck. I'm on my 4th hand truck now and have learned that lesson well. Go with steel.",

I suggest making sure you hold heavy items against the frame (pulling back on the item, not the handles when you are leaning back in the 2 wheel mode). The wheels are solid, yet it seems very much like air tires for smooth rolling. I would be wary of using this with truly heavy loads (like near the max listed). Being aluminum is great for being lighter weight, but will more likely fracture if over stressed.",
