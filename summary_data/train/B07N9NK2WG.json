One of the instructions for henna is to use a shampoo without sulfates to protect the hair and the color. I felt like this one was a great investment since it came with conditioner as well. I have to say, I'm pretty impressed. A little color bleed is normal when using red dye, but it's significantly less bleed when I use this shampoo. So far the deepness of the color appears to be lasting longer which will save me some effort to re-dye my hair more frequently. My hair comes out very soft too!",
