I decided to try it for my husband. He likes that it is rugged but still a smartphone. It can definitely take a beating and it even takes photos underwater! Very happy with the purchase and happy with how easy it was to get activated. We bought a SIM card from ebay and activated it over the phone with Sprint.",
