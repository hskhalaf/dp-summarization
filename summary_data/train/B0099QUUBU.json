The software is not that easy to use and it is quite hard to get a good picture to really be able to get the most out of the aperture/depth of field and focus settings on the software. Major adjustments and functions from the software are only available for the new mirrorless-style Lytro camera. Good for experimenting and trying something new. Not functional as an all around camera.",

Easy to work with using their software, just point and shoot and you get the varying focus sort of photo that this is made to take. Photos are good quality on a computer screen/in a webpage, which is how the service seems to be intended to work. I don't think the 'limited' resolution is much of a big deal if you're not projecting onto a giant wall.",

The actual execution and final product is disappointing. The quality of the images is poor at best, and really takes away from the experience.

It didn't take me long to have problems with firmware/software issues. Right now, I can't access any new photos on the camera because the software doesn't sense that it is connected to my computer. Also, the software will not install on 32 bit systems or iPad 2 or less. When it all works, it's brilliant.",

Taking light field photos is fun, but the first gen's small image size and image quality leave a but to be desired. Even in optimal conditions photos aren't as sharp as I'd like. As others have said, you definitely need to compose your photos and take foreground/background objects into consideration for the best results. The Lytro Illum, Lytro's second generation camera, takes MUCH better photos but comes and a premium price. Hopefully in a few years those will become more affordable as well, as light field photography really does feel like technology from the future.",

If you are serious about photography however, you will be very disappointed with the image quality of the photos. The camera itself is built very well and is easy to use. After shooting a few hundred pictures with it, I consider it more of a toy than a camera. It should probably be priced more in the $125 range than $499. Hopefully the image quality will improve through software upgrades and someday it may be a great product.",

Maybe it's a useless piece of hazardous waste for some, because 1) you need a Win 64 bit machine to run it 2) it doesn't run until you download the old software version, update the firmware, etc. 3) The resolution is really poor 4) processing the images or even downloading them from the camera takes forever",

The software doesn't work on my mac so I cant transfer any photos and the app crashes everytime I try to connect to the camera and transfer images. All in all it amounts to a whole lot of nothing. Really sad. Ultimately I returned it because I couldn't do anything with it.",

He liked the concept of the photo not having to be in focus, but overall, he didn't think the camera was worth the money being charged. He said the pictures are way too small and the camera doesn't work when taking photos of a moving subject. The recipient has other, better-quality (granted, it's bigger) camera equipment, and decided the Lytro wasn't something he wanted, after all.",

    "title": "Lytro Light Field Camera, 16GB, Red Hot",
    "description": "Size:16 GB| Color:Red HotThe Lytro camera is the first consumer camera that records the entire light field-all the rays of light traveling in every direction through a scene-instead of a flat 2D image. Shoot first, focus later By capturing the light field, you can do incredible things. Like refocus pictures after you take them. This also means that the Lytro camera has no autofocus-and none of the shutter delay that comes with it. Do more than tell a story. Recreate it. Refocus to discover new elements within the scene and move the picture in any direction to change your point of view with Perspective Shift. Use Living Filters to create a unique look. Now every picture you take is a chance to tell a new kind of story. Grip Made from precision-tooled silicone, the grip is easy to hold. Shutter Button The Lytro camera has no auto-focus - and none of the shutter delay that comes with it. Lens An 8x optical zoom lens with a constant f/2 aperture offers a wide range of creative shots. Touchscreen You control most of the camera functions with a tap or a swipe. And the backlit display lets you compose, review, and refocus your pictures. Light field sensor We joined a micro-lens array to a digital image sensor to capture the color, intensity, and direction of light entering the camera - 11 million light rays to be precise. Light field engine The light field engine processes the light rays captured by the sensor, so you can view pictures on the screen and refocus them with a tap.
