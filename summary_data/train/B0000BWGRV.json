The paint will burn off almost immediately so don't expect it to last. I am going try painting it again with a quality high temp paint. The regulator seems a little cheap but functional. Really can't complain too much, it worked as it should. Not sure how durable it will be in the long run but I am not going to be using it all that much. I would say it's average china quality.",

We were worried that it would be hard to regulate the temperature for best frying, but our fears turned out to be groundless. There is a regulator to use for that and it worked awesomely. It was a breeze to clean as well. We purchased this so that we could enjoy fried foods without having our kitchen and home smell like a local diner. This is a great buy for frying chicken, seafood - you name it. (Except turkeys of course as this is not a turkey fryer). The one and only reason I gave this 4 stars is that it does not come with a lid.",
