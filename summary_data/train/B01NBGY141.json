I would estimate the downward force on the stopper to be far less than an ounce and insufficient to force stopper to occlude the drain hole. Sad, because during its brief utility it handily surpassed my previous version (with the spout).",

It actually motivates me to make my own chicken stock more frequently, since I get to use little Miss Best 4 Cup every time. Effortless to use & easy to clean. I didn't assign a durability rating since I've only had mine for about six months. So far, so great!",
