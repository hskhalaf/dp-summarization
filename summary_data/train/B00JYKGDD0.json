Small plastic bar over the volume buttons cracked at roughly 1 year and shortly after fell off in my pocket. Small cracks starting appearing in year 2. Cracks keep getting bigger even tho the phone has - never - been dropped. Case fits well and is slim enough. It doesn't snag in any of my pockets. Color has kept its integrity. I think the case is better than many but not a top tier product. Price is tolerable but not great.",

The finish of the hard plastic portion was far too slick/smooth for me and in my opinion definitely needs some surface texture similar to what you find on an Otterbox Commuter. I tried lightly rubbing the the smooth plastic part of the case with steel wool to provide grip, only to discover how thin the color coat was. I bought the Otterbox through Amazon to replace the LUVVITT case.",

While it is fairly durable and sturdy (I guess depending on both user AND usage), I am not 100% confident it will protect my phone entirely if dropped on a hard, solid surface. The texture may seem slippery for some and the color coating did start rubbing off after a long while, albeit most likely due to normal wear-and-tear. I would recommend this case for \"careful\" cell phone owners... but not those who, like me, tend to be a little \"less careful\".",

I purchased this with screen protectors from amFilm (Premium HD) which are amazingly clear and easy to install without dust or bubbles. They also reduce finger print issues and clean with a simple damp cloth. The only complaint I have with the LUVVITT armor is that the rubber base case is a bit sloppy at the bottom. I will be surprised if it last more than a couple of months before it begins to sag from the \"when new\" snug fit.",

They align well with the phone. The cutout for the fingerprint reader is well made as well. This feature is important to me since I use the reader often.

      "text": "This cover fits like a glove and it's thin and the blue is a great color. I think it provides really good coverage. I've dropped my pone a few times and it lives on. Know it's not like an Otterbox. It's not that heavy duty but that's why it feels great and is not so bulky. The materials are kind of stiff and won't rip like the rubber on other cell phone covers I've had. And if I have to take it off, I can. I don't have to go thru changes to get it off. Great product.",

      "text": "I've always turned to Spigen for my phone cases, but after buying the new iPhone 6, I've heard some bad things about how their iPhone 6 cases would crack and fall apart. So I took a chance buying this case and am glad I did. The quality feels nice, snug, and sturdy. The back finish is a smooth matte so it doesn't scratch if it were glossy which is practical. The buttons work flawlessly and the bottom is just thin enough to dock the phone. I don't expect this case to protect my phone if I threw it in the air, but it should be alright if it slips out of my hand at waist level.",

Everything is accessible and the case feels comfortable in my hand. The phone is so light weight that I always felt like it was very fragile. The case adds some nice weight to it without being bulky.
