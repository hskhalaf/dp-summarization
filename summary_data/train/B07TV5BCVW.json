However, I am unable to connect with Bluetooth so it's totally unusable. The regular method used to connect any other Bluetooth device doesn't work. The directions in the manual are terrible and make no sense. The instruction video on YouTube describes a method that also does not work. I guess it's time to return it.",

When unfolded, it's a selfie-stick with remote shutter control, but it's also a table-top or free-standing tripod base with detachable remote--great for those Zoom meetings and group shots with YOU in the picture as well. It's a little more costly than some of the others, but IMO it's the best design and best-looking (I got the one with blue trim to match my phone). Besides being one of the slimmest designs, it is also more stable than others due to the braces on the legs. Highly recommended.",

But now we can prop it up out of reach but close for calls. I really like how the stick folds up onto a light cylinder. Remote is easy to pair and use too which we have used for family photos.

Bluetooth connectivity is great and useful since my phone doesn't have a 3mm jack. It might be a bit tricky to extend and open up the stand, so be careful with it the first time.

If I were Atumtek, I would take this design and make it entirely out of machined aluminum and charge a lot more for it. Overall a nice design and a good price.",

I use it to take large group photos as well as up close selfies. The remote is detachable so that he can be in the group picture. You do not have to point the remote at the tripod for it to work. Tripod holds my iPhone 11 with no problem.",

You can set up the shot and take the pic completely hands free from your phone. Or take video, completely hands free. I originally bought this simply because I\u2019m a small woman and my arms aren\u2019t really long enough to get a good selfie, but I was amazed by the quality and versatility of this product. I highly recommend.",

It was very hard to open and does not open enough for big phones easily (especially the Samsung Note). Also, the phone tilts slightly due to it's weight. I did not mind that part because a lot of other tripods had this problem too and I'm not a professional photographer. So if you're a perfectionist with a big/heavy phone, this might not work for you.",
