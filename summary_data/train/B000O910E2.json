The smaller pieces were difficult to disconnect. I had difficulty \"playing\" the enclosed Teacher's Guide DVD. It's actually a digital text that would only load on one of my several devices.",

Of course, we are that homeschooling family that throws away the Lego set instructions... so if you want explicit and simple written (as opposed to visual) instructions, Knex might be get little frustrating. For us, they're a wonderful challenge!",
