      "text": "This is my most regrettable amazon purchase in the past year. Really, do yourself a favor and just buy something else. The wireless technology used by these headphones is terrible for an office environment (I can only get clear audio out of the left or right channel, but not both). Worse than that though, is when all audio stops playing for 1 minute, a loud blast of static comes through the headphones, and stays on until audio starts playing. Absolutely horrible listening experience. I'd rather use apple earbuds than these. Seriously. And that's after almost a year of everyday use. Hopefully, I can still get a few bucks for this thing on Craigslist.",

Very easy operation, there\u2019s a physical switch for power and a scroll wheel for volume, which is essential when shopping for someone who isn\u2019t great with little buttons so big plus there. They sound pretty good, perfect for tv but wouldn\u2019t recommend for music. When he\u2019s done watching tv all he does is put them back on its stand and they start charging and ready for the next day. Highly recommend for anyone buying for parents/grandparents.",

After they fall a couple of times, the plastic that comprises a majority of the frame is so weak at the earpiece connection that they snap off. Mine are now superglued and duct taped together.

It's not really a deal breaker if your only intention is to watch TV or something without disturbing others, but when it comes to more serious applications such as listening to Music... well, it's not exactly a bell ringer.

You would be better off just buying the cheapest no name brand because that is what these are but your paying a premium for the brand name.

Otherwise, these are a great way to listen to a program, at the volume you like, and not disturb those in close proximity. Walk around (within 30 ft in my case) and do things and hear your program uninterrupted.",

Another pair were sent immediately, but they came straight out of the box with the same exact promblem the first set had and we could not get them to work.

It\u2019s bulky, though, and not as comfortable as AirPods or Sony Bluetooth headphones. I can\u2019t turn my head as I recline on my big couch! Can\u2019t appreciate the noise cancellation too much because the cloth ear covers get in the way. But overall, better than most for its sturdiness and edficiency. I like that sound isn\u2019t emitted from my TV at all when the headphones are plugged into the 3.5 mm jack.",

She was so pleased that we bought a second set for our second family room. Connections are easy as long as the TV (in our case) has standard audio out jacks. One word of warning however. If you should purchase two for your home, be sure to put them on different channels. There are 3 settings for this and you'll need to change one so as not to get interference, even if not using both at the same time.",

After turning down the headphone audio and turning up the volume on the TV the noise was all but eliminated. I now award these headphones with 5 stars.",
