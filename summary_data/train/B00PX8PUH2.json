It\u2019s does it\u2019s job, it has 3 recliners, for the babies comfort. And the tray is a pretty decent size, not too big nor not to small. I chose this one before of the price. I wasn\u2019t looking to spend much so this was perfect. I must say though, the colors and the design aren\u2019t exactly very appealing to look at. It\u2019s not pretty. But that\u2019s ok.",

      "text": "I bought this based on the reviews expecting a decent quality inexpensive high chair that would last us the next year for our 6 month old. What I didn\u2019t expect was how flimsy the overal integrity of the structure was as well as how cheap the plastic back support was made. My little one was never able to get comfortable. The process of putting on the table portion might seem like a good idea on paper but in practice it became cumbersome with her little fingers always getting caught in between the chair and the clamps. We threw this thing out after two months and bought a Peg Perego Siesta and never looked back.",
