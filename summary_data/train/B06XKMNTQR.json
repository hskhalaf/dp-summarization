      "text": "This was my first ice-fishing rod I've owned so far and I have no complaints. I used it a little over a dozen times during this last winter and it worked great. The tip is pretty sensitive so subtle bites are easy to pick up on as long as you're paying attention. The only thing I'm unable to comment on is how it handles with larger fish such as Walleye or Northerns. I've only caught Rock Bass and Perch on it so far so it's limits have yet to be tested. Overall, I love it.",

I was going to return it until I decided to clean it and hope for change. With a little TLC the reel was super smooth and the stick was gone completely. All I used was a little oil and some reel grease. The problem was fixed in less than ten minutes while I watched TV. Updates will come after I get safe ice...",

Great flex while maintaining a stable base. Makes fighting the small fish more enjoyable. Really solid unit for the price. I would recommend!",

      "text": "I love almost everything about this pole. I bought the 25\" light for panfishing and have had no complaints about the rod itself. Great sensitivity and action, but still has enough backbone for bass and pike. My one complaint (and this might be a fluke) is that the reel doesn't always reel smooth. It seems to me that the problem may be some frozen gear lube or maybe a lack of lube, I'm still not quite sure what the problem is but it doesn't effect the power of the reel, just makes it a little tougher to turn. All in all a great rod and reel combo for a great price would highly recommend.",
