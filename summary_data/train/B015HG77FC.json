The range is about 5 to 10 mts, without having obstacles, it won't work from one side to another of a wall. The battery lasts very very long, average 10-12 hs without recharging and using it actively. However it has minor impact as it comes with an USB cable so you just plug it in and keep gaming. The dial and buttons around are kinda useless and you never will use it, maybe the dial but they are hard to find and press therefore it's not important",

You need to pull the battery pack out to hard reset them. There's also an issue with battery. If you want the fancy lighting, it's going to absolutely nuke your battery. Good thing really because the lighting is completely out of sight anyway while wearing so you might as well not have it on but still you can probably get 8-10hrs battery out of them at a time. Nice to have them wireless for nipping to the kitchen while still listening to games though!",

It doesn't offer great noise cancellation, as if someone is in the same room as me, I can still hear them moving around / talking. The only cons about this headset is the wireless / RGB combo. If you're wearing it, you can't see the RGB lights - it's often best to disable the lighting in the Logitech software, as it drains the battery and requires charging more often.",
