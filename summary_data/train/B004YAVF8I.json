I'm 68 y/o and not about to learn how to do everything they wanted me to do, I'll just buy from a different manufacturer from now on. I've been a long time customer..... they blew it for $9.99.",

It came with a nano receiver which goes into USB port of the laptop or can ben stored inside the mouse when travelling. It\u2019s a plug and play device and I haven\u2019t had any issue with browsing or formatting basic shapes in PowerPoint. Build quality is great and I am enjoying it a lot. It has only two buttons and scroll wheel but for a wireless mouse with great precision and reliability, price is just about right ($11.49 as of 02/13/2016). Overall, it\u2019s a great product and I would definitely recommend.",

The battery also lasts a long time (1 yr and still going on another computer). The only negative things I find are it's light-weight, cheaper feel, and it's not uncommon for the battery compartment to pop open when dropped on the floor. I'll accept both of those problems for an inexpensive mouse that I can use anywhere and on any surface in my living room. Recommended.",

I dislike the USB being so small, but only because my Surface Pro 2 only has one USB port and I have to remove the USB if I need the port for another purpose. I just fear that I will lose it in the midst of my busy life if it is not immediately put back into the port. Other than that, I really like it! It is a great fit for my hand and it looks like it could work for both a left or right-handed person. UPDATE: After only four months, the mouse has completely stopped working.",

It's a lot more convenient for both business and personal needs than the laptop mouse. I'd recommend Logitech any day for anyone. Don't bother wasting money on others. Just use Logitech. The keyboards are great as well!",

It might be petite, boarder line boring, and void of any whiz-bang features, but it works out of the box and you can have it very soon if you order now. I prefer a mouse over a track pad anytime and consider one of these a necessary add to any laptop.",

I've used this one not even for 1year yet, so it's kinda hard to say because my mouse before this and after that 10-year sturdy mouse only lasted less than 3 months. I'm giving this 5 stars because the delivery and the service is great, and so far its performance is great, too. We'll see how long this will last. Hopefully it can last longer than the previous one.
