      "text": "I love, love, love this ironing board. After my last wonderful ironing board (not a Brabantia) was assassinated by my cats I was insistent on getting a high quality replacement that would withstand the demands of a rogue woman who actually irons her clothes as well as irons her quilting projects. This was very expensive for my budget so it does not stand opened and accessible to cat attacks now. The wide platform at the end easily holds my iron, spray starch and water spray bottle as well as being a convenient hanger-hold for the waiting garments. I know this isn't the board for everybody but if you are a serious quilter/sewist/ironed-clothing-wearer you should really consider the Brabantia ironing board.",

It's too bad you can't select from a few designs. The only thing I would point out is that it really is quite wide. If you have smaller-sized shirts that don't have buttons (i.e., t-shirts), you won't be able to put them over the ironing board, but will instead need to iron them by lying them flat across the board (so ironing front and back at the same time--not ideal for a wrinkle-free look).",

After reading reviews by people who sew a lot I settled on this board. It is significantly heavier than any board I have previously owned. But when I unwrapped the board and lifted it into position I was pleased by the quality, sturdiness and stability of the product. The cover, padding, height adjustment mechanism and iron rest are well designed. I was worried about the design of the legs, concerned that they would make the board unstable. I couldn't have been more wrong. When I started ironing I wished I had this board decades ago. No regrets. Good value.",

So, this Brabantia seemed perfect being having extra wide dimensions. I wanted to love it and do prefer it over the smaller ones; but it is almost too wide. It works great on XL men's shirts, but my women's small shirts get stretched out. It is however terrific for ironing curtains, or bed spreads.",

Plus: - Quality manufacturing and attention to details - Extra large ironing surface - Premium ironing board cover; light years better than the cheapo silver ones you get with a board from Walmart - Sturdy and substantial feeling; very, very little shaking/movement compared with a typical two-leg ironing board - Great packaging; heavier box and heavy gauge shrink wrap Minus: - Circles pattern on cover; with thin white shirts, the dark circles \"bleed\" through the shirt and can fake you into believing they are wrinkles; not a big deal for most things I iron, but worth mentioning",

The point is also too fat to easily fit the seats of pants etc. This would be a perfect board for sheets or pants. But for closed garments that have to be threaded onto the tip of the board, go for the smaller option. I returned this and got the narrower version. Perfectly happy.",

      "text": "This ironing board is very sturdy. I really like the plastic catch for the legs so that when you have closed the legs they do not accidentally fall open if you trigger the adjustment handle when you are carrying it. My husband, who is tall, likes that it can be adjusted to a higher height (39 inches). The cover is sufficiently padded. I ordered the wider version because I thought it would be better for ironing things like table clothes, which it is. However, I struggle sometimes with fitting my shirts around it. So consider what you iron the most before deciding on a width. If it is mostly clothes, I would go with the standard width.",

Thankfully I had a good reflexive grip on the iron. This one has notched height adjustment options for security. I expect to use this ironing board for a long time. It might even be worthy of mentioning in my will!",
