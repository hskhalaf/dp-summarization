It takes about 30 minutes to fill the generator, but we are pumping from a bottom connection on the supply tank, making it faster. Nearest option was three times the price. I do wish they offered one with one inch connections and a little bigger pump. Pump is smooth and quiet. This was a low cost solution for a temporary situation, so I am highly satisfied.",

I had about 10 foot of 1in heater hose going out to my jugs. The pump is so powerful that it took roughly 30 seconds to transfer a 5 gallon jug! It runs super quiet and helped me get my 25 KW diesel generator filled up in a few minutes. NOTE= you will need 1\" I.D. heater hose or fuel hose as this item does not include the hose.",
