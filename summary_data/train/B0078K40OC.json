      "text": "We love this lunchbox! We have had several other ones but this one is the best. Lots of room inside and my favorite part is that the water bottle holder is nice and big. Insulated bottles fit with plenty of room. Took the advice of another review and let my kids color theirs with permanent markers. The lunchbox on the right is actually 3 years old and has held up like a champ (the coloring is not 3 years old). Another plus is the detachable long strap so it can be worn over the shoulder or cross body too.",

BUT, today, I looked down and realized the handle was completely frayed off! I bought this earlier this summer but have only used it for 2 weeks of graduate school. This isn't a lunch box that was dragged through the playground or destroyed by a child. My daily five minute walk from the car to my classroom seemingly destroyed this lunch box in 2 weeks of use. I am extremely disappointed and discouraged by the lack of quality. It will not hold up to normal wear and tear.",

Nice side storage for drinks. Internal mesh pockets hold most utensils Cons: Big for only one meal. Mesh pocket doesn't hold larger utensils. Could be angled differently or replaced with straps.",

      "text": "This is a great lunchbox at a very good price! I purchased a bento lunchbox for my son and realized that it wouldn't fit in the superman lunch bag we had purchased for starting school. I was a little worried about purchasing a new one online just in case the dimensions were off but it's perfect. The side pockets are great for his snacks and water bottle and the box is easy to remove. The zipper goes all the way around and doesn't snag on the bag. I place one ice pack inside with the lunch box and it keeps everything cool. Will probably buy another for hubby as he now wants a bento box each day for lunch too.",

And I love the two cup holders! I can put my insulated steel travel mug on one side and my insulated water bottle on the other! They balance each other's weight :) The dual shoulder and handle straps are very convenient. The shoulder strap is wide enough to be very comfortable and the handle strap is nicely padded.",

However, one of my complaints for this lunch bag is that the threading around the handles isn't exactly that durable. I noticed that after occasional use, the handle is beginning to wear and the threads are coming apart.",

The smaller one holds temperature well, so I imagine this one will as well. It's just too big for my needs.",
