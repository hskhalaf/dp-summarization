Until another year went by and the same exact issue happened again. Now I'm on my 2nd replacement (3rd unit) and it's once again gone dead. Rather than contact the company a 4th time, I think it's time to move on. Bummer. I really enjoyed the sound, and the volume really gets up there. But not worth the effort.",

It seems a bit heavier than I originally expected, but I don't mind that at all, it seems rugged enough to last through many many uses. I am mostly wanting to use it at the hot tub and parties and that sort of thing so an effective bass performance and rugged construction is critical. It gets effectively loud and I like it a lot!",

Amazing lows mids and highs with plenty of volume so your neighbors can hear it clear as a bell. If you are looking for an awesome speaker for $99.00 this is a great value for your money. I bought this to take out by the pool and enjoy good loud music without hauling my expensive home stereo JBL\"s outside and it does its job well. Don't spend $300 bucks on a small speaker that puts out small sound. Get this bad boy, you will not regret the purchase. Happy tunes!",
