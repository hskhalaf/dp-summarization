It says to shake it first, but the product seems kind of thick and gooey and really doesn\u2019t \u2018shake\u2019. When I apply it, it seems thin like I am only getting a half of the product that has separated, and it is the oily part with little to no color or coverage at all. It also seems to make it difficult to get a good application with an eye pencil. The pencil doesn\u2019t really get a smooth line, but instead it goes on rather light and smeary because of the oily base. Not really a fan. I\u2019ll probably stick with my Smashbox Photo Finish Lid Primer.",

So, after watching a Lisa Eldridge YouTube video where she recommended this, I decided to try it out. It\u2019s a nice, glossy/watery consistency that leaves an even, natural color with subtle sheen. Its really lightweight and honestly doesn\u2019t even look like you\u2019re wearing anything. Which is what I was going for! It\u2019s like your natural eyelids but better! Great for a \u201cno makeup\u201d makeup look or even as a shadow base. Love!",
