Also, every couple months we would try baby oatmeal to help with her reflux, but it caused so much constipation. Now, the last few days she has had no spit-up or food related pain that I can tell, and the truly amazing thing is that we gave her oatmeal yesterday and the day before, and today she has already pooped twice! No more issues whatsoever. Genius product.",

He was having less diarrhea/sick looking bowel movements and it continued to improve. I mixed a pouch into a small amount of yogurt with his lunch daily and he eats it right up with no issues. This is probably the best infant probiotic I've ever tried.",

Either way, it\u2019s a very economical choice compared to other probiotics on the market and it seems to work just as well as the previous probiotic we were using (Gerber drops)",

There's no possible way I can measure half a packet so I'm just guesstimating, which usually ends up with most of it in one day's portion so there's just a tiny amount in the other. We're using formula so I just add it to her bottle and, thankfully, it doesn't increase the amount she spits up.",
