They are okay on fit, but they have something inside the heel wrap that constantly scrapes the back of my ankle. It is very annoying and sometimes even hurts. When I first put them on and wore them around the house to see if they were okay, they felt fine, but the more I wear them to work, the more my ankle hurts.",

Not a normal thing to do but the thick foam sure beats the stick insoles that came with these boots or those $15 \"work\" insoles at the store.

Feels sturdy on loose rock, good on the ladder, no problem when driving the truck, a little slick on wet surfaces like wet wood.",

      "text": "These replaced my Timberland steel toe Pro boots I had for motorcycle riding for probably 15 years which finally got rubber rot in the soles. The new ones are smaller, narrower and lighter than the originals I had and had to try 3 times to get the fit right. I ended up with a 1/2 size larger and a wide to get the same fit I got on the old boots and also this is the pit boss so slightly different style. I like this boot. Comfortable and lighter than the original making walking around easier. I think it's a quality boot.",

NOTE!!!!: You have to buy the timberline rubber insoles sold separately otherwise there is no support. Def worth the 30 extra dollars. And the timberline long socks work perfect for any work boot. Breathe well, not too thick, and very comfortable. I work 60 hrs a week as a mechanic so at that rate expect to get a little less than a year each time since I'm rough on them. Also, the insoles that u buy separate have to be cut to your size but not hard to do. Just use a pair of scissors.",
