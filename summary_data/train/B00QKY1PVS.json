This works pretty good just sprinkled a few right on top of litter and helped with the bad smell already. I still use a plugin along with this cause the cat smell is always strong to my sensitive nose and I clean it out as soon as my cat uses it. I'm glad I have this to help, I'm going to continue to buy this.",

Whenever we'd have guests, the door would be shut and labeled \"The Quarantine Zone\", nobody dared to enter. These beads along with a litter box cover solved the problem, our house smells fresh and clean once again!",
