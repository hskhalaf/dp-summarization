    "title": "Nikon D4S 16.2 MP CMOS FX Digital SLR with Full 1080p HD Video (Body Only)",
    "description": "Style:Body Only| Configuration:BaseFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nRethink the limits of speed, precision, efficiency and versatility in the field. With remarkable enhancements throughout the entire workflow, thrilling new levels of speed, performance and ISO sensitivity and the superior image quality of a Nikon flagship HD-SLR, D4S frees professionals to perform at their peak in whatever conditions their assignments demand. Capture full resolution stills at 11 fps for approx. 200 shots with full AE and AF functionality, noise-free photos and videos up to ISO 25,600 (expandable to a mind-boggling ISO 409,600 equivalent at Hi4) and 1080p Full HD videos with high-fidelity stereo audio. Transfer files 10x faster with new 1000 Base-T (Gigabit) wired LAN, and increase that speed further by shooting a smaller RAW SIZE S format. Think and shoot in ways you may not have believed possible.\n\nTHE EVOLUTION OF A MASTERPIECE.\nThe course of modern imaging has been forged by the talent and ingenuity of working professionals, but also by the introduction of a few cameras so innovative and forward-thinking, they redefined what's possible. The Nikon D4 has been such a camera. And now D4S proves that a great thing really can get better, with remarkable enhancements throughout the entire workflow, dazzling new levels of speed, performance, ISO sensitivity and, of course, the superior image quality of a Nikon camera.\n\n\nSPEED AND PERFORMANCE \nENHANCEMENTS THROUGH THE ENTIRE WORKFLOW\nHow do you make a revolutionary camera better? Improve its speed, precision and efficiency without sacrificing the features that make it exceptional. D4S builds on the success of D4 with 30% faster image processing and substantial energy savings\u2014capture up to 3,020* stills on a single charge\u2014an extended standard ISO range (100-25,600) with enhanced noise reduction, and improved tonal range and smoother gradations. Shoot 11 fps for approx. 200 shots at full resolution with AE and AF functionality. For faster initial subject capture, use five AF sensors as a single focus point with the new Group Area AF setting. Transfer files 10x faster than the D4 with new 1000 Base-T (Gigabit) wired LAN, and increase that speed further by shooting a new smaller RAW SIZE S format. Perform at your peak\u2014D4S will keep up. \n\n*Based on CIPA Guidelines\n\nNIKON IMAGE QUALITY \nSTUNNING VIEWS OF DECISIVE MOMENTS\nLike its predecessor, the D4, the D4S delivers a level of image quality that elevates the power of any story. An improved 16.2MP FX-format CMOS image sensor is paired with Nikon's spectacular new image-processing engine, EXPEED 4, for truly phenomenal speed and performance in the field. The combination achieves outstanding ISO sensitivity, faithful, vibrant color, natural depth, subtle nuanced tones from pitch black to snow white and smoother gradations in both stills and videos. Nikon's proven 51-point AF system and 3D Color Matrix metering III with a 91,000-pixel RGB sensor provide fast, accurate autofocus and metering. Enhanced Picture Control tone curves deliver more depth and clearer color rendition in \"Standard\" mode. For viewfinder shooting, a new custom setting lets you toggle Face Detection on and off as the situation requires for improved exposure bias around your subjects. You can even measure White Balance against any point in the frame.\n\nNIKON FLAGSHIP ISO PERFORMANCE\nNOISE-FREE SHOOTING FROM ISO 100 TO 25,600\nPhotographers go where their assignments take them, and this often means working in the high-contrast glare of the midday sun, the low-light at dawn or the poorly illuminated interiors of a sporting venue. Nikon flagship D-SLRs have long been recognized by professionals for their clean performance at high ISO settings, and D4S takes that performance to the next level. With a specially designed 16.2MP FX-format CMOS image sensor engineered to collect more light and render higher image quality plus the power of EXPEED 4, you can shoot sharp photos from ISO 100 all the way up to 25,600. The ISO range can be extended to a mind-boggling ISO 409,600 equivalent at Hi 4 for overcoming the most challenging lighting conditions. Enjoy great flexibility in your approach to fulfilling challenging assignments. \n\n THE CHOICE FOR PROS ON THE GO \nA CAMERA THAT WORKS AS HARD AS YOU DO\nD4S is designed to keep you shooting wherever the story brings you, even after others have packed their bags for the day. Its increased ISO range means you'll be able to capture brilliant photos and videos in whatever light is available. Enjoy improved ergonomics and operability as well as flagship levels of durability and reliability\u2014key for those who spend all day with a camera around their neck. Select from five image area modes while shooting stills in Live View: FX, DX, 1.5x, 5:4 and 1.2x. A new RAW SIZE S setting allows for shooting 12-bit uncompressed Nikon NEF files that are smaller and more easily manageable\u2014speeding up the entire workflow. When you're racing a deadline at a major event, D4S can transfer images up to 10x faster than previously possible with its 1000 Base-T Ethernet. D4S is the camera for today's working pro. \n\n\n\n\n\nA MULTIMEDIA POWERHOUSE \nPROFESSIONAL VIDEO AND AUDIO CAPABILITIES \nToday's stories are being told through stills, video, audio and exciting combinations of each. D4S is a multimedia powerhouse, allowing you to capture stunning and smooth 1080/60p video. Shoot scenes with tremendous depth and sharpness as well as with shallow depth of field or bokeh\u2014and even capture 2MP stills simultaneously while recording video. For video, 2.7x Crop Mode extends the reach of lenses and produces outstanding video quality and detail. D4S adds real-time audio adjustments during recording, selectable sound ranges like Wide Range and Voice Range and improved wind noise reduction on the internal mic. Adjust color settings on the camera's LCD to better match an external monitor. Capture smoother Time Lapse sequences with reduced flicker and improved interval control (up to 9,999 shots), and even simultaneously record to internal CF or the latest high speed XQD cards and an external recording device.
