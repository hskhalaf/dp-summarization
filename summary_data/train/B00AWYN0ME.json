      "text": "For it's price point and for being a POS, the Canon Powershot is a good value. It takes decent pictures and fits in a pocket or purse with ease. I love it's small size, I love the plug in battery charger and I love the scenery photos it takes. As with any low budget camera, lighting can be tricky and you definitely want to take \"posed\" shots as opposed to \"action\" shots. It suits my purpose, which is a quick grab and go camera that will take decent pics for a decent price. You can't go wrong with the Canon Powershot, just know what you are getting.",

Instruction book better the many others BUT one must read the FINE print. Controls are for most part well placed but some are too small. Test shots appear okay, only time will tell after many exposures under various lighting conditions. This model was selected as a back up to my Galaxy S5 for travelling light, leaving my Canon 7D and assorted lenses home.",

On a trip, I'll upload to my iphone and text or post to facebook. At home, I'll remove the SD card and insert into my PC. The advantage over cellphone pictures is that the resolution is much better for editing and printing. Especially in lower light settings where cellphone optics and flash cannot compare. Recommend using the included wrist strap at all times. Unlike earlier models, this one has rounded edges and a slick surface and is slipperier than a bar of soap.",

Well, raining and me sweating, I took it out and used it. It got wet and started acting out. I opened up the base, removed the battery and card and put it in with some rice and let it stay a few days. Once out, it worked once again.

I emailed Canon customer service, and they gave me instructions for hard-resetting the camera. They also told me to clean the battery nodes with a cotton swab.

Once we got past how small it is, we fell in love with the amazing and clear pictures. Our other camera was about 9 years old and while it took good pictures, using this new Canon showed us how old it had gotten. The Canon pictures were much crisper. For such a small amount of money, this was an excellent investment for an everyday camera used in the field (literally) and around the house.",

Sometimes when you need something more than phone pics, the Elph has always been perfect for us.",

It still take pictures-but I couldn't review them on the old camera . I had to put the SD card in a computer to view them. This new camera is a couple years newer model from my old one. I LOVE IT! Awesome pictures. Easy to use. Easy to download and great for fitting in my purse, pockets, camera bag! Also great price!",

The zoom starts at 28mm wide-angle and extends to 224mm telephoto (35mm equivalent), covering a wide and highly useful range. The telephoto reach gives you the freedom to capture subjects from afar, while the 28mm wide-angle makes it easy to shoot sweeping landscapes, large groups of people and tall buildings.\n\nHIGH RESOLUTION, HIGHLY ADVANCED PERFORMANCE\n16.0 MEGAPIXEL IMAGE SENSOR WITH DIGIC 4 IMAGE PROCESSOR\nWith the PowerShot ELPH 130 IS digital camera's 16.0 Megapixels of resolution, your images are rich and clear, with textures and tiny details faithfully reproduced even at the long end of the 8x Optical Zoom. This high level of resolution is ideal for creating the largest prints, and allows you the flexibility to blow up and crop any section of an image to express your creativity. The DIGIC 4 Image Processor powers the camera's advanced systems and features, ensuring fast, reliable performance with low battery consumption.\n\nDIGIC 4 IMAGE PROCESSOR\nCanon DIGIC Image Processors have set the standard for functionality and performance since their groundbreaking introduction in 1999. With each successive generation, DIGIC Image Processors have brought elevated performance and powerful new features to PowerShot digital cameras. The DIGIC 4 Image Processor has ushered in a new level of picture quality and accelerated processing, making possible features such as high-speed continuous shooting, HD video and Face Detection Self-timer.\n\nA SMARTER CAMERA MEANS BETTER PHOTOS\nSMART AUTO\nPhotographers of all levels appreciate a camera \u2013 especially a go-anywhere compact digital \u2013 that takes the hassle out of capturing beautiful images. The PowerShot ELPH 130 IS gives you Smart AUTO \u2013 sophisticated Canon technology that makes getting that great shot as simple as pressing the shutter button. Smart AUTO automatically detects scenes by assessing various factors in both the background and the subject. Detected scenes are analyzed using 32 predefined shooting situations. The camera then makes optimal settings to ensure the best possible image capture when shooting still images. Smart AUTO also includes Advanced Subject Detection, which allows the camera to detect and track non-human moving subjects like animals and vehicles. With Smart AUTO, all you have to do is frame your shot and capture away.\n\nSHOOTING MODES/SPECIAL SCENE MODES\nSmart AUTO The camera automatically selects the best shooting settings for optimal quality based on subjects and environmental factors to provide point-and-shoot simplicity. Program The camera automatically and intelligently selects the aperture/shutter speed combination based on the shooting conditions. Portrait Brings the subject into focus while beautifully blurring the background. Smart Shutter The camera automatically takes the photo when people smile, wink, or get into frame. Low Light For high quality image capture in an amazing range of dimly lit situations. Fisheye Effect Now you can get the fisheye effect \u2013 a classic photographic distortion \u2013 without a fisheye lens. Miniature Effect Give images a miniature look with an effect that emphasizes perspective by blurring the top and bottom of the image. Toy Camera Effect Simulates photos taken with \"toy\" or pinhole cameras, darkening the image at the edges to create a vignette effect. Monochrome Choose from three single-tone effects: Black-and-White, Sepia, or Blue. Super Vivid Super Vivid intensifies existing hues, saturating the scene with bright colors. Poster Effect Poster Effect combines several similar shades into one color, turning subtle gradations into eye-catching, scene-popping contrasts. Color Accent Choose to retain a single color in your image while other colors turn monochrome. Color Swap Select a color and replace it with a color you specify for special effects. Snow Shoot clear snow scenes without darkened subjects or an unnatural bluish tint. Fireworks Create brilliant images of skyrocketing fireworks. Long Shutter Use to blur moving subjects for artistic effect, ideal for urban night photography. Stitch Assist Easy-to-use guidelines simplify the shooting of aligned multiple frames that can later be combined (using bundled software) to create panoramic photos. Movie Record video; unwanted scenes can be deleted in playback mode. GORGEOUS HD VIDEO FROM YOUR STILL CAMERA\n720P HD VIDEO\nYou can shoot high definition video anytime, anywhere right from the pocket-sized PowerShot ELPH 130 IS digital camera. With a simple push of the dedicated movie button, you'll be able to instantly record every moment in motion. 720p HD video is smooth, vivid, and beautifully lifelike, making it an ideal way to capture special memories. In addition to being able to shoot 720p HD video at 25 frames per second, the PowerShot ELPH 130 IS can also shoot 640 x 480 VGA video at 30* frames per second.\n\n*Actual frame rate is 29.97 fps.\n\nDEDICATED MOVIE BUTTON FOR EASY VIDEO CAPTURE\nIt's never been easier to shoot videos with a PowerShot digital camera. To make shooting video as natural as snapping pictures, the PowerShot ELPH 130 IS has a dedicated movie button. No need to plan ahead, no need to search through menus on the LCD screen; when you feel a moment would be best captured in 720p HD, simply press the button and recording begins. The camera is always ready to shoot stills or video whenever you want.\n\nOPTIMAL IMAGE STABILIZATION IN ANY SITUATION\nINTELLIGENT IS AUTOMATICALLY CHOOSES FROM SIX DIFFERENT MODES TO OPTIMIZE IMAGE STABILIZATION FOR THE SHOOTING CONDITION\nIt's easy to capture clear, steady images with the PowerShot ELPH 130 IS, even in low light without using a tripod. That's because the camera is equipped with Canon's innovative Intelligent IS. The system analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation \u2013 allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. For stills, the system automatically selects among Normal, Panning, Macro (Hybrid) and Tripod IS modes. When shooting video, the system automatically selects among Dynamic, Powered, Macro and Tripod IS modes.\n\nNormal Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills. Panning Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement. Macro (Hybrid) Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting. Dynamic Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking. Powered Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified. Tripod When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed. A CHARGE THAT LASTS AS LONG AS A MEMORY\nNEW ECO MODE HELPS REDUCE POWER CONSUMPTION FOR LONGER BATTERY LIFE\nThe PowerShot ELPH 130 IS takes energy conservation to the next level with ECO Mode, which provides more shots per single charge through LCD monitor and camera power management. ECO Mode can be activated for easy power preservation when an outlet is unavailable or the moment is too exciting to put the camera down. ECO Mode quickly wakes the camera from sleep when a button is pressed. With ECO Mode activated to conserve power, you can even stay connected for longer with the built-in Wi-Fi\u00ae feature on the PowerShot ELPH 130 IS. When the fun with family and friends runs late into the night, you can be assured your camera can keep up.",
