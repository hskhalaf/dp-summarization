Other than this benefit, I don't see this type of doorstops outperform other doorsteps, as described in the product title. To me, it's certainly not decorative. It's a doorstop, it's a doorstop. It does its job. That's all. When you jam it underneath the door, to make it work, you still need to double-check if the door can't move before let go. I had it happen to me several times that the doorstop didn't actually stop the door. So, in that sense, this product is probably too pricy.",

We also have a French Bulldog who has eaten door stops, so we have to make sure it\u2019s secure. We ordered the two pack here, and one door stop is working beautifully in our bedroom. Unfortunately, the one in the babies\u2019 room isn\u2019t and is instantly dislodged. I think the issue is because there isn\u2019t a lot of space between the door and the door stop. Overall, if both worked for us, I would give the company 5 stars for a sleek, effective door stop.",
