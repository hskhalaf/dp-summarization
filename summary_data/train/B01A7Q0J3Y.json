      "text": "Nikon did it right on this model. I received this body the first week it was released and since then have shot dozens of sporting events logging upwards of 30k frames. Superb low light focusing, quick and reliable auto-focus, well-placed control positions for ISO, EV adjustments on the fly and the touch screen makes it enjoyable to quickly scroll/enlarge photos for review. Since I started using this body, my D3 and D4 have been sitting in my equipment cabinet. The only complaint that I have is that now I literally have 50%+ more quality tact sharp photos to sort through after each shoot.",

The viewfinder is large and offers a good view of the subject and the screen is great for times when using the viewfinder might be awkward. The setup of buttons makes it easy to make adjustments on the fly, and while all the varied menus seem confusing at first, with practice and patience it all makes sense and the camera can be set up to my personal specifications. This is clearly the best professional crop sensor camera and it has helped my photography to move up to a new level.",

The Nikon D500 has all the bells and whistles that I was looking for in a DSLR. There are even some features not found on some full frame cameras. If full frame isn't necessary for you kind of shooting, then the D500 is HIGHLY recommended.",

The 4k video is great, but invest in a couple of XQD cards and consider the HUGE file sizes when editing big 4k projects. You'll want a huge internal hard drive or some very fast external solutions. GIANT step up from the D7000 I was using for the last 7 years. I used to use that only up to ISO 1600 (RAW) or ISO 640 (Video), now I can push to 3200 / 1600 respectively and get cleaner results!",

Nikon glass is easier to get a hold of and priced way better than Sony glass. Used Nikon glass is a bargain as well",

The sensor resolution and sensitivity allows fast shutter and sharp imagery. Used auto-iso setting for birds and wildlife to keep depth of field and fast shutter constant for sharp focus. Coupled with the VR lens, the results look impressive. Also went to Cango Caves which have lowlight opportunities where this camera's light sensitivity really shines. With so many focus, exposure and depth of field options I still am working on being 5% smarter than the equipment. Highly recommended!",

      "text": "I was really disappointed with the D500. I had problems getting details in photos when using ISO over 800. Some of the low light photos I took had smudged details with ISO 3600. I was not expecting the amount of grain and loss of details on the ISO levels between 800 and 3600 as reviews indicated this camera was supposed to be great for low light situations. Pros - camera shutter was extremely fast (almost too much as it was easy to take 20+ photos on the continuous setting with little effort) and very quiet. Returned as it did not meet my expectations for quality.",

No matter what you shoot, you can be sure that the D500 will be up to the task, time and time again.\n\nSMALL, YET POWERFUL\nYOUR FAVORITE TRAVEL COMPANION\nThe sleek and beautiful D500 goes anywhere you go, bringing along stunning resolution and performance. Packing a lot of power into a smaller camera body thanks to its DX sensor means you can take advantage of the smaller and lighter DX lenses in the NIKKOR line, and when you're travelling, every ounce counts.

With the D500 at your side, whether you're hiking through the lush landscapes of New Zealand or on safari in Africa, it will be ready to go, effortless and unobtrusive.\n\nTHE NIKKOR LEGACY\nUNLEASH THE FULL POTENTIAL OF THE D500\nLike every Nikon DSLR, the D500 is best paired with legendary NIKKOR lenses which provide unequalled clarity and versatility. The NIKKOR legacy is unmatched--there's a reason over 95 million have been sold to date. Each lens offers a different view from which to capture your memories. Shooting landscapes or portraiture? The fast AF-S DX NIKKOR 16-80mm f/2.8-4E ED VR could prove to be your best friend. Or, extend your range with the lightweight AF-S DX NIKKOR 55-200mm f/4-5.6G ED VR II, ideal for shooting sports, parades or distant architecture. No matter your choice, pairing the Nikon D500 with renowned NIKKOR lenses is a recipe for success.\n\nA PEEK UNDER THE HOOD\nBURSTING WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY\nThe new D500 is a technical marvel, the fruit of Nikon's tireless strides towards producing the world's greatest cameras. To preserve life's most fleeting moments, you need a camera with incredible speed. The EXPEED 5 processor in the D500 opens up a world of possibilities, processing images fast enough to allow up to 10 frames per second so you don't miss a moment of the action. The new Multi-CAM 20K autofocus system provides 153 AF points including 99 cross type points, which together enable you to create images that match your vision. It is also the first Nikon DX camera to utilize the new XQD memory card technology, which provides faster read/write and transfer speeds to fully take advantage of the D500's speed. Not quite ready to upgrade to XQD? That's no problem, as the D500's dual memory card slots can accept SD media as well. Although compact in size, the D500 certainly packs a punch.\n\nNOT AFRAID OF THE DARK\nTHERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO SEE\nNot much light to go around? The D500 makes the most out of every bit of available light, giving you the flexibility to produce high quality images in dark environments. With a native ISO range of 100 - 51,200, expandable to Lo 1 and Hi 5 (50 - 1,640,000 equivalent), the versatile D500 is not intimidated by difficult low-light conditions, down to -4 EV. Rich details emerge from the shadows to produce unrivaled quality found only with Nikon cameras and lenses.\n\nLAUGHS IN THE FACE OF DANGER\nAS TOUGH AS YOU NEED IT TO BE\nThey say that good things come in small packages, and the D500 is no exception. A powerful but smaller sibling of the D5, the D500 features the same durable, rugged build and ergonomics you've come to associate with Nikon DSLRs. Built with rugged magnesium alloy and carbon fiber materials, and featuring dust and water-drop resistance you'll have peace of mind even when shooting in extreme environments. The D500 also leverages a 3.2-inch 2,359k-dot tilting RGBW LCD touchscreen, making it easy to get the shot even from high or low angles.\n\nYOUR IMAGES. THE WORLD. CONNECTED.\nDON'T WAIT TO SHOW OFF YOUR BEST SHOTS\nNow, sharing your amazing photos is easier than ever - the D500's SnapBridge functionality enables multiple built-in connectivity options. Liberated from the constraints of connecting wires, you can transfer your images to a compatible smart device from anywhere in the world using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to eliminate the barrier between your camera and smart device. As an added benefit, the D500's built-in Near Field Communication (NFC) capability makes it a breeze to connect the camera to your compatible smart device while the built-in Wi-Fi capability allows for faster wireless image transfer. For those looking for an even faster transfer solution, the D500 is also compatible with the optional WT-7A, enabling transmission of files to an FTP server or computer at speeds of up to 866.7 Mbps.\n\n\n\nSUPPLIED ACCESSORIES\n * EN-EL15 Rechargeable Li-ion Battery\n * MH-25A Battery Charger\n * USB Cable Clip\n * HDMI Cable Clip\n * DK-17 Eyepiece\n * UC-E22 USB Cable\n * AN-DC17 Strap\n * BF-1B Body Cap\n * U.S. Warranty\n * User's Manual",
