        "The Sony NWZ-S610 series features a compact design with a high-quality feel and an ample screen",

        "No more awful SonicStage software: this Walkman is a PlaysForSure device supporting subscription tracks as well as unprotected WMA, MP3, and even AAC files",
        "The player offers good sound quality and an excellent rated battery life"

      "cons": [

I have a Sony Walkman that is much older that I have about 750 songs on, wanted to upgrade. A total waste of money and I should have known better, it was not Prime.",

I was not that computer savvy in converting the music format to smaller kps so that the tracks could fit on the player, but once I figured it out, it was easy, hence I wish the instructions were of more help to those of us who need a little \"music download 101\" (smile). I am new to the MP3 music format, but it's wonderful considering they replace the hundreds of CD's that I have..I am a die-hard Sony(and Amazon) fan for years, and this is one more star in my collection..You rock Sony..Thanks....BJ",

I've had it for only about 10 days so far. It does have space for pictures and also has a radio. I haven't checked out the radio. I wanted Sony because I believe it has better music quality than other MP3's I've used and the price was about the same.",

It has good sound and easy to use, i like the hold button so that I don't waste the battery getting tossed around in my bag. my only two complaints are that you cannot make a playlist on the device, you have to make it on the computer and that I have only had it a few months and have had to use the reset button already.",

They said they have a new policy and will no longer price match. I felt kind of cheated. The player is great though!",

I use it at the gym and it makes working out a lot easier. 2 minor complaints. The headphones hurt my ears so I'll probably need to replace them. Wish it came with a clip or armband. Sound is great. Haven't used for videos yet. Overall, I love it and have no regrets about this purchase.",
