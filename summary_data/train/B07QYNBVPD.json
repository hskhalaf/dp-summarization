      "text": "I mainly bought this for watching videos/typing papers/ browsing internet. The touch pad is so bad. When ever I use two fingers to scroll up or down, it works like 30% of the time. It was fine at first, but around 30 days in my touch pad started having this problem. Most of my time is browsing web pages and I can't even use the two finger scroll. Its also really easy to do other multi finer gestures by accident. My $200 chromebook has lasted 2 years and has a better touch pad. It's kinda sad because other than that I really like this laptop.",

Now have the hassle of replacement and losing my data. Do a quick internet search for \"asus wont charge\" and you will see this is a longstanding issue (since at least 2018). Avoid the problems and try a different manufacturer. It may cost a little more, but you get what you pay for.",

I requested a replacement so hopefully the second one will show up in working order.",
