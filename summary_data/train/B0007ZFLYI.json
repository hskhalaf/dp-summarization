      "text": "I purchased 4 of these Logitech 961400-0403 Quickcams for use with friends over Skype because of the price, performance and features. The resolution is very good for VOIP, and the face-tracking and special-effects features of the associated software work as advertised. I initially purchased a Logitech Orbcam for significantly more but these are so much cheaper with equivalent performance for VoIP that I would choose these any day. Possible improvements: 1. Although the form factor is for Laptops, a wider mounting clamp for desktop LCD monitors would improve its usage. I had to fabricate one for my desktop. 2. A side-to-side swivel mount would also improve its usage.",

The webcam didn't track hand movements very well and the video came out really blurry. My built in laptop webcam was much better in that regard. It's good for someone who stays still and just speaks into the video. The camera didn't fit on my laptop and kept falling off, which got really annoying. After a few hours of recieving this product it's now boxed up and ready to be returned.",

      "text": "I bought this webcam to use with my laptop when I am away from home. I have owned several different webcams and my basic needs are a camera that can deliver 640x480 resolution at 30fps. This camera does a good job of delivering that level of service which is enough to provide a relatively smooth picture. The Logitech software for enhancing a picture in low light also works well as does their software that cancels sound loops that would lead to feedback. The one drawback I have found is the mount has insufficient spread to clamp onto my laptop's display frame.",

The only thing I don't so much like is that it doesn't fit snug on my laptop and it can fall off when I close my computer (I have a Dell laptop) All in all I really like this product.",

You would be better off getting something which you can move sideways and/or upside down. Right now, I have to move the whole laptop left or right to adjust the picture.",

Relative to a Labtec product, the resolution was far superior, the room-level light capability much better, and the focusing ring made acquiring sharp images much easier. I was particularly impressed by the close focusing capability. This inexpensive camera can produce close-up images that rival a far more expensive low-magnification scope plus video attachment. The driver was also faster than the Labtec's, allowing a useful boost in frame rate at lower resolutions. I think it's difficult to go wrong with this camera.",

Sometimes there is a bit of an echo in the speakers, but it's not so much that you can't get over it. All in all this is a great product that produces a VERY clear picture if there is enough light. Also, the filter on it for brightening in low light situations is very good. I'd recommend it to anyone. It fits snugly, but securely on the screen of my Dell Inspiron 9300.",
