They\u2019re cut exactly like alva\u2019s, which makes me think they\u2019re rebranded, but I\u2019d venture to say they\u2019re marginally better quality. The liner doesn\u2019t pill as much and the elastics are holding up better. Two of the diapers in the pack are extremely difficult to snap so I don\u2019t reach for them often. The inserts are bamboo microfiber, which are, again, marginally better than plain microfiber. Overall they\u2019re decent diapers to have in rotation, but not our favorites. Nora\u2019s Nursery definitely knocks it out of the park color wise!",

If you have a hevy wetter change every two to three hours and i highly recommened to double up on bamboo inserts at nighr for the baby to wake up dry. Great company, defintley will perchace more!!

There's no way you could put these on a 6 pound newborn like the description says. I think I will like them more as she grows.",

I bought some extra charcoal bamboo liners and like those better than the ones that come with these diapers (more absorbant, wider, and much quicker to dry - I have no dryer).
