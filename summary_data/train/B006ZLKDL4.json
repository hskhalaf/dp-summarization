Day 3 I noticed after reaching down to the bottom of the box where all the chocolate pieces were, that they were either discolored (old? previously melted?) or broken. I tried a piece that wasn't discolored, I didn't expect fancy expensive chocolate but it tasted awful. It went into the garbage. Will not order again.",

It was very very frustrating and I'm not sure if I'll be buying this again for next year. But the chocolates were probably the tastiest I've ever had from an advent calendar",
