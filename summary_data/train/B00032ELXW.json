      "title": "Finally found a non-stick pan that lasts",
      "text": "Been going through bake (pizza) pans a lot in the last few years trying to find a good one. This model's a keeper. After a about 30 uses and 31 runs through the dishwasher, the coating's still intact, it stays clean, and the only rust is just a tiny bit from under the rim. Sadly, none of the other pans I've tried so far can make *any* of those claims. This pan has also remained smoke free. The perforations make for crisper crusts and firmer doughs. Just need a flat sheet under the whole thing if drippings are a concern. Since this pan has 3 \"feet\", it stays above the flat sheet so air can still circulate.",

It was NOT bent when I first started using it. Still works but I shouldn't have to worry about it warping. Wanted this size in the calphalon brand but they didnt have this size. Purchased this with fingers crossed. If you need a smaller size pizza pan this works. Cooks perfect and super easy to clean. Food slides right off without sticking",
