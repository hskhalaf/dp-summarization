      "text": "Likes...I prefer the flat screen and the clarity is fine with good colours,especially in view of the price. The fingerprint scanner is excellent with instant readout. Very occasionally have to wipe my thumb tto make it work. Camera very good and sensible in keeping the wide angle lens and ditching the telephoto option. Not liked so much....Samsung sound has always been average and still is. But use headphones and all is well. Phone tends to open lock screen page when kept in my shirt breast pocket. That is annoying and haven't solved yet. But overall a nice value for money mobile.",

Works a few times then not recognised/clean scanner error messages. Obviously building the scanner into the power button is not effective.
