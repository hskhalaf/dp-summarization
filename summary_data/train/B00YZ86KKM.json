A friend is a physical therapist and she recommended this one. It beats the $200 one from my ortho!!! So much more comfy, so much lighter. I did have to take the \"foot ramp\" out of the front to hold my foot in the alignment my doc wanted, but it's easy to do. It's just velcro'd in, so yank it out and you're good to go! This is lighter, cooler and so much more comfortable. But, it holds my foot right where it's supposed to be.",

      "text": "When you are sitting or standing, this works. But the point is to wear it to sleep. When you lay down, the wedge forcing the foot up no longer has the same resistance and the foot loses the pressure against the wedge which causes the stretch. If you tighten the straps, as I did, you can create pressure again but...as cost of your circulation and the straps cut into the skin. So, you can have pressure...and a BLUE foot or no pressure...and the same issue as before you bought the boot.",

It is a bit big and may take some getting used to sleeping with it, HOWEVER, it has significantly reduced the pain in the morning and for the first time in many months I actually take normal steps throughout the day. It is different than other night splints because it REALLY stretches the tendon. You have to adjust the straps on the side that pull the foot towards the shin, but it truly helps!",
