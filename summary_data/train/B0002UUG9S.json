If I had gone a size up, they would be too big. Leather stretches over time, so I don\u2019t recommend going a size up. Just bear through it being a little snug at first and then it\u2019ll be perfect once you break them in. If you\u2019re a dancer, you don\u2019t want to order a size up and risk them being too loose or baggy. If I had one complaint, it would be that the backs of the shoes dig slightly into the back of my heel. Otherwise, I have no complaints.",
