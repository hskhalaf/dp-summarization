      "verdict": "A lot of buyers were disoriented by the purpose of the Reebok CrossFit Lite TR. Even though it was presented as a CrossFit shoe, a majority of athletes primarily used it for powerlifting. It offered a rigid, flat sole, excellent grip, and a broader toe box, all of which are essential for this type of training. From this point of view, it was found to be an excellent value for the price. Contrariwise, the same features which made it an efficient powerlifting shoe kept it from becoming all-around training footwear for some people.",
      "pros": [
        "The Reebok CrossFit Lite TR impressed numerous athletes with its flat, stiff sole which provided a stable platform for powerlifting",
        "Many buyers found the design of the trainer to be aesthetically pleasing",
        "A lot of reviewers noted that the traction capability of the outsole was top-notch",
        "This shoe made plenty of training enthusiasts feel well-held and supported in the heel area",
        "A considerable number of testers with medium and wide foot dimensions appreciated the extra room in the toe box",
        "Some users mentioned that the trainer was flexible enough to perform CrossFit WODs",
        "A handful of wearers enjoyed doing rope climbs in the shoe",
        "apparently, the soles were sticky enough to grip the rope, and the high-top design kept the ankles safe from abrasion",
        "The shoe was also given praise for the excellent quality of the materials used"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "Several disgruntled reviewers wrote that the shoe started to fall apart after about a month of use",
        "For some wearers, the CrossFit Lite TR was too hot and restrictive, causing unpleasant odor and discomfort"

I don't run so not sure about running in these, but I do use the elliptical machine and treadmill with ankle weights, these are comfortable while doing both of those. For lifting these provide a great solid base. Highly recommend these shoes!",
