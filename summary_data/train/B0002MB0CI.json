Its laceless look goes well with almost any outfit and its fabric is soft enough to be breathable yet would revert to its original form.The toe part of the upper would tend to tear a hole because of the soft nature of the material. Stress builds upon that area, and preventive measures are futile, so it\u2019s best to buy more pairs to alternate its daily use.",

I purchased these after another style of keds I liked stopped being made. I love these more! Also, the sole/insert comes out so you can easily wash them. The insert is kind of a water resistant foam insert that I usually just hand wash in the sink while I toss the rest of the shoe in the washer. I usually dry them on low heat and the fabric doesn't seem shrunk or tight after doing so. They're true to size and I definitely recommend these to anyone who loves comfy keds!",

They don't have the most support on them, but I'm expecting that you aren't going to be going on a jog in these. I bought my second pair for a trip to Europe and they were ready to go right away and I didn't even need to wear them in. No blisters and no issues. I think they go so well with so many different options - a cute, casual dress, jeans, romper - you name it. They look great.",

Follow-up to say that with socks, they are too tight for me. But with the little sock liners that are thinner, they are fine. They are my favorite shoes!

Plus, this particular style ( white, washed, no strings just eyelets) were impossible to find in my local stores...All sold out in my size. Excellent to find on Amazon and delivered the next day! I just bought another pair for a friend who loved mine during our trip!",
