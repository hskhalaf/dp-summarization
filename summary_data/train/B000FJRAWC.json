      "text": "I replaced a very similar old US Craftsman screwdriver with this. The top of the old unit finally fell apart. Pros - Carries 4 bits which is all one needs for most household/handyman uses. No fumbling with slots and clunky storage. Buy a full bit set if needed for more extensive or bench needs. Good quality driver on par with the *old* Craftsman brand. Cons - The magnet is rather weak. Several times I have tightened a small screw only to find the bit stuck in the screw and not the handle.",

The screw cap on the end for bit storage works great. The bad- the magnetic properties of the magnet are non existent. I used the driver twice, both times the bit fell out. If they would have used a rare earth magnet, this would be a 5 star tool. I was so disappointed that I ended up carefully removing the hex shaft from the handle, and replacing it with a Wiha magnetic holder / extension. It was easier than sending it back.",

I recently installed shelves that required me to install a header bar about 11 ft above the ground....so holding the bar while installing a screw while standing up high is not fun. But this screwdriver held the 2.5 inch screws perfectly....I could hold the bar with one hand and the driver held onto the screw enabling me to safely get the work done. In other words, the magnetic holding capacity is more than adequate to hold a long screw horizontally. Sure comes in handy.",

I wanted a screwdriver with a magnetic tip strong enough to not only hold the screwdriver tip but the screw as well. Couldn't find a decent screwdriver, not even at Sears. Craftsman now makes inferior screwdrivers like everyone else. Well at least I can still count on Klein (the actual screwdriver does not bear the Klein name) to produce a decent tool. Nothing else special about this, except that it will hold a screw on the tip as you use it.",

It's strong enough to get the job done, but not nearly as strong as most others. On the plus side... it makes tip changes quicker.
