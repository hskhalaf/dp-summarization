I went through all the troubleshooting steps, including disassembling the unit (per instructions), tried several different filaments (ABS and PLA), all to no avail. I tried contacting MYNT but so far have not received a response. I'm returning it for a refund and have purchased a different unit from a different manufacturer.",

      "text": "After trying every permutation of cable, adapter, pen, plastic... I narrowed down the issue to 2 faulty power adapters. Pen would suddenly \"reboot\" and would have to wait for the temp to go up again. When plugging the pen into a 3rd party USB charging hub, it performed perfectly for hours so I'm 100% positive it was a faulty power adapter. Aside from the power issues, pen is great! Super fun, heats up fast. It would have been nice to have some sort of stand/mount. Brings color and fun to my 3d printer projects! My 6 year old loves it!",

Once I switched to a different charger (at 2.1 amps) the issue was resolved and the pen handled continuous extrusion quite well.
