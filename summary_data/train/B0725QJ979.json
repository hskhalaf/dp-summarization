The installation can be done by one person but a team of 2 should be able to finish the job in < 45 minutes (excluding unboxing and removing the various pieces from the box)..",

Also, the handles are widely spaced and more appropriate to a taller person (over 6\u2019). Lastly, the dip handles would benefit from thicker rubberized cushioning sleeves. Overall though, it is a fine piece of equipment that should provide years of service.",
