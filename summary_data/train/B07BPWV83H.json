I would not recommend these or any others with the same type straps.

Also, once firmly attached, they seem to pretty much stay put without sliding around or down.

I am also pleasantly surprised at how well made they are for $25.99. Awesome product.",

They did get a little annoying on the back of my legs, which I am sure would not happen with pants underneath. Would highly recommend these however!",

My wife has been using the pads for a few weeks now and they seem very sturdy and show promise of lasting a while. We both agree that the knee pads are well made and that the price is very reasonable for this product.",
