We don't have a designated playroom, so I was looking for something that wouldn't take up our entire living room. This is the perfect size for her! Both the one-year-old and our 3.5-year-old have had a blast climbing on this all day. It also seems really sturdy/good quality. The material looks like it will be easy to wipe down, but there are also zippers to remove the covers should they need to be washed. Really happy with our purchase!",

He loves that he can slide down it, and very quickly figured out how to get up the \"slide\" part. I do hope one day they come up with a slightly bigger version (if there is one I didn't see it)",

Nicely lightweight - to pick up and store when he's not here, or to vacuum. The quality is great, and price is very good, compared to similar items.

It does not have any adhesive or anything keeping the two together so it makes it dangerous, sometimes I\u2019m in the kitchen and I turn around and there\u2019s a huge whole in between where my daughter could easily hurt herself. 3. I think the last step is still too high, my daughter fell backwards and hit her head. Overall I think this product is not made thinking out the safety of our little ones so i wouldn\u2019t recommend.
