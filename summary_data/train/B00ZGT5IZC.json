Loved it on ice cream and salad as well as on tuna and salmon --- sweet/tart ratio is very good (the older products tend to be sweeter in my limited experience so perhaps the 12 year ageing is better for what we use it for). Value seemed good as compared with my local boutiques which sell higher end vinegar (can't find this stuff in your local grocery generally).",

Don't confuse this with the balsamic vinegar sold in grocery stores. This is aged and concentrated in wood barrels for decades so it is thick as syrup and has a wonderful sweet/sour/woody taste.
