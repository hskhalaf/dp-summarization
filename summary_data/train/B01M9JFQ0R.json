IMPORTANT: this will leak a little around the ankles and hands, but the water is absorbed into the neoprene sleeves. My core was completely dry. I find this totally acceptable. The other o'neill drysuit I owned (boost) would not absorb water and the rider would carry any water egress inside the suit. This new design is much improved. Size is snug. At 6' 170 I wore a large.",

The good part about this suit is that it fit great in the calves, forearms, and neck. I felt the standard drysuit zipper made the shoulders too stiff for prone paddling, but fine for standup paddling or waterskiing. Also the zipper requires a second person to help get on and off.",
