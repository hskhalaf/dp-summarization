I have worn them a few times at work and I spend a lot of my time on my feet, walking and standing. I wear inserts and my foot doesn't slide out of the shoe. I would recommended these to anyone and to specially to those who wear cheap shoes. Our feet deserve comfort and protection.",

So all in all, I loved the shoe. They just were made for me so I returned them.",
