    "description": "Inov8 F-Lite 230 Training Shoes The F-Lite 230 training shoe from Inov8 is the ultimate gym shoe; lightweight and breathable but durable and grippy, it is ideal for tackling intense CrossFit workouts with increased durability and versatility. Inov8 Shoe Fit Scale For technical footwear, a good fit is essential to enhance your performance. Inov8's new Shoe Fit Scale makes it easier to find the perfect fitting shoe. All Inov8 shoes are designed with Met-Cradle technology to lock down the mid-foot for a stable hold, where they differ is in the toe box. The shoes are now graded from 1 to 5, Grade 1 representing their closest, most precise fit and Grade 5 representing the widest fitting toe box. The lower the number on the scale, the narrower the fit, which ensures minimal internal movement of the foot when running fast on technical terrain. Shoes with the higher numbers on the scale will suit athletes with a wider foot and those wanting that extra comfort in the toe box. This wider toe box allows the toes to splay for increased stability when lifting heavy weights. It's also perfect for longer runs and races when toes begin to swell. Inov8 have graded the F-Lite 230 Training Shoes as Grade 2. Breathable Mesh Upper The upper of the F-Lite 230 is made from an incredibly lightweight mesh fabric. This allows you to train unrestricted and with full freedom of movement. The upper is constructed from an internally structured one piece, which allows the shoe to adapt to the situation it is in. The fabric used is highly breathable, which is crucial during intense training sessions. As well as allowing ventilation to the foot, cooling the wearer during exercise, the shoe allows sweat molecules to leave the skin and pass to the surface of the fabric, where it can then be evaporated. This results in the wearer being fresh and dry - and ready to tackle their session with maximum efficiency. Additionally, supporting the midfoot and securing lockdown the F-lite 230 utilis",
