So I got tired of buying Drano all the time. I searched for a better product and based on the reviews, I thought this might be it. I poured one side and left it overnight, then poured a large pot of boiling water, slowly down the drain. No change. I did the second half of the container the next night. Still no change. I would have to say for tub clogs, don't buy this one.",

Left it over night. Basically, it took repeated kettles of boiling water, poured down the drain, throughout the day, to get the drain to slowly drain. Eight hours. I think there isn't enough product to break up a clogged drain or else it isn't strong enough?",
