Once you learn the basic settings and remember to adjust the eyepiece and the objective lens, then the image comes into focus nicely. Several reviews that I had read stated that the service was not good but I had a representative write me and ask if there was any questions about my unit. I asked Mr. Oran about the updates that I was supposed to do and he checked my numbers and found that I had the latest updates installed. I wish the manual was better and explained the system operations a little better but Mr. Oran filled me in on that missing information.",

In my opinion, it's better than some FLIRs I've used. The WIFI is a very cool feature. Anyone who has the app and WIFI password can see what the unit sees on their phone or tablet. No more handing the unit over so that they can see what you were looking at. It's a great unit.",

I took it deer hunting and while I didnt see any deer that day, I was picking out squirrels at 75-100 yards. The squirrels showed up as pink dots so no definition but I had no idea the squirrels were there until I spotted them in the scope. I did become familiar with all controls before going to the woods.",

I write this review so you know what to expect when going afield. And don\u2019t even think about using rechargeable batteries, as they will tank twice as fast.
