A 33 gallon trash can a piece of plywood a screen and old shirt make that a no issue. As far as how the wood turns out... excellent. I use mine in the low speed mode and only take a small bit at a time, using Maple and oak I am still on the first set of blades. So feel confident that this is a good purchase, if your needs are similar to mine.",

If you're using a 4\" hose to collect the chips into a bag or can, be conscious of the noise the planer makes and how many chips are dropping down from the blade area. This is an indicator of the receptacle filing up. The blades on it usually leave a small ridge on the wood that easily sands away. Not much snipe with the tables on each side.

The blades are easily removed for replacement/sharpening as needed and it thins boards to as close to your exact thickness as any machine out there. Yes, it costs a few bucks more but your frustration level will disappear when you use this machine. Isn't THAT worth something?",

Makes the roller grip and the surface slick, so the wood feeds much easier. I have had it over a year, and really like it.

It does an excellent job of planing cherry, oak, maple hardwoods in the high speed mode. I have not used the fine finish mode yet, haven't needed to. I really like the preset thickness stops; you can plane down to standard thicknesses easily. It is pretty heavy so I do recommend a sturdy stand; locking casters on the stand could be essential if space is an issue.",

Will clean and sharpen knives and ordered another set oem. Changing knives is easy, but a little time consuming. Great planer for the price. See how it holds up in the long run. Update: this machine is still working great. Have put a lot of material through it with no issues. Knives are not difficult to change out. Would definitely recommend.",

Indoors, large, strong shop vac handles the shavings with ease, but will fill vac container fast. The entry and exit platforms make it much easier to load boards and receive them with reducing planing marks. It is a bit more expensive than a lot of other units, but the quality and handling seem well worth it.",

After minor adjustments to co-plane the infeed and outfeed tables and attaching the crank handle, this machine was ready to go. The DeWalt planer effortlessly took any piece of wood I could throw at it and left a wonderful, nearly no-sand finish, including in mildly figured hardwood. One feature I was VERY impressed with was the built-in chip blower. The blower was strong enough to take the vast majority of the shavings and push them through 10 feet of hose into my dust collector, while the collector was off. VERY impressive. Definitely a must-have if you want a great planer at a decent price",

Weight: 102\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe DEWALT DW735X 13-Inch, Three Knife, Two Speed Thickness Planer has a powerful 15 AMP, 20,000 RPM motor (10,000 RPM cutterhead speed) that handles larger cuts in wider materials with ease. The three knife cutter-head delivers 30% longer knife life and makes knife change faster and easier. The two speed gear box allows users to change feed speed to optimizing cuts per inch at 96 or 179 CPI. It has a fan-assisted chip ejection that vacuums chips off of the cutter-head and exhausts them out of the machine. With a 19-3/4\" cast aluminum base it is 2X more rigid than a standard 10\" base and folding tables. The automatic carriage lock reduces the movement that causes snipe without the need for manual engagement by the user. It also has a material removal gauge and extra-large thickness scale that deliver accurate cuts with every pass.
