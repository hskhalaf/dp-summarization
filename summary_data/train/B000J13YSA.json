If you\u2019re a 1/2 size I feel like they\u2019re going to be either to tight or to large no matter what you do, if you\u2019re an even number shoe size just go 1 size up and it should fit perfectly for you.",

The only downside, and I guess it's the way they are designed with not much heel, is they kinda slip in the back when you walk. Kind of a minor detail, as I'm not walking around the neighborhood in them, only around the house, BUT...I wish they didn't do that. All reviewers say that you have to break them in initially, and I agree with that. UGG makes a quality product, and as far as keeping your feet warm, during a Michigan winter, they do that perfectly!",

I HIGHLY recommend these slippers when you don't want to wear cheap slippers, but also don't want to wear sneakers in the house when just relaxing. Word of advice: Get the Scotchguard Nubuck and Suede Spray. The slippers are already water resistant, but the spray keeps them from getting scuffed or spot stained.",

The lining is nice and warm without making your feet sweat, the soles are great for the occasional trip to the woodpile, and they're all around very comfortable. The only gripe I have is that they're a little low on the heel so your foot lifts out a little when you walk, but that's more the consequence of buying slippers with low ankle coverage than an actual design flaw.",
