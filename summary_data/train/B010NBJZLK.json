I emailed a second time as well as putting a very poor review on their website. I have still not heard from AeroGarden!!! I guess they just ignore their customer with broken products.",

My wife sort of liked it when I gave it to her, it sat in the box for a while, but once she finally opened it and set it up, she has become obsessed. it's her new favorite toy. she wants to get the larger farm unit to start growing more and more. it's also a quite beautiful product line- so it's not only a functional / useful product, but also decorative. a terrific invention!",

I'd waited as long as the instructions told me to wait. Right now only THREE of the initial seven plants are growing and providing anything. The others either didn't take, etc. I'd watched this product for longer than I can remember and I finally caved in and tried one. I regret that. There is no magic here and it's not any easier than planting outside. It probably needs more than they really advertise to be successful. I wish I hadn't bought this product.",

I also bought some patio pepper seeds from another site. They haven't germinated yet, but I know from personal experience, that peppers can take about 3 weeks to germinate. All the plants that have germinated are looking good after a couple of weeks so I would definitely recommend this product. It's definitely worth it for anyone to be a little more self-sufficient.",
