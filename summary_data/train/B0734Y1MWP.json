Update: Looks like the descriptions have been updated to show the differences in shape between the 25.4 bar and the 31.8 one. Much clearer now; the 25.4 is the classic curved shape while the 31.8 is the ergo shape.",

I've never crashed or hit anything with the handlebars. Comfortable handlebars though and great value, just wouldn't recommend due to the bend. It was the left side drop that was bent outward about a half inch from center.",

My only complaint is that there aren't enough choices for the width of the bars as these are about an inch too narrow, though they work flawlessly besides that. I cannot fault the product for that though since I knew what the measurements were before I ordered it, but for the money this was a great purchase. I recommend it!",

One picture is with the bar aligned using the markings and the other picture is with it installed based on it's actual center. Using the markings in the \"middle\" of the bar, my handlebars were about 1cm off center. Did not notice until tape was on and trimmed. This is the only handlebar I've ever come across where this has been an issue. It's installed and fixed now, so im not going to worry about returning, but it still looks dumb and sloppy in an otherwise meticulous build. Would not recommend or buy again.",

I had put it on a bike I was converting and doing summer work on, so I didn\u2019t actually ride until after return window was over. Its just gonna be junk in the basement i guess",

Very light and feels, looks and performs amazing after wrapping them up in some tape. Only problem is that you can\u2019t add brakes on the flats If you wanted to. ( unless you do something unconventional and flip your breaks upside down with the lever pointing in instead of out? )",
