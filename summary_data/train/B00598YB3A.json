      "text": "So this is my second order of what I believed to be a perfect brace, and I got ripped off on the new model. They have added extra stitching around the hinges, but the reduced the amount of velcro on the top and bottom straps so you cannot get the same fit you had before, so if you wanted a tighter fit as I needed in my case, the brace doesn't stay secure and slides down my leg. So now I just lost time and money, because I can't return it. There should have been a notice that the model was changed this significantly that it affects the overall wear. Another cost saving measure gone wrong. Really disappointed.",

As sizing is based on knee circumference; those with bigger/muscular thighs and calves will simply not be able to adhere to the chart and must move up one size (at least). I viewed Amazon's return policy and cannot understand why I cannot exchange this for a larger size. It's never been used other than to quickly try on. You are best off going to your local sports store where you can touch and feel the product. Beware.",
