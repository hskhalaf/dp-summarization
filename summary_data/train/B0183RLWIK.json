      "text": "This is a high torque drill driver. Hold onto it tightly and when driving screws but very careful to start it slowly otherwise it will spin the driver bit (Phillips or pan-head) in the head of the screw stripping it. It takes practice and effort to start this drill slowly when driving screws. And yes, this is on the slower of the two speed settings. For drilling, the torque is great, just make certain you have tightened the drill bit into the chuck tightly otherwise the high torque might cause you to spin around the drill bit.",

Only downside is the batteries are WAY overpriced so save a bunch and get a generic.",

Upon opening the sealed Dewalt box I found it contained a Dewalt 710s1. This model is a 12v and costs less than half of the DCD 791B. The direction \"booklet\" supplied was a zeroxed DCD791B.
