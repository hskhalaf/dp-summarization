      "text": "The kit is cute and very good quality. Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because it doesn't come with directions. I bought this for my grandmother's 94th birthday. I often find pressed flowers or leaves in her old books. She has some dementia so she couldn't understand what it was, but today we opened the press after 4 weeks of waiting and we were both thrilled with the results! I bought \"create your own\" buttons for a couple bucks, took the pin out and we're using them as coasters. They look so beautiful, they don't even look real!",

But as an adult who wants to press flowers for crafts, this is PERFECT. It is somewhat small, so it doesn't take up a lot of space, but still allows you to press quite a quantity of plants at a time. Would definitely recommend.",

I was also disappointed to see that it only had paper and cardboard inside. I was expecting felt and linen paper in addition. You could make one of these yourself easily. Maybe my standards are too high :(",

In 1975 The Moulin Roty Toy Company launched 2 toys: a car made of wood and sponge, and a soft rag doll named \"la douillette\" that charmed everyone with its originality. In 1980 Moulin Roty became a worker-owned cooperative. To ensure the development and the durability of the company, the founding members adopted the status of co-op (SCOP in French) to preserve the founding values of the brand: solidarity, sharing and respect.\n\nMaterials\n\nMoulin Roty searches for the very best materials, selecting most of their fabrics from France and the rest from Europe because of their design and technical quality, as well as their non-toxicity. (Oeko-Tex certified). All solid wood used, mainly beech wood, comes from forests that are managed ecologically and that respect quotas for felling and re-planting.",
