VERY good sound. 4-5 hours is reasonable battery length (portable batteries are cheap now, folks, so you can easily double the battery life). You can charge it the same way you charge your phone. Bluetooth works fine for a very reasonable distance. Solidly built and a pleasing design, you cannot go wrong. Add to that the Logitech reputation for quality products, and there you have it. Now, go buy one.",

I can use it with my iPhone to make audiobooks and music sound great, and sound loud enough that I can move around a room, or even into another room, and hear the book/music. I can also hardwire it to my laptop so I can hear TV shows etc. in stereo. And I can use it to amplify the iPhone speaker on phone calls, a godsend when my husband and I are both participating on a phone call.",

Thus, louder bass notes are artificially silenced resulting in dull lifeless music. The mid-range and treble notes are clear and precise with very little distortion, but this speaker has a way of removing much of the joy I normally experience from my favorite music. I recommend spending more on a speaker if you value high quality playback from your portable speaker. This is the first time a Wirecutter review has left me feeling disappointed.",

Not great, but well enough to have some fun.",
