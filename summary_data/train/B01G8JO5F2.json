I like that I can talk on the phone using them. I have small ears so it was a concern for me that they would fall off. I went to the gym and tested them out and they worked out great. I have wore them around the house for 3 hours at a time and they didn't cause any pain or soreness. Score! I purchased the extended warranty to go along with them too. My husband is considering buying a pair too. Awesome buy!",

The company was very responsive and good about replacing them. However the second pair only lasted a month before it completely stopped working. So I am retracting my previous review which is below: Headphones are pretty good. Sound quality is great, they don't tangle and they fit comfortably. Only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because I never know how much battery life I have left. I wish when you either turned it off or on the voice would inform you. Otherwise I love them.",

It's also a pain to have to curve them around my ear every time I would want to wear them. These earphones are made for people with average to large ears. They are also very clunky and look super dated. If you have smaller ears, and want something that looks nice, do not purchase these. I was duped by all the good reviews... do not believe the hype.",

They died faster than usual and won't accept a charge. No red or blue light when plugged in to USB. Tried multiple cables and ports. No damage, no water damage, well taken care of. They just stopped working. Would give them a 5 star if they didn't break. Your mileage may vary, but I guess you get what you pay for.",

I work out for an hour and I can use these for 5-6 consecutive days in the gym. Since I use it only for this purpose, it's a great product for me and for the price. For relaxing, I prefer wired earphones because of the amazing quality that you just can't beat. Hope this helps someone.",

      "text": "One of the best purchases I've ever made on Amazon. Comfortable, great sound, surprisingly long battery life. They stay on with no problem while exercising. They even come with a nice little zip up hard case for storage. Sometimes connecting them to my iPhone can be a little tricky, but nothing that can't be fixed with a quick switch of Bluetooth on and off. Highly recommended. Edit: Just wanted to add that you can also pause, adjust volume, and even skip forward/backward (used on Spotify) with the buttons right on the headphones. I believe they have other functionality that I've yet to use, as well. Very convenient.",

      "text": "I can't comment on noise canceling or moisture wicking. I bought these earbuds so I could answer phone calls while I'm moving around the house or somewhere where the phone can be near me. I'm tired of holding the phone up to talk into the speaker and really don't like holding it up to my ear anymore. So far, so good. I like the earbuds; they're comfortable to wear and I can hear my callers well. For what it's worth, I love the nifty case they came with. That's quite an extra bit of swag for the money.",

      "text": "These have been fantastic for over a couple of months now. I have only had them die on me once, and they have been able to hold charge for at least 5 days at the gym @ 2hrs a day. I have also taken them snowboarding and survived an 8 hour day. They have been exposed to hot, cold, sweat, rain, and still keep on kicking. The only thing I do not like is that bluetooth can be a little spotty to connect to if you are using multiple devices. They have been difficult to use between my phone and computer in the sense of getting them to pair correctly.",

      "text": "If I put the earloop over my ear, the earbud part doesn't fit into my ear canal and rests outside of it. I'm using the smallest tips, but it seems the angle of the hook relative to the angle of the earbud portion are not correct for my ear. If the hook could be positioned in different positions I could probably make them work, but since the point of these is the earhook I'm only giving these 3 stars. The earhook holds them in place, but the sound isolation is poor due to them not going into my ear.",
