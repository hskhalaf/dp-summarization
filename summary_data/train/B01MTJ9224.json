If LuxHaus ever decides to make a new run without the engraved logo on the side and improved calibration of the tamp, then I would reconsider.",

Usually if something goes wrong with a pull it's because I messed up and overfilled the portafilter, or didn't verify that the puck was even. Overall, I would say this is a cheap and easy way to make a big impact in the quality of your espresso.",
