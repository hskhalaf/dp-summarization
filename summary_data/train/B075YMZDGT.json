The pictures are the left and right sides of my head where I've never had much hair growth. The bottom was about 3-4 weeks after I started using the shampoo and taking biotin.",

Also, it is not very cost effective since I needed to use a lot to even create enough foams. I liked the smell, but that was about what I could say. Not for me.",

I\u2019ve used it as well and my hair felt very clean and refreshed afterwards-although I have super thick hair and don\u2019t actually need it, but I wanted personal experience with it.

    "description": "3HC STIMULATION COMPLEX \u2013 This blend of plant-derived ingredients has been clinically shown to stimulate hair growth and hair regrowth by promoting the proliferation of HFDPC cells, the stem cells responsible for regulating hair follicle development, increasing the number of growing fibers, increasing follicle lifespan and preventing hair loss.* In clinical trials of alopecia patients using dermatologist conducted pull tests (clinical method used to estimate amount of hair loss), the analysis showed a reduction in hair loss of 21% over a 3-week period.*\n\nTIME-TESTED BASE SHAMPOO \u2013 Vitamin E, Coconut Oil, Rosemary Oil, Green Tea Extract, Vitamin B Panthenol, Biotin and Keratin, this volumizing shampoo cleanses and protects, making a perfect choice for overall hair regrowth, hair repair and hair regrowth for men and women, shampoo for oily hair, straight hair and even curly hair products.*\n\nANAGEN VS. TELOGEN \u2013 3HC has the unique ability to increase the ratio of anagen (growth phase) to telogen (resting/dying phase) hair, which keeps follicles in a more constant state of growth.* By keeping a larger percentage of hair in the growth phase and preventing hair from entering resting phase, the body will continually encourage hair growth.* After treatment with 3% 3HC a 31% increase in the anagen/telogen ratio was realized in just 60 days.*\n\nTHE SCIENCE OF AMINO KERA NPNF \u2013 Combination of Keratin-derived amino acids designed for deeper penetration than other Keratin ingredients due to its molecular weight distribution, it has been clinically proven to provide immediate & long-term strengthening.* In lab tests, hair treated with 2% Amino Kera NPNF conditioner showed an immediate 10% increase in strength (defined as total work required to break hair) vs. placebo conditioner and a 41% increase after 3 applications.*",
