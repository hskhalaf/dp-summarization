Videos are going to experience sound issues unless camera is held super steady or by using a tripod. Otherwise, video recordings may have internal gears, focusing and stabilization noises picked up. As far as a good compact pocket digital camera...which can certainly perform as well as most Bulky SLR's...this is a good one to consider. The side menu is not such a bad idea. Other complained , It is a non issue. The zoom X 8 as well as extreme close up are excellent. Great quality over all. Made in China vs. earlier models always from Japan.",

She couldn't be happier as it's just as compact as her old Sony (meaning that it's always in her pocketbook) is even easier to use, has a larger LCD viewing screen, a more powerful zoom lens and a better flash. Plus, it's pink and that just thrills her. The added resolution is just an added bonus and she's now taking more pictures than ever, even signed up for a photography class at the local high school that has taught her a lot about composition, lighting, depth of field, etc. Highly recommended",

The ELPH 310 delivers faster focusing and excellent image stability. It offers other movie features as well, which other reviewers can describe. I took a few hand held shots in my workshop with poor lighting, and the images were sharp. The MENU button has moved. So far I've not found out how to delete all images. I miss the eye level viewer feature of the SD1200. The ELPH 310 offers only the LCD screen. Too bad. That's why I give it four stars. If anyone finds how to delete all images, please contact me.",

We both ended up with the same problem with the shutter getting stuck and the camera not able to work at all afterwards. I sent my camera back to Canon for service within the 1 year warranty, and it came back to me with a $189 service charge for a refurbished camera. Clearly a manufacturing defect, but they wouldn't cover the charges. So disappointed in this model and Canon service.",

Some of the mechanical functions have slowed a bit, so I purchased the ELPH 310 for Christmas. Wow, what a difference!! It is smaller and the LED is much larger, so I have to hold it differently, but the changes are worth it. The video function is easier to use because it has a dedicated button and you can zoom while you are recording. On still shots, the software recognizes faces and adjusts brightness to compensate for shadow. I've only had it a short while, so am still learning. No complaints yet.",

Pros - + Lots of nice features (many different settings to optimize photos, e.g., low light, foliage, portrait, action) + Small and light + Good zoom + Quick to start up + Colors are great -- vivid, even in low light Cons - - Features list is a little hard to access, but you figure it out - Not much else...

      "text": "Had this camera now for about a week, pictures come out ok but nothing special. Settings are quite difficult and limited if you do not stick with auto, which take decent pictures but not great pictures. Main reason for sending camera back is that lens cover does not close all the way by itself and this is the exact problem that caused my previous Canon to be useless within a few months due to scratches on the lens and dust inside lens. A feature that I will miss are the 3 second video clips that are taken with every shot if you set it to that function. Would be an ok camera if it was around $100.",

You have to remove the battery and put it in the wall to charge. I'm not sure if there are other chargers you can buy separately but for traveling this kind isn't very convenient. Other then that it's a great camera. Highly highly recommend.",

My only complaint is the cover to the outlet for the cord to connect to the computer. It is way too tight - a real pain in the butt to manoeuver it around to insert the plug. Also not easy to open. But for the above, I would have given it a 5 star rating.",

    "title": "Canon PowerShot ELPH 310 HS 12.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 8x Wide-Angle Optical Zoom Lens and Full 1080p HD Video (Silver)",
    "description": "Color:SilverThis is a must-have camera for anyone looking for some underwater fun! The camera features a water-proof outershell as well as a DIGIC 4 Image Processor that has evolved face detection technology that tracks the faces of moving subjects & lets the shooter enter the frame seamlessly with the face detection self-timer.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n ELPH 310 A Masterpiece of Design and Technology \n\nUltra-Slim, Elegant Design \n\n\n At a slim 0.87 inches, the PowerShot ELPH 310 HS digital camera is super-thin, making it a perfect choice for those who desire a small camera that fits easily in a pocket. With five cool metallic colors to choose from (Purple, Blue, Pink, Green and Silver), there is a PowerShot ELPH 310 HS that fits your style. \n\n8x Optical Zoom with 28mm Wide-Angle Lens \n Despite its slim profile, the PowerShot ELPH 310 HS houses a powerful Genuine Canon 8x Optical Zoom Lens that delivers outstanding optical performance and versatility. The zoom starts at 28mm wide-angle and extends to 224mm telephoto (35mm equivalent), covering a wide and highly useful range. The telephoto reach gives you the freedom to capture subjects from afar, while the 28mm wide-angle makes it easy to shoot sweeping landscapes, large groups of people and tall buildings.\n\n\n\n \n\nOptical Image Stabilizer \n\nHandheld shooting can often lead to camera shake, making photos and videos blurry. Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer is a sophisticated system that uses lens-shift technology to correct for unwanted camera movement. It makes handheld photography more practical in more shooting situations, providing excellent image quality in many difficult situations: outdoors at dusk, inside without a flash, and even at the telephoto end of the zoom range without a tripod. For photos, it enables shooting at slower shutter speeds, accommodating more low-light shooting situations than ever before without having to boost ISO sensitivity. With camera shake and vibration reduced, you get a sharper, steadier image. And because it is an optical system, there is none of the image degradation typical with electronic image stabilizers. \n\nExperience the Power \n\nCanon HS SYSTEM \n\nThe Canon HS SYSTEM lets you take bright, clear photos in an even wider range of shooting situations. Beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas. The system is the result of two technologies brought together in PowerShot cameras: a high-sensitivity imaging sensor, which is able to capture more light; and the DIGIC Image Processor, which actively reduces noise with high-speed image processing. The 12.1 Megapixel CMOS sensor in the PowerShot ELPH 310 HS incorporates advanced light reception technology that enhances sensitivity. The DIGIC 4 Image Processor provides a major boost in noise reduction, expanding the usable ISO range to an amazing high of 3200. The Canon HS SYSTEM takes the frustration out of low-light shooting, delivering clear, blur-free images.\n\nCanon DIGIC 4 Image Processor \n\nCanon DIGIC Image Processors have set the standard for functionality and performance since their groundbreaking introduction in 1999. With each successive generation, DIGIC processors have brought elevated performance and powerful new features to PowerShot digital cameras. The DIGIC 4 processor has ushered in a new level of picture quality and accelerated processing, making possible features such as high-speed continuous shooting, Full HD video and Face Detection Self-timer. New, more powerful noise reduction algorithms also provide improved low-light capture. \n\nMemorable Moments in Spectacular Full HD \n\nCanon Full HD Video Advantage \nIn addition to the Canon HS SYSTEM, the combination of the advanced CMOS sensor and DIGIC 4 Image Processor in the PowerShot ELPH 310 HS makes it possible to shoot crisp, clear high definition video. Imagine the fun and excitement of being able to shoot spectacular 1080p Full HD video with stereo sound that you can later watch on your HDTV or download to your computer to share with family and friends. In addition to being able to shoot Full HD 1080p video at 24* frames per second, the PowerShot ELPH 310 HS can also shoot 720p HD video at 30** frames per second. *Actual frame rate is 23.976 fps.\n ** Actual frame rate is 29.97 fps.\n\nHDTV Playback via HDMI with CEC Support \n \n\n It's easy to enjoy and share the videos you shoot with the PowerShot ELPH 310 HS. Simply connect its HDMI terminal to your HDTV using an HDMI cable. And because the PowerShot ELPH 310 HS supports HDMI-CEC technology, you\u00edll be able to control the playback of your images and videos on any CEC-enabled HDTV using the TV\u00eds remote control. (CEC \u00f1 Consumer Electronic Control \u00f1 is part of the HDMI specification, enabling components in a system to communicate with one another.) \n\n \n\niFrame Movie Support \n \n\n \n\nWith the PowerShot ELPH 310 HS, you can also shoot video in the Apple iFrame format, which is a computer-friendly standard that speeds up importing and editing of videos. It keeps file sizes small, making it more convenient to upload or e-mail high-quality videos. The iFrame format enjoys native support in compatible Mac and Windows video applications, making it unnecessary to perform time-consuming and often quality-degrading conversions. \n\n \n\n\nA PowerShot that Keeps Up with the Action \n\nHigh-Speed Burst Mode \n Capture amazing action shots like the pros with the PowerShot ELPH 310 HS camera. Using High-Speed Burst mode,* you can shoot at exceptionally high speeds \u00f1 8.7 frames per second. It\u00eds a great feature for those who enjoy taking pictures at sporting events. High-Speed Burst is also an excellent way to make sure you capture that perfect instant in time when shooting any moving subject. \n\n *Image resolution is 1984 x 1488 pixels when shooting in High-Speed Burst mode. \n\nSuper Slow Motion Movie \n The Super Slow Motion Movie mode* on the PowerShot ELPH 310 HS gives you a fun and useful option when shooting videos. It records video clips at a very high speed \u00f1 up to approximately 240 frames per second. When the clips are played at normal speed (30 fps), the action is dramatically slower. This video shooting mode can be used to capture memorable plays at sporting events or to analyze and study motion. \n\n *Records 640 x 480 pixels at 120 fps and 320 x 420 pixels at 240 fps. \n\n\nA Steady Image Is a Beautiful Image \n\nIntelligent IS \n The latest advance in Canon Optical Image Stabilization technology, Intelligent IS analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation. For stills, the system automatically selects among Normal, Panning, Macro (Hybrid) and Tripod IS modes. When shooting video, the system automatically selects among Dynamic, Powered, Macro and Tripod IS modes. With Intelligent IS, you can concentrate on image capture, letting the camera make the most effective IS settings to assure the steadiest possible image.\n\n\nNormal\nCorrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills. Panning\nPanning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement. Hybrid\nCorrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting. Dynamic\nEffective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking. Powered\nCompensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified. Tripod\nWhen tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed. \nSee Everything Brilliantly \n\nPureColor LCD System \n The PowerShot ELPH 310 HS digital camera\u00eds large and bright 3.0-inch PureColor LCD screen makes it easy to view and frame your shots in high resolution (461,000 dots).\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n PureColor technology delivers excellent contrast with rich, true-to-life color. Moreover, you can view the LCD screen over a surprisingly wide angle \u00f1 above, below or to either side \u00f1 without color shifts and with minimal reflections. A scratch-proof hard coating and a dust-repellent fluorine coating ensure a durable screen that dependably displays clear, vibrant images. \n\n \n\n\nA Smarter Camera Means Better Photos and Videos \n\nSmart AUTO \n Photographers of all levels appreciate a camera \u00f1 especially a go-anywhere compact digital \u00f1 that takes the hassle out of capturing beautiful images. The PowerShot ELPH 310 HS gives you Smart AUTO \u00f1 sophisticated Canon technology that makes getting that great shot as simple as pressing the shutter button. Smart AUTO automatically detects scenes by assessing various factors in both the background and the subject. Detected scenes are analyzed using 32 predefined shooting situations. The camera then makes optimal settings to ensure the best possible image capture, whether you\u00edre shooting stills or video. Smart AUTO also includes Advanced Subject Detection, which allows the camera to detect and track non-human moving subjects like animals and vehicles. \n\n\nShooting Modes/Special Scene Modes \n\nSmart AUTO The camera automatically selects the best shooting settings for optimal quality based on subjects and environmental factors to provide point-and-shoot simplicity. Program \nThe camera automatically and intelligently selects the aperture/shutter speed combination based on the shooting conditions. Movie Digest Records a video clip before capturing a still image and then combines one day\u2019s worth of clips into a video. Handheld Night Scene Take clear and steady pictures at night without the use of a tripod. Super Vivid Super Vivid intensifies existing hues, saturating the scene with bright colors. Color Accent Choose to retain a single color in your image while other colors turn monochrome. Low Light For high quality image capture in an amazing range of dimly-lit situations. Portrait Brings the subject into focus while beautifully blurring the background. Kids & Pets The camera reduces focus time so you won\u2019t miss those special shots. Color Swap Select a color and replace it with a color you specify for special effects. Beach Get clear shots of people at a sunny beach without darkened faces. Foliage Capture brilliant shots of autumn foliage, greenery and blossoms. Smart Shutter The camera automatically takes the photo when people smile, wink, or get into frame. High-Speed Burst Captures rapid action frame by frame, by shooting continuously at a high speed while the shutter button is held down. Best Image Selection Shoots five consecutive images then chooses the best one based on the image information. Snow Shoot clear snow scenes without darkened subjects or an unnatural bluish tint. Fireworks Create brilliant images of skyrocketing fireworks. Stitch Assist Easy-to-use guidelines simplify the shooting of aligned multiple frames that can later be combined (using bundled software) to create panoramic photos. Long Shutter\nUse the blur moving subjects for artistic effect, ideal for urban night photography\nFishe Effect\nNow you can get the fisheye effect of a classic photographic distortion of a fisheye lens.\nMiniature Effect Give images a miniature look with an effect that emphasizes perspective by blurring the top and bottom of the image. Toy Camera Effect Simulates photos taken with toy or pinhole cameras, darkening the image at the edges to create a vignette effect. Poster Effect Poster Effect combines several similar shades into one color, turning subtle gradations into eye-catching, scene-popping contrasts. Monochrome Choose from three single-tone effects: Black-and-White, Sepia, or Blue. iFrame Movie The Apple\u00ae movie format, iFrame, makes it easier and quicker to import and upload videos while retaining high image quality. Super Slow Motion Movie Record your clips in high speed (approx. 240 fps), and then watch your videos in slow motion. \n\nHigh-Speed Burst \nThe camera shoots continuously at a high speed of approx. 8.7 fps while you hold down the shutter.\n\nMiniature Effect for Movies & Stills \nEmphasizes perspective for a miniature effect by blurring upper and bottom portions of videos and stills. \n\nSuper Slow Motion Movie \nRecord your clips in high speed (approx. 240 fps), and then watch your videos in slow motion.  Actual results may vary from examples shown above. Final image may vary depending on picture composition. \n\nEasily Turn Your Memories into Videos \n\nMovie Digest \nCreating a video* containing highlights of a family vacation or an important occasion is a lot easier than you might think. When you use Movie Digest on the PowerShot ELPH 310 HS, the camera will automatically record a short video clip (up to approximately 4 seconds) every time you shoot a still image. That entire day\u2019s worth of clips will then be automatically combined into a single video. Movie Digest does all the work, so you can sit back and enjoy your video! \n *Movie Digest videos are recorded at VGA resolution and 30 fps. \n\n\nEasier, More Enjoyable Photography \n\nFace Detection Technology including Smart Shutter \nSpecial Scene Modes \nBest Image Selection",
