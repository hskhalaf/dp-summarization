As you can see from my pictures, the product did wonders to it! Pictures shown is just my first time using it. I can't wait to use it a second time to get my items even brighter and restore it.",

If you are using on something dyed like a jacket, purse or furniture test it in a spot you can't see first.

I've used it on 3 expensive Corbin motorcycle seats where they dye it properly because it's exposed to the elements and it made them look better than they did new. I've used them on my cars leather interior again treated properly because it's exposed to UV rays and it gave amazing results. It's a great product and so is the conditioner.",

The cleaner removed a lot of grime as I went through five rags that were stained brown. I bought the 8 oz size and mixed in a spray bottle. The conditioner is called honey for good reason. It goes on thick and sticky but covers a lot of surface area. I bought the 16oz size but maybe used 20%. You must wait overnight for it to get absorbed. Make sure you wipe it off and go back three/four times to remove all conditioner. Highly recommend this cleaner/conditioner.",

Pros: -easy to mix -does leave any residues after application -32oz is good for many applications -dries fairly quickly. I sprayed the solution on a towel first then applied to the leather.

There are tons of opinions out there, but I decided to go with this product because of its longevity and solid reviews. I cleaned it several times because my cloth kept coming away dirty despite the fact the chair appeared to be clean. A few days later I followed with their conditioner. The products were easy to use, effective, mild on my hands, and did not have a strong odor. The chair looks great!",
