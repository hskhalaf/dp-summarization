Especially at this price!!!! However, as others said, the sound is too low for video recording and the camera is noisy. I really wish it had worked for me. It had a great zoom lens. So many wonderful features!!!!! Now, I have a camera bag & rechargeable batteries that I don't need. I had high hopes that were dashed and I returned the camera.",

      "text": "Nice, lightweight camera that takes great photos without having to lug around extra lenses and equipment. More options to take photos than traditional point-and-shoot digital cameras. Download the manual and read how to use everything to get the most out of it. I practiced for a while at home before taking it to Alaska. I especially like that you can switch from the digital screen to a more traditional viewfinder because it's hard to see the screen in bight sunlight. The digital telephoto is also great, zooms in much closer than most small point-and-shoot cameras. Also a good idea to get rechargeable batteries and a charger so you'll always have batteries ready to use.",

I can not say enough good things about this camera! The pictures are awesome! I brag about it to everyone and spread the word about the price and where to find it...Amazon.com ROCKS! Seriously, I love this camera!",

When I saw this deal with the camera, especially a GE brand I was skeptical (GE making cameras??!!!!). Anyway after checking out the specs I was convinced that it could be a good camera. I was not disappointed. The pictures are clear and the function of the camera is easy. Some camers give a blur when the zoom is used, but this one is just wonderful. Great buy!",
