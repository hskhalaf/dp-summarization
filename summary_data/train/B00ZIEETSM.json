      "text": "I started wearing these four years ago and loved them. A 5-star product -- well-made, durable, comfortable, washes out quickly. Then I recently bought two more, just to have in reserve. There has been a design change: the panel is still two thicknesses of material, BUT they are NOT sewn together at the front. I suppose it saves money in manufacturing. It could be intended to make the layer next to the body more flexible. But it's a poor design for anyone that uses a pantyliner or similar item, because the pantyliner doesn't stay in place. I returned both pairs and will not buy more.",

I'm 5'5\", a bottom-heavy 130 (muscular legs/hips), waist about 27\" and hips about 38-39\" and size medium fits snugly without pinching. Perfect for wearing under basketball shorts! They're also great for hot weather; they breathe well and seem to wick sweat effectively.",

Fabric is light and comfy. They will give you a visible panty line but the way they are cut makes it a little less noticeable (leg holes sort of follow the natural crease under your butt, granny panty style). They are pretty pricey but if you need an athletic panty I recommend these for comfort and no wedgies.",

Only complaint is when pulling them up the waist band part feels a little too tight (like not quite enough stretch) and this is my normal size. But once they are pulled up they feel fine and do not constrict me. Not sure I will buy this style again but I do love this brand!",
