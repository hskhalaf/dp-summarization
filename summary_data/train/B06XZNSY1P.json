I bought this as an alternative to the bigger camping chair. The positives is that it is super light and fits into it's tiny carrying case. If you position yourself right it can be pretty comfortable. It feels like its not sturdy, but it is designed to hold up to 300lbs. The downfall is that it is really low to the ground, so if you have issues getting up and down, this is not the chair for you.",

I have taken it out to quite a few soccer games and one campout and it has been a very nice, light and easy accessory that is not hard to pack around. It seems to be very well made, at least comparable to the much more expensive Big Agnes Helinox chair which is more than four times as much. This is a great little chair. I am 6'1\" and 185lbs and it fits me well. It is not a deep chair, nor does it have a high back; so don't expect that type of comfort. However, I can sit quite comfortably in it without any problems.",
