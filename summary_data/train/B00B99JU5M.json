Works exactly as the old one, and I trust this model more than those new ones. You can go read the reviews yourself and make and informed decision, but I personally would take these every time IMO. I notice the SSD aspects of it start to kick in once I've played a few days with a game. Boot times decrease pretty decently, among other expected performance boosts. I love these things, hope they innovate more in the future. I cant afford a 3TB SSD, but I CAN afford one of these babies.",

Especially if you boot a few times in a row, you can tell from the performance increase that it is running from SSD... basically what it already has loaded in cache, so it makes it was faster.

Unfortunately, Seagate thinks since it seeks so quickly, 5400RPMs is fine. I have a 5400RPM and a 7200RPM SSHD and I can absolutely confirm the 7200 is significantly faster. Still, this works very well. Don't believe ALL the hype: an SSD will function faster in use, but this is significantly cheaper and still quick enough that, to me, it's not worth the price difference to get an SSD.",

Overall the drive runs great, there's no bad sectors so far, and doesn't make a lot of noise. It's quite fast, and definitely worth the price.

And i saw this 1TB Drive which was under $100.00 I installed and my computer runs at twice the speed compared to my older Drive. I am running Mac OSX Snow leopard with around 900 App's on 1 Partition, OSX 10.9.2 Mavericks on 2nd Partition and so far Installed some app's and some games and this Drive has no Issues and runs like charm. I would say this was good investment.",

And logging into the user account is pretty snappy too, depending upon how many things you have start up. Loading applications is definitely faster, though not as fast as a solid state drive or internal flash storage. In reality, you can't beat the price of these drives for the increase in performance.
