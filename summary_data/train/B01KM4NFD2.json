This watch does that plus extra features. Weather alerts, pedometer, sleep tracking, calories and alerm features. As of now the app market still functions. At first I had issues installing the update, but I left the house and ran the update strictly on my phone's data and it went through while driving. It's a quite simple smart watch, I like this product more than my Samsung and Motorola smart watches.",

My Pebble One still works great but after 3 years with it I figured it was time for an upgrade. The microphone on the Pebble Two works great and makes sending quick text messages so much easier.

I charge this every 7 days but have pushed it to 9 days. Fitbit purchased Pebble but does not offer a similarly designed smartwatch in their catalog. There is a market for eInk, function-over-bloat, weekly charging, mid to small form factor smartwatches.",

Essential for me, as a teacher, are the phone and text notifications-- I can glance at my watch to see who's calling or texting, without having to take out my phone. The only complaint that I have is that Pebble was bought by FitBit, which is scrapping it. Poor decision to do so, as the Pebble, while perhaps not for everyone (it's not flashy, doesn't have a touch screen, is B&W), fills a niche very well. I am very happy with it!",

Water resistant, extremely long battery life (several days without charging), display is easily readable in any lighting condition, and the list goes on. I wanted a smartwatch to count my steps and give me notifications without touching my phone..and this thing does that plus more. I love how i can reply to texts using simple words, emojis, or my voice! It's also really convenient that there's buttons to control this watch because touchscreens can be annoying sometimes.",

I caved in and bought it when Amazon dropped it to 50% off even though my Pebble 1 was fine, but this is better in every way. Smaller profile, fantastic battery life, better support for animations, sleep tracking, step counting, multiple vibration patterns for notifications, and the voice to text actually works really well! Well worth it",
