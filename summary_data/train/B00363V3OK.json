Not only that, when I was testing it out, I kept pulling these little plastic pieces out. Kinda like down feathers that poke through, but plastic hairs! I'll attach a picture.

Not a bad thing, just noteworthy because big people like to camp too (at 5'8 and around 200lbs i had no problems but there wasnt a ton of space...).

Material on the inside feels cheap, the sacks they come in will never be used again due to my inability to roll them small enough, and I find the hook and tie mechanism that comes attached to them not easy to use or largely functional. Not my favorite sleeping bag, but I kept them because you can zip two together and they perform the basic functions I need. Tested down to 38 degrees F, and kept warm.",

This sleeping bag seems to be of excellent quality, and I was able to snag it at an amazing price. The only down side is that the sleeping bag did not come boxed, so it won't be the easiest thing to wrap (hello, gift sack!). Regardless, I know it will be a big hit at Christmas!

The no-snag zipper is a joke, wished they just used a normal zipper. The stuff sacks aren't even a joke because you'll never get the bag back into it - even with it fully expanded.
