A reviewer did comment that these retro high-top basketball shoes seem to be too heavy and bulky to play ball in. Still, it appears that these retro Nike basketball shoes are for old sneakerheads who love the distinct look of 90\u2019s sneakers. Dennis Rodman fans who have been patiently waiting for a legit reissue of the Nike Air Darwin should definitely grab a pair of these basketball shoes.",

What I will say is that when I tried other Nike shoes that look like this style, they did not have the same cushioning or comfort. I will say that I\u2019ve bought about seven pairs of these so I can definitely say that I recommend them. I do a lot of athletic classes and the first time I put them on I was like, wow this give me an advantage. They look great and are very comfortable comfortable.",

Peoples reviews are correct that it is tight at the top of the sneaker, you have to put effort to put your foot in. But once it loosens up after a couple days its fine. I wouldnt recommend a bigger size unless you have a wide foot because they will break in. Highly recommend.",
