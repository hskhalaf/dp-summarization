Our room was in marked contrast with a beautiful display.",

Autofocus, keystone, etc. makes it a breeze to set up. The only downside is that it ships with a CD with the drivers. Since many laptops today skip the CD drive, you have to be smart enough to go to the website the download the drivers. Don't confuse this with the cheap (sub $150) projectors. I tried two of them and there is absolutely no comparison. They are not meant for a professional presentation. This one is.",

It comes with all the cords a remote and a thin bag to carry everything. This was definitely worth the purchase. I also checked the price of the bulb for future reference and its not too bad.",

And I concur with all of them. Great resolution, bright display, easy to use, compact, etc. The common negative feedback I saw was that the fan was loud. Someone equated it to a hair dryer when in \"normal\" mode. I find the fan to be completely acceptable, not loud at all in the \"normal\" mode. And like others, agree it is nearly silent in the power save mode. The fan noise is no problem for me. Highly recommended!",

The machine has gotten quite hot while I was watching a movie and the noise of the cooling fan (?) was a bit annoying. The image was not very clear when I set the projector about 3 m apart from the screen (and the screen width was also around 3m). I can watch the video and read subtitle well enough but it is difficult to read the title of the folder or file on the computer screen.",
