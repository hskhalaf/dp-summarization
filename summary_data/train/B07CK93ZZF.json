      "text": "We have a Yamaha Aventage RX-A780 receiver as the driver for a 5.1 home theater system. We were hoping to include these as the wireless surround sound component; however, we found them nearly impossible to set up. I say \"nearly\" since some reviewers found a way (e.g.15 step process to hard wire the initial set up). The instructions for the RX-A780 and the Musiccast focus on connecting phones and other devices, not so much connecting their own receiver. Our package did not include any user manual. Went to the internet for that. Sent these back. We don't need the aggravation.",

UPDATE: after doing a factory reset on all Yamaha items, I was able to get them setup. If you are going to use these with your Yamaha Home Theater system, it is important to set up your receiver first.",
