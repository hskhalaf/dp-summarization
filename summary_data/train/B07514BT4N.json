Unfortunately, there were few pagers actually working during the event. More pager couldn't react as we pressed the numbers on the keypad base. We got checked afterward that there was no issue about the \"calling range\", as we put those non-functional pagers near the transmitter, there was still nothing happened.",

We purchased 3 of these systems and they have worked out really well. Their success has led to our other locations purchasing 3 units. That alone is an endorsement of the product. Not only did we purchase we repeated the purchase multiple times. We did have a couple of pagers that did not vibrate but the company quickly sent us replacement units to correct the issue. Super easy dealing with them and they stand behind their product. We have been using the systems for roughly 3 months and the pagers are handed out all day every day.",

They have been amazing, high tech, far reaching, and extremely cost effective. We simply type in a pager number onto the order ticket, and when done, staff punches the number into the keypad and the guests come out to get their food. Easy stuff. Cons: Two of the pucks no longer work at all, and one other has a faulty digital readout so that the \"8\" reads like a \"U\"... other than that, we will continue to use and recommend to others.",
