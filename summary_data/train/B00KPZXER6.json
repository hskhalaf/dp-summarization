This oil didn\u2019t taste right.. it is most likely rancid or has an additive. It is more viscous and made both my husband and I sick to our stomach. In this case I\u2019m going back to the more expensive brand. We can see and feel the difference. Beware this product is quite inferior or no quality control and it is rancid. What is NOW foods going to do to correct this? My neighbor also bought some and she got sick too!",
