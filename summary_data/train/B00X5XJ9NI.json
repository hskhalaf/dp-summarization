Liked it so much bought one for my son because he lives in his basement and is redoing it while renting the upstairs and only had a microwave so now he can cook eggs roast chicken etc. and he loves it as well and I just keep forwarding the recipes to him as like I say I cook everything in this cooker now.",

I have not cooked in it yet, but expect it will work as it is supposed to. Will update if it doesnt.",

My previous slow cookers have been cylinders, this one allows me to view the food spread out across the book, making it easier to check its condition. Additionally, the lid fits well and is made of glass- some these days are plastic. I've used this for two meals so far- pot roast with potatoes and carrots, which came out slightly under-cooked, and BBQ chicken, which came out perfect. Overall this is a great product, and I hope to try the other cooking options soon.",

Perhaps it's the anticpiation as you smell the food for hours before you can eat it. By adding some more heat settings for this unit, you retain all of the good things about a crock pot and add the convenience of cooking faster if you want. In addition, this thing is very good sized so you can cook a ton of stuff in here. That also means that storage may be a consideration if you have a small kitchen or don't have much room in your kitchen thanks to other appliances.",

So many slow cooker recipes call for browning meat prior to the slow cooking and I thought it would make very convenient work to be able to do this in one operation. I was very disappointed. Only the back right hand corner of the cooker got hot enough to saute. The others 3\\4 of the pan was barely warm. I gave up on the browning and just turned on the allow cooking function. It works. If you already have a functioning slow cooker don't bother. This is too large and bulky to store based on that alone.",
