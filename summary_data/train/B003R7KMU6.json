Honestly, this is the coolest and most amazing audio piece I've purchased since the first CD player in the early 80's. I don't know how anyone could gripe about this at all. So what that it's not wireless? I'm glad it's not. Ever mess with a wireless printer??? What a nightmare. From the brilliant display to all the connections and features, I couldn't wish for anything better. Thank you Marantz for including the headphone jack and volume knob on the front. I like this so much I placed it on my nightstand next to my bed! And you know what bedside nightstands hold...",
