I recently brought them on a trip to see family and just dumped them on the table and no one could resist. My 4 year old son all the way to my 93 year old grandma were all building things. It was fun to see. Sorry the pictures are terrible but my 4 year old took them. Some things that were made were spongebob with Gary, Mario with a ? Block, A unicorn with a rainbow, and then some people and cubes. I want another set but it will be a while to save up.",

A great appeal is that they can create 2D and 3D constructions with ease, unlike LEGO's and that's perfect for all of my fidgeters who love turning things this way and that way in their hands. They're lifesavers on so many levels and I will be buying more!",
