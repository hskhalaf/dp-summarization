We took the 250 and 300 to Maui and rode them nonstop out far to the coral reefs, snorkeled about an hour running them on and off then rode them back. In one day, they were both used continuously to the snorkeling spot and back and the battery did not die. The 250 pulled my 250lb husband no problem, but the 300 gave him more power. Do not hesitate to buy one, but note that they start to get heavy when hauling them to the water. We also bubble wrapped them, kept them both in the original boxes and checked them on the airplane.",
