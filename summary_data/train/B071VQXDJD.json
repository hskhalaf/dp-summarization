Voltage rating and EN reading were within .02 volts of each other and the EN Amp reading was within 2 amps of each other. I am impressed and several techs I work with now want to purchase one for themselves. I especially like that I can put the machine serial number in on the printout tag.

I seems to do a lot of tests, and it prints it out for you. I put together a short video showing me putting this thing through it's first tests.
