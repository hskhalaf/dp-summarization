There are a couple of manufacturing flaws, but I think it adds character to the piece, making it appear even more vintage; one of a kind. My favorite things about it are the little balls on chains that flip over and hold the pages in place. Even my husband commented on it, and trust me, that is huge! Definitely recommend!",

The color and design work well with all kitchens styles; the positive feedback helped me make this decision to buy, so I thought I'd add to the list by saying I would definitely recommend this product.",

I am going to have to say that the book holder has the bar that comes out in front of the book and blocks some of the writing but I usually do not read the recipe word for word so this does not bother me. There are some weights to keep the pages from moving. They move easily and so it's not a issue. I really like this book holder. I would buy it again if I had need for another. \ud83d\ude09",
