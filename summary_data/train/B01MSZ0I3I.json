Has the rollover certified safety test which is always another great safety feature, it's made pretty well and clicks right into it's base with ease. Same with taking it out and carrying it around with multiple adjustments for the carrying handle. The release for loosening the harness is pretty simple to use but is a little inconvenient on location. The bases seatbelt locking device is fantastic and when put in nice and tight, that base does NOT move an inch at all! I would recommend to all new parents!",

The snap-in base for the bassinet-seat is a great feature, as you make sure your bay is comfortable strapped in the seat outside the car before snapping it into the base. This saves a lot of back strain that you usually have to deal with when trying to make sure your baby is properly secured in traditional car seats (though the seat can also be secured in the traditional manner if the base is not in a car that is being used.) The seat is easy to set-up and adjust. This is the best baby car seat I've ever owned",

Do note that the pinkish/purple interior color is very pronounced. We like it that way, but it might not be to everyone's taste.",
