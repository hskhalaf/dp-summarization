I like Sous Vide since it only takes 5 minutes to set up and 5 minutes to clean up everything when done...does not disrupt my workflow and I eat better...win win! Just dropped in a Flat Iron steak...mouth watering already. Update: Just purchased a second one so I can do steaks at two different temps...these things ROCK!",

The single drawback, as far as I am concerned, IS the lack of interface on Joule itself. On that off chance that your smart device has failed and your bluetoothless computer can't access Facebook......you're screwed. If it's worth the risk (and it usually is), Joule is AMAZING!",

Should not be hard to fix it all but it has not been done and cute recipes and jokes do not compensate for it.",

A blistering hot cast or carbon steel pan for 45 seconds a side and you would not know you did not cook it in a pan (except that the inner temp and color goes edge to edge) Fantastic product. We make our own sous vide boneless turkey breast and no longer get turkey from the deli. it is melt in your mouth tender.and costs half as much.",

I love how it is app based, and the app is great and offers great recipes. I didn't realize how many things this thing can actually cook. I will say if you are really good around a grill and you are looking to use this for only steak, chicken and pork this is probably not something you need. The only thing this would offer over a grill for a \"grill master\" is the freedom to not have to tend to the meat while it is cooking.",

Some people may be bothered that this product is controlled almost completely by a mobile app; I actually enjoy the feature. The cook times on bigger and/or tougher cuts of meat can be long, and the mobile control allows you to do things like change cook temperature from work (or using an Alexa device). The app and related website also provide a bunch of recipes that take some of the mystery out of using a new cooking technique. And the food has come out awesome so far. Highly recommend.",
