And it's actually very moisturizing, so your legs and body don't feel tan but flaky! It goes on evenly, and is subtle, but you can add more later if you like it a little darker. It's a very natural color, and does not smell bad, amazingly. I apply with my hands - not a mitt, so I can tell how much I'm applying. Just wash hands after & you're good to go! I love it. Buy it, so they don't stop making it! :-)",

The 'tan' looked remarkably natural and I thought I'd finally found my perfect self-tanner (being a redhead, I burn easily and avoid the sun as much as possible. Consequently, I can look rather ghostly!) When I re-applied the lotion a few days later, as the original 'tan' started to fade, it still looked pretty good. However, after another week (or so) and another application, I definitely looked orange! So, in the future, I'll only use when I absolutely need to look 'freshly' tanned and NOT as a way to maintain an 'all-summer-tanned' look.",

      "text": "I have literally tried over 20 self-tanners to date and can honestly say this one is in my top 3. Not only does it look great after just one application it fades gradually too after showering etc. Like any self-tanner be sure to exfoliate and all the rest before you apply, be careful on elbows/hands/knees where it can easily cake on. One application lasts me 7-10 days before I need to touch up, I don't load a ton on I am just incredibly fair skinned and am trying my best not to look anaemic! So if you are looking for a nice light tan that gives a good glow and smells great I would definitely recommend.",

It doesn't look like a real tan because of the orange, -ish basic overall tone of it, but it's not as orange looking as any other self tanner I've tried and it doesn't smell at all. I don't think it is possible to obtain a deep brownish tan with any self tanner like the real sun gives, but so far, this is the best one I've tried and I have tried many.",

I will say it is not completely odorless. But I usually apply it, leave it on for several hours and then rinse in the shower later to remove the smell but keep the tan.
