Pros: Excellent graphics Its nice you can play missions multiplayer and there's competitive multiplayer Cons: Lacks originality. Its all been done before. The story doesn't suck you in. Instead you're left wondering \"Who are we fighting? Why are we fighting them? What are we doing here again?\" Entirely repetitive. Be expected to face the same enemies on the same map, again...and again....and again. That includes bosses. Sadly, this game was entirely a disappointment. For all the money they spent on advertising, I wish they would have instead used that to make a better game.",

The biggest downfall is that if you don't buy the Dowloadable Content (DLC Expansions), you'll be missing more than half the storyline and game experience, so you'll need to shell $15~20 more. The major updates takes a while, too. It's understandable that it requires time to make a patch to fix bugs and add context, but it feels that it's taking a bit longer than it should. Hopefully, they release the full game WITH the DLC's included in the near future.",

      "text": "Destiny was a very hyped up game and Activision and Bungie have delivered something unique. Destiny's open world, challenges, customization, and combat system add for a fun experience that is very entertaining and challenging. The games visuals are great too, especially on next gen consoles. However, playing the game solo is very difficult and not playing co op is not a good idea. The game also lacks in missions, as the campaign is quick and there are daily challenges that tend to get repetitive. Overall, Destiny is a game that should only be purchased if you own a next gen console and have friends to play with. And now at $40, it's a great way to get started.",

I recommend this game to people who enjoy collecting weird stone things to turn in for capes and other items of clothing, and for people who enjoy killing halloween wizards and awakening the hive.",

Also the missions are pretty repetitive, go to the planet, do this, go back to base, walk a long way to talk to someone, get an item, go back to the planet, do something else. I mean, it's a typical MMO. If you like that sort of thing, maybe you'll like Destiny. But personally I prefer games with more substance.",

Sure the levels are repetitive, the worlds could have been a lot larger than they are too - but when you're in a Raid with 5 other friends, it gets exciting and sometimes on edge.

One note, aside from the raids which take a long time to get to, pve missions/strikes are limited to 3 people which is a bummer. Also dont expect to make friends in-game.",

I started in year 2 which I think was worth the wait because the Amazon price drop to $15 for vanilla disc + an additional $30 for the Taken King Collectors Edition DLC code, I ended up spending a total of $45 for the complete game. Thanks for everything Amazon! I put COD AW to the side now and been playing destiny for 3 1/2 weeks, and now a level 40 Titan with 4 or five exotics and plenty of legendary weapons. I love this game! Amazon has the best Competitive Video Game prices on high end games!",

    "description": "GAME OVERVIEW\nFrom the Creators of Halo and the company that brought you Call of Duty. In Destiny you are a Guardian of the last city on Earth, able to wield incredible power. Explore the ancient ruins of our solar system, from the red dunes of Mars to the lush jungles of Venus. Defeat Earth\u2019s enemies. Reclaim all that we have lost. Become legend.\n\nA Bold New World\nEmbark on an epic action adventure with rich cinematic storytelling where you unravel the mysteries of our universe and reclaim what we lost at the fall of our Golden Age.\n\nMore Ways To Play\nThe next evolution of the first-person action genre that provides an unprecedented combination of storytelling, cooperative, competitive, and public gameplay, and personal activities that are all seamlessly woven into an expansive, persistent online world. Venture out alone or join up with friends. The choice is yours.\n\nCreate Your Legend\nPersonalize and upgrade every aspect of how you look and fight with a nearly limitless combination of armor, weapons, and visual customizations. Take your upgraded character into every mode, including campaign, cooperative, social, public, and competitive multiplayer.\n\nGUARDIANS\nHUNTER\nMaster of the Frontier - Quick on the trigger and deadly with a blade, Hunters stalk battlefields as if they were hunting prey. Cunning and ruthless, they prize the undiscovered and prepare for the unexpected, channeling their powers by intuition and gut instinct. TITAN\nArmored Engine of War - Their lightning-charged fists will knock you off your feet. Their armor and shields make them nearly invincible. We like to think they are our faceless knights, protecting us from our countless enemies. But their power and resolve gives them the air of rising Gods. WARLOCK\nWielder of Arcane Power - They've found a way to weaponize their curiosity, harnessing the Traveler's light in patterns never before imagined. Warlocks are not passive scholars of the unknown. These are mystic warriors, capable of incredible acts of devastation. GAME MODES\nCRUCIBLE\nCompetitive Multiplayer - Enter the Crucible to hone your competitive skills against other Guardians in arenas that span the solar system. Victory will earn you rewards and reputation. EXPLORE\nOn-Demand Adventure - Revisit the worlds you have discovered to aid the City in their exploration efforts, seek out valuable resources in order to upgrade your weapons and gear, and link up with other brave Guardians roaming the frontier in search of action and adventure. STORY\nEpic Campaign - Destiny features a rich, cinematic story, centered on your quest to discover and explore the remains of humanity's Golden Age. As a Guardian, you must venture beyond our walls, into a wild and dangerous frontier, and take the fight to ancient evil forces hell bent on our destruction. STRIKE\nCooperative Multiplayer - Form a Fireteam, three Guardians strong. Infiltrate an enemy stronghold, cutting through wave after wave of enemy ranks emboldened by their fierce, battle-hardened leaders. Confront an enemy worthy of only the bravest Guardians. TOWER\nThird Person Social Space - Home of the Guardians, the Tower is a third person social hub where you can regroup, rearm, and form new alliances before venturing beyond the safety of the City's walls. DESTINATIONS\nEARTH\nOur home. After the Darkness swept over us, we found the Traveler where it made its last stand. Beneath, we built The City \u2013 our last \u2013 within its protective aura. From here, Guardians stand watch, defend our civilization, and strike out into the wild frontiers of Earth \u2013 and beyond \u2013 to reclaim our lost worlds. MARS\nWhat little we know of Mars may as well be a myth. We built a massive metropolis in the red dust. The Darkness swept nearly all of it away; the sand itself claimed the rest. No one knows what remains of our lost age, now buried beneath the dunes. MOON\nLike Earth, the ruins of humanity's former glory can be found scattered across the familiar lunar surface. Recent exploration attempts have been repulsed, reporting increased enemy activity, and even strange tectonic phenomenon. The City has since classified the Moon as a \"Forbidden Zone,\" open only to our most brave and experienced Guardians. VENUS\nVenus was once the site of great discovery \u2013 a paradise. Now, it is a monument to all that we have lost. The old stories say we built an academy dedicated to learning and research on the shore of a wondrous sea, and that the waters themselves boiled and rose up to shatter the coast, washing away all that we had built. ENEMIES\nCABAL\nFew Guardians have faced Cabal and lived to tell the tale. They are a professional military operation. On every front we have found them on the march, they have already dug in and ringed their installations with razor wire. Now, it seems they've turned their eyes towards us. FALLEN\nFallen are hardy creatures who can survive in a wide range of environments without heavy armor or complex modifications to their physiology. They travel light, hit hard, and are gone before you know it. Fallen may look like mere scavengers, but on closer inspection you will see hints of a splendid, sophisticated past, and the proud markings of their ancestral \"Houses.\" HIVE\nHive manipulate the physical world in ways that we can only begin to imagine. The Hive have carved a kingdom deep into the lifeless core of the Moon, and it is there they remain, silent and buried among many dark and terrible secrets, a reminder of the tremendous power that brought forth the Collapse. VEX\nScattered reports indicate that the Vex appear to be mass-produced machine units, constructed of an unknown metal alloy resembling hammered brass. All attempts to communicate with them have failed. They are hostile. They are unrelenting. They are deadly.",
