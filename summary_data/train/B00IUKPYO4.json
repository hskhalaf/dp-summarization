      "text": "Really like this diaper bag, not too big, not too small. It is made of nylon that says waterproof, haven't been in the rain to see, but looks sturdy. Came in orange, pink, blue, gray and the red we picked on Amazon for a reasonable price $25.95, compared to other bags. Really liked the circle pattern. Has lots of pockets to keep organized when you need to grab a certain item. Liked this bag had a zipper, our other bag is open and I am always afraid I will lose something. Overall love this purchase. (Had a different label then Damero, was landuo on tag.)",

Happy to say it was a home run! Super roomy pockets galore and the clip on strap is plenty long enough to carry this messenger style. I have become a fan of the brand and have also purchased their diaper backpack and again a home run!",

It's hold everything that I need and more. And I am very OCD so the pockets are great for organizing. I choose the red because I didn't want my husband to carry around something too feminine and of course I had a son so this is really neutral. I don't really use the over the shoulder strap. I find that it doesn't stay at the place I adjust it too, this is the only down side to the bag.",

Both front and back pockets on the outside zip and side pockets are big enough for bottles or water bottles. Bag is very functional and can be used for a little amount of items without staying big and bulky, yet expand for a lot of items if needed. The bag seems more bright red, almost pink online with little grey showing, but the true color is equal parts of dark red and dark grey- a little deceiving.",

Not only does it not stay on your sholder, but it also slips out of the length you adjusted it to, so it's always super long. I'm not saying the bag isn't worth it, just be prepared to buy a decent quality strap with a sholder pad for your bag.",

I have a 2 year old and another baby on the way, which is great because you can put A LOT of stuff in this bag. The 2 sets of straps are great to have too. I definitely recommend this bag.",

      "text": "The bag arrived in clear cellophane packaging; new with tags. The pockets and side zippers were exactly what I was looking for. I had plans to use this as a dance bag for my daughter. Zippers worked fine and all seemed well! Until I noticed a 4.5\" split opening along one of the seams of the bag. For the cost of the product, I could not justify keeping the bag and fixing it myself. Retuning this one and keeping my eyes out for a better quality bag.",

It's lightweight, it's big but not \"duffle bag size\" (my husband's complaints on some of the others). It holds enough for my 2 year and infant for a full day on the go and it has a good number of interior pockets but still ample open space in the middle for my wristlet purse, snacks and iPad. I just wish it was available in solid/bold colors. At this reasonable price, I'd buy two more just to coordinate with the seasons/outfits.",
