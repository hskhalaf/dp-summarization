It was a small tender and in my opinion, Yoga4You proposes the best quality product for this price. The material is nice parachute silk nylon, it feels really good and comfortable during exercising - it does not \"cut\" into the body. Stitches are well-done, handles are soft and strong, the plastic they are made of is different from the one we have - it looks more strong. I like the color and design itself - for yoga studio, it is quite important. I would recommend this yoga trapeze for studio and home usage.",

I like to use it for stretching, inverted exercises and relaxing at the end of my usual morning run. It is also really easy to take it anywhere (I like to train in the park) using the pouch.
