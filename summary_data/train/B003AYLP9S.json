I haven't yet figured out the other ways to configure the set up, am hoping to find something easier.",

For some reason I had difficulty putting it together. To get the handles to bed you step on a cord and I manage to get my foot trapped everytime and squished. The tallest handle is not tall enough. It doesnt seem terribly sturdy. Things slide right off it. I guess I was expecting more of a industrial one. It does fold down to a nice small size. I could see this being a good item for moving items in an office setting, items to a trade show, etc.. I will probably end up returning it.",

The hand cart I had was upright and had a small foot, so I'd need a bungee cord or else any box I put on it would fall right off when I tipped it back to roll the cart. This one holds probably 3x what the little hand cart held, but it's as portable and easy to unfold. The Rock-N-Roller is also much sturdier and easy to maneuver. I probably put 100-200 pounds of boxes / plastic tubs on it at a time and it has no trouble with them. Very happy with this purchase!",

We/I need to move tables of various sizes - 4 foot, 6 foot, card tables, tray tables - as well as tubs of products and odd shaped racks and displays, as I help her to unload/load and setup/breakdown the booth arrangements (no two of which are the same...).",

Or maybe I just got the hang of it. It is extremely versatile and I've used it for moving various things. The only position I haven't tried is as a furniture dolly and probably won't, just prefer to haul things around with it.",

My boyfriend is also a photographer and just borrowed it to move even more gear onto a ferry, and he liked it so much that he's buying one for himself after a single use.",

Look at the photo to see what I mean. However, the two end bars are secured by pins, so I think I'll try to switch them since I'll be using it more as a cart than as a handtruck.",
