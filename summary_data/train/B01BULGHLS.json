Only upbeat music designed to stimulate baby, the music only has two settings loud and louder, and you can't turn on music only or lights only. It's an all or nothing setup. I love baby einstein products, I've been using them for 14 yrs, and my previous experiences were all top notch, so I was kinda shocked to find so many flaws with this seat.",

The music leaves something to be desired. But, overall, the bouncer is serving its purpose.",

It only works for mom controlled fun. Everything else works and is great. my daughter loves it, but I really would've liked her to enjoy the self fun option when she moves or grabs the toys it goes off.",

It has a kick stand that prevents the chair from rocking, so you can use it as regular chair. The security harness is also better then in other rocking chairs. I was considering Fisher Price infant to toddler rocker too however when I saw the reviews with photos of babies hanging after the chair tipped forward too much I was afraid for my babies safety and decided to go with this one.",

The vibrating mechanism in the seat rattles and it drives me insane! It's the actual button that you switch back and forth to make it vibrate that rattles. It's annoying enough that I am considering sending it back. I hate returns but it is worth returning if I can't make it stop.",
