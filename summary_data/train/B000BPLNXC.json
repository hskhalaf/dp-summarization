There was a line of 1/8th inch here and there that were removed, but the bulk of the frost was still there. I tried to \"put my back into it\" and scrape much harder, but it didn't help. I will be returning this for a refund. A complete piece of junk and waste of money!",

The snow removal is much faster, which is real nice, and then if there is ice, it comes off pretty easily too! Great purchase in my opinion :)",

It scrapes ice really quickly from my windshield and brushes the snow off fast. I typically leave a little late for the long defrosting process my car must endure, but this handy thing saves me so much time (reducing it to 1 minute rather than 10 minutes)! Also this thing has great reach for my short stubby dinosaur arms. The shipping and handling also had those bubble bags full of air and came in 2 days. Overall wonderful product!",

We did not have any more snow after we ordered them, so we will have to wait until next winter to test them out.",

Foam grip is nice, and the overall size is just small enough to fit in the trunk without taking up too much space. Wish there was some way to select color, but you get what they send.
