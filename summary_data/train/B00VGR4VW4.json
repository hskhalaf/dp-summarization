I purchased one of the color versions, as opposed to plain white, as I wanted the option of no duvet... This product really needed one, anyway.

Exactly what you see in the picture is what comes to your door. It's VERY warm so we got rid of all our other blankets and just use this one comforter with a flat sheet. It makes doing the wash that less difficult. I think everyone should own a down comforter. Buy it! I'm a fan for life.",

I've washed and dried them in the laundry machine and dryer. The twin size fit well in my top load washer. Came out beautifully. No bunching of the stuffing. In fact, I think they got fluffier. Wonderful blankets for the price. I would recommend.",

I followed the directions on the tag. Washed it on delicate cycle with low spin. I wasn\u2019t going to put it on my bed without washing. To me horror, it was ripped open when I took it out of the washer. I took it straight to the garbage. Got on Targets website and ordered one with Shipt.",

      "text": "I like the product. Light, reversible and comfortable. I ordered Cal King, thinking Cal King is 98\" wide. I assumed it would hang over the side comfortably. It doesn't. Short on each side exposing bedding which looks tacky. I missed the return window so now I see the over size version. Measure your bed before you order to ensure draping on each side is acceptable. I'm screwed but you will enjoy the product. Thank you",

The comforter is soft and oh so cozy. I like the pillow shams that came with it, but don\u2019t expect them to be of the same quality as the comforter. They are thin, but coordinate perfectly. I use them in front of large thick pillow shams that I already had. I am expressly pleased with this purchase.",

We received it next day. It comes packaged in a vacuum-sealed plastic. I washed it right out of the bag and when my son put it on his bed, he could not stop laying on it. He loves the double-sided option to coincide with what colored sheets he has on the bed. It has s small amount of fluffiness like an alternative down comforter, but with a softness of microfiber. It's a perfect comforter for teens!!!",

Otherwise I would be getting a real down comforter with some substance to it. Honestly they could of put some fluff to this thing! Disappointed.",

It adds a nice layer of softness and comfort to for that perfect \"fluffy bed\" look. It's honestly made it harder for me to get out of bed in the mornings!
