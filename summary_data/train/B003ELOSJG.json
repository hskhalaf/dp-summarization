Several emails were sent to Seagate asking for advice on a possible solution to this registered product to which I received ZERO replies. I eventually had to take the failed drive to an independent data recovery service who managed to rescue my backup files from this backup drive for their requisite exorbitant fee (aka ransom). I'll likely not buy another Seagate product if I can at all help it. I have HDDs from the early 90s by other manufacturers that are still perfectly serviceable to this day.

Initially it was going to store all my media files and just be put to rest but then I found myself leaving it attached to my computer more often then not. With older external drives that I have, that are powered externally (from an outlet) I found that they would continue running even when not attached to a computer via USB and after the computer had been shut off or put into sleep/hibernation. This drive automatically powers up and down with the computer which I really like. It didn't try and install unnecessary software on my computer either and aesthetically it's quite nice.",

I've only had this drive for a couple of months, but the price was right and the reviews good so far. The drive worked immediately, did what I asked it to do, and has contiued to do so.

I partitioned it to use for two different backup applications: one which makes a complete \"cloned\" drive backup copy, and Apple's Time Machine for incremental data backups. Best feature (in my opinion) is how quiet this drive is compared to my older Seagate FreeAgent hard drives I have. It would be nice if there was some sort of indicator light just so I know it's on. Price was good. I'll probably buy another soon. Hope you find this helpful.",

The fact that even after emptying my old laptop's hard drive into this there is still more than 1 TB space remaining-which just pleases me. I am a happy customer.",

I am happy that I got this product at only $129. The current price of this product is way too higher. Initially i had driver problem because i had installed 64 bit OS on Dell vostro 1015. Overall the HD is a good buy. So far this has worked fine.The only hitch could be, it needs a power supply , it doesnt draw power from PC or laptop. The drive doesnt get too hot when in use. I would recommend buying it.",

These complaints are really about the software that ships with it though, and not the device itself. There are other software solutions that can provide that if needed.
