The menus are different, I can connect it via wifi to a number of devices, the pictures are so clear and crisp. There are a multitude of settings for manual and auto and I love the fact that the screen moves and isn't stationary. I seriously can't say enough about this camera. I've only had it for a few days, but I love it.",

It performed great and although I had to learn the non-professional aspects of this camera, it was fun using the scene mode and filter mode. I don't regret getting it as it took very nice photos and was one third the weight of my 5DM4, which made it easy to carry around. It showed me that you don't need a professional level camera to take great family photos.",

As a content creator, this is extremely helpful since I can use the camera for live streaming or recording. The camera has not overheated after hours and hours of streaming. One downside is the AF is ever slightly slower compared to the M50. The M50 felt like it could shift its AF a little bit faster. This will likely not be noticed by most people unless your focus is shifting very frequently.",

I shoot on automatic and the pictures still turn out incredible and stunning.

The only thing I'm concerned about is it was a lot of money for me to spend especially now days, and the touch screen part which is adjustable is a cool feature but held together merely by a piece of plastic. Fingers crossed I have no problems. I bought it because i read it was ranked #1 DSLR for beginner's as well as for pro's. And I do like Canon as a company, they have excellent quality compacts!",
