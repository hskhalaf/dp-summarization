      "title": "3 pairs in 3 months, all faulty!!!",
      "text": "My first pair worked flawlessly for 3 months but for some reason just stopped working one day - the buttons on the remote became unresponsive so I wasn't able to turn them on. I ordered another pair hoping for better luck but they had a problem with the battery and only lasted between 10 to 20 mins before dying despite being fully charging and showing the battery to be full. Thinking '3rd time lucky...' I ordered another pair but they seem to have the same problem as the first pair and won't even turn on! There is clearly some kind on manufacturing defect with these or poor quality control by the company so won't be purchasing from them again.",

I now feel stuck with earphones I don't like without recourse to change them or get my money back. I have to charge them twice a day! Unreasonable. They do fit quite well and the sound is good. Useless if they cant last long enough for my morning commute.",

Amazon, as usual, have provided excellent customer service and I will get a refund but I now need to find another pair. I may give these one more chance.",
