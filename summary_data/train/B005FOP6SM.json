It's far more comfortable on my rear end than my Specialized Romin Evo Pro or my Selle Italia SLR. However, I've spent the past month and a half not being able to feel my junk. Except for when it feels like I'm peeing razor blades. If you have a problem with numb-nuts on other saddles, this one is only going to make it worse. I ultimately got the Arione VS-X which needs to be broken in, but after 2 100 mile rides, the VS-X is just way more comfortable.",

This particular one replaces another that finally wore out after 7 years of very frequent use. While comfort should be your number one concern, I also love the Arione because it offers a wide variety of fore and aft positions while riding, and it's very light and durable.",

Despite trying numerous angles and fore/aft positions, this saddle refused to be comfortable for me. There is no cutout, which resulted in severe pain and chafing in the perenium (taint) area. For those also experiencing perenium issues, definitely look for a saddle with a large cutout. This completed alleviated my issues after the first ride.",
