They're also great to wear weightlifting, and just casual wear as well. If these shoes last a while this may be my new go to shoe!",

The only problem I have with these shoes is the sole is a bit weak and I will most likely need new shoes within another two months. If you are a runner I recommend these shoes as they are mostly comfortable to wear for a long distance run. These shoes even have a good grip on wet surfaces. I run on the track sometimes and as expected these shoes do not slip up on the track surface. I'm currently looking into buying a new pair of reebok running shoes! Highly recommend to runners and daily wearers alike!",

The \"outsole\" is only slightly more abrasion resistant than my bare skin. At 4 months the soles of these shoes look like they're 4 years old. They might be OK if you spend most of your time inside a gym and running on a treadmill.

The decoupled bottom dissipates shock, and the dual-compound outsole flexes where you need it without sacrificing durability.\n\nReebok was founded for one of the best reasons possible: athletes wanted to run faster. So in the 1890s, Joseph William Foster made some of the first known running shoes with spikes in them. By 1895, he was in business making shoes by hand for top runners; and before long his fledgling company, J.W. Foster and Sons, developed an international clientele of distinguished athletes.",
