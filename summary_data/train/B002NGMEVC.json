Not sure if it's the materials (the tourmaline perhaps?) but it doesn't have a \"hot\" smell when in use, but rather a crisp metallic scent. I know that may sound crazy but if you've got a lot of hair, you've probably smelled a burn from a blowdryer before. This stays cool to the touch and never smells like a fire hazard. Probably does lessen dry time some, but I find a good blowout spray will really improve that as well. I alternate between air drying and blowdrying my hair, but when I do blow dry I find this worth the investment.",

This dryer was impressive. Small and light. Comfortable grip. Moves air very well but also produces enough heat for efficient drying which other dryers have not accomplished. I also found that I'm using my flat iron less after drying because my hair has been sufficiently straightened AND smoothed with this dryer and a round brush.",
