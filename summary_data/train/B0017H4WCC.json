So I initially purchased a 6.5. It was too nig in the heel and too long. Returned for a size 6 after trying them on in a store. The cushion in the foot bed is thinner, the sole is thinner. The shoelaces are a lot thinner. This causes them to tangle easily. The liner the lining inside the toe box hasn't been stitched in for years, but instead glued in. This has already started to come loose. It would be nice to see some of the previous quality returned.",
