This thing is absurdly fragile given the amount of negative reviews. I thought this was mostly on shipping but I think it goes beyond that. TCL needs to do a revision to the packaging and reconsider the materials used for the actual screen. I will not be buying this TV again.",

I opted for the refund. Amazon was very helpful in this process. I may still try again for the tv later.",

All my cable remotes recognize the unit so I can use the cable-remote to turn both on. Nit - Roku still has you click the cable/satellite mode select on power-up, so you still have to use TWO remotes to get you there. This review is about two months in and all good. Enjoy.",

The sound is ok, but I recommend getting a sound bar. Overall, its a great value for the technology. Delivery is scheduled which makes purchasing this super easy.",

See the Dolby Vison picture Compared to the Samsung 65 RU7100 I bought in December this TCL is far better in every respect. Samsung failed in 3 months refused to connect to both wired and WiFi. Samsung has jerked me around since April still waiting for resolution. I highly recommend the TLC 65 inch 625 model.",

Really happy with ps4 pro and this tv.",

The sound is good, so I can use the TV sound instead of my surround sound if I don't feel like turning on the surround sound. 4K videos look stunning, and you can sit as close as you want (I have this 55 inch TV in our bedroom) and the picture is never pixelated. Excellent TV, I would highly recommend it, especially for the price.",
