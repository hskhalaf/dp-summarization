I shoot weddings on a Canon 5D Mark III and a Canon 6D. In a pinch I could easily use this camera if I needed to. The picture I have attached is a 15 second exposure with my kids running around with solar lights. This shot is un-edited and was shot in raw. The only thing I did with the picture was transfer it via Wi-Fi to my cell phone using the Canon picture app.",

The camera has a hard time producing crystal focused images in anything other than bright light or with flash, whether using manual of auto settings. The color rendition was mediocre. And worst of all, the automatic lens cover started to glitch after first day of use, needing a push to fully open or close. Didn\u2019t feel like I took a single worthwhile image with this camera. I was really excited to add something this compact and powerful to my collection. I\u2019ll have to keep looking.",

It's a bit costly, but I would say relative to other professional cameras its a fair price.

Image quality is good even at higher ISO sensitivities, making even ISO 1600 shots usable in some situations. 20MP resolution is more than enough for my needs, if not overkill, but I appreciate the detail and sharpness of the images. The 24-100mm equivalent range isn't terribly \"zoomy\", but it works well for street photography or for indoor events. Shooting wide open at F1.8 in certain lighting conditions can produce some noticeable chromatic aberration (purple fringing), but that's easily removed in post. Overall, great camera with few flaws.",

      "title": "Our Go To Daily VLogging Camera",
      "text": "Our favorite vlogging camera. Rating it 4 out of 5, because it can have a lag in focusing in while videoing. Our last one developed a sensor issue after 2 months of daily vlogging, which caused a black dot on our footage, in brightly lit areas. After a lot of research, we decided to rebuy the G7X Mark ii, because it is quality when it comes to ease of daily use and unmatched low light video quality.",

The only thing I didn't like was that there was no mic input which is my fault for not seeing if it had it or not....I just got too excited to buy this. Buuuuut the quality of its own mic is pretty good. I bought this thru the payment plan so that was amazing. Didn't even know that Amazon does that!",

      "text": "Purchased this camera right before my overseas trip. Seems like a great camera so far. The only issue I have is I bought this camera brand new but it arrived with a few scratch on the screen. It seems someone already used it before they returned the item . I usually buy screen protector when purchasing a new item. I'm just bummed I had to apply the protector on a used item. Didnt have the time to return it due to the trip coming up so soon and wouldn't get a new one in time.",
