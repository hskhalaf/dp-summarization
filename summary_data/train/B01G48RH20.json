Love the charger, love the pouch, and the packaging was great too. Haven't had any issues with calls or people not hearing me - it's been fine, and I love the app that comes with it allowing you to adjust the sound. The only reason this is a 4 star, and not a 5 - is the level of \"microphonics\" sounds, which are produced due to the cable rubbing against your clothes. It's noticeable, so you have to either stay quite still - or wear t-shirts, soft cotton based clothing. A work shirt will be quite noisy in your ears.",

And after charging, you MUST put the ear fins back again, and put the ear tips back again before you can use your earphones. How unpractical. And considering how thin the ear fins are, I doubt they are very durable if you have to remove them and put them back everyday... This is the worst and most unpractical design ever.

The charging dock is fast and quirky, the second set came with a new feature to help hold the earbud in. The variety of earbuds from silicone and memory foam are great as is the magnetic off switch which acts as a holder or the little clip. I do think there are products with slightly better battery life but I find mine consistently last longer than advertised, the sound quality on calls is also amazing. I\u2019ll look forward to adding to my collection soon.",

Always connects to other people's devices even when I am listening to the music! Low sound quality too, but since I am not paying for the sound quality, it's ok. But connecting to others's devices? Sorry, already sold for half of what I paid",

Now others may find them much better. The sound is great but I also found that they don't pair well to my iPad for watching a film, great for music but for some weird reason they only work for music. I eventually found they fit best but inverting them so they go in the opposite ear they are meant for upside down, seems to work for me, but I wouldn't recommend them to anyone as I didn't find them very easy to use.",
