If you plan to put heavy stuff in them, then they may lose their shape but they worked great for us. Our daughter and daughter's in law liked them so much they wanted to wear them. My wife and I responded in unison, \"You can't wear them!\" But if it gets real cold this winter, we won't have any trouble getting them out and using them to keep our feet warm!",

The sizing matches exactly as advertised; however, I will say I should have measured the opening of our previous stockings... the width of these is much smaller than what we\u2019re used to. They do have some stretch, but not significant stretch, perhaps an extra inch. For me, the value of the product outweighs this slight con. The vendor packaged my order with care, even leaving a handwritten thank you. Highly recommend... but maybe measure out 5\u201d for sizing clarity beforehand.",
