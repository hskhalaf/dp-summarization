My boy wore it a few times but it always got super staticy and shocked him and me when I pet him. I tried a few static control products but didn't help. It also rides back on him while he walks and when he tries to sit, it tries to slide back up his back but his air gets caught in the holes. I hope that makes sense. It looks quite uncomfortable. I think I should have gotten a solid one instead of the mesh type.",

The vests don't seem to bother the dogs much when we go for walks.The vests also stay in place after going for walks. I've taken the dogs on a dozen or so walks with the vests and only once or twice had to adjust the vest. Overall, I am pleased with the vests and the hunter orange w/ reflector stripes significantly increase the visibility of the dogs.",

The belly strap is elastic with a small squeeze release buckle. The front has 2 wide strips of velcro covering the full width of the front. Workmanship seems decent, stitching seems secure. The belly strap is what will be the test. Happy with it and now I feel better about walking my dog in the woods during hunting season.",

The belly strap is fully extended (his girth is roughly 27\") and is a perfect fit for him. No sliding off. The material is stretchy enough so as not to constrict his breathing. My only comment to the manufacture would be to add a d ring either on the back or collar area for an attachment point. He also uses a small cow bell, which would be nice to be able to leave on the vest all the time instead of having to attach it to his regular collar. All in all great product. Thanks",

High Visibility!! The clasp is very secure! Comfortable on my Large 89 lb chocolate lab! It is mesh, which really is nice on these hot days. He needs lots of exercise and when the wheelchair is outside in full speed mode it is light and allows for air to flow through while he is running. It looks brand new and he rolls in the grass or shakes and wears it daily. I'm so pleased and would expect you would be very happy too.",

This vest works well as we can spot her easily and it is lightweight with air holes throughout so she does not get too warm. It also has nice reflector strips up the sides if needed. I measured her girth and bought the medium. Fits perfectly. I would highly recommend this vest.",

I would recommend it to anybody who needs their dog to be seen (for whatever reason that may be).",
