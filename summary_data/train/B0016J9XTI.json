As other reviewers have noted, the \"mechanism\" can be a bit finicky (and it's not the smoothest functioning thing in the world, even installed properly). It's a great sized \"touch up\" ironing board, but also has limitations (like not slipping jeans over it, the folding mechanism can be insecure). Overall I still rate it 4 stars. We have it installed in a laundry room cabinet. Install wasn't super easy, but still worked out fine. Overall I feel it is worth the money and I would purchase again.",

The uniquely designed expandable frame mounts easily in a vanity drawer between cabinet sides from 14-1/4 inches to 21 inches wide and the fixed brackets allow for easy mounting of all standard drawer fronts. It features a chrome finish and unique ball-bearing slide system that provides sufficient over travel for maximum utilization. Simply open until the gravity lock engages, unfold board and you are ready to iron. Double-check your cabinet's opening (inside dimensions) to allow the best fit. Measure side to side (width), front to back (depth or length), and top to bottom (height). Double-check to make sure your product is within measurements and don't forget to take into account any obstructions (plumbing, hinges, etc.).",
