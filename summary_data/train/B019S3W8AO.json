All is good, my kids, their friends, they all come over to our house when Dad is making pizza. A couple kids even nicknamed me Papa John. I quickly corrected them that it was insulting as my pizza is the best! The only ingredient I was missing was a decent pizza cutter. That was in the past, this is a GAME CHANGER! Works great, is safe and way better than any other design. I was skeptical at first until I used it. Now this rocks!! Mangia!!!",

Yes it sounds tedious and stupid to have to take apart a pizza cutter just to be able to clean it, and it is, but this is such a great quality pizza cutter that it doesn\u2019t even matter. The process of taking it apart and putting it back together is so effortless and can be done in less than 10 seconds. The cutter is large and sharp as well. What more do you need?",

It's easier to clean than a standard slicer, and I love that it has a built in safety guard so forgetful people like me can't lose it. Highly recommended!",

It is simply superior from a physics stand point. You can get much better downward pressure on the item you are cutting. It is easy to clean. I am thinking about making some cheese quesadillas and I think this will do a great job on them as well.",

I\u2019ve used to cut pizza and to cut dough for rolls. Very handy!",

It's also dishwasher safe, and because it comes apart, you know all the pieces are completely cleaned, with no nooks and crannies for pizza or water to hide out. I'm seriously considering buying a 2nd one.",

      "text": "I found this product to be easy to hold and cuts well. However, the protective blade guard ironically makes you more prone to getting cut and needs to be redesigned. If you slide your finger to open the cover there is a very good chance you will cut you finger on the blade. The ridge to open the blade cover needs to be longer and protruding out more so you can open the cover away from the blade and not towards it. I ended up just removing the cover to prevent any chance of cutting myself while opening the cover.",
