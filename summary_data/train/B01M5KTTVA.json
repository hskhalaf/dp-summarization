I used to have a charge cord plugged into a power port and then a separate aux cord for audio, but with this deck, I don't use the aux cord at all. I just plug the lightning cable directly into the deck and it charges and plays audio at the same time. Not only that, but the media controls on the deck and remote work to play/pause/FF/RW/skip tracks. Couldn't be happier and it's a great deck for the price.",
