I kept using it because it felt so amazing on my neck and shoulders, but then I thought I had a stomach flu. I tried it again the next day because it felt awesome and I thought it was a fluke...Unfortunately, I started to get nauseous again. I returned it, but I am still sad because everything I\u2019ve tried since doesn\u2019t compare. I wish they made this in an unscented version like they do with other neck wraps. What do you think?",

Possibly, the company should change to a sturdier fabric with no stretch and a sturdier stitching. I think that would resolve the issue. I miss using it. The company was very responsive to replace the first one ordered. I wish I could give better feedback.",

I felt the tension leaving not only my neck but my shoulders as I sat and watched T.V. while wearing it. In addition to the heat relaxation, I enjoyed the herbal fragrance as well. It is subtle and not overpowering in the least which I liked. I believe I have found the perfect Christmas gift for families and friends!",

I increased heating time incrementally, and also tried flipping it halfway through heating. The wrap seemed to be under-filled, in my opinion. I also did not like that I had to heat it on a plate.

It is exactly as they advertise\u2014very soft, perfectly weighted, perfectly constructed to fit around shoulders and neck, you can do things while wearing it, and it smells delightfully relaxing and soothing. The ONLY thing I wish were different was that it held the heat longer\u2014but I\u2019m not rating it lower because of this, as I think this is just how all these types of products are (I\u2019ve used rice bags, beans, etc., and none of them hold the heat for long periods of time). Over all, very satisfied, and use it all the time for chronic neck pain.",

I currently have a membership at my local massage location, I have been prescribed medication for my headaches, and have tried everything recommended for relief. My massage therapist recommended heat to relieve my headaches, and my husband found the Huggaroo on Amazon. The first night I used it, I awoke a new person!!! I currently fall asleep with it every other night. I told it my co-residents about it, and they bought them as well! Due to sitting at a microscope all day, the Huggaroo relieves everyday muscle aches! Thank you Huggaroo!!",

But then this is just a hot wrap, no aromatherapy for me. And not worth the $36 I paid.",

Second, after a couple years, the scent wears off. However, that's to be expected. Over all, this is a really good product and I highly recommend it.",

I needed quality, which is exactly what I got with this. It's soft, and plush, and the way it's sewn there is even heat. It smells phenomenal (natural herbs, with no harsh fake perfumes that I can detect). They best part is the way it hits alllllll the spots.",
