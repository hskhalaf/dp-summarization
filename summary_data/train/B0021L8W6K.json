However, I decided to wedge it in between some books so I could angle it and now it only goes on the floor and they are able to chase it. Now I just wish there was a setting option for longer than 15 min!",

If your cats use their eyes more than their ears AND they will chase anything with abandon, then buy this. However, if your cats are patient hunters, waiting for their moment to strike, this is not for your pets. Also, if your cats use their ears, they will watch the device more than the dot. It moves too fast for patient hunters. My cats get bored after 1 minute. I have MUCH more success using it in manual mode.

I was also concerned he would knock it over or laser himself in the eye, but the beam lands far enough away from the unit that neither of these have been a problem. If you have a dog who likes to chase moving objects whom you would like to keep busy, this is a great choice.",

There is a diagonal mirror in the head, and this reflects the laser beam outward at an adjustable vertical angle. The problem is that the housing of the mirror interferes with the laser beam. So at almost all mirror orientations, the laser beam is trapped within the head for about 40% of the time. Kitty is interested at first, but gets bored and walks away when the light is not visible.

After only a few days of use, the moving mirror on the top stuck in place and so the laser no longer moved as intended. I taped it in place and that helped a bit so it's somewhat usable, but this purchase was a disappointment considering the performance and longevity of the first one.",
