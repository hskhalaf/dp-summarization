It's kind of sung in the bust area but that is how it is supposed to be so they won't giggle while you workout. lol I ordered a 4X....I know it sounds way to big but its not and a lot of people tell me that I'am not big for my height.I also wear a size 18 pants and XL shirts. It will make you sweat like never before as well! I hope this helps because before I bought one I was looking at about 50 reviews until I made my final decision. :)",

After searching and searching, my friend recommended this to me. I trust her, so i ordered it. At first, it was a big snug. I wear a medium/ large in women\u2019s clothing. I ordered a large. A little tough to zipper but around the waist is adjustable. Today was my fourth day using it, and it has gotten easier to zipper. Besides the snugness gives me motivation to lose the weight even more.",

And even if that doesn't work you can always return it I decided against it because I want to make sure that everything was held in even though I ended up having a uniboob effect and the top part not really staying into the part of my chest.",

Keep in mind I wear 2x in shirts.",

The chest on my vest was extremely to big but the bottom fitted okay the only reason why I\u2019m keeping it is because of the belt it helps pull me in. Overall the quality is great! You will sweat which is the purpose anyway! I would say GO FOR IT. Given the price... you can always downsize.",
