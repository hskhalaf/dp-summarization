The plug 'wires' are copper strips. Since the pickup is metal when it comes in contact with the plug 'wire' it transfers the spark to your HAND. What a rude awakening... My other Actron light with a plastic molded inductive pickup works fine on the Ford Model A. No shock.",

I've had it a year maybe two, been using to time the same vehicle and never seem to be able to get it dialed in. Also, the last time I used it the bulb apparently burnt out because it quit flashing in the middle of timing an engine and doesn't seem to be replaceable without destroying the rest of the tool, trying to open it up. Needless to say, I'm looking for a different one now.",
