The description calls them something different but in all actuality they are a pot and pan. I was worried that they would have had an over powering \"chemical\" smell like my air fryer did for several days but these arrived odorless. Great overall simple construction. I feel the price was a little high and they could have included a tool to help remove the very hot items from the air fryer. I would recommend this to anyone looking for these accessories.",
