I also like how you can choose to use a strobulb flashlight like in Luigi\u2019s Mansion: Dark Moon. Even though the game is short, it is totally worth it. I think it is an amazing game. I totally recommend this game! Happy hauntin- err.. hunting.",

Definitely worth the money spent! Definitely a classic! Edit: The achievement system is great and has made me replay the game in numerous ways. This game was meant to last this time!",

It has been updated to the PAL version (according to what I've researched) and all of the ghosts have about 50% more health on average while dealing a lot more damage and no hearts available unless you capture more than one ghost at the same time. Overall, I still love this game and I highly recommend it!",
