When I came into the garage to ride, the front tire was flat. I took the tube off the bike to look at it, and I found green slime leaking out of a dime-sized hole and rip near the seam, and also slime leaking out of the base of the valve stem. This looks like a product defect to me. I would probably not buy this tube again. For reference, I inflated it to 45psi per my tire's specification.",

Now it has a flat front tire and another split tube. I will have to replace a second brand new tube in one day and have yet to ride my bike! These tubes are JUNK!!

When spinning the wheels when the bike is on the work stand, the slime settles in one place and causes the wheel to be very unbalanced. I don't feel this when riding. This might settle out with time or it might eventually turn gummy and stay in one place--I don't know what to expect.",
