      "text": "I've used the 4-sided graters for years as they are the most stable. But eventually they dull, and it always seems the support bottom wire that runs around the bottom edge, rusts. Since that's where the grated food falls, not ideal. Even those 'rubber bumper' ones don't protect from the rust; they loosen up and wear out over time. Decided to try this based on good reviews. It's stable when open, although I don't much like how easily the two halves separate when folded as it makes it hard to put away without rubber-banding it. Oxo should put a little clip somewhere to keep it together for storage. Nice and sharp grater holes; when opened up it's stable.",

    "description": "The OXO Good Grips Two-Fold Grater offers convenient grating versatility in one tool, tackling both medium and coarse grating tasks, over a cutting board or directly into a bowl. Its unique bi-fold design allows it to stand upright on a cutting board or the two grating surfaces can be separated for individual use right over a bowl. The medium grating surface is ideal for vegetables, hard cheeses, carrots, zucchini, chocolate and more. The coarse grating surface is ideal for semi-soft cheeses, butter, apples, cabbages, potatoes, onions and more. Soft, comfortable, non-slip handles ensure a secure grip in your hand during repetitive grating motions and the non-slip feet keep the Grater in place on any surface. The Grater disassembles for easy cleaning and folds flat for convenient storage.",
