The price and low hassle convinced him to give this a try and IT MADE SUCH A DIFFERENCE. He wore the booties for a full 90 minutes and then soaked his feet for about 20 minutes for the next three nights and then gently scrubbing with a wash cloth. We will definitely be buying this again!",

A friend told me about Barefoot Scientist version of the \u201cfoot peel\u201d concept and I knew I had to try it. I also knew that whatever they used as ingredients would be safe for my body, and I was right. This was a much gentler formula and worked just as good (if not better) then the competitors. My feet feel baby soft and I didn\u2019t need to use harsh chemicals to get me there. I will be using this every few months for sure.",

    "rating": 3.7,
    "feature_bullets": [
      "GENTLE DEEP PEEL FORMULA: Achieve a full skin renewal cycle in about a week. Unlike other harsh acidic peels that aggressively strip skin, Reboot uses milder alpha-hydroxy acids to shed away dead skin layers and reveal new, softer skin with just one use. This is the perfect \u2018first time\u2019 foot peel for people who are worried about exposure to high acid formulations or who have sensitive skin.",
      "KICK BACK AND EXFOLIATE: Relax and let Reboot do the work. These booties are powered with antioxidant-rich fruit extracts that moisturize while milder alpha-hydroxy acids work to shed layers of dead skin.",
      "EASY TO USE: Clean and soak feet, then dry and place inside booties. Close with the attached adhesive tape and thoroughly coat the skin. Leave for 90 minutes, then rinse and dry to clean off remaining gel. Soaking feet in the following days will accelerate the exfoliation process. If peeling does not appear to occur after several days, gently wash feet with warm water and a washcloth to assist with cell turnover.",
      "REDUCE AND ELIMINATE SKIN BUILD UP: As part of a seasonal pampering ritual, use Reboot to gently remove hardened skin. Full rejuvenation may take up to 2 weeks to complete.",
      "SAFE AND EFFECTIVE: Our blend of powerful ingredients from nature and science is formulated for maximum effectiveness, and is hypoallergenic, vegan, dermatologist tested, free of phthalates and parabens, cruelty free and Leaping Bunny certified."
