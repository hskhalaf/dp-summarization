I am trying a smaller size in hopes it fits better. If not then I'm sure I can find a rescue that can use one. I DO love the coat! Nicely made!",

We're lazy city folk and value dog accessories that aren't a chore to put on. The Weatherbeeta slips right over her head and velcros to the sides. There's no danger in it slipping off and it keeps our dog comfy. Also, the leash opening location aligns well with our EzyDog harness (the same cannot be said for the 1200D parka). The one downside is that it's *only* a windbreaker. If it's also raining outside, you'll want something else because water will soak right through this.",

It is true to size in the back length however my dog has a substantially deep chest and with the design of this coat the chest piece pulls the coat farther forward and lifts the back end. The end result is this coat fits her great only if she is standing stock still and since she is a active dog that is extremely rare. If she is running around the back of this coat is flapping up and down with a several inches of Doberman keister sticking out. She doesn\u2019t care but I wish it were a smidge longer.",
