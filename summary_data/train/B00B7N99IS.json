I did have mine for 3 years however it had very limited use and always kept in a camera case to try to preserve gasket/sealant life. I did like he camera but for the price I would of liked to see more Life out of this. I won't be buying another one. Why do that when you can get a waterproof case for your phone that guarantees to work or they buy you another one?",

That would be impossible because the camera they shipped me was missing the internal tab that keeps the battery in place for power. It cannot work without the battery being seated properly in it's slot. Was very disappointed not to be able to take underwater photos on my 1st trip to the Cayman Islands. In short, camera model is great, but not from this seller... :-(",

This one has a much more secure and durable battery door. The weak point on this camera is the LCD, which can be protected by a cheap screen protector. This camera is perfect for outdoor adventures - I've taken it skiing, hiking and on the water and it's been great. It takes lovely video and photos for being so small.",

But in order to do that I have to bump the telephoto to about 1/4 increase to replicate what I'm seeing with my eye. If I don't do that, I'll get a distant shot. A real strength is battery life. I can shoot 100's of pictures over several days without changing or charging the battery.",

I had it out in rain, wind, blowing sand and had no issues. I could shoot it one handed while riding and took a few thousand shots over the 52 day ride. It takes great pics.

If you're just using it on land and hoping the \"waterproof\" feature will protect you from accidental spills and such, I'm sure it will be fine. The camera worked great the few times I was able to use it on land, and worked fine for 1.5 snorkel trips.",

The map system that comes with it is almost useless, especially since the battery life on this is not that great. The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is the battery life. The battery life is not the worst I have seen but nowhere close to my old Canon Powershot.",

When you're standing completely still, shooting a stationary target in ideal lighting conditions, it produces decent photos. However, when it comes to real world use, most of your shots come out completely unusable. Blurred subjects, and horrible under/over exposure. I'm being completely serious when I say that iPhone cameras outperform the aw110 in real world use. My 8 year old midrange Canon powershot A540 outperforms the brand new aw110 in every way. Very disappointing. I'm sending it back for a refund asap. I'd suggest looking elsewhere for a tough camera.",

Loses something when you pan around quickly, but still vivid.

The first time I thought it was a fluke. Not so much. Terrible underwater camera. I won't be buying Nikon for underwater use again. I'm disappointed as I've had other Nikon cameras that worked great.",

Life lessons I suppose since I had read the reviews. Hopefully their customer service will be better than the product itself.",

Our grandkids have already given it a brutal test jumping into the salt water and snorkeling with it. I don't find the shake feature to be of any benefit and have turned it off - permanently. It's a real waste of technology. I'm looking forward to further exploring with the camera as we travel to diverse and harsh environments.",
