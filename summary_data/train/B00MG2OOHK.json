I used my steamer on the long dress in the photo and although it I had to refill it 3 times (because it is small), it worked really well on getting the wrinkles out. I am impressed with it.

      "text": "I have owned several steamers over the years. This is quite possibly the worst. It spits tons of water. When it is done, it hisses such small amounts of steam, I don't know why it bothers. Do not waste your money. You could breathe on your clothes and have as much wrinkle free effect. I was contacted by the seller after posting this review who let me know that there is a 3 year warranty. Since then I have contacted them three times about how to return this and get a replacement. This has been going on for weeks. My review stands at this point, since obviously the warranty is useless.",

      "text": "This is a wonderful steamer, very efficient, works up steam very quickly. I had a different steamer for years that worked with a little screw-on cap. Finally, I managed to lose the little cap, rendering it unusable. This one has a large top (see the line above the water window and button on the handle), which makes it impossible to lose--the entire top part is the lid. It also gives it a large opening, making it easy to fill without spills. If you need a steamer (and you do!), you can't do better than this steamer.",

If you will be needing to steam a lot of things at a time, then I would go with the larger version of this steamer, but if you're just doing a few garments at a time this size is perfect.",

However, because it is much much smaller, I am okay with it. After about 15 uses (I use it daily for work pants/shirt), sometimes it spontaneously stops heating the water. So I have to power off and power on again. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. So far I've gotten it to re-heat up the water pretty quick, but still, it's a defect.

You have to hold the steamer really close to the garment, like almost less than an inch. I was worried it would stain the dress with water stains or burn it, but it did the trick. We don't have a lot of experience with it yet, but seemed to work better with thinner materials - it steamed my dress no problem, but my husbands suit, we had to use an iron as well for the thicker parts of the jacket. But good value, and will be convenient for future use.",
