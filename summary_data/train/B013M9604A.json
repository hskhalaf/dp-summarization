It's also not hard to get off if you make a mistake!! I would recommend it to anyone who wears eyeliner because of the high quality and the sharp look. Also, the pen tip doesn't break down or get stubby over time so you can use it just like new until you run out. I wear it every day and it literally lasts forever!! I think I have bought 2-3 since June 2017 and it's currently March of 2019. This stuff rocks!!!",

It's usually $2-4 less than buying directly from Clinique and is the real deal as far as I can tell. Plus I don't have to pay for shipping or *shudder* go to the mall. For those of you unfamiliar with the product entirely-- it is amazing! Glides on beautifully smoothly, great control, nice and dark, stays on all day. Be careful when putting the cap back on though. One time when I did, some of the individual hair/bristles/fibers/whatever got folded under somehow and now they're kinda stuck, sticking outwards.",

The last thing I eliminated was this eyeliner and my rash immediately cleared up. I\u2019ve also used many brands of eyeliner for over 10 years and never had an issue. I don\u2019t recommend this product for the price.",

Don\u2019t waste your money, this is the worst eyeliner Ive ever had and will NOT be purchasing ever again.",
