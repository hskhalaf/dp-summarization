Battlefield, Minecraft, Fallout, Fortnite. All play on Max Settings and are smooth! Battery life is better than i thought it would be for web browsing and spreadsheets on Gaming Laptop. Ofcoase while gaming im always plugged in. If your like me and want to keep on charger at the house and one in your bag they are quite expensive. Overall excellent laptop would buy again.",

I can not vouch for longevity as I have only been using it for around a week now, but I can absolutely vouch for build quality. This laptop is super fast, extremely well built, and I LOVE the glass trackpad. It is a non conventional trackpad out of the way towards the back of the computer since this laptop will be used with a mouse anyway. It can be used in a pinch for basic productivity work (but who would use it for gaming anyway?). Very technologically advanced. I will update if I ever have any problems.",

I simply do not understand why this was done and suspect it has to be some engineering issue because otherwise no computer user would ever do this. Other than that however I can find nothing to complain about and many things to rave about. The speed is simply outstanding. The screen is exceptional. The keyboard is good and responsive. The fans are superb and quiet. Highly recommended if you can afford it.",
