The mouth was large enough for adult products, and the bags are easy to change (I change them myself, the elderly do not), and the scent keeping is as well as can be expected. There aren't many \"full\" diapers that enter the pail, however a halfway filled bag can leave an odor in a medium sized bathroom pretty quickly. If you need a pail the 2pk refills are economical and a fabreze plugins will benefit your piece of mind. Owned for over three months of continued use with no issues.",

I love that there is no smell from either pail, and we let ours go a lot longer than we should between changes (literally diapers piling up so the lid won't close properly). Baby is on exclusively breast milk, so we will see how these do once we move to solids. The pails looks great in the nursery, and I love that there are multiple colors to choose from. Highly recommend these for both cloth and disposable diapers!",

Buy this over the regular size. You won\u2019t regret it. Also, you can make this into a regular trash can once your baby outgrows diapers. You will not be disappointed.",

I also really liked the bag inserts that came with the can, super easy/handy - and you could also use a reusable liner if desired no problem.",

I have to tape it in order for it to be closed. So the locking mechanism to remove the trash bag is terrible. Otherwise it is good for use and I love the color and how it looks nice and not like other diaper pails.",

    "description": "Color:GrayWho\u2019s excited about changing diapers 6,000-9,000 times per child? Dekor Hands-Free Diaper Pails are designed to make this unpleasant chore as easy as possible for you AND your budget. Unlike other disposal systems where you have to bend over, operate a lid, or shove a soiled diaper halfway inside the can, Dekor pails are 100% hands-free. After a diaper change, you are likely to have baby in one arm and the soiled diaper in the other. No one has a third hand to operate the diaper pail. Just STEP on our foot pedal AND DROP the soiled diaper through the trap door. No squishing, twisting or cramming. No other diaper pail on the market is as easy to use! A childproof lock keeps curious toddlers out. Continuous liners allow you to empty the pail whenever you want, using only as much refill as you need. Simply cut the refill with the kid-safe cutter located inside the access door, discard, and tie a new knot in the remaining bag. You don\u2019t need to waste a full bag to empty a partially-full pail. There is an effective triple odor control that keeps smell in the pail. First, the spring-loaded trap door shuts immediately after the diaper passes through. Next, rubber gaskets on the trap door and the top lid tightly seal odors inside the pail. Finally, the refillable liner helps neutralize odors with a pleasing baby-powder scent. Because all our pails are made with closed-cell ABS plastic, they cannot absorb odors like cheaper plastics, will not dent, and are scratch- and fade-resistant. You\u2019ll be able to use our product long after your little one is out of diapers. Simply pop out the diaper insert and use in the bathroom, kitchen, or garage. Great for use with cloth diapers with the Dekor Cloth Diaper Liner. The Dekor Plus holds up to 60 newborn diapers; and is available in the following colors: White, Gray, Pink, Blue, Black, Soft Mint.",
