I spent $30 on a smaller version of that one at Bed Bath & Beyond and hated it, it was WAY too small.

The battery AND plug charging options are great for traveling or needing it in a place with no plug if necessary. I highly recommend this, and will be buying this kind from here on out.",

If you can't get the base off, it will still tuck into just about any bag. And because it folds closed, the mirrors are protected. If you have questions or concerns, contact the seller, as they are very responsive and accommodating.",

You can install batteries but I do keep it connect to my computer as I dont have to worry about battery life . If you use batteries, the lighting wont be as bright as when you connect via the cable it came with. I like the desing because it has multiple mirrors with different with different close up ranges",

Anyone review or question said its brighter when plugged in compared to batteries- I haven\u2019t tried batteries yet but I would have thought plugging it in would give my the flickering. Oh it also has a convenient little dish at the base to hold whatever for you. Perfect for keeping track of hair pins or other smaller items. Overall, I definitely recommend.",

The only thing that i didn\u2019t like was that the port for the cord is angled towards the front, b/c that made it hard for me to plug it into the outlet but I made it work. I wish the port was next to the battery compartment, which would make it easier to use for my set up. I also wish there was a longer cable, so I had more flexibility. Otherwise love it & especially love that you can dim it!!",
