These characteristics play a great role in the success of a hike. However, it seems that its lacing system was its weak point. By and large, with its reconcilable mishaps, the Expeditor Trek 2.0 still has a lot of advantages worth looking into.",

      "text": "Bought these for my Husband in March to use at his Hillwalking Group. All seemed fine until today, when travelling over terrain and conditions that the boots were designed for, he has advised me that after a slightly heavier downpour than usual his boots became rapidly saturated making his journey pretty arduous to say the least! As I am extremely disappointed with this occurring I will be contacting the seller to advise of this situation and hopefully this will be resolved to allow me to review once more a lot more favourably!",

I persisted until i finished the walk but could not wear them the next day for another 10 miles. Still got them but will need the break them in before the next hike. They are light and generally comfortable, (apart from my issue) they will be worn again by me so happy with the buy\ud83d\udc4d i always look for a boot with a wide fit.. thought these might do it...
