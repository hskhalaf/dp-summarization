This is pencil width vs normal lipsticks I buy. It is smaller, cheaper quality, raised lettering Clinique name, made in different country and the comment \"not for individual sale\". The lipstick had tiny pimply bumps all over also. My first thought was that it's a knock off, but when I sent a message to the seller, she says that it isn't. I can't risk my health. I love the color, but I returned it. Waiting to see how much the seller refunds. Will never buy again without physically seeing the product.",

I wanted to get more into the world of lipstick (after finding a more natural color first) and find a fun going out color that would stand out! This is now my favorite lipstick to use when going out or dressing up for a fancy event! This color is beautiful!! It does a perfect job of amping up my outfit while accentuating my natural skin tone and not being too obnoxious. It's also the perfect combination where it feel hydrating without being sticky or easily smearing off. LOVE it!!",
