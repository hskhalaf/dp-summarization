It is essentially a second oven, you can cook pretty much anything in it. I opened it up right away and cooked our Turkey for Chrismas dinner. It cooked much faster than a traditional oven. I would recommend it to anyone who has the storage since it is quite large. Even if we only use it for holidays and family get together so still think it is well worth the money.",

The oven does, however, cook fast; we expected the turkey to be done in 4 hours and it was done in 3 hours following the time guidelines from Butterball. The turkey did come of fully browned; this was a complaint w/ some previous buyers. Excellent product and excellent shipping service from Amazon & UPS. Thanks.",

Removing it from the roaster to the oven for 15 min at a high temp will brown it.
