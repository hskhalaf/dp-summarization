Ended up calling a local Plaza Tire and they did it in less than 5 minutes for $14 including the old tire disposal, total is still cheaper than purchasing in store. First mow with tire worked as it should. Will update if it tears up. I bought an extra to keep as a spare since all local stores are currently out of stock.",

Once on, they ride like a charm and I can tell they will last a very long time. This is one of those purchases I would not hesitate to do again. Mowing 3 acres of lawn is my zen so making sure I have good tires is a must",

Compress tires with a ratchet strap to get bead to seal. An extra hand to air up the tire is helpful.",
