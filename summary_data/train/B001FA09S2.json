Each time I have used it, I have end up with chemicals all down my backside due to the pump leaking while pumping it. In addition to the leaking pump, the straps on it are very cheaply made. This is a poor product and I am very disappointed with this sprayer. I missed the return period through amazon and the manufacturer is not willing to return it. Poor product with bad customer service. I do not recommend buying Chapin products. I guess I just learned a lesson that cost me $71.99.",

I thought the first year this was caused by the cap on top of tank being screwed on (with low pressure in tank) creating nowhere for expansion to go.

The shoulder straps are not well padded as advertised. They are well built, but stiff with not much cushion. I fixed that by taping a couple old folded up washcloths on, which worked just fine then. I would pay $5 or more more to have nice cushioned straps. The CF valve keeps even pressure, but it needs almost continuous pumping to keep the pressure up, which isn't hard to do. Of the best five similar products by an independent review, I would buy this product again.",
