The only problem that I would consider maybe changing on the device is the fact that you can not remotely pair Bluetooth devices without taking the device off the Bose and then replacing it onto the pins.

Just one problem, the range on most of these system is limited and kept dropping the connection.

We love the sound and generally used apps such as Pandora and Tunein Radio to play music and listen to our favorite programs. The iPod was frozen at iOS6 so apps didn't function well or couldn't be installed. For the price, we tried this product to see if we could keep the Sound Dock going. It's incredible! Easy-to-use, works perfectly, the Bluetooth connection comes up fast and is reliable! No more dropping off the WiFil. Right now, we're connecting through an older iPad but it's great to know that we can connect through any number of Bluetooth devices.",

Simple and intuitive to use. You do need to take it off and put it back on (unless I'm missing something) between uses to get it to recognize your device after you haven't used it for a while (the equivalent of power-cycling, I think). I recommend this rather than fussing with buying an adapter that may or may not work (the ones I bought that worked for my car stereo and my iHome speaker did not work for the Bose).",

      "text": "This product is very easy to use and install. I have a 30-pin apple connector which is connected to my car stereo. After switching to iPhone 5's I got this product instead so that I wouldn't have to change my existing set up. A couple of things: 1) if you have a very old 30-pin accessory that uses FireWire charging, you need to purchase the version of this product that comes with the power adapter. 2) if you hook this up to a car stereo, you will likely need a ground loop isolator to get rid of the annoying high pitched whine. This is especially bad when charging your device since the two circuits share the same ground.",

Only minor issues I have is that in between songs on Pandora there is a feedback like sound that emanates from the Sound Dock. Other small issue is that I have to remove and re-dock the adapter before each use so that my phone can find it. Might be something I am doing wrong but nothing else seems to work. Overall, I do love this product and can totally live with these minor issues. I would highly recommend this product to others who want to stream via a Bluetooth connection on their compatible Sound Dock.",
