I wrote the company,but saw on their website that they had a 30 day window for refund. I got a really nice response from the company and there are sending me a replacement. So while I was upset about the vulnerability of the hose, I look forward to trying a new one and hopefully avoiding the leaks. These things happen and when the company is reponsive, you can't ask for more than that. That is excellent service.",

If you want it to move a lot of water or run a sprinkler, it\u2019s not great for that. The smaller diameter interior hose doesn\u2019t carry nearly as much water as a traditional hose. This keeps it flexible, but isn\u2019t going to be powerful enough to give you a strong jet of water. It won\u2019t have the volume to run your sprinkler as well as a normal hose.",

Provided it holds up over the season, this will be a truly excellent addition to my gardening supplies!",
