      "text": "These boxes are heavy duty but there is a fundamental problem with their design: It is difficult to slip mail into the slot! The problem is there is a lip welded at the top of the retrieval door that the mail catches on when the mail carrier slips it in the front. The mail either gets bent or often the carrier simply leaves it hanging halfway out the front, defeating the security altogether. The back side of the box needs to be smooth to allow normal size envelopes to pass. Magazines and larger envelopes get mutilated. Needs a rethink!!!",
