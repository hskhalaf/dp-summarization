No shedding fine dust, no rug moving around even with the dog pouncing all over the rug. It has gone through two moves now, and it honestly looks like brand new still.

Since I had to trim it anyway so that it would not show around the edges of my rug, this was not too much of a problem. I had to cut 4\" off the width to square it up.

You will end up rolling and unrolling your rug on it a few times before you get it right, so that it doesn't stick out from one of the sides. 2) At least on my Qing Spyder Bamboo floor, it leaves the checker pattern that is.... tough to get rid of. Even though you will never see it since it will be covered with your rug, but it might be something I would be worried about if I do decide to remove the rug from that area in the future.",
