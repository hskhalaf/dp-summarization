Thankfully the insoles were removable and I inserted \"Superfeet\" insoles this last weekend. My foot and back pain is subsiding now. I was drawn to KSwiss for a couple reasons. Amazon has KSwiss styles with more colors than just white or pink and that is why I went from my former Prince and Nike brands at my local sports store. My husband also owns a pair and loves how light they are and he seems to fly across court so I thought maybe if I had a pair (of Big Shots) it could help with my speed.",

And I don't ordinarily buy less expensive shoes. They also have a little extra support on the outside of your foot so when you are starting and stopping your foot doesn't feel like it will roll to the outside. Love them, love them. Also they play fairly cool on a hot tennis court.",

But the price was good. I doubt they will last as long as my last.",
