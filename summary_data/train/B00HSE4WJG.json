They are the perfect blending brush and are stiff enough to apply hard and soft powder. These are as soft as my Sephora, Mac, and Urban Decay brushes. Only time will tell if they last.",

You can have the best makeup in the world, but if you don't have great brushes to apply it, you won't achieve optimal results. Applying makeup with your hands or bad brushes is like finger painting, whereas with the right brush and tool, you can fine-tune detail and blending for a smooth finish.",

Would DEFINITELY recommend for a new person to makeup, as I am somewhat new to the advanced techniques.",

Usually you don't get smaller brushes that aren't for eye makerup and liners. This set has smaller brushes that makes it easier to get foundation to cover the dark circles under my eyes. .

I've ALWAYS used higher end brushes, but recently purchased an inexpensive contouring powder pallet (novice at contouring) and I didn't want to spring for expensive brushes. The quality highly exceeded my expectations; they're super soft, no hairs have fallen out, are still soft, and have held up well to cleaning. I will definitely purchase these again... the cost of all of these is still mush less than the cost of one MAC brush.",

These brush are wonderfully soft and apply makeup so smooth and wonderful. I had my doubts but I would buy these again and again!",

I use the four smaller brushes for my eye makeup application and the fluffier ones are fantastic for blending the eyeshadow edges. They are all thickly bristled and soft!
