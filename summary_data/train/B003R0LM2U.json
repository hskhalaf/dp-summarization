Corn products are one of the man sources, along with corn gluten. Cats are carnivores.we won't see them raiding corn fields on the middle of the night. The food is even an unappealing yellow color!!

      "text": "Purchased Pro Plan Urinary Focus wet food for my 2 cats recently. They absolutely LOVE taste of this wet food! I use it along with Pro Plan Focus Urinary dry food to help deter & control UTI's. One of my male cats had crystals develop in the past so he needs \"special\" food to keep him healthy & happy. As most \"parents\" of felines w/UTI's know - cats need lots of water to help prevent UTI's. I mix both the wet food feeding w/water (make it a soup) and also mix water with their dry food feeding. Pro Plan Focus Urinary has not disappointed my cats nor me! Great product and I highly recommend.",

This food is very wet and the cat gets water through the food as he eats. Our vet really didn't think our cat was going to make a recovery but was surprised to find him very hydrated upon his last examination. The key is to keep the cat hydrated enough to keep the urinary tract flowing fluid and not plugging up. Since using this food, our cat has had no urinary problems and is doing great.",
