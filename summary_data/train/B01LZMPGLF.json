Cons: - Water bottle holder mesh tore from elastic on first use with a regular sized water bottle. Other thoughts: - Over time the strap has started to loosen up. Adjustments are needed daily vs. weekly.",

It's built very well, all seams good, no loose threads or missing areas. Holds a decent amount of notebook sized items, has inside pockets for smaller items. Strap can be moved to L or R side depending on how you want to wear it. Very happy with this purchase.",

I will sew a secondary handle on top of where the main strap meets the belt to combat this, so the bag will carry higher when I hook my hand through it. Highly recommend a cord/misc item organizer.

I have the dark gray color and it looks classy enough with the leather straps, I only don't like how the front straps curl up at the ends though might be something that happens with all straps like that.

      "text": "We're enjoying this bag. Not suitable as a replacement for a purse but great for outings and travel (perfect for using in boating as it holds a lot of stuff). Good for 1-2 persons but not stuffed to the gills as it gets too bulky. Army green color very neutral, doesn't hold onto dirt and scuffs. All pockets, zippers function well, takes a bit of getting used to as it is carried over one shoulder - front or back. Priced right, after shopping for a very long time, we're glad we got it!",
