      "text": "I was initially disappointed when my handgun with a rail mounted tactical light blocked the barrel post, preventing the gun from securing in the rack. But like any red-blooded ammosexual, I found a solution. Get yourself a bitdriver, and slap a 8mm socket on it. Then unscrew the two tiny bolts holding the barrel posts. Invert the barrel posts so the bulky post bar is now on top, reinstall bolts. Viola, your tacticool accessorized gun now fits. Now stand majestically in front of your waving American flag and drink a beer, for you are a true defender of freedom. Pew pew, Murica.",

Could be a litter deeper (one or two inches) for longer barrel guns. My Ruger Mark IV Hunter just barely fits if I angle it in on the bottom of the safe.",

Since I have rail mounted lights on all my pistols I removed the hangers and shelf, added real foam, then cut to fit 2 full size pistols, 2 magazines, and a subcompact under the bottom shelf. Much quicker draw now but it did take some doing. The slow code entry is the worst part about it though.",

The door which is spring loaded to quicken access to the guns slammed against its spring without any dampening and against the table top. Imagine the noise that makes, and therefore makes \u201cstealth\u201d as advertised, impossible.

As others have mentioned the beeping sound was quite annoying while pressing the buttons but in the instructions there's a way to turn that off. The main reason I'm giving it a lower than 5 star review, is after learning my combination pattern I could do it faster than it could register, so to enter it at a nice calm pace might be hard in a stressful situation.",

      "text": "Safe seems very secure and easy to program. The only negatives i have found are the power cord is very short and the outlet is on the side of the safe. Since i am a lefty, the placement of the safe puts the power output on the wrong side. If it were located on the back of the safe it would work better. Same with the security cable. The interior light is perfect for being able to see the gun when the safe is opened, but it is very difficult to see the barrel posts in the back of the safe when trying to put the gun back inside.",

Plan to transition this from the night stand to below the gun rack with magazines, ammo and one hand gun. The hangers are rubber coated with a sleeve which does leave the mettle tip exposed. But is you take your time placing the gun on the hanger you have no worries of any damage. Oh, the night stand? full bio-metric reader is the plan, single gun.",
