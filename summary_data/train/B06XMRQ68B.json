      "text": "I am extremely disappointed in this keyboard. Right out of the box the right arrow key gets easily stuck when pressing it. This is very frustrating when web browsing or trying to watch a video because the key is engaged. It was like this out of the box and never went away after 2 weeks of use. It seems the cause of this issue is poor quality control as it seems the plastic of the bottom border will brush up against the keycap and prevent it from disengaging. The worst part about this whole process was dealing with Logitech Customer Support. They denied that it was a real issue and called it a cosmetic issue. This is ridiculous. Buyer Beware.",

I have recorded a video of how the keys sound. Best to turn up the volume and wear some headphones to hear it clearly, listen carefully after each button is pressed down and released. The noise is incredibly distracting and really is a shame on an otherwise fantastic keyboard. I thought my keyboard was just a bad, defective one, but it seems like other users have this issue as well. If you search youtube other Logitech Romer G keyboards including the Pro also have this issue.",

The lighting is fully customizable however the white, like the g810, looks more like blue than white. The shade of purple is my favorite color on this keyboard and I use it with lime green accents.

After a day of use I am extremely pleased with my choice. This keyboard excels at gaming and perhaps surprisingly it's also an excellent choice for plain old typing.

It's a fantastic TKL (ten key-less) option, especially for price performance, and it integrates beautifully into the software, but otherwise, just for pure switch quality, I'm thinking I may swap to a different keyboard. If switches make or break a keyboard for you, the soft rubbery feeling at the end of a stroke makes it feel a bit weird for FPS's and MMORPGs. Would recommend, but if you have more money, I would definitely splurge on a slightly nicer TKL like the one's linus tech tips just reviewed.",

Only knocks against it are no USB ports, and the RGB lighting seems a little inconsistent in which profile it loads. Seems like a software issue. If they could add the extra USB passthrough port I'd give it 5 stars. Everything else is really top notch.",
