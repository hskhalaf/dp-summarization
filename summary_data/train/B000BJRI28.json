      "text": "I bought this speaker as an in wall center channel speaker and it excels in that role. This compliments 4 Yamaha NS IW660 speakers that I used for front and rear surrounds. The speaker chassis is solid and will not be prone to any components vibrating which can be annoying with some in wall speakers. The sound is excellent and clear. The highs are crisp and not tinny and the mid-range response is excellent. My only dislike is that the cover screen is domed and I would have preferred a flat screen for a cleaner appearance.",

I actually found it easier to install these speakers than mounting a set of Bose. I could not recommend this enough.",

I wish they made this with a seperate midrange driver to give it more presence in the midrange. You will need a sub woofer to get the real lows.",

It replaced an Onkyo surround system. The speaker delivers with distinct vocals and great clarity. The center channel speaker is crucial in any surround setup, and this one delivers. I think not getting these same speakers for my left and right fronts proved to be key as well, but I could see purchasing these for the 3 front speakers. The only thing keeping me from giving that 5th star is the fact there is no mid-low cutoff control. Overall, good job Yamaha",

    "title": "Yamaha NSIW960 2-Way Speaker",
    "description": "In-wall front/center speaker system combines superb sound and nearly invisible design to compliment any home theater environment.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nSave space in your listening room with the Yamaha NS-IW960 speaker. The easy-to-install unit mounts conveniently in the wall, where its narrow footprint doesn't keep it from delivering powerful, high-performance sound for both movies and music. The speaker is particularly suited to front or center channel applications in a surround sound system thanks to its versatile three-driver design, which ensures that the lows, mids, and highs all receive ample attention. The NS-IW960's dual 6.5-inch Kevlar cone woofers, for instance, reproduce frequencies as low as 50 Hz--a solid number for an in-wall speaker. The 1-inch titanium dome tweeter, meanwhile, ranges as high as 28 kHz. The end result is warm, rich sound that transitions smoothly and seamlessly from bass-heavy passages to soaring vocal highs. \n\n Yamaha uses only high-quality materials when building the drivers to ensure superb sound quality from any source. And should you need to re-orient your listening area for any reason, the NS-IW960 stands ready to accommodate your new setup. The speaker's tweeter is built on an adjustable swivel, so you can \"aim\" the high-frequency sounds toward the new listening position. To do so, simply press on the edge of the tweeter until it reaches the correct angle. \n\n Finally, each speaker includes a high-capacity, customized crossover network at 6.5 kHz that helps minimize distortion and prevent the deterioration of transients as they pass through the network. And installation is straightforward thanks to the included cutout template, the paintable grille and frame, and the gold-plated push-type speaker terminals. Note that proper installation requires such tools as a power drill, a drywall saw, wire strippers, a level, a Philips screwdriver, and a sturdy wire such as a coat hanger. \n\n The speaker, which boasts a power rating of 50 watts nominal and 150 watts maximum, measures 7.69 by 23.44 by 3.75 inches (W x H x D) and requires a mounting depth of 3.16 inches. The speaker is also backed by a two-year warranty on parts and labor. \n\n What's in the Box\nSingle NS-IW960 in-wall speaker, speaker grille, cutout template, paint protective cover, glue strip, user's manual.",
