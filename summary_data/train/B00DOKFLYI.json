After speaking to a nutritionist, we learned that ground flaxseed can go rancid very quickly, so I'm suspicious about how long ours had been sitting in Amazon's inventory.

I have subscribed to this product and hope it continues to be offered here on Amazon. A bonus is the fantastic price! Thank you Spectrum Organics for a superb product!",

I am going to use them to make my salmon burgers since I can't eat dairy and eggs at the moment. I read that they can be used as a binder to hold the salmon flakes together. The quality is good enough to use as a topping on desserts too.",
