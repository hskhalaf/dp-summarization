But then I washed it, and the fabric of the pillow cases is CRAZY wrinkled now, and the comforter straight up shrunk. It was a king size, and now it barely fits on my queen size guest bed. I've never even heard of such a thing happening. I had no idea comforters could shrink. So... Not real thrilled with it. What good is a comforter you can't wash?",

I washed it after I opened the package gentle cycle cold water and then dried it on delicate and air fluff took around 3 cycles to get it 85% dry. I ordered a king to fit my Cali king bed and it\u2019s a bit short but it still looks great !",

I like that they have such stylish options in a comforter, because that\u2019s really hard to find and no one wants a duvet cover for a kids bed, trust me. It can get a little wrinkled after washing but I have bought worse at a more expensive price. I would definitely buy another for my littlest when she moves to a big bed! :)",
