You have to tighten the ring down so hard that you get a constant stream of metal filaments in your sausage mix and it causes the unit to work necessarily harder. If you don't tighten enough, meat squeezes out the collar. The new blade is so cheap and light I can't imagine it lasting more than a season.

I tried completely thawed just to see and it gums up the blades pretty bad. Also, clean the blades often while you're grinding as bits of sinew and fat will get stuck on the blades and make grinding difficult.

A must for those cooks out there.",

The other problem is, the blades got rusted the first wash, which is not good, the holes on the blades are too small to wash the rust off. I still like the idea, just hope they can have better quality.",

I used it to grind my whitetail deer meat this season, and it did very well. One thing that multiple reviewers mentioned is metal shavings in their food. Well I FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS and it did just fine with no metal shavings and no issues. It does not grind fast, but it grinds well for being an attachment and not a dedicated grinder.",

Grind my own burgers with trimmings from other meats (i.e. T-bone, round roast, chuck roasts, etc.) I get the best eating from well trimmed beef buys AND great hamburger ground with the ratio of fat to meat I want. The attachment works well with my KitchenAid Professional 6 mixer and is simple to clean. I recommend storing in the refrigerator or freezer so that it is ready to use (always grind meat chilled through a chilled grinder to minimize bacteria.) The price was about the same as a manual clamp-on-to-shelf style which appears very difficult to clean and would require a lot of cranking to do the job that this KitchenAid attachment does in a flash.",

After that I put the meat in the grinder and turned on.....the plastic ring didn't hold the pressure and busted......so here we are still hungry.
