She struggles to gain weight, even with high calorie kibble, so I bought this to help give her a little extra padding. It really does work too! Luna absolutely goes crazy for this stuff. It smells like vanilla (from the milk proteins I believe) which is better than a lot of the nastier smelling foods. I don't follow the directions because I don't have the patience to measure out this viscous liquid. Instead I just drizzle a bit over her food. Be careful though because Luna vomited from eating her food too fast, even with a slow feeder.",
