      "text": "If I could give zero starts I would. This thermometer worked great...until it didn't. One probe still functions, but the second probe reads ridiculous temperatures - e.g., 105 degrees for room temperature (when the first probe reads -- correctly -- a comfortable 70 degrees). We've switched out the two thermometers and the base is not the problem - it appears to be the second probe. This is my second iDevices thermometer, and I was so hopeful that this one was going to be better than the last. It's a great concept, but the quality just isn't there. At this point, I'm just waiting for the first probe to fail.",

Just an iDevice. I use to probe the meat several times upon the finishing cooking process which works, but you watch all the juices from the meat escape when you remove the probe. And it's always a guessing game as to when to start the other dishes you plan on serving with the meat. With this device, you gets results throughout the whole cooking period allowing better meal planning. The device works great and makes me a champion when cooking meats of all types.",

When the Idevice came to the right temp the plastic thing in the turkey didn't pop. The turkey was so moist. We just recently used it for our pork roast and turned out great. We will use this for all of our cooking for now on.",

      "text": "This is a great tool and we love using it. However its 7-10 degrees off. Its shows 165F but when we check in the same location with a traditional thermometer its always shows less. So we got in habit or coking everything 10 degrees past the thermometers reading. So when its beeps ands says \"Your food is ready\" it's another 5-10 degrees that it'll actually be ready. We had to throw things back on the grill to cook longer several times. The most accurate reading we got so far is for salmon, but that's usually not too thick. Something like tri-tip and turkey is harder to read. Overall great product, but needs some improvement in temp reading.",

I emailed Weber and finally received a call back over 2 weeks later only to find out that the probes go bad and they don't show a replacement probe available! Great! So I'm out over $200 and can't get parts or warranty service. Weber advised me to call Amazon! Don't buy!",

For one the app isn't dedicated to the Kitchen Thermometer, but instead controls all of the iDevices, so if you're only this one thermometer, there are unnecessary and slightly confusing steps involved in using it. Also be warned that the alarm that goes off when your meat is 10 \u030aF from reaching its desired temperature is only as loud as the current settings on your phone. If you have the ringer switch turned to vibrate and/or your ringer volume turned down, it could be a sad, char-filled dinner.",

While having both probes in the same piee of meat, the device will show two different temperatures, one of which could be 50 to 100 degrees different. I've had so many replacement probes I can only assume they use the cheapest componets available. One lady in customer service was very nice, but with the history I've had with this product, I'd never recommend.",
