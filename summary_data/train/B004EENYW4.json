I cannot understand why the first pair didn\u2019t shrink and this pair did the first time I washed them.

After the first washing all but one shrunk so that, what once fitted me perfectly in length, now 4 of them had shrunk so that they now fitted between my knees and ankles!

      "text": "Very disappointed because they look NOTHING like the picture. The color is way too white and they look extremely fake. Obviously they aren't real jean material, but I don't think they could even pass as jeans from far away. I would like them more if the front pockets were actually real (instead of the side pockets), if they had real buttons, if the drawstring wasn't on the outside (less noticeable) and if all the detail didn't look as if a child drew it on with a crayon. Also, the material is very thin. My boyfriend literally wears jeans to bed, so I wanted to get him pajamas that looked like jeans. lol",

I kept them for myself (I'm female and wear a 16) and reordered a large for him. I've had two pair (med) for years and love them. Wish they would make them in a \"non destressed\" pattern or other colors.",

We finally had to replace these after all this time. They finally wore out. They even keep their color pretty, only lost about 50% of their color and turned a slight muddy red compared to the new ones we jus got in the mail.

That is, unless you really like to wear high-high-waters. No matter what you do with these, they will shrink in length to the point they are not wearable at all in my opinion. Too bad too, because they are a great idea and very comfortable to wear otherwise.",
