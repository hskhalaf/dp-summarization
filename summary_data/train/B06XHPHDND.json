I took a shower March 14th 2018 and the hose near the top ... next to the base was leaking and various spots - good 6 inches down the hose needless to say water going all over the place and lost my pressure that I had come accustomed to. Not a happy customer! Must be inferior product Within the coil, it seems that the rubber inside the hose was getting brittle or something was eating at it.",

Literally, if i held it so it sprayed straight up, the water would go about an inch into the air, and I have very good water pressure. I'd barely give this three stars if it weren't for the outright lie in the product description.",

As advised in reviews, made sure not to over tighten during the less than 5 minute install and had no problems with it breaking or leaking. The water pressure improved tremendously!
