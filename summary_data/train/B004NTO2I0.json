I returned the first camera I got of this model because of a defect with the lens - no problem about doing that and the replacement came quickly and works great. It's a good size to fit in my purse and the zoom is plenty for pretty much any situation. I would buy this camera again.",

It might do better with manual setting, but the whole idea for us was that it be easy to use, and having to manually adjust it all the time makes it pretty much useless on that score. Our iPhones take much better pictures, more easily, lacking only the zoom feature. :-(",

The battery life is definitely a problem and spare batteries are available but still expensive at the time of this review ($35-$50 range). It eats up battery power even when the camera is turned off. In bright sunlight the LCD screen is difficult to see. Operationally the camera is easy to use and turns out good photos.",

Initially I thought it is my finger was on the flash and later discovered that the lens zoom is getting in the way of the flash.I wouldn't recommend this camera until they fix the flash issue.
