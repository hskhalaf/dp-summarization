Because of the open eye area they fit my face better. The Fuel Cell frame makes me look like my eyes are too close together...not the case with the Batwolf.

      "text": "Been searching for these at a good price everywhere for a month straight. Popped this bad boy into my Amazon cart to watch the price fluctuate (as Amazon products normally do) and in four days it dropped to 101.99 so that's how much I got them for. With no tax. I got a good price on some genuine oakleys that I love the clear frame and the blue lenses. They match my work uniform colors so it works out. I would recommend these for someone who is looking for these",
