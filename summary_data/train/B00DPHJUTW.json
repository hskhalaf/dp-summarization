      "text": "We really like putting our kids in Keen sandals because they're so durable and easy to clean. Previously we were getting them the Keen Newport sandals, but the Seacamp ones were on sale, so we went with those this time. I like them a lot better. The sole is slightly slimmer and more flexible, and my toddler seemed to have a much easier time running in them. Unless the Newports are significantly cheaper, I would go with the Seacamps. I would add though that both sandals are a bit narrow in the toddler sizes. We always have to go up a size for my son, and he always outgrows the width before he fills out the shoe lengthwise.",

This last pair we bought on here in 2014 have not held up well at all. In fact anytime they get wet they dye my daughter's feet red. Disappointed in buying a more expensive product that isn't holding up to past expectations.",

(I believe the size 5 for Keen corresponded to her exact foot size so I got a size above so it will fit for the entire summer). I got these because of the closed back and front, the ability to go in water, and the thin sole compared to the other Keen sandal. PROs: Fits as expected. Flexible sole, I can bend it easily with one hand and also twist it. Easy to put on. Even though I got a size up, they are not too loose. CONs: 4 stars because I don't like the big price discrepancy between colors! :)",

My first pair (Newport H2) has been tried-and-true, traveling to several countries for miles of hikes and walks through all sorts of terrain and weather. I wanted a 2nd pair to wear while my 1st pair was drying from rain/rafting/beach. These are comparable to the Newport H2's in that both are comfortable, air-dry pretty fast and are the ugliest shoes I own. The main difference is that these are much lighter and nowhere near as clunky and clowny-looking. You won't win any fashion contests with these but they are practical and excellent hiking sandals.",

My son's feet smelled *AWFUL* after wearing these and continued to smell worse as time went on. Again, I washed them and it did nothing to the odor.

I have two boys and I handed down one pair to the other they looked almost new even though they had been worn as his brothers primary shoes. I love these shoes. Easy to clean never stinky, never ripped. A part from a strap adjuster broke off at some point but it didnt affect the shoe so im putting that in the plus category. You can adjust the width of the shoe so that helped as they were passed around between my two going from wide to medium.",

That being said, when it's 95 degrees out in the summer and she's playing in the yard, or she comes out of the pool, that's not always realistic. I needed something that would help support her for those rare times she is not wearing her gym shoes, and after doing a lot of research, purchased these, and I've been happy with the way her feet have responded! They seem very well made, and if you're open on color, you can probably get them cheaper here than anywhere else.",
