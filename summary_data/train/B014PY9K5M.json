Recently my device worked until the day after the warranty ended and then it started working intermittently. So I checked on line and found this TP-Link AC1900 router onsale and decided to give it a try. So much easier to set up this system and get devices online, and it is a lot quicker than the gigabit router from linksys. the touchscreen display is great and keeps me from getting my laptop out to set up the linksys router. If you are not tech savvy and want quick wireless, give this one a try.",

The screen is nice however only really useful for child controls and guest logon where you have to have a self changing code.

I thought it was my connection until I tried another router, turns out this router has been my problem. I highly recommend a different router, it's unfortunate that I spent so much and got very little in return. The great reviews is what lured me in, so hopefully I can help someone else to choose a better router.",
