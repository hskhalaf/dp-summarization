We went from a broken, worthless system that woudln't even hold a season's worth of gear, to holding every type of shovel, rake, broom and yard tool I could find. My only gripe is that one of the silver pegs that you must insert to hold the attachments in was faulty. The little belly-button type bump wouldn't move in to allow it to go through the holes. Eventually I gave up and used a hammer to gently tap it through the holes. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another, but it fits EVERYTHING I have, so I don't even need it!",

Way too confusing of an installation for a simple storage rack. Do yourself a favor and just buy the Rubbermaid track system for half the cost and prevent making huge holes in your garage for no reason. The company should provide better hardware and instructions on a 90 dollar product. I was definitely not satisfied and will be returning the product.",
