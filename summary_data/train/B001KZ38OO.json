It takes forever, and sometimes it advances and then flips the wrong photo. We still haven't been able to access the settings menu to switch our preferences. This is supposed to be a gift! We were going to load the pictures to save them the hassle but I still dont even know if I want to send it.",

    "description": "Color:BirchFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nWhat Makes Cagic So Much Better? \n\nEuropean Styling \nCagic was designed by a European-trained interior stylist using quality materials and bringing a passionate attention to detail. Unlike other gadgets on the market, Cagic will look gorgeous in any d\u00e9cor and from any angle. It is not a gadget but an element of home d\u00e9cor. Cagic is available in three beautiful frame finishes: mahogany, birch and black. \n\nIntuitive Touch Matting Interface \nFrame buyers tend to be women and tend to gift to an older audience. They want to enjoy their pictures, not learn (or need to explain) a new gadget. We at Cagic understand this, which is why we created an intuitive touch-matting interface for effortless frame operation. \n\nExpandable Memory \nLike most other frames, Cagic has multiple slots to accommodate different camera memory cards. In addition, Cagic has an extra SD memory slot that ships with a 2GB SD card inserted. This gives users the convenience of on-board memory with the flexibility to expand the memory available based on their needs. Users who wish to have more on board memory can simply remove the SD card and replace it with a larger one. \n\nFreedom in Orientation \nCagic can be placed vertically or horizontally according to the user's preference or mood. The frame will immediately and automatically display pictures correct for however the frame is placed. \n\nNext Generation Platform \nCagic is the first frame built on the new generation of image processors, rather than the standard AmLogic or MagicPixel chipset. This allows for more fluid display of photos and faster performance and storage. \n\nTrue Touch Matting \nUnlike other frames with glowing buttons, Cagic is the first digital picture frame with true, patent-pending touch matting technology. The use of soft keys in the matting allows for a complete integration of controls into the frame, without interfering with the elegant design of the frame. \nTechnical Specifications \n\nVivid, luxuriant color screen \n-- LCD: 8.4\" Full Color TFT LCD with TrueVu for perfect photos every time \n-- Resolution: High resolution 800x600 Flexibility in storage media \n-- Mini USB connection to connect to a camera, flash drive or a computer \n-- Compatible Memory Cards: CompactFlash (CF), SecureDigital (SD), MMC, MemoryStick, MemoryStick Pro, MemoryStick Duo \n-- Two separate SD card slots: one for storage, one to load photos \n\nCapacity to hold years of your favorite memories \n-- Storage: Included 2GB SD card holds up to 20,000 photos at 800x600 resolution with CPO5 optimization \n-- Number of photos will vary by resolution \n-- Native JPG format \n-- SD Card can be replaced to increase screen storage capacity \n\nBeautifully designed and integrated power cord completes the design \n-- Power: 5V 2A \n-- AC: 110V-240V \n\nThe perfect size for your home \n-- Dimensions: 10.1\" x 12\" x 3.2\" \n-- Weight: 4 lbs, 2 oz \n\nIn the box, everything you need to view your pictures in minutes \n-- Cagic Digital Frame with included 2GB SD Card \n-- AC Adapter \n-- Mini USB -> USB Adapter \n-- Quick Start Guide",
