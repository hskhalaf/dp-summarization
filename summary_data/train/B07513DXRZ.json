Video is while my six year old goddaughter pulled her bait out of the water and put it back in just as the fish swam away, fun times! Haha! Northern pike like to attack the camera, but luckily the camera is pretty tough!",

      "text": "I've been using this camera for about a year and absolutely love it. Ice fishing is SOOO much more amusing when you can watch the fish approaching your lures. We usually drill 4 holes, then put the camera in one of the ends holes, pointed at the other three. Once we get all three lines into view, the show begins. Surprisingly good picture quality, even at depth. My camera recently died, and I emailed the company. Within 8 hours they had responded and sent me a new camera. I know electronics will go bad sometimes, but knowing the company will actually respond and help me resolve the issue is important when considering a purchase. Very impressed so far.",

Did all I expected it to do.. Kids loved it too. Made fishing with them way more fun..",
