Again the design is fine, but the dimension should be roughly an inch larger. I'm sending it back. For reference the bun in the attached photo is just a standard white bread 3-3/4\" bun.",

I tried to press burgers with stuff inside, the burger did not hold together very well. ended up reducing the amount of fillers I put in it. The diameter is a bit smaller than I would like. Since the meat shrinks, the end product is smaller in diameter. The meat did stick, but since the bottom pushes out, it is easy to make the patties. Making thick burgers went well, just harder to cook all the way through, thus a larger diameter would work better. Over all, it is OK, works well, but may look for one larger in diameter.",

I used to almost \"knead\" my ground beef, mixing in spices, etc. Now with this I just quickly put the meat in the press, then sprinkle Worcestire and seasoning on top of the burger, not touching it.

There is no actual press to mush the ground meat into neat and even little slider shapes. It was cheap and not worth returning, so I tossed it out. FYI: For my sliders, I put pre-cut hamburger paper (from Amazon) in a muffin tin and used a juice glass to mush them down. I should have thought of that first and saved a few dollars.",

When making stuffed burgers, you really can't put too much in the middle. Maybe a taller press is in order. Also, when stuffing burgers, keep in mind that your cook times will be different. Since there is only a thin layer of beef on each side now, it will cook very quickly. If you like making your own patties though, this is a must. They came out nice every time. Fresher and cheaper than buying frozen patties! Enjoy.",

If you have a hard time making your patties the right size by hand, then this could be the answer. My issue is, the hamburger sticks to the surface of the press, so it's hard to get the patties out without taking it apart every time. I'm sure this will vary depending on the fat content of your burger. I'll probably still use it sometimes, it does make them look really uniform and nice.

The handle is supposed to turn to lock onto the burger press, but the teeth are too small to engage. What happens then is the press sticks in the base. Frankly, I believe this a just a poor design. The so-called slider press is just a stand-alone mold. Overall, this is way overpriced for what you get. Instantly returned.",

I still sprayed it down with a little oil, but honestly, I don't know if it was really necessary. This is a great New kitchen gadget.",

The plastic prongs that hold the two major pieces together for non-stuffed burgers wear very quickly and you cannot hold the pieces together. This renders the press useless. I had to order a new press simply because I have not found one that stuffs a burger as well. I am doomed to buy a new one every year, it seems.",

The handle does not give like others when pressing the burger and you don't feel like you are going to break it.

Put a round of meat (I made mine 1/3 pound) in the middle of the baggie. Don't close. Place the baggie in the press and press away. Perfect size burgers ready for freezing. Just shut the baggie and then store the burgers in a freezer storage baggie. This way they are double bagged and will be less likely to get freezer burn. And since they are in individual bags, it's easy to take out as many as you need and return the remainder to the freezer.",

We made 50 hamburgers in only 20 minutes using a scale to measure the weight ( a quarter pound ) a paper on bottom and one on top. The finished (cooked) patty size is perfect for standard hamburgers buns. I have yet to attempt sliders with this. I have made one stuffed burger, and for that purpose it worked well.",
