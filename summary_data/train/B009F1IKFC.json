Everything fired right up; monitor at native resolution, touch enabled and accurate and audio working with a good bump in volume vs Surface Pro speakers. Pros: - size - colors for main user - touch accuracy - built in speakers - price/value - VESA mount - resolution matches hd laptop resolution - reaching for screen to click a button actually works! Cons - colors yellow for off center viewers - screen glare in high ambient light - DVI only might be an issue for some - no bezel touch ability means some gestures don't work",

As you sweep from the bezel, your finger doesn't enter at the exact edge of the screen, so Windows 8 often doesn't recognize the gestures. It's possible to learn to get them to work much of the time: start the gesture by touching the screen right at its edge with your fingernail \"pointing in,\" but I still have trouble with the top and bottom gestures.",

I'm using it in a Virtual Organ installation (using Hauptwerk and Grand Orgue) I've designed that displays the organ console's stops, pistons, and couplers, and when you touch the stops they either come on or turn off. However, the only issue with this model is that the screen is very reflective so you'll need to be careful with not placing it in away the reflects too much. Otherwise it's an outstanding 24\" monitor and touch-screen combination. This is actually my 2nd (same model).",
