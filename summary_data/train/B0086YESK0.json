Including HUMAN DANDER. My dog is literally allergic to humans. His outbreaks look like huge raw, bloody scabs with bald patches. He was previously taking 5 different medications as well as getting antigen shots weekly (insanely expensive). 5 months after switching to v-dog, he is completely off all 5 meds and is only getting weekly antigen shots. Not to mention, he absolutely loves the food. And he's picky. Great product. Better for his health and the environment AND I'm saving thousands in vet bills. Win.",

Caleb, my Yorkie loved the food on its own at first but since he is a picky eater, I have been adding nutritional yeast (a vegan staple) or peanut butter to enhance the flavor for him. Sometimes I will add some fruit or veggies from my plate. I have been subscribing to this food for a while but I hope other flavors can be integrated.",
