The c-stands are cheap, the internal part of the soft boxes are cheap, it took forever to force the soft box open because it's not fluid, it came with smaller bulbs than other soft boxes and again, it's cheap. Pay the extra money and get the more expensive soft boxes.",

Also, adjust the legs on light stands so the lights don't tip over if you don't have weight bags. Amazing price for what you get!",

Also, came with no instructions on how to assemble etc. Just a bunch of stuff in the bag. Not impressed.",

My only issue (as is with the top heavy products) is connection from the light box at the top to the base is quite flimsy. Anchoring it down is problematic and I could see this an an issue if you have to move these around a lot. I have these in my studio permanently so they dont move, but that connection wears quickly (and would need a replacement) if you aren't careful.",
