The watch is very comfortable to where. The screen is ok. But could be better. I added a screen protector on it. Kinda sucks but leaving it on for now. Far as pricing I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the money. Catch it on sale like I did. And the app sucks. If you can get around without using the app then it\u2019s fine. Other then that it\u2019s not a bad watch.",

Mine is, always has been, but still not connection and the same error message. I don't know of a similar product that works better, but you should certainly AVOID Suunto watches if you plan on using them in the woods.",

Although it has held up against some pretty harsh situations. So I guess the plastic housing is a matter of preference. I feel it\u2019s not worth the price for the functionality though.",

Connecting to your computer is finiky and and it stopped working at all after 2 years when the battery would last only 5 days. I gave up finnaly on this Suunto after I hit my arm on a shelf and the plastic mold broke where the telescopic rod connects on one side. 0 Stars from me. way too many problems.",
