No items were bent or scratched and there was no rust. All of which were common complaints. They also added better instructions that were easy to follow, took me an hour to put together. The rack is very sturdy and a great buy for the price! Looking forward to my workouts!",

Scratches, dents, misprint of post numbers. Post position 10 is through the joint between upper and lower posts and will not align, so that the position cannot be used as a weight station. This is a bummer, since it would be the perfect location for my bench. I gave this rack 4 stars. It seems very stable, and is more than adequate. It looks great at 10 feet. Any closer and you start to see the cosmetic issues I mentioned.",

The square tubing is 3\"x3\" and has a 1\" diameter hole in case you were wondering. CONS: I wish Cap made some more accessories that you could mount to this rack like a dip bar. The worst part of this item was the shipping. UPS (United Package Smashers) really did a \"bang up job\" (pun intended) handling this one.",
