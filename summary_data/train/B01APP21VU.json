I am super unhappy with the customer service and now have been on HOLD again for maybe 20 or more minutes waiting to see if they can send me a pan. I might just throw these in my RV as junk pans and buy from someone else after this, sad",

      "text": "Would be straight 5 stars but the lids on this whole line of Calphalon cookware are just slightly a pain in the butt to clean. There is a small gap between where the glass meets the metal that you have to force the corner of a sponge into. I bought one of those bristle brushes for $2 from the grocery store to fix the issue (the kind that hold the soap in the handle).",

    "description": "Style Name:Sautee Pan| Color:Gray| Size:5 quart\n\nThe Calphalon Classic Nonstick 5-Quart Saute Pan with Cover is made with dual-layer nonstick for extra-easy food release and cleanup, and is constructed from durable hard-anodized aluminum for fast and even heating. With its wide, flat cooking surface, the multi-purpose non stick saute pan gives you plenty of room to brown or sear chicken, fish, steaks or vegetables. Low sides make it easy to flip, stir and turn foods, while still keeping splattering to a minimum. This saute pan is finished with a long, stay-cool stainless steel handle. Includes oven-safe tempered glass lid to help foods retain moisture when cooking.\n\nUse & Care:\n\nHand wash only. Never place cookware in an automatic dishwasher, or use abrasive cleaning pads or cleansers that can damage the pan and void the warranty. Interior: Clean the interior nonstick surface of the pan with a liquid dishwashing detergent such as Dawn and a non-abrasive sponge or soft bristle brush. Exterior: Clean the hard-anodized exterior surface of the pan with a liquid dishwashing detergent such as Dawn and a non-abrasive sponge or soft bristle brush. For stubborn spots on the exterior only, use Bar Keeper\u2019s Friend cleanser and a non-abrasive sponge.",
