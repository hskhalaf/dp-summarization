The only issue is the jack which doesn't fit if you are using a thick tablet cover. You have to remove the protective cover to be able to insert the jack all the way.",

I haven't figured out how to remove it yet and the sound is staying in headphone mode so my kid cannot use it for now. It's a shame because up until now they were great and she loved them.",

First pair broke within warranty period. New pair was sent without issue by manufacturer. The sound quality on the replacement pair was poor at first, but then just stopped working. I didn't bother reaching out for another replacement - just kind of seemed the product was not meant to be a solution for our house/standards.",

As a parent, I like that the headphone jack unplugs from the headset. This allows faster untangling of the cord, and also allows the kids to run around with the headset and pretend that they are listening to music or talking on headsets without the cord getting tangled on everything. The Kids favorite feature is that the headsets plug into one another, however one of our two sets has a defect so we can only plug them into each other in a certain order.",

They are just his size, easy for him to plug in and he loves all the stickers that came with it. The volume remains low no matter the device he plugs it into. Love that you can plug another pair of headphones into these, so both he and his sister can listen to the same device at once - no more fighting. So far, I am very happy with my purchase.",

The price was excellent (varied by color so check them all before purchasing) and the quality is good. As my kid is normally very well behaved I didn't think the durability was too important but I was proved wrong shortly into the road trip and happy to say the headphones held up great. The dual headphone jack adapter being standard is a great touch and knowing I don't have to worry about the volume being cranked too high on accident is very reassuring. I would recommend these to anyone with kids.",

My daughter is 3 1/2 and they fit her great, she also loved being able to pick from the decorative stickers to add. The headphones volume isn't that loud, but that was perfect for me.",
