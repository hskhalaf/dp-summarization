It's incredibly simple to setup and really neat to be able to search the internet while I'm watching TV. The only cons are: - No 3D Blu Ray support - Some blocked online content, like Hulu, but I mostly use it for Netflix - Remote is kind of clunky, but I just use the free iPhone app instead, which is great (there's an Android App too) Those three cons aren't really important to me, which is why I still gave it 5 stars.

I got it for a good price. I am very happy with it, My oldest Daughter is buying one for her and her husband. It comes with a built in program that teaches you how to use all the buttons on the controller and all the features that it has.The internet sure looks better on my HD TV than on my computer! It has a full web browser so the web pages load up pretty fast.",
