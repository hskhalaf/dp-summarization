I used to use KT tape but it came off easily and want effective for pain. I use this stuff in shin splints, shoulder pain, etc. I am about to run/workout with no pain.",

My recent purchase was not in vain, as I've been wearing my first application of Rocktape for 4 days and my shoulder has felt loads better. I love how it stays on for a 5-7 days too. If you havent tried it, you should. Highly recommended!!",

I ordered the digital camouflage and was expecting what is shown in the image, what I got was the correct box, but the tape itself has sky blue where I was expecting olive green. Not sure what's up with that! I need the tape so I have to use it, but there are other options out there so probably will try another brand...don't like not getting what I ordered.",
