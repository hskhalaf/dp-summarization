      "text": "I had them for 4 years, and they are extremely accurate. No colored bass... very crisp highs and natural voice... all the instruments and other voices are there. They are sooooo good that I had to change to a higher sampling source (of course, I got rid of mp3s or compressed material) in order to really enjoy music played form them. Also, when your are in a plane, the exterior noise is well isolated. They are not less than fenomenal.",

Strongly recommended. I had a couple of issues with them. 1 - Some of the sleeves that came with the earphones were squeezed so hard in the packaging that they are damaged 2 - The PTH device is bulky, cabling becomes a mess, and the battery door doesn't close right which makes the battery fall out a lot. I contacted Shure with my issues and they responded that they will take care of them. I really hope the replacement PTH doesn't have the battery falling out issue.",

I have some nice sennheiser headphones (which I bought here for around 200 bucks), but I didn't feel comfortable wearing them at the gym. I'd say that my Shure earbuds actually wind up delivering much better sound than my over-the-ear headphones. I've also got a logitech 5.1 system which is great, but doesn't even compare to the sound these deliver. I'm very satisfied with the purchase, but buying these wasn't really much of an investment so I wasn't expecting much out of it.",

The Shure's sound is very smooth and well-extended at both highs and lows, and although I was hesitant, I find the in-ear design to be comfortable for extended periods of time. Really, the sound is amazing - can't say enough about it. I do have two minor complaints: one is that I find I'm not using the Push-To-Hear module much - I probably would have just as happy to have skipped it. The other complaint is that the case Shure provides doesn't really fit the earphones, cables and so on very well.",

The external microphone is useful for airplanes (listening the the air crew), my motorcycle (stopping at gates), and other brief conversation scenarios. My only complaints are that the whole device is a bit clunky to workout with since a part of it clips to your pants and the microphone is a bit large to wear under a shirt, but it's not a big problem. And they are super expensive, but considering how tired I am of annoying headphones, even expensive ones like the Bose in-ear, I think it's a good investment.",

    "title": "Shure SE530PTH Sound Isolating Earphones with Push-To-Hear Control (Discontinued by Manufacturer)",
    "description": "Product Packaging:Standard PackagingAMAZON.COM\nThe Shure SE530PTH Sound Isolating Earphones with Push-To-Hear Control marks the bridge from the classic E Series line, to the new line of Sound Isolating Earphones from Shure. Evolved from personal monitor technology road-tested by professional musicians, and fine-tuned by Shure engineers, the SE530PTH earphones deliver an unparalleled acoustic accuracy rivaled only by live performances.\n\n The Shure SE530PTH utilize three balanced armature drivers, one dedicated tweeter, and dual woofers, to bring you a listening experience that has been optimized for high-quality recordings and lossless formats. And with integrated passive crossovers that ensure high and low frequencies remain distinct and defined, you get an incredibly wide and detailed sound stage, distinguished by precision highs and robust bass. What's more, the SE530PTH includes sound isolating sleeves that block over 90-percent of ambient noise and provide a customized fit. Combined with a low-profile ergonomic design and modular cable options, this helps ensure interruptions from the outside world are minimized so you can focus on your musical passion. Not only are these earphones comfortable and audibly engaging, but the innovative triple driver configuration is a first in class for universal fit, sound isolating earphones.\n\n For occasions when you must tear yourself away from the music, the SE530PTH includes an innovative Push-To-Hear control. A first for sound isolating earphones, the detachable Push-To-Hear control allows you to activate the VoicePort microphone and adjust levels of external sound for clarity. Similar to the microphones used in Shure QuietSpot cellular headsets, the VoicePort microphone is tuned to pick up the human voice, ensuring maximum intelligibility. Ideal for brief conversations without removing your earphones, the Push-to-Hear switch allows you to quickly and conveniently alternate between your music and your connection to the outside world.\n\n Shure's SE530PTH comes with a premium fit kit that includes everything you need to get the most out of your new earphones. Because every ear is different, this kit includes three sizes: small, medium and large of both the flex and the black foam sleeves, as well as a pair of universal-fit triple-flange sleeves. These allow you to experiment with the size and style that creates the best fit for your ears, in order to provide a good seal for optimized sound isolation and bass response, as well as maximum comfort during extended wear. These earphones also come with a detachable cable solution that has been designed based on extensive user feedback to enable unmatched personal customization. The two included modular cables provided give you the option between a three-foot and a nine-foot option, so you can tailor your experience depending on your activity and application.\n\n The SE530PTH earphones feature a sensitivity of 119 dB SPL/mW, an impedance of 36 ohms, and a frequency range of 18 Hz to 19 kHz. These earphones include a 0.25-inch adapter that allows you to use them with home stereos and other devices with 0.25-inch jacks instead of 3.5-millimeter jacks. The SE530PTH package also includes a carrying case as a convenient, tangle-free storage solution, and a level attenuator that allows for comfortable listening from any high-output audio source. What's more, they even include an airline adapter that optimizes compatibility with European airplane armrests for overseas travel. The Shure SE530PTH earphones come with a cable length of 18 inches, and a manufacturer's limited two-year warranty.\n\n What's in the Box\nShure SE530PTH earphones with Push-to-Hear control, sound-isolating sleeves, 1 x 3-foot modular cable, 1 x 9-foot modular cable, 0.25-inch adapter, carrying case, level attenuator, airline adapter, user's guide and warranty information.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nWhat 80 Years of Audio Experience Sounds Like Today\n\nIf youre as passionate about audio as the musicians who use our microphones, you deserve the legendary performance of Shure earphones. As a leader in the professional audio industry for over 80 years, were proud to bring you personal listening products that reflect our experience and ongoing pursuit of audio perfection--and the new SE line of sound-isolating earphones is the latest step in approaching that perfection.\n\nIsolation, not Cancellation\n\nShure Sound Isolating Earphones are unlike headphones that feature noise canceling technology. For listeners seeking maximum audio fidelity, the differences are key. Noise cancellation technology uses active circuitry to counteract background noise, which may introduce artifacts into your audio. Sound isolating earphones comfortably fill the ear canal and naturally block most background noise for a clear, detailed listening experience--all without the need to listen at high volumes which may risk damaging your hearing.\n\nLegendary Performance At Any Level\nEach model has its own unique sound characteristic, providing increased range and detail as you move up the line: \n\nSE210 (white) / SE210-k (black): High-quality on-the-go audio utilizing Hi-Definition MicroSpeakers to deliver full range audio, the ergonomic design of the SE210 is ideal for premium on-the-go listening. The SE210 also offers a flexible design for multiple wearing positions. SE310 (white) / SE310-k (black): Breathtaking sound and style featuring Hi-Definition MicroSpeakers with a Tuned BassPort, the SE310 delivers extended range audio and optimized low-end performance. The SE310 also offers a flexible design for multiple wearing positions. SE420 (white) / SE420-k (black): Heart-pounding performance featuring Dual TruAcoustic MicroSpeakers, the SE420 uses a dedicated tweeter and woofer to provide a detailed sound stage. Lows, mids, and highs are distinct and defined for accurate reproduction of all the details of your music.
