I did not rate down because I most likely need to recalibrate a little better. But a warning to others: test print and cut and calibrate on your normal paper first! Cuttting vinyl: its awesome.

The pen options are not great for us, .3 is just too thick of a base line-weight and the aftermarket custom pen holders are wonky at best.

No complaints so far. It paired with my iPad within seconds. Set up took about a half hour. NOTE: I saw some reviews say they received a 'used' machine. I did not. Everything came sealed with plastic on it. So it was definitely brand new. Purchased from amazon.",

My cricut is constantly running into issues, and after about a handful or so of cuts it just stops working. It does this every time I use it, and I'm starting to go crazy. Please take my advice, Silhouette is better because it can cut more and the program is way better.",
