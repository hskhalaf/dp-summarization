I use them for light industrial warehouse work and they are perfect for that. They are still brand new, I only had them for a week, but my initial response is they are fantastic. My only concern is, I hope the velcro strap holds up, and keep its promise as these shoes get older. Besides that minor concern, great shoe!!",

I use them at work at the hospital - they go great with my scrubs and also are great for walking the dog- esp in the early AM when i am too lazy to tie shoes. They are becoming my version of the \"today sponge\" from Seineld- -hopefully they won't go extinct!Nice assortment of colors to choose from.",
