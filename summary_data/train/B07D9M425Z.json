      "text": "I had always been on the edge about buying this style of shoe because I primarily do traditional weightlifting as opposed to Olympic lifting, I finally found this pair at a decent price so I figured I might as well give it a shot. These shoes are incredible in suprising areas, the primary benefit to me is to tilt my ankles forward while both squatting and deadlifting, which helps me sit much deeper into my seated position on both of these lifts without straining my hips, the benefit of this is a major reduction in lower back strain during both lifts due to enhanced leg mobility. Absolutely phenomenal, well worth the money even if you don't do Olympic style lifting.",

I've lifted in them a couple times and appreciate the slightly higher than normal heel. The shoe isn't super stiff beyond the heel, so you can Olympic lift in them. It feels reasonably solit, but I still prefer the velcro strap to the fancy mechanism. I tend to wear a very wide show and my feet aren't terribly uncomfortable in them",
