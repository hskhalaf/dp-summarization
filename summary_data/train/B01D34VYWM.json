      "text": "In my own ignorance, I thought all, or most, puffy jackets with the 90/10 down filling were made for really cold weather. Sadly this one is not. A few of the 'squares' of filling seemed almost empty. I know now that in addition to the type of filling, the amount of filling is also very important. This is a great product for cool weather (high 50s to 60s). It's super light weight, compact and very comfortable. But I need something for cold weather so it didn't work for me.",

      "text": "I have this jacket in 4 colors and the size is true. I gave it 4 stars because the zipper is plastic and sometimes opens up from the bottom, but I have always been able to fix it. However it is a great value for the price. Many down jackets are just too warm, this one layers nicely over a sweater and is perfect for temps in the 40's and 50's when you don't need one of those expensive \"arctic\" down coats.",

Fit is good, zipper works well, overall a good buy.",
