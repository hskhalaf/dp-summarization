Yes, the film is crazy expensive, but you aren't going to use this camera as you would a normal one. We found out the hard way it's impossible to capture a good picture of a sunset (or indeed any thing with the sun in it) and yet needs a lot of light to work (despite the \"high key\" some photos did come out very dark) but you learn to work around it. Definitely a great little piece of kit, perfect for special occasions.",

Given 4/5 for quality of photos purely because, well, it's an instant camera. You can't expect pin sharp perfect photos everytime but I am so so happy with the results so far. I've seen a lot of reviews that really bash instax and sadly it's probably because they don't know how to use it to it's full potential or have given it to a child. Any photography enthusiast should definitely give instax a go, it's just a lot of fun, highly recommend and can't wait to take it out and about.",

The selfie mirror is big enough to frame a small group of people and the camera is small and light enough to use 1 handed. My only gripe is that I wish it was usb rechargable or took rechargable batteries. But I knew this before I bought it for her. I use my Instax printer a lot and there doesn't seem to be any diffence in quality with those prints and these so I can't fault it. It's perfect as a gift.",

The image quality is superb and it takes seconds for the image to form after you've pressed the shutter button. The image colour and clarity was more than I could have expected, especially as I was in broad sunlight! (Could have easily over exposed).

    "description": "Color:Moon White| Product Packaging:Retail PackageDesigned for the selfie enthusiast, the Moon White Instax Mini 70 from Fujifilm is a sleek camera characterized by a range of features for self-portraiture and sharing your instant credit card-sized prints. The camera's design incorporates a retractable two-element Fujinon 60mm f/12.7 lens that permits focusing as closely as 11.8\" in macro mode. The optical real image viewfinder has a 0.37x magnification along with a target spot to aid with composition, and the front of the lens incorporates a small mirror to also benefit more accurate selfie compositions. Besides the standard automatic exposure control, with +/- 2/3 EV exposure compensation, the built-in flash can be used in conjunction with an automated exposure mode to adjust shutter speeds for enhanced background detail. A dedicated Selfie shooting mode also automatically adjusts brightness and accounts for the close-up shooting distance of self-portraits and a creative Hi-Key mode brightens the overall exposure for cleaner-looking skin tones. For self-portraits taken at longer than an arm's length, the instax mini 70 also features a tripod mount and a 10 second self-timer. Additionally, for sharing a print with someone, the 2 continuous photo self-timer mode will automatically shoot two frames within the self-timer's duration to provide you a pair of similar prints.",
