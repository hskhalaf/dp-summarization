My old one (another brand from Walgreens) worked perfectly for 5 years before dying....R.I.P my love. This cover cannot be easily opened with one finger like a regular kettle pot, you have to put some elbow grease and pull where you can see that shadow part on the lid. Very stupid design. It works like it should in terms of boiling water fast. Too bad I threw away the packaging otherwise this thing was going back right where it came from for giving me a second-degree burn on my arm!!!",

This hot pot works functionally to boil water or to cook some noodles/soup in, but it is much to difficult to clean to be of much utility. There are so many crevices that take ages to clean, that it's actually just faster to use a pot than this. Its unbeatable price is the only redeeming factor of this hot pot, but realistically, the time spent in having to clean it really doesn't make it worthwhile. I would purchase something else if you can spend a little more.",

Looks like it will last for awhile (we have only used it for 2 weeks) Cons: when pouring with lid on, a small bit of steam leaks up to your hand. Low power setting is SLOW boil, not really warmer. We did not use it for anything except boiling water. Coating on the bottom heating element looks solid, and shows no sign of wear or degradation as mentioned in other reviews. Overall good value for the price.",

      "text": "When doing typical Amazon.com impulse buying, decided to buy this because it was cheap and seemed useful from the description. After purchasing it, both my wife and I use it constantly. I ended up buying another one for myself to use on deployment. You'd be surprised how often you end up using this thing to create quick, hot boiling water. If you cook Ramen a lot, this might be your new best friend.",

      "text": "Bought it for use in hotel rooms. Works great for heating up soup, boiling noodles, or just heating up water. The cord is short, so you may need an extension cord. It cycles up and down to boil very high and then very low. But it gets the job done. A little tricky to clean around the bump of the heating element, but it has a non-stick surface, so that helps.",

I am sure the list is almost endless, so I will stop here.",
