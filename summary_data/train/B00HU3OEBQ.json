Study for the thin plastic that it is made of. Storage they need to be more precise on their measurements. I have not gotten to use it because I sent it back the same day I got it. I wish I could add more and be more beneficial. Pictures provide the measurements that I was concerned with. Hope some of this helps.",

The load is not as heavy as if I were on a construction site. I like it for my needs, excellent. For heavy tools, not so much, in my opinion. I would not recommend this for construction workers with heavy tools. It just a little to \"light\" for a heavy load. Gave it 4 stars for this reason, but for lighter loads, a great product.",
