She had to wait until Monday to reach out to Nesco customer service. They told her to return it to Amazon, I proceed to do a warranty return and find that the return window was closed on 10/6. I have found no other link for communication with Amazon. Very Disappointed",

      "text": "I bough my first NESCO food dehydrator about 15 years ago. I use it to dry peppers, tomatoes and herbs. Occasionally beef jerky. My original version was a bottom fan version. It is/was terrific! Dried my produce and herbs flawlessly. Alas, recently the fan started to lose speed (velocity?). After 15 years, I could not complain. I just bought this \"top down\" fan dehydrator. The digital control is great. Much nicer than the previous analog dial. And the size is compatible with my previous dehydrator, so I can still use the 4 trays that I already have. For my money, Nesco makes the best products on the market. High quality at a very reasonable price. Don't hesitate to purchase this!",

The dehydrated bananas are like fruit leather/chewy so are great for oatmeal, muffins or just a snack but they will not be crispy.",

      "text": "Remove moisture and greatly extend shelf life of your food. This is a great dehydrator that delivers even drying to up to 20 trays. If you have a busy family this is a great way to provide proper nutrition when you are not at home. Dehydrate the foods you want and put them in a zip lock baggie and go. Great for a purse, briefcase, or back pack. Love the timer that shuts off the unit to prevent over drying. You will not regret buying this unit.",

Excellent product, it has been a week since I bought it, I have no complaints about the product, I am very happy with it, the only problem I have is that Amazon does not allow me to buy the trays and other accessories. I can not understand why Amazon tells me, They can not send ((Add-A-Tray [FD-1000, 1010, 1020, 1040-Set of 2] White, 15-1/2'')) or ((Lg. Clean-A-Screen \u00ae [FD-1000, 1010, 1020, 1040 Set of 2 15-1/2'')). If anyone knows how I can get the accessories please let me know. thanks drwilsontorres@gmail.com",

The old one seemed to over-dry things and this new one seems much more gentle, if that makes sense. The dehydrator seems to be well made and I expect many years of service. One of the best things-- my old racks fit this unit, allowing me to expand it!",

The unit's adjustable thermostat ranges from 90 degrees to 160 degrees F, providing the flexibility needed to ensure excellent results.
