I ride motorcycles, and wear a full face helmet......they fit underneath my helmet very well with no interference. If there is a negative, it's that they are maybe a little darker (one shade?) than they really need to be. But, if i had a choice of having them like they are, or not having them, i'll take them as-is every time. I honestly do not have a complaint with them at all.",

Not only they they answer super fast, but they expedite the package at no additional charge... I got them just in time as promise.

There are different sized glasses but its hard to really recommend the right size, I originally bought one that was too small and was able to take advantage of Amazons excellent return policy.",

If not feeling confident, go to a lens vendor in any mall and have them adjusted. They usually don't charge a dime for that. Also, if unsure about size/style, please go to a mall and try them on.

    "title": "Ray-Ban Rb3025 Aviator Classic Sunglasses",
    "description": "Originally designed for U.S. aviators in 1937, Ray-Ban RB3025 Aviator sunglasses have quickly become one of the most iconic sunglasses models in the world. These perfect Ray-Ban Aviators for women and men are a timeless model that combines great aviator styling with exceptional quality, performance, and comfort. Aviator sunglasses by Ray-Ban are comfortable unisex glasses that are offered in multiple frame- and lens-color options. \n\nThe updated Ray-Ban aviator sunglasses feature the Ray-Ban Evolve photochromatic lenses. The Evolve photochromatic lens treatment allows a gradual change of lens color from a lighter shade to a darker shade within three minutes when exposed to UV light outdoors. No other light will result in the color change. Within five minutes of stepping back inside, the Evolve lenses in the RB3025 will gradually change back to the original color! Made from high-quality glass, Ray-Ban lenses are prescription ready.\n\nMade famous by the 1980s movie Top Gun and others, these Ray-Ban sunglasses for women and men are known for elegant wire frames that are durable and built to last. With a classic metal frame, you can see the world through a variety of lens colors including crystal brown, crystal green, G-15 non-polarized, and more\u2014all of which provide optimal visual clarity and 100% UV protection. G-15 lenses absorb 85% of visible light and block out most blue light. They provide amazing color contrast and produce better clarity and more natural vision. These sunglasses for women and men are comfortable to wear and make a statement anywhere you wear them. To keep them clean, we\u2019ve included a lens cloth in the case.\n\nRay-Ban is the world\u2019s most iconic eyewear brand and is a global leader in its sector. Every model in the Ray-Ban collection is the product of meticulous, original styling that translates the best of the latest fashion trends into an ever-contemporary look for millions of Ray-Ban wearers around the world. From the early Aviator style that emerged in 1937 to the introduction of the classic Wayfarer in 1952, Ray-Ban is a brand that embodies America, adventure, great cities, wide-open spaces, heroism, individuality, and authenticity.",
