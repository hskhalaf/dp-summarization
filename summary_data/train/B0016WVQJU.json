I've been able to teach the bears to not chase me and now I've probably saved their lives. The blast is exceptional and you can do short bursts. I've done about four short bursts so far. I zip tied the holster to the front of my bike and so I can get to it quickly.",

I've seen several reviews mentioning the seals were missing from \"new\" cans. I would not trust the product to work if the seals are not intact.",

I'm sure I'll appreciate it if I ever run into a bear or other lethal-sized varmint, but my goodness the can is almost a foot tall! Obviously NOT mace-sized. At any rate, I have hiked with it in the woods, and while it's a nuisance to carry if you're just using a fanny pack, I'd hate to be without it if I ran into a cougar or bear or wolf.",

The 9.2 oz spray combines maximum stopping power with a superior range of 35 feet, meaning you can deploy it from a safer distance to deter an aggressive bear.

FRONTIERSMAN Bear Spray is a quick-to-deploy bear defense spray made with the maximum strength allowed by the E.P.A. (2.0% major capsaicinoids - 50% stronger than SABRE's maximum strength police pepper spray). The 9.2 oz canister provides maximum protection by rapidly deploying the heaviest fog of up to 1.84 oz (52 grams) per 1-second burst (up to 84% more than other brands) and creating a massive barrier of protection between you and the charging bear to maximize your safety. FRONTIERSMAN Bear Spray is available with holster options for the quickest access when seconds matter. When an 800 lb. bear is charging up to 50 feet (15 m) per second, every moment counts. Holsters keep your canister secure and immediately accessible without any cumbersome straps or velcro closures that can disturb the bear or cost you precious seconds as you try to access your spray. Explore confidently knowing you have the best bear safety products on the market with you from FRONTIERSMAN.
