      "text": "I bought two of these after discovering \"Frogmore Stew\". If you're doing any type of seafood boil this is the pot to have. I was concerned the 42 qt would be bigger than what I needed, but \"size does matter\". If you're using the strainer it takes up a good amount of space around the edges and bottom. I have done boil for ten using this pot and could probably squeeze in 1-2 more. It's not a heavy gauge so I am not sure I would push the limits. But for boiling water it heats up fast.",

That fact that it's lighter than stainless is also beneficial since I use it for large boils.

Now we have live crabs ready to be steamed and no pot so now we are out scrambling to find one at a local store. Not happy and will never purchase this brand again.",

Keep in mind this container is aluminum so when you usr burner you need to tun te flame lower because i have notice other reviewers burning through the aluminum buttom because they run the flam past the melting point of aluminum.
