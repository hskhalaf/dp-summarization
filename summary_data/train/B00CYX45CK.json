The cooler is pretty quiet and looks great. For my taste the Intel Logo could be a bit brighter. The installation was easy but can be improved. Not sure why Intel could not have better instructions or print on the bags which bag is for which socket. For an Intel product the installation instructions are a bit disappointing. The radiator is thicker and more robust then the one of the Corsair H55.",

This cooler was listed on the ASUS compatible hardware list as well which is why I ordered it and thank God it works.

      "text": "Pros: Radically improved thermals over the stock solution with a 4790K. This fixed a stability issue, as well as thermal throttling issues I was experiencing. With the stock cooler, under P95 ( no AVX, small FFTs) I would hit T_Core 100C and get serious throttling within about five minutes. With this cooler, things never get over 62C. Very quiet. Cons: Difficult install - the retention bracket has blind nuts which are not held captive in the bracket, so they can fall out if you are not careful. If you're particularly unlucky, they will fall behind your motherboard, between the tray and the PCB, requiring you to remove the whole thing again. Bit cramped in a micro-ATX case.",

You have to put your ear very close to the fan to hear anything. The installation manual is horrible. Thankfully attaching this to the Asus X99-A motherboard is really straight forward. I just got this installed yesterday so time will tell. As they say, \"no runs, no drips, no errors.\" Only time will tell if the factory sealed system will stay water tight over the years. Only thing to note is to make sure you have a decent sized case. Full tower height highly recommended.",

It also has threaded holes on the back side which allows for an easy addition of another 120mm fan which will give a more powerful push-pull effect.",

Average temps hold at 25-30C. I suppose you could replace the stock fan with a different SP fan for possibly better performance, but the one that comes in the package works fine.",

I typically build with AMD and see 50-60C temperature ranges under load, and was worried a new Intel build would be hotter. Pleasant surprise from this modestly sized device, it's silent and extremely effective. A new i7 4790k is 21-23C idle and 55-60C under load (Prime95), but the Arctic Silver thermal paste I used in place of Intel's is worth noting. Even has power supply options for daisy chaining if your board has only 1 connector. Only con I can come up with is there appears to be no way to disable/remove the blue LED's without compromising the product/warranty - do you really want kill the bling though?",

I didn't feel like waiting for an RMA and some reviewers said they didn't like the stock fan anyway, so I replaced it with a Rosewill I had available.

Once I had my setup figured out it was fairly simple to install. If you are using the included bracket it is important to realize that if the holes do not line up with your motherboard they can be adjusted. I bought this to push my overclocking a little further which I haven't gotten around to yet but I'm sure it'll meet my needs. I will update this review after I've tested the unit under load a bit more until then check out some pics from my install.",

When installing make sure you don't misplace the 4 metal pins that go inside the screws, gives it the extra lift to install correctly, otherwise you're gonna have a bad time.",
