Glad to report none of that. Love this sneaker, it is unusual that I can find something basic that fits my feet so well, as I said, I have narrow feet.",

But, the shoes I received were Dream Foam insoles. It's a tremendous difference, if what you're looking for is the support and shock reduction. I'm extremely dissatisfied. I was going to buy the black leather, also. But, after having them misrepresent the shoe, I will not be. It's a shame.",
