So you may be able to get the quarters out with your finger when you pay at a drive thru but nothing else.. the coins are literally jammed in there. You can't get them out because the spring is pushing the coins upwards to the lip of the lid and making it impossible to pull another coin out.. So I cannot recommend this. After 12 months I finally gave up and tossed into the garbage bin were it belong. NOT Worth buying !",

This means that the cup will slide around a little when driving, but I don't find it to be a real problem. It definitely helps to speed things up for me in the drive thrus.

UPDATE: Two years later on and we are still using it. The \"Nickle\" slots spring as compressed (I keep a lot of coins in most of the time) and they rattle out while driving. Coins do stick every now and then, half of it is because coins get nasty and sticky sitting in peoples dirty cup-holders! I'm pleased with the overall function and resiliency, so I'm replacing it with another one!",

Then, dry with a napkin, towel, a shirt sleeve, or pant leg. Once fingers are completely dry, they should have good traction, making it very easy to remove coins. Works 99% of the time. This trick makes using this coin holder worthwhile. Coin holder eliminates having to fish through console or ash tray. I've also said goodbye to coin jars that are tedious to have lying around then having to schlep to those coin redemption machines.",

      "text": "Overall good product. The springs that push the coins up could be stronger. Half the coins in each sleeve works well with the strength of the springs, but once the sleeve is full, the weight of the coins push on the springs more than the springs push on the coins. Coins still comes out but with some work on my behalf. Overall Good Product and does the job as long as I don't fill the full sleeve up with coins.",

My only complaint is that the pennies seem to get stuck and won't come out easily. I often have to bang it on the palm of my hand to get them loose. I have had this coin holder almost a year and with the exception of the pennies side it works well.",

Glad I purchased and I would definitely buy it again.",

Also, as others mentioned, I wished the size were larger, but the person who suggested putting it in a foam beer insulator has a good idea, and I'll try that so it's not bouncing around so much in the cup holder. Those two things being fixed, it'd be a 5 star product, hands down.",

So what I wanna say this item is just a good clone (I`ll see how long it`ll last) but a price including shipping is obviously must be lower because it is clone made from cheap plastic not as like original one that i had ,it is my straight thought sorry. And thank you anyways for selling this cheat item that must be cheaper . Will recommend for buyers!",
