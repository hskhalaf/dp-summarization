With heels, it\u2019s perfect. The fabric is of good quality and even right out of the bag, it was barely wrinkled. It\u2019s lightweight and airy, which makes it perfect for your summer outings.

And it went to above my ankles which was great in the summer time. Bummed the medium didn\u2019t work out for me but will look into getting a large instead.",

The leg draping lays from diagonally forming the outer left to the inner leg, which honestly gives you the illusion that you're taller when you're wearing heels. The print is quite subtle in person. Not too out there with the palm tree leaves. The print of the leaves is not in awkward places. Going on vacation??? BUY THIS JUMPSUIT.",

I am pear shaped so I ordered a large and it fit in all the right places. I was worried about the bust being too large, but the adjustable tie straps solved any worries that I had. The material is light weight and I would imagine lighter colors may be see through. Overall I plan to purchase this jumpsuit again on other colors.
