Not a very durable product. I reordered and hope the new one lasts more than a week, but I have a feeling the replacement will probably fail as well. It was a great price, however, the saying you get what you pay for could be true here. Perhaps if I spent a little more, I would get a more durable cover with grommets that stay in place. Very poorly designed grommets :(",

It is well designed and has two orange handles to identify the front where the handle bars are. It also has a snap fastener at the bottom so it wont blow away. You might want to bring along a couple of bungee cords to keep the covers from flapping in the wind and to hold it tight. It seems like very strong material. Even though it was windy, it did not tear. It fit perfectly and did a good job of protecting the scooters.",

Seen few cover at shops around town and they was well over 45 dollars. Seen this cover and decided to give them a shoot since it was reasonably priced and include lock. Happy I choose them! Cover fits perfectly over moped. There is loops in cover so you can put lock through so no one steals your cover. Great quality and material.",
