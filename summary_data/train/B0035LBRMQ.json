I just switched from my Olympus E-3 camera with three lenses to a micro four thirds OM-D with just this lens. Going from wide angle to a decent telephoto with the camera's great low light capability, I am very happy for my general photography purposes. Obviously this lens won't do if you have particular needs and want the extra light gathering capability that a professional lens would bring. But if you are traveling and need one lens due to weight and/or space this would be the one.",

      "text": "This lens gives you a range that is comparable to the 18-200mm for the Nikon and Canon cameras, and is much lighter. The unfortunate aspect of it that it causes autofocus to be very slow, to the point where it may not focus at all (especially if the object is very far away). This may be because of the way the Olympus does autofocus, but it is unpleasant nonetheless.",

However, like all zooms in this class, there are some image compromises over what prime lens can do. For everyday use, however, it is hard to beat.",

      "text": "This is a magnificent lens, producing crisp images all through the focal range, and eliminates a lot of lens changeovers (which was a major reason for my buying it). In my experience the best results are achieved by keeping the shutter speed at 1/500, or faster, as you extend the lens (even though my camera has image stability), and I increase the ISO setting to achieve that end. That's not a problem to me, just something to be aware of, and it's the only reason I give it 4 stars and not 5. I like Olympus products, having owned a couple of their cameras now, and this lens lives up to my expectations.",

The image quality is great, it focuses very fast (on the Olympus OM-D), and it feels very solid. The focusing ring is buttery smooth, but the zoon ring is a little stiff. Of course, the max aperture is an smallish f/4. That is the compromise you make for the portability and versatility. However, since cameras can now produce good results at ISO 3200, this is less of a concern.",

It captures great images, and this plus the fine Olympus 60mm macro are all I need for an excellent day in the backcountry. It's nice not having to swap lenses from wide to tele, and unless you're a super OCD pixel peeper or making poster sized enlargements, this lens gets it done. That being said, it is a long lens relatively speaking (4.25\" or about the width of my E-M10) and so if I don't need telephoto, I do swap it for the 14-42mm IIR kit kens (and take off the accessory grip).",

    "description": "OLYMPUS 261504 Zuiko Digital 14\u2013150mm f/4.0\u20135.6 ED Lens\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n The M. Zuiko Digital ED 14-150mm F4.0-5.6 (35mm equivalent 28-300mm) lens is designed to maximize the performance advantages of the Micro Four Thirds System, and it's significantly lighter and more compact--easily fitting in a jacket pocket. \n\nThe new lenses, made with ED (extra-low dispersion) glass for superior image quality, complement the design of the PEN\u00ae cameras, including the powerfully simple E-PL1, also announced today, making it the all-in-one package for consumers with any skill level, including those who are new to photography. \n\nThe Micro Four Thirds System standard meets the telecentric requirements of dedicated digital design. Light rays strike the imaging element nearly head-on for optimum edge-to-edge image reproduction. It also enables much more compact design than the Four Thirds System standard (or other interchangeable lens systems) because it reduces the outer diameter of the lens mount by 6mm, and the distance from the lens mount to the sensor (the flange back distance) by approximately half. As a result, M. Zuiko Digital Micro Four Thirds System lenses offer uncompromising professional quality for capturing both still-images and High-Definition (HD) videos, and the lenses are exceptionally compact to make capturing your life more fun. \n\nThe high-power wide-angle to telephoto M. Zuiko Digital ED 14-150mm F4.0-5.6 zoom lens is 65 percent smaller and 70 percent lighter than the comparable 10x ZUIKO Digital ED 18-180mm F3.5-6.3, making it ideal for everything from portraits and indoor scenes to sports and landscape photography. \n\nBy maximizing the advantages of the Micro Four Thirds System design, compact size, low weight and amazing image quality, the new lens significantly expand the photographic potential of the system. The inner focusing mechanism uses a light, compact, single-element unit to enable exceptionally fast, quiet autofocusing for smooth, superior operating ease during still and video capture. The manual focusing mechanism is designed to offer a responsive feel and precise operation, enabling you an affordable, high-quality means to capture your life in stills or HD videos. \n\nThe 14-150mm lens also offers quieter and more responsive AF performance, and provide professional image quality for capturing amazing still images and videos. It is compatible with all Micro Four Thirds System Olympus PEN cameras, and all other current and future cameras that comply with the Micro Four Thirds System standard. When mounted on an Olympus PEN camera, the lens is stabilized thanks to the camera's in-body Image Stabilization system and offer effective shake compensation at all focal lengths.",
