We have to open them in the sink to avoid the mess. And getting all of the solid food out of the packet is near impossible. For a buck or more for these small packets, one would think the smart people at Fancy Feast could come up with a more user-friendly package.",

I give her about a tablespoon full twice a day with her solid food. It stimulates her appetite, and \"primes\" her to continue what I consider her health solid food. I have tried other Fancy Feast flavor pouches, but she insists on this specific flavor. I dread the day Fancy Feast decides to \"improve\" their formula, and change their mix. Yes, I would recommend this to a cat!",

Some of the cats like the broth but don't like the solid matter in these? Not sure why it seems good.",
