A bunch more capacity for large items, a better way to wash forks and spoons and knives (also safer than blades and tines sometimes pointed upwards).",

So, wine glasses have to be put in on their side, which takes up lots of space and leaves them full of water when the cycle is done. Not very satisfactory. I guess I should have brought a wine glass to the store before I bought it. Just a warning for those who,use stemmed glasses...",
