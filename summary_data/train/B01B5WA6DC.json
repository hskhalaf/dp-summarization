But, he really, really wanted it so I ventured to buy it. In no time at all he was riding it all over the place up and down the street, etc. and loves it! It has held up very well to the initial crashes he took while learning to ride and still looks great several months later.",

The threads in the LEFT pedal crank are not correct and you cannot screw the pedal in. Next I bough a $30 more Diamond Back unicycle and clearly the parts are made from the same factory in China and I had exactly the same problem. The Left pedal won't screw in due to poor threads. Do not buy this until they get the message and manufacture a new batch of these correctly!!!!",

This 24 inch wheel unicycle gives her more range for riding around town. Her transition time to the larger wheel unicycle was quicker than I thought it would be, less than a day. We did cut five inches off the bottom of the seat post for the seat to go almost all the way down.",

I've since upgraded the pedals (they send plastic with it, you will fall, you will buy more pedals) and replaced the tube twice, I think he's running over the cactus with it (not really).",
