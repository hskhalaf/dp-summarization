I was getting tired of cleaning the entire stove after frying a few pieces of bacon or something. Yes, I could use the microwave to cook bacon but I don't like how nuked bacon taste. I enjoy bacon in this fryer though. I bought a separate air fryer cookbook because the Philips web site cookbook is sort of sketchy. Now I've figured out the process and can cook most items w/o a cookbook. The biggest change is the seasoning has to adhere tightly to (cling to) food. Otherwise the air will just blow your seasonings off when you cook.",

It also can dehydrate thinly slice fruit. Great idea for healthy snacks. Experiment with the timing to get better and faster result for the dehydrating. It probably not a bad idea to get an airfryer cook book just to see other ideas. One of the best investments I have done. The only downside is the accessories offered don't fit the extra large airfryer I bought, but I could tell that when I ordered it. However as it is, it is still a great fryer.",
