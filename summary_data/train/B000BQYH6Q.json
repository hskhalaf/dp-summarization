It's hard to tell from the picture, but the inside is not solid, it's hollow. which means that the only support for all the weight of my trailer is on the sides of the chocks. That thin plastic just doesn't hold well. Mine broke after using them twice. Also, because they're hollow, the only contact they have with the ground is the perimeter of the chock, not the inside area. These slid on me several times before they broke. I'm just glad I still had the chains attached! I would recommend finding something made of solid rubber or at least thicker plastic.",

I used my electric blower to clean off the brake dust and it blew it right off under the tire. It\u2019s flimsy so you can\u2019t really wedge it in between your tire. Also the material feel like it could crush easily. Since it\u2019s platic and has no weight practically it could just slide off if your car moves. Don\u2019t waste $5 or $6 on this plastic garbage and get a sold heavier choke.",

I relegate them to light duty, like changing a tire on a level surface while the car is supported by heavy duty jack stand and the parking brake is applied.

Also to properly use them u are suppose to have two per tire front and back side. Or at least if u only put on back side put a 2x4 on the front side of tires so they cant roll either way.",
