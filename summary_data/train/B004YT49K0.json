Plus, you get a little push up from the corset so the tatas look great! ;) Note: the corset fastens in two different sizes. I ordered a medium due to my bust size (36DD) and could have gone with a small fastened on the largest size. Enjoy the costume and save some lives you beautiful Amazonian Warrior!",

I wanted to leave a review though as some taller, like me (5'9\") reported the corset being a little short. I actually didn't find that to be an issue and felt the corset was comfortable and stayed as it should. I am a 29 waist, 34 C bust and felt the fit was perfect. The skirt is thin and short and my plan had been to wear metallic red leggings under or you could wear shorts as well. I do have rather small wrists so the cuffs were a bit loose but overall I thought it was a great costume.",
