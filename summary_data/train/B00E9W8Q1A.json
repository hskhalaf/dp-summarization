Cons: 1) When I received this I was disappointed that the HD outlet is gone. I was going to return it until I found there is no Verizon Droid phone with that option any more. 2) If you use Miracast instead of HD there is a display lag if any Bluetooth device (headphones, keyboard, mouse) is active. 3) Camera quality is just OK. I was hoping for better. 4) There is no SD card slot - internal memory only, so watch how many apps, songs and photos you store.",

As to the phone, it otherwise seems well made and designed, but the lack of viable accessories means I can't buy 2 more for my wife and I.",

      "text": "Proximity sensor completely broken and defective. Camera options poor compared to first Droid Maxx Razr. No live brightness adjustments. Camera's pictures look horrible on display because the camera takes higher resolution pictures than the 720p outdated stretched display will allow. Sound quality is loud and excellent. We needed this for my husbands business badly. We are very disappointed because no other phone comes close in battery life. Amazon also gave me poor service in undoing my upgrade told me password was wrong and to call Verizon to update password and it was what I said it was resulting in wasted time and phone calls....I have a 5 week old newborn so this is very annoying.",

      "text": "Very happy with Android smartphones and Motorola products have been excellent. The problem I have with this order is that the description indicated the device I purchased was refurbished- something I was just fine with. However, I'd wrongly assumed refurbished meant having a replaced battery. The battery in this unit was NOT replaced, so no enjoying the usual long lasting battery power of the Maxx. This refurbished unit's battery runs down before the day's over with only light use. It will cost me another $75 to $100 to have a new battery put in! Very disappointed, will not buy a refurbished unit again.",

      "text": "Had these phones for a little while now and they are impressive with most of their features and abilities. However the auto voice operation needs some work it's constantly picking up other sources and trying to do things. Also the extended battery isn't as impressive as you might think. I'm a fairly heavy user and I have yet to go longer than from the time I get up to the time I lay down battery life which I've read about in several other reviews. Other than that is a fantastic device with excellent performance and shoe and is sexy to with is carbon fiber woven body and hefty gorilla glass.",
