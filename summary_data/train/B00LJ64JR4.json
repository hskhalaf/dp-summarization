Hence really dislike this item (bought it because of the great reviews). Also, the water system (open system) is not really my favorite because while holding your baby anything can happen and you could spill it out easily.",

I know a lot of reviewers complained that it doesn\u2019t have an auto-shut off, but that\u2019s definitely what you need to get temps high enough to deactivate lipase.

Since the warmer provides a continuous heat source, formula can easily overheat if you get pulled away; honestly you're better off just sticking the bottle in a warm cup of water to heat.

Once switched on, the warmer gently heats bottles and food within 3 minutes. Its compact size makes it easy to store on a kitchen countertop or bedside table for nighttime feedings. The warmer heats bottles and foods safely and evenly and unlike microwaves, won't cause hotspots, so you can be sure the internal temperature is safe for your baby. All Philips AVENT bottles, toddler cups, and food jars fit in the warmer. The warmer is fast and easy to operate - just plug in and flip the on/off switch on the back of the unit. A neon light lets you know the unit is on and working. An included instruction guide makes it easy to calculate the correct heat-up time. Operation involves adding water and turning the dial. A light blinks to indicate that the contents are properly warmed to a safe temperature. To be sure, always test the internal temperature before giving to babies.",
