This chair is soft and comfortable and rocks really well with no squeaky sounds. It has a very solid round metal base so I don't worry about it tipping over. I bought a small carpet cleaning machine and used it to clean our first glider and it came out looking almost new. We don't have an ottoman with ours and feel like this glider works fine without one. I am 5'2\" and my spouse is 6' and we both find this chair comfortable.",

It came put together and ready to be placed in the nursery. It is small, but I still liked it. I breastfed and rocked my son in this for several months comfortably. But, then it started making a terrible sound. We flipped it over and sure enough one of the brackets had broken. For the price, the quality is very poor. This is the only purchase I've ever made on Amazon that I regret. I would not recommend this product.",

It was a slightly different size base, requiring pre-drilling for reusing the old 6 large screws. Now fixed, chair works well. A little frustrated there was so much work required for the price, but chair is comfortable.

Love the gray color - goes with everything. We didn't really have room for a large ottoman and just purchased a Kidco nursing stool to use with it and it worked perfectly. Looking forward to using this chair elsewhere in the house.",

The ONLY reason I've not giving them 5 stars is because the color is not quite as expected. They are a bit lighter in reality than they look in the pictures online, and fabric is a bit shinier (they appear more matte in the photos to me) - however, they're still very nice and I look forward to enjoying them for years to come!",
