I have, historically, had an... unattractive beard. I had some serious beard envy toward all the guys that had well-shaped or thick beards. The difference between a guy with a beard and a beard-guy is grooming and care, including some beard oil or beard balm. I am sure that there are other great products but this has really worked well for me. After three weeks- color me impressed.",

I researched beard oils to keep my beard healthy and robust, and chose Wild Willie's based on the quality of the ingredients. I like that this product is made in the USA, it smells fantastic, and it makes my beard and skin feel fantastic. The price point of this great product is extremely reasonable given the high-quality ingredients and great customer service. Highly recommend!",

If you are married this shouldn't be an issue. It's beard oil, and yes women like men. But beard oil, isn't really going to help your chances, with women. Why are men being marketed like teenagers? I will take this review down, if the marketing managers change thier unnecessary tactics. The product sells itself, no need for \"sex sells\" mindframe. Let's be real men!",

I am always skeptical of beard oils that might have a floral or fruity smell, but this one smells like fresh clean laundry, not feminine at all. Like I said, after one use, I could already tell the difference in texture, and it just keeps getting softer with every application! Excellent product, I highly recommend!",
