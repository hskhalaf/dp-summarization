I really wanted a hard cover, but this book looked good so I ordered it even though it is paperback. The cover is thick and durable. It even has a nice feel to the cover, as though it has a waxy smooth coating on it. I recommend this book, but do wish it had photos of the recipes and that it was a hard cover.",

It's easy to saute with water or broth or use applesauce in baked goods. Oil is so passe. That said, I have converted a couple of the recipes to oil, salt, and sugar-free. Still, I expect plant-based cookbooks to follow common sense good health guidelines for obvious reasons.",

It shows you the cost per serving on each recipe, as well as which recipes are dorm friendly, easy to make ahead of time and save, and a variety of other \"tags\" that help (gluten free and things like that). I am not vegan but I might buy a copy for myself anyway - the recipes all look so good! There is a lot of variety and most of them don't require weird ingredients you have to buy at health food stores and stuff like a lot of vegan cookbooks. Definitely would recommend!",
