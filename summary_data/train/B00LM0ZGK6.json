For fancier headphones that also have controls, they won't work with this (you will need to control play/pause, volume, etc. on the device itself). The quality of the sound seemed fine to me, but then again I'm not picky. I'm very happy with this purchase.",

I did use ainline volume control to attenuate the volume a bit. Even at its lowest volume level Alexa's voice/music were too loud for my small office. The volume control fixed that and now I can run the Dot at level 5 volume comfortably with room left on either side for softer or louder if needed.",

It was shipped immediately, and arrived on a SUNDAY with Amazon Prime FREE 2-day shipping. You just can't beat that. Some of the other products simply split the audio so that one side got all of one channel and the other side got all of the other channel. NOT the case with the Ugreen splitter! It is perfect stereo in BOTH jacks! I wholeheartedly recommend this device. At the low price you can't go wrong.",

And here's the significance of the carrying pouch: I bought these for my husband and in order to have them handy when he might need them, he has to put them in one of his pockets. Without that pouch, they would obviously get tangled and eventually break. So, the pouch (as insignificant as it might sound), is a really beneficial feature.

However, with the first headset I tried, if I did not insert the headset plug all the way into the jack and hold it there, I would lose the right channel. This was the case for both output jacks, so I don't think this is a defective unit. I tried with three different headsets, one would not give me the right channel unless I held it in place, one worked fine, and one was in-between, where a very slight tug (i.e., letting gravity pull on the cord) would be enough to cause the right channel to go away. This is way too fussy for me. Will be returning it.",
