The helical blades make this unit extremely quiet. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a high quality jointer.",

      "text": "Had a Jet planer that I used for years, built a wheeled platform so I could move it around my garage, and then it tipped over and offset the tables to a point I could not fix them. Looked for a replacement and found the Powermatic. What a difference. Weighs a ton, but also bought the wheelbase and so solid and easy to move. the Helical cutterhead is so much better then the 3 knives I had in the Jet, easier to replace, smoother cuts, and no tear out at the end. Pricey but worth the investment.",

I tried using my 2\" dust lines with a reducing fitting but discharge area quickly clogged with shavings. I am currently allowing the waste to fall on the floor and have to sweep up the pile. Even without the dust collector connected there was little air pollution as most of the pieces were heavy and just fell into the pile. This was my first Powermatic tool, and I will be muting more after this great experience.",

    "description": "Style:Jointer1791317K Features: -6'' jointer with helical cutterhead.-54HH. Assembly Instructions: -Assembly required. Dimensions: -Dimensions: 37.5'' H x 24'' W x 66'' D.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nThe Powermatic 54HH Six-Inch Jointer with Helical Cutterhead features a superior finish and quieter operation compared to conventional cutterheads with its helical cutterhead with 40 four-sided, indexable carbide knife inserts. Designed and built to make your wood-straightening tasks easy and accurate, this heavy-duty jointer will remain a vital part of your woodworking shop for years to come.\n\n\n\nPower and Stability\nTo provide stable footing--the key to optimum accuracy--the 54HH has a 21- x 13-inch (W x D), all-steel base cabinet that puts the table surface at a comfortable 32 inches above the floor. The one-horsepower, one-phase, 115-/230-volt motor (pre-wired for 115 volts) is factory-mounted within the base cabinet and can be converted to use 230-volt power. The motor is on a special mount for easy belt-tension adjustments, and the fine/quick adjustment lever on the infeed table ensures precision cuts.The base also contains the dust collection chute that evacuates debris from below the cutterhead via the exterior four-inch-diameter port near the floor--a design that keeps the hose out of the way to prevent tripping accidents.\n\nHelical Cutterhead\nThere are many cutterhead designs that carry the helical moniker, including simple straight blades broken into segments and dispersed around the cutterhead cylinder. Despite the helical label, they retain many of the liabilities of the long-blade designs. However, the 54HH features a true helical cutterhead with specially machined carbide inserts arranged in spiral-shaped rows for effective--and incredibly quiet--performance.\n\nThe inserts also have a four-inch radius ground into them and are mounted so they approach the wood at a 14-degree angle. This creates a true shear cut that eliminates much of the impact and the resulting fiber disturbance other cutterhead designs deliver. Also, the durability of the carbide combined with the low-impact, shear cutting action mean the inserts have an extended life.\n\nPrecision Ground Cast-Iron Tables\nWith a length of 66 inches and a width of 7-1/2 inches, the main precision-ground cast-iron table is one of the longest available in this class, providing plenty of support for large workpieces. It's conveniently mounted on dovetailed ways that keep it perfectly aligned through height changes. Adjustments are easy: the outfeed table height is adjusted with a handwheel mounted below the table; to adjust the infeed table, the handle can be moved up and down for coarse height changes or, the long handle can be rotated to make fine, precise height adjustments.\n\nHigh-Performance Fence System\nThe all-cast-iron fence system has a length of 38 inches, height of four inches--and like the tables--is precisely ground to ensure straightness. The supporting and tilt mechanism, made up of large cast-iron pieces, make this system as accurate and repeatable as it is durable. For versatility, the fence tilts up to 45-degrees towards and away from the tables.\n\nAlso, fully adjustable stops at 90 degrees (vertical) and each 45-degree position make set-up fast and help keep the 54HH accurate with minimal maintenance, while center-mounted controls make for easy operation.\n\nThe 54HH is backed by a five-year warranty.\n\nWhat's in the Box\n54HH Jointer assembly; one stand; one door with mounting hardware; one dust chute with mounting hardware; one fence assembly; one pulley cover; one belt; one cutterhead guard; two push blocks; one fence handle; one manual; one warranty card; and one hardware bag.",
