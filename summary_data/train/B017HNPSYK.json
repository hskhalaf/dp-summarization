If I have any complaints so far, it's that the popped corn comes out with such force that it's hard to control/contain it. First time I used it, there was popped corn allll over my kitchen. I'm learning. Tonight, only three kernels got away from me. The results are light and fluffy and tasty!! Popping is very fast, too!",
