When nothing worked they offered to send a replacement product in a different size as a last resort to solve the issue. Their commitment to their customers have impressed me. They have earned my trust as a customer. I will do another update on the product as soon as I see how the replacement works out. Either way, their customer service have exceeded my expectations.",

It may be just my cats and the fact that I had a 1 inch gap at the bottom and the cats could see and opening, but either way, my cats juts waltz right through the thing. like they know how it works and how to push it right open. so for my cats, it's a fail - too bad though, the product is quality and closes up tight, all on it's own - maybe i have smart cats, or persistent",

Other screens were a little too long and got stepped on and tore. The magnets are strong. I used the Velcro that came with the screen and it fits perfectly. I added a few tacks just to make sure of the fit. I hope to be able to use this for 2 years at least. My only concern is that i will have to leave the Velcro strip on my door frame after i take it down. So far, so good.",

I was hesitant because it's not the typical material you see, and because I need it to withstand 3 young boys. After installing the screen, I prefer the fiberglass one. It's thick and durable, thicker than a window screen. And I notice it less than the black striped ones, which seem cheaper in quality now. Oh, and it fits perfectly!",

After I had sewn it down to the correct size and cut off extra length, it was easy to install and seems to work well. As my door is short and narrow, it does constrict the opening a bit, but we think its worth it.",

I have bought multiple (cheaper) magnet screen doors in the past, but they would rip off the door frame and rip at the bottom with a misstep of a dog paw. As soon as I received this item, I could tell it was MUCH better quality (probably because of the fiberglass mesh). The adhesion is also so much better - half of the Velcro is built into the product, so no worries about it coming off on that end. All in all, I wasn\u2019t too sure about the price tag since I knew cheaper options were available, but I\u2019m so glad I made the investment!",
