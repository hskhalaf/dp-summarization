Getting used to that but would have been just as happy with a \"normal\" case. This is a very extravert PC but it has good reason to show off. Super happy with it so far, recommend it to anyone who wants a real top end PC.",

With the colossal 32 gigs of RAM which I find to be more than enough, the GTX 1080 which is able to run most 4k games at max graphics on at least 45 fps, and the extremely fast processer this computer has been incredible so far! It was very well-packaged and came with all the necessary components such as Wi-Fi antenna etc. I also appreciate how the case is elevated off the ground to avoid overheating.

All fans works about 1300rpm which is quiet enough 40cm away. Although I am going to change those fan, but I would like to say the noise is acceptable for most people. Hope it will not ganna happen any problems. So far, five stars.",

Once I priced up all the components to build my own, like I've done many times over the years, I found this gem all ready to go and covered by a 3 year warranty for basically the same cost. Work colleagues who bought systems from Cyberpower all had positive things to say. That was good enough for me. This system has met all my expectations and I'm very happy. Only thing I had to add was a wifi card. It's a no-brainer.",
