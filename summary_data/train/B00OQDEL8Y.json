The shape keeps your shaving foam from getting out of the bowl (mostly), and is large enough that you can use pretty much any shaving soap in it. The only issue keeping it from five stars is that the metal is not quite as thick as I'd like, so it lacks a little heft and will slide around while you're whipping up a good lather. If you hold it (as I do) this problem goes away. It's not so thin it deforms in my hand during use, but I've no doubt it would pick up nasty dents though if it were dropped.",
