The Guide is one of the best shoes I've tried (had the 7, a couple of the 8s and this pair). There is a bit more stability than what I would like, but think anyone looking for mild support would really enjoy this shoe.",

We saved over $40 dollars buying these on amazon vs the local running store. We also picked up a pair of saucony spikes with the money we saved and still came out ahead. This is a great running shoe if you're look for something with great stability and moderate pronation. Very good cushioning if you're a heal striker like he is.",

I have worn Sauconys for years and have liked many of the Guide and Ride models but the Guide 9 is definitely not an improvement on previous models. If you have worn a Guide 6 or 7, I would recommend buying those instead of the Guide 9.",
