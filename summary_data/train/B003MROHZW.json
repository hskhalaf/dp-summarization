      "text": "As a dog daycare we have tried my muzzles over the last 10 years. These are pretty much lumped in with all the others and do not stand out from the crowd. We find that they can tear at the seems and after a week or so they become useless. If you have a dog that doesn't mind having a muzzle on you should be fine with this muzzle. If you have one that doesn't like it and will fight to get it off, many times the plastic clasp on the back with break or it will tear.",
