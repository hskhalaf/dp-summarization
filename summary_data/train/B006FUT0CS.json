The spray will stick the dirt on your towels and it will be hard to wash off. But I like this because it's really quick. I use it on the outside of my windows too.

      "text": "I\u2019ve always liked the idea of waterless/bucketless wash products, but was also weary the products wouldn\u2019t produce the results I wanted. This product exceeded my expectations. I\u2019ve come to the conclusion I will be only buying Meguairs products from now on. I quickly learned you need very little of this product to produce good results. I used one microfiber cloth, sprayed the cloth and wiped, then used another, dry cloth to pick up any remaining residue and dirt. The shine and waxed finish is impressive. If your car is truly dirty you will need multiple cloths as you\u2019ll simply end up pushing dirt around the paint.",

I wouldn\u2019t use in a heavily soiled car for fear of scratching the paint. One bottle will typically last 3-4 washes on a full size car or small SUV, depending on how saturated you want to spray on.",

    "description": "Size:26-OuncePerfect for urban dwellers, those with limited access to water, or the hot rodder who just arrived at a cruise, Ultimate Waterless Wash & Wax safely lifts away dirt and grime while leaving behind a protective layer of hydrophobic wax. In as little as 15 minutes, this new formula can morph a drab and dirty appearance into a stunning, clean and shiny car, without a drop of water. What's more, depending on how dirty the car is, a single bottle, along with the help of a few microfiber towels, can wash and wax up to five average-sized cars. To use this spray, simply mist onto the surface of the vehicle and gently wipe away using a Meguiar's Supreme Shine or other high quality microfiber towel. Wash and Wax Anywhere spray's unique chemistry insures a scratch-free finish when used as directed, as special lubricants and cleaning agents safely loosen and then gently remove the dirt. Follow with a quick wipe from a clean, dry towel and the surface is left with a beautiful, glossy, just-waxed finish. Waterless Wash & Wax is also safe to use on all wheel types, plus rubber, vinyl and glass.",
