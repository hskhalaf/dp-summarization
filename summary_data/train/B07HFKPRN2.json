I highly recommend this line for fine thin hair. Also I was surprised at how little it takes to get a beautiful result. I recommend starting with a smaller amount than you think you\u2019ll need!",

      "text": "I bought this sampler kit to try for my thin hair, only the dry shampoo I would consider buying again. The shampoo and conditioner didn\u2019t add thickness or volume, left my hair feeling dry and lifeless, felt like any cheap brand. The thickening lotion was so heavy that it weighed the hair down and my hair wouldn\u2019t hold the curl from curling iron. The only thing I would try again is the dry shampoo, however there are other dry shampoo brands that are so much better. So, I would not recommend these products or buy them again.",
