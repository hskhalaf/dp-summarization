Solution: force a piece of tooth pick in between the locks to keep them pushed apart in unlocked position.",

Once I started using the door the cat was a little undecided so I pushed him through from both sides a couple of times. After that he used it on his own. Now he comes and goes as he pleases without pestering me to constantly open and close the door. Fantastic.",

      "text": "This cat door is awesome. I rescued a one year old cat from our local animal shelter and had the cat door installed (by a handy neighbor) into a six panel steel insulated door from our laundry room into our garage where the cat litter tray is located. We taped the door wide open for a week or so, then slowly kept lowering it for the next couple weeks. We then coaxed her through the closed door with special treats a couple times and, voila, she's been using it ever since. It's quiet and it's nice that she can see through it. I would definitely recommend this product.",

Nice size for a LARGE cat (his name really isn't Fluffy but it sure does fit). He is about a 17 pound cat with a fair sized belly, and lots and lots of fur. He gets through just fine. No more early wake-up calls. Fluffy is happy, we are happy. Thanks!",
