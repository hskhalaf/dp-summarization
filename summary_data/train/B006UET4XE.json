When I go to wipe it off, it just gets everywhere and I have to start everything over. I hate this thing.

The applicator has just the write amount of stiffness. Would recommend to anyone who is new to eyeliner or who wants something that is quick and easy to apply. The color is very dark, striking black- it appears darker than kohl or pencil eyeliners. It is more similar-looking to a dark-black gel eyeliner. The product runs out fairly quickly- I think mine lasted approximately a month. If you store it upside down the pigment will stay near the applicator more easily.",

The Maybelline Master Precise All Day Liquid Eyeliner Makeup Waterproof lasts all day and doesn't smudge. My winged eyeliner looks wonderful! It is also comfortable to hold and use.
