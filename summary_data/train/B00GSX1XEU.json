Pros : Easy to fit Easy to clean sitting cushion as a detachable one so that you can put in washer as well wheels are of good quality , never had any issue while my baby was using this. Music and steering is big plus so that even now when he is 2 ys he still uses the handle one to play. hence its 2 in 1 (long lasting one ) These wheels works only for flat floor ( Not on CARPET )",

Some days he is grouchy until I put him in his little walker. I even feed him in it because we are just starting out so I want him to be comfortable. And on top of that it is super easy to assemble and I know my baby is safe in it (although he is always supervised).",

We've had more than one three or four month old baby who just seems to need to be able to stand and balance \"on their own\" and this is a very sturdy walker that safely allows that activity. The seat supports without constricting legs and the tray has the ability to hook toys to it so it also provides for grabbing coordination. Just follow the guidelines for advisable time to spend so the little ones get their tummy time, too!",

They love the items they can play with. I also bought extra items and rings so they can attach them to the unused loops or they can remove one toy and replace it with another. It helps develop the baby leg muscles for walking later. It is easy to wipe out if it gets dirty. My girlfriend took her baby outside on a blanket and put her in this while she worked in the yard. Very sturdy and easy to put together. Thank You!",

So when we first put her in there and she was still a little wobbly she would kind of slam herself back and hurt her little back or lean forward to fast and hurt her little belly. All I did was stuff a receiving blanket underneath in between the fabric and the seat back and put a blanket around her.",
