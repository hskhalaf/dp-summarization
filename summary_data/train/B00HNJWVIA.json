      "title": "Great prosumer 4K camcorder!",
      "text": "This being the second to the top end consumer 4K camcorder, it's packed with features. The 1\" sensor is a massive improvement over the 1/2\" sensors that the sub-$1000 camcorders have, making it superior in low light. The manual focus ring is also much larger and more responsive. The built-in ND filters (3 levels) are fantastic. This is really more of a prosumer model than a consumer one. A lot of great features packed into a tiny package, but yet has a nice weight to it and doesn't feel cheaply made. Great for doc and student filmmakers who want 4K 24p but don't have $5,000 or more to put into a camera just yet. Highly recommended.",

      "text": "Even five years after its launch, this is an impressive video camera. I had previously used the AX53, but this surpasses the AX53 in every way except stabilization, which, given my shooting style isn\u2019t crucial to me. Beyond its video quality, the hidden gem of this camera is it\u2019s ability in the photo mode. While it lacks the bells and whistles of more modern Sony photo cameras, it still produces still images that rival anything from the RX10 or RX100 series. Back in 2014, Sony got the color science right on this camera, and I\u2019m very impressed.",

Great value. Tested the camera out a bit but still have to put through its paces. But initial thoughts, it is a very well built camera, and much bigger than the Panasonic it is replacing. Materials feel premium. The ability to change settings manually quickly with the wheel is great. this also has built in ND filters which is rare to find in a consumer camera, and will save you some money not having to buy the filters.",

The images have a crispness to them that, for me, puts the AX100 above the competition from other consumer 4K camcorders, both from Sony and Panasonic - forget the footage you'll find on Youtube, its video output has to be seen straight from the memory card to a 4K TV. It is not a professional video camera, of course, but amateur enthusiasts will be well served by it. Highlights: - the clear zoom is very nice, with little loss of quality. - internal ND filters are also extremely useful - low light quality is good, esp. compared to the competition, but not jaw-dropping.",

But I must forward you, you need to learn the manual settings to achieve such greatness. All auto isn't bad, but for those special shots, learn the manual settings.

Sporting resolution that\u2019s four times clearer than HD, this changes everything. Footage is captured with true cinematic depth thanks to the 1\u201d image sensor and video is recorded with total versatility in mind: XAVC S2, AVCHD and MP4. Put one in your hand and tell your story in 4K.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY\nCAPTURE 4K/30P VIDEO THAT FAR EXCEEDS HD RESOLUTION\nCapture the finest details in 4k (Full HD 4x resolution , QFHD: 3840 x 2160). This camcorder allows incredibly high resolution, to produce vibrant and extremely realistic images. What\u2019s more, the blazingly fast image processor is the same one employed in professional Sony models, making it possible to record 30p movies at the camera\u2019s full resolution for incredibly smooth and sharp playback, with no loss in realism, even when panning the camera and shooting moving subjects.\n\n1\u201d EXMOR R CMOS SENSOR W/ DIRECT PIXEL READ OUT\nThe camcorder features Sony's first 1.0\" Exmor R CMOS sensor. The back-illuminated technology improves low-light sensitivity and combines with Sony's Column A/D Conversion to reduce noise by 50%. This is great when shooting in dimly lit environments such as night landscapes or indoor scenes.\n\n14MP RESOLUTION VIDEO AND 20MP STILL IMAGE CAPTURE\nCreate cinematic video with 14MP resolution sensor (for video) and high quality 20MP still images.\n\n\nVERSATILE SHOOTING W/ XAVC-S, AVCHD AND MP4 CODECS\nThe FDR-AX100 records HD movies in the XAVC-S format, which uses MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 for video compression and linear PCM for audio compression, while saving files in a MP42 wrapper. The highly compressed files allow extensive record times. The camcorder also records in AVCHD, ideal for quality video for HDTV and Blu-ray disc burning. Additionally, the camcorder can shoot MP4 HD video, which is ideal for sharing over the internet at up to 28Mbps. Having the ability to switch between all three of three formats makes this camcorder an ideal tool that is versatile for creating content to live in a number of different environments.\n\nCARL ZEISS VARIO SONNAR T* LENS W/ 12X OPTICAL ZOOM\nThe FDR-AX100 comes equipped with a newly developed Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T* lens that has cleared a series of tough performance tests.

Notable features of BIONZ X technology include: 1. Detail reproduction technology optimally filters edges and textures differently depending on the scene. 2. Area specific noise reduction swiftly and efficiently analyzes the subject and reduces noise. This new image processing technology achieves an even better balance of exceptional detail and advanced noise control. Its ability to record at 120p enables slow-motion playback at one-fifth the speed in a 24p environment in post-processing.\n\nOPTICAL STEADYSHOT IMAGE STABILIZATION W/ ACTIVE MODE\nOptical SteadyShot Image Stabilization with Intelligent Active Mode is an advanced optical image stabilization technology that corrects camera shake to capture scenes with phenomenal smoothness and stability. Intelligent Active Mode analyzes video frames and provides compensation with assistance from the new BIONZ X image processing engine. Whether recording movies while strolling on vacation, shooting while chasing a child, or zooming in to capture faraway subjects, Handycam\u2019s simple solution smoothly reproduces the scene with a higher level of stability.\n\nHIGH CONTRAST 0.39 OLED EVF FOR EYE-LEVEL FRAMING\"\nThe FDR-AX100 employs high contrast a 0.39\u201d OLED Tru-Finder EVF which reproduces rich color and deep black. A new optical design of the EVF, using four dual-surface aspherical lenses, allows for a 33-degree wide angle view that is amazing clear through the edge of the view finder.\n\n\nLARGE 3.5 XTRA FINE LCD (921K) \"\nThe 3.5\u201d (16:9) Xtra Fine LCD screen (921K) displays sharp, bright, vivid images, letting you compose a shot more easily - even outdoors, while enabling you to change settings to best represent the scene.\n\nNFC SMARTPHONE LINKING - SIMPLE CONNECTIVITY TO SMARTPHONES VIA WI-FI\nConnectivity with smartphones for One-touch sharing/One-touch remote has been simplified with Wi-Fi/NFC control.
