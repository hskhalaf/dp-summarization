Only have to go over the floors once to sweep/vacuum/mop! Worth every penny. OH and its easy to take apart and clean too. Freaking perfect.",

Call me old fashion but I think that a product should last a little bit longer and the company should do a better job of standing by their product. With that said giving this product a one too high. It is a shame because Bissell use to make good products and had great costumer service.",

Yesterday, however, when I went to fill it, water started gushing out everywhere. Upon close inspection, I found a dozen thin cracks in the reservoir, which rendered the unit trash. The plastic just isn't strong enough for a device that gets as much abuse as a vacuum.",

Sadly, after 5 uses, when filling the reservoir for the steam, the water drained right out the bottom and on to the floor. There was a large puddle of water to mop up. Also the removable footing that holds the mop head became very difficult to attach. I returned it and was given a partial refund due to being slightly over the 30 day return policy.",

And a possible thinner short arm for hard to reach areas like behind toilets or under cabinets. I'm keeping this machine as long as it keeps working. 2 months before the year is up this machine stopped steaming. Never purchase again for the price.",

My favorite thing is not needing to use chemicals to clean! The deep boosting attachment & special wet pad worked great as well, just pitch it when done. All attachments are easy to figure out.

Bissell is great about sending a new machine as I suspect they get many calls, but I am on my 3rd one in a year! It's a hassle to call, spend time on the phone with a customer service rep, send them pics of a cut cord of the broken machine for them to send you a replacement. They won't refund your money if you buy it through amazon. Don't buy it find something else!",

Now we have to purchase another one, will look for a different brand, hopefully, more durable.",

I like the vacuum but had to return it because of this problem. I hope the manufacturer is able to fix this by privindkng larger wheel base and mecanism to adjust the floor brush high rather than the current small from wheels.",
