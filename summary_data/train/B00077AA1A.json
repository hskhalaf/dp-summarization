This trademark design features elegant scalloped edges on durable white ceramic porcelain. This mix-and-match classic is crafted for outstanding freezer-to-oven-to-table performance. This microwave and dishwasher-safe 18-piece set makes for a sizeable enhancement to a dinnerware repertoire.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nEmblazoned with a sweet butterfly and wildflower motif, this summery dinnerware pattern is versatile enough to serve everyday meals or stand in for special occasion dining. Perfect for an average family, this set packs six 10-3/4-inch dinner plates, six 9-inch salad plates, and six 12-ounce mugs. Made of fine china, the dinnerware has a beautiful reflective quality to its ivory base color yet is surprisingly durable enough to go from the freezer to the oven to the table without damaging and is also safe for the microwave and dishwasher.\n\n Based on designs from Lenox artist Louise de Luyer, Butterfly Meadow's dinnerware set mixes and matches a variety of meadow scenes, each featuring a species of butterfly with a different bloom. Among the pictured butterfly varieties, there are colorful Swallowtails, Monarchs, Eastern-Tailed Blues, Orange Sulphers, and even a dragonfly here and there. Avid gardeners will also be able to spot favorite flowers, which range from morning glories to lilacs to tiger lilies. Each scene is a bit different from the next, adding to the charm of this country-style dinnerware. Graceful scalloped and ridged edges on plates and mugs lend an additional feeling of innocence to this pattern. This dinnerware set matches other crystal, flatware, and serving pieces in fine china and sculpted metal within Lenox's Butterfly Meadow collection. --Cristina Vaamonde\n\nWhat's in the Box\n6 dinnerware place settings.
