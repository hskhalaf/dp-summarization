I used a PC and it failed with large files. I am impressed by it's metal look. It looked great. After downloading iDiskk pro and connecting it to my iPhone, the photo transfers was very fast. You just need to full charge your phone before doing it. I am able to select different folders for transferring photos. I did read the user manu to turn off iCloud upload setting before doing so.",
