My only \"gripe\" is that the steel supports are quite spread apart. I added some wood slats in between for added support (see picture).

Make some minor adjustments with a blunt instrument after you drop on the mattress and foundation, and \"nuttin' ain't goin' nowhere. \" Definitely more fun than wrangling loose slats!",

The edge of the packaging had been torn in transit and since some of the bolts were loose in the box, it probably came out in transit. Fortunately, I had one at home that fit. I needed a frame to attach to my wooden bed frame and this one did. I have been using the frame for a couple of weeks and it works as expected. If I needed another frame, I would purchase this one again.",

My wooden slates legs would all fall and the slates looked and felt weak to the point where I felt my bed will eventually collapse. I prolonged getting something sturdier for months thinking I would probably need a new bed frame but this saved me from going that far. I was skeptical of only having three of the metal slates but it was stronger and sturdier than all 6 slates I had before. I kept the original slates and put these as reinforcements and now I\u2019m confident my bed will hold. Totally recommend.",
