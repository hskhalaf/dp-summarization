I was indecisive on whether to buy this one of another one out there that was a bit more expensive but come on, this one had the most positive comments and now that we've tried it, we will stick to this one!!.

Not only this makes the mask inefficient, it also makes my glasses fog immediately, so I cannot walk/run.

I was not impressed with the adjustability of this device. I am a fairly fit individual and this device is seems to be either all or nothing. I tried every setting and above the easy levels it is extremely difficult to breath. I even tried weightlifting and running. It hindered my performance in every way. The mask is very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.",

Don't go off my word alone, highly sugguest to try it yourself. I was skeptic too but honestly now recommend it if you want a good training mask.",

I believe I'm not up to the cardiovascular conditioning to get the benefits from it. I also had a few claustrophobic moments while wearing it. It's not a bad mask as far as quality or fit.

Not sure how you get away from that in a mask, but if you're wondering if it perfectly matches altitude it. Doesn't because you don't have to deal with the suction feeling of the mask when hiking.",
