We did have some difficulty connecting iPhone and iPad with the USB connector the projector didn't seem to recognize this outlet so I went to apple store and purchased for $120.00 the apple TV box and HDMI cord which I would recommend in addition to this. It was delivered as promised and if I had patience for techno issues I would have called company for issue but (I am certain it was something I missed) but with the apple box it is phenomenal!!!",

The build quality is good. I can't complain about the performance. Cons: The lumens are very low on this. I had to turn off most of the lights in the 100 person room to get a good view of the projection. If you have to have bright lights in the room, this may not work well for some.",

This picture is bright and produces a very large image over a short throw distance which is nice in an apartment with limited space. However, ordering this product from Beach Camera I was given a shipping cost, and later received an additional invoice from from FedEx to cover a hefty $96 customs fee. This put the price of the projector close to $600. Again I love the product, but if you get it in Canada, get it from a distributor in Canada so you don't have to pay this ridiculous fee. Cheers.",
