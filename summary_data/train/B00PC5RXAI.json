I liked the functions of the alarm/voice alarm features in my older Kiddie, so the new Kiddie was the perfect upgrade. This new model only takes two AA batteries (included) compared to my older Kiddie model which took three AA batteries. The new Kiddie model, mounted right up to my original Kiddie brackets, there was no need to install the new bracket.",

The new alarm continuously gives a low battery warning even when using fresh batteries (I tried 2 sets). I'm trying to return the product, but the Amazon returns site is saying this item can't be returned. After reading their return policy it is unclear why this is the case. After ordering things from Amazon for nearly 20 years, this is the first time I've ever had such an issue. Needless to say, I am extremely dissatisfied. Maybe I'll have better luck dealing directly with the manufacturer, but I will certainly think twice before buying anything through Amazon in the future.",

I purchased the new kiddie alarm with 2 front facing batteries because one reviewer stated that it fits on the old wall mount device. This is true. My issue is with the difficulty of installing the batteries. There are 2 red plastic objects where the batteries go, that basically push the batteries out. I had to try to read the instructions on battery installation. After about 20 or 25 minutes, I finally wrestled the batteries in and managed to close the battery door. I do not look forward to ever having to replace the batteries, which is important for the functioning of the device.",

The alarm, both voice and siren, is plenty loud for the 2 bedroom 1 bath main floor of my bungalow style house, as I found out recently when my husband was frying bacon and couldn't figure out that the smoke getting thick in the kitchen was from burning toast behind him.
