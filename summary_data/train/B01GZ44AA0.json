I'm soooo disappointed with the flavor and how tiny the package is for the price! I'd rather make my own for wayyyyyyyy cheaper AND better tasting! I will not be buying again. If you don't don't make your own, then this could be a good go to since there's nothing to really compare it to, but I personally was very disappointed with the flavor and servings for the price!",
