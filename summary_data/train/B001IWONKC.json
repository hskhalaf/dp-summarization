As it pours out, it is aeriating the red wine and really taking it up a notch. And, there is a small screen inside right before the pour spout that will filter out any cork debris or bottom sediment which is an added bonus. A definite buy item! And great for gifting too!",

Once I compared the wine with and without Haley's corker I was sold. Bought one that day, took it to a party, and the person that poured the last glass threw the bottle away with the corker on top. Theses are black so it is easy to do. They do sell colored ones but cold not get the same price. So I found them on here at the same price for 4 as what I paid for 1 at the winery.",
