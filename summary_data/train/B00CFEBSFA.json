As it is, it's just sitting in the cupboard and never been used.",

So after some googling I found out it was a problem with old firmware so I flashed the newest available which fixed that error but the wifi was still weak when I was a few meters away. So i decided to return. Also to set up the Linksys smart wifi app I had factory reset the router!",

I wasted sooooo much time before I eventually managed to find it on their website. (Note: Make sure you change the default password as it is common for EA6300, possibly all of their routers).",

Also, the validation of subnets is terrible; I use /23s but it only accepts /24s. In essence, this may be an okay device if you're planning to replace all of your current devices, but just doesn't want to play ball if you're trying to integrate it into your current network",

Drop one star as I would have to agree with previous reviews saying the setup can be cumbersome, it seems the overly simplified setup software built into the router is prone to crashing - I had to do a factory reset and was able to complete set up the second time around. Once setup, this router is definitely top notch though!",
