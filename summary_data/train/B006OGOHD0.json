I've opened handgun safes with paperclips, pieces of coat hanger wire, 7-Eleven Slurpee straws, coffee stirrers, but never a gum wrapper--until now. Here's my main problem with this GunVault device: I first compromised a GunVault product back in 2015, and one would think that a company caught selling defectively designed products would recognize the need to have their remaining product line evaluated before being exposed again for selling junk. But not GunVault. Apparently GunVault would rather deal with public humiliation.",

Concerns: As others have mentioned, it does make a bit of a clunking sound when it opens, which you probably don't want in a home invasion.

Cons: - Very minor issue but it takes about 2 full seconds from the time the reader confirmed your finger print to then drop open the access door.
