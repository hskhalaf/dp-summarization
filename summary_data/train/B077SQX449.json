The flat bottom piece is so convenient it allows the mirror to sit flat on top of a desk/table without screwing it to your wall (you can add the screws for more security and to avoid the risk of the mirror falling). Lastly, I added stick on lights which makes it look expensive, it\u2019s perfect and very affordable!",

I am very sad because I love the way it looks and it would have fit perfectly in my room. I know that this is not completely the fault of the seller, as UPS may have handled it incorrectly, but the box did not even have a \"Fragile\" sticker on it, and the packaging was not that protective. Looks like I will be purchasing a different mirror-sad because I really loved this one.",

It's really nice for a $40 mirror, but the screw heads are visible on top and under the shelf, and there are some minor imperfections, but I truly didn't mind for the price. I didn't care for the installation - you have to make sure the screws are in the wall level and at the exact distance as the mounting holes - but we got it done. (Since it's light enough I wish I could have hung it with picture wire - would have been much easier - but there was nowhere to attach the wire.) All-in-all, I would recommend.",

Make sure one side is the straight side (the side you cut doesn't have to be straight). 2) Turn the mirror around and mark the holes on the straight side of the cardboard using a marker. 3) Use that cardboard strip as a template for your wall. You can measure and level where the mirror will go and it will go up without a hitch.",
