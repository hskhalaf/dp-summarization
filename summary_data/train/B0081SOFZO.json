      "text": "I had the same issue about 3 months after I purchased this product. I never had received a manual to use for trouble shooting, so I called the manufacture. They emailed me a manual right away, and let me know that slow dispersion of the water most often means the tip of the dispenser needs to be cleared with a tooth-pick or the unit needs to be cleaned. Upon doing both of those things, it now dispenses water quickly and easily again. For those complaining of this issue, it's an easy fix (it's a maintenance issue on the owner's end - not an issue with the product).",
