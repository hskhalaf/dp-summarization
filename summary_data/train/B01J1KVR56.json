I read somewhere that it\u2019s important to pump the mattress up and leave it inflated for a day without sitting or laying on it. It allows the materials to stretch and expand. Apparently it decreases the chance of it popping or breaking a seam. We had some friends stay with us a couple nights and it stayed perfectly inflated the entire time. We even had it sitting in the room for a couple of days after they left and it was still completely full of air. Highly recommend.",

I made sure the pump dial was in the correct position before the second night, but still deflated. it would be a great air mattress if it did its job of holding air. Returned for money back. Do not ignore reviews as I did, they are all correct, it does not hold air. My guess is the air pump is faulty, and leaks through there.",
