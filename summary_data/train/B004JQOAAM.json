      "text": "The plumber just left after installing this faucet so I am just giving my first impression and can't yet speak to durability. My plumber was not particularly impressed since he said that most faucets come with their own compression hoses and this model did not. I wondered how this brushed nickel would look installed directly on stainless steel since none of the product pictures showed that configuration. It matches quite nicely and I have attached a couple of pictures showing that. I do like how it swivels easily and the hose attachment fits well in the faucet base. The spray feature does stop if the water flow is too low and the flow reverts back to stream when turned off.",

Crawling under the sink, reaching up to where the items are fastened, you definitely need a basin wrench. But, once you get it done and properly tightened and the faucet and handle all properly lined up (a bit of a challenge, but that would be true for any model) it's a very nice faucet.",

      "text": "Too early to tell its durability yet, but my feedback so far... The good: Handle can be lifted up and down by a figure to control flows. Swivels freely left and right. Body is all metal. The so so: Very light weight which makes it feel flimsy. Even securely fastened, the body rocks slightly. Hot/cold lines not clearly labeled - had to guess which was which during installation. The spray button is hidden in a rubber boot (why?), making it hard to operate with one hand. None of the flaws is a deal breaker, but I am on the fence to say I will buy it again.",

      "text": "This is a superbly performing faucet for the price. I installed it myself with the deck plate several months ago and we've had no problems whatsoever. Faucet in brushed nickel looks very nice, no imperfections. Installation went smoothly. Handle works well: water shuts on/off completely and volume/temperature control is smooth. No leaks anywhere. Switch between central water stream and multi-stream spray is easy and works well. Sprayer sits well into its holder; could be a more solid fit but not a problem. The one minor drawback is that the swiveling cylinder that the facet comes out of is slightly off-center from the short bottom cylinder, but I think that's only noticeable to me because I'm the one who installed it.",

Update, 2 months later, showing quotes from my earlier review ===> The \"slanted aim of the faucet\" is actually better than \"straight down\". In fact, the faucet rating is now moved from 3-star to 5-star. My previous concern that the water flow rate is \"slow\" is now offset due to the very effective spraying of water flowing through it... I mean the built-in spray, with the optional super-spray switched off.",

I took a chance on it, because Consumer Reports said all faucets perform so well these days they've stopped rating them. My husband particularly likes the feature on this one that switches the sprayer to full stream each time you turn the water off, as that is easier than finding the right place to push the off button on the sprayer.",

I really liked the faucet initially. All other water pressure in house is fine. Now it takes me FOREVER to fill up sink to do dishes, it's really annoying and this wasn't exactly easy to install, so not looking forward to having to buy another! Any helpful hints on how to fix this problem???????",
