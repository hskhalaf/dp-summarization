The phone itself is just the business, super fast for browsing, lightweight in the hand and, not massively big. There is no phone on the market that can compete with this. If you've just purchased an iPhone, then take it back as this is the best phone out there",

With all phones, one can never say this is the best because there is always a newer one out a few months later. Some people complain about the price. It is true that the phone is expensive but all top end phones are similarly priced. iPhone 10s Max is \u00a31500 for 512GB version. That is \u00a3300 more than similar Note 10+ 512GB. Somehow many people praise Apple but complain about Note 10 price. Currently I use an iPhone 8 and will buy a note 10 in a few months once it is a bit cheaper.",
