I have somewhat of a wide foot but not wide enough to have to buy \"wide\" shoes. These however are cut weird at the front causing blisters on my toes on BOTH sides. Halfway through the day I had blisters on the back of my foot and on both sides of the front. The cushion is comfortable and better then most flats but the overall comfort is a NO for me. These shoes are terribly uncomfortable all the way around.",

I was afraid it would look dowdy (I'm 24 and I really don't want it to age me) but it's quite stylish, and SOO comfortable. This shoe is heaven. I wish it came in more colors, because right now I wear it nearly every day. Since it IS real leather, make sure to clean, condition, and protect it to really really get the most out of your purchase. This is definitely worth it, and you will save a lot of money when you're not buying $10 flats every few months...",

I feel i can wear them with anything, anytime. The color is 99% close to what you can see in the picture. I have tried some other products of this brand, they are all great quality products.

The Leather on the toe showed wear fast, the insert and arch support was not as comfortable as hoped, and the sole split along the lines located under the ball of your foot. All in all, I would not say the shoe is worth its full price tag of $50-$60.",

I'm so sad, since the 8's at about $14 and the 7.5 is $70. Clearly, I won't be reordering them given that significant price difference. But other than that, they seemed comfortable and have some cushioning (more so than many flats). Would recommend, but would advise sizing down.",

The shoe gets hot like any shoe, but traps in the heat and moisture so bad that it causes major foot odor problems. Would not recommend this shoe to others, but have to wear it. Bought it to have professional flats for work while in my third trimester. Not very professional to be walking funny because how they hurt the back of your heel.",

They are a little long on me but the width is perfect, however my feet are slightly wide. I wish I could afford more but I'm on a college student's budget so these will get a lot of use!",

Maybe just because my foot is too wide, but they are a bit snug. It's not too bad though so I'm hoping either the memory foam flattens or the upper stretches out a bit. Overall, love them.",
