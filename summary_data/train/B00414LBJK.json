I immediately returned it and the second one showed up in just as poor packaging but not al scratched up so I decided to go ahead and accept it as I didn't want the hassle of another return. At first it worked pretty well and was only slightly uncomfortable. In less than 6 months this has become difficult to hear and regularly drops calls. Furthermore, the screening on the face is peeling off as well. The dang thing is falling apart. I do not recommend buying this.",

The item is great though, except the quality is poor. a few months after use, The rubber brand \"Q2\" fell off, the filter covering of some sort on the mouthpiece or mic also fell off. THEN on 10/29/13 the bluetooth just started to break apart, the volume control was not there anymore, I placed it on my shirt pocket, and when i pulled it out, the thing was in 2 pieces. But after taping it together it still works! So I'm giving it a 3 star! Yaaay! But my other bluetooth from plantronics have used it for more than 2 years still intact, just lost it. This one never even used frequently.Oh well never again!",

My previous headset was a Jawbone, the BlueAnt is a MUCH better piece, the voice commands truly make it hands free, the call quality is very good and the phone book compatibility is a very nice feature.

Very happy with this headset. I'm not done exploring all its features, but call quality is excellent and it's super-comfortable. I highly recommend it if you're looking for an over-the-ear headpiece. My only issue at this point is the apparent compatibility problem between the voice activated calling and Google's address list. I haven't really dug into it, as it's not a high priority. It's nice to be able to listen to music on my headset, and it's great for hands-free calling.",

The bluetooth downloaded all of my phone contacts to its memory so when someone calls the bluetooth announcer automatically announces who is calling me; also when you receive a call the bluetooth announcer asks you if you would like to take the call or ignore the call.

Other than that I think it's great that I can connect to multiple devices and it hold as my phone (iphone 4) contacts and announces them when it rings. Call quality is good.",

Buy this for the base functions, if you want fancier features such as voice commands etc...look else where for a MUCH higher price.",

Yes, I paid a bit more for some of these, but this one is by far the worst in all aspects. The Jawbone is by far the best...actually any model. Nothing else compares, and though I was buying this for a beginner, this falls far short of my expectations. Do not buy it.",

When the headset arrived I plugged it in to get a full charge. When complete I read the instructions, turned on the headset and I could hardly hear any sound - the volume was so quiet even turned up to full volume. The headset is supposed to automatically pair with the phone - which it did not. I tried to pair it with my device through the settings field but the device would not recognize the phone. Don't waste your money - find a better quality headset.",

The unit I received only had one earbud and one earloop, fortunately, they fit my ear adequately. The unit works great! Much better than the Jawbone I had been using.
