I need to wear an orthotic insole under the shoe's cushion insole, and I was happy to see that this shoe's insole completely covers my orthotic, so I can rest assured I will be able to walk with no pain from the orthotic edge cutting into the bottom of my feet. Very nice looking shoe. I got the water-proof version since we'll be doing a lot of hiking most likely in the rain.",

But anyway, this boot is comfortable, and kept my feet warm and dry during a 3 week trip to Ireland in September. Hiking in Ireland is wet, muddy, and slippery, and these boots were the best defense against all of those elements. The Vibram sole is outstanding and the Gortex let me walk proudly through muddy puddles. Vasque boots have a tendency to run a little snug so I bought a size larger and wear them with thick socks.",
