The blades don't have much \"grip\", and tend to slide off of the chicken when cutting. The handles are smooth, and once you're into the job, are quite slippery as well. The Gelindo handles don't allow for enough leverage to keep the blades in place when clamping down. In the past I've don't the same job with kitchen scissors and now realize that it is the looped handles of the scissors that are most important - the loops allow for leverage even with slippery handles..",
