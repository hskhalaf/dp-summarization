      "text": "I bought this system with the Crucial 16GB kit (CT2C8G3S160BM) and a Crucial M500 240GB mSATA Internal Solid State Drive (CT240M500SSD3) and it is awesome. I installed Fedora 20 on it and everything booted first time, flawlessly. In the 15 years I've been working with Linux, that's a first. With the SSD, this computer boots in 10 seconds (including the 5 second delay for you to select which Linux kernel to boot). The performance is fantastic as the system is unbelievably responsive. Admittedly, this is not a gaming system, but it smokes our windows laptop and crushes everything our family want to do with it.",

I have one of them for each TV in the house configured with 16GB of RAM and a 240GB SSD drive, and use them for everything from streaming Netflix to surfing Amazon, email and word processing, etc. without any slowness. I highly recommend the Logitech K400 wireless keyboard with touchpad as an accessory. They are somewhat thermally sensitive. If you put them in a closed space with no ventilation, they will periodically overheat and require turning completely off, letting them cool down, and powering back up. They need some \"breathing room\", but besides that, I highly recommend them.",

Very cost effective, no fan or HD noise, and very speedy for all of the business applications I have tried. I am driving an HP QHD display (2560x1440) with an inexpensive DisplayPort cable. I have also tried driving a small 1080p flat-panel television using the HDMI output and this worked quite well. Being 100% solid-state has the advantage of fast RAM, and fast SSD storage. This is a wonderful combination, which works very well with Windows 8.1.",

However, it falls flat on its face when a new video codec standard (H.265) was thrown at it. QuickSync could not decode H.265 so that leaves the job up to the cpu - which pegged at 100% on complex scenes. The result was still pictures instead of fluid motion. Perfect for online audio/video, web browse, lab, etc..., but barely missed the mark as a high-end local networked video streaming system.",
