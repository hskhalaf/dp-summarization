HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend. I have used this method for my pre-school aged children, and i have seen a massive difference between my children and others. In addition, I'm a teacher, and I have used the middle school aged techniques in the classroom with success. But seriously, if you're going to home educate at all-- you need this book as your home plate. You can adjust as needed for your child and lifestyle. This book is the BOMB DOT COM!",

My results are wonderful as a result. However, every student/teacher combo is different, and what works for some may not for others.",

It can be used as a full curriculum (they recommend all the spine books you might need) or as a reference to beef up and strengthen your current methods.

This book helped me make a few course corrections that have improved our daily routine, and I know it will be a much used resource for years to come. It may not work for everyone, and I don't agree with everything in it, but I imagine it would be useful to nearly anyone. I highly recommend it to anyone that is homeschooling, or thinking about homeschooling.",
