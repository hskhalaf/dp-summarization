I decided to try these as a cheaper alternative to her normal LiteBite mouth guard, and surprisingly these are WAY better! This mouth guard molded to her braces better which provides a full coverage over her teeth, but still allows her to speak normal. It fits very comfortable and you can barely tell she's wearing it. She will definitely be using these from now on!",

I held the the sides up with my fingers after coming out of the hot water to keep it elongated, reaching the teeth in the back. Clear, sturdy and included information on how to care for your guard after making it. Keeps me from clenching all night and no headaches. Thanks so much.",

This one fits the best and allows him to talk to his team on the field much better than other guards. I will continue to purchase these for seasons to come.",
