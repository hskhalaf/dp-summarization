The fit and finish on the shade is phenomenal. As others have said there is like a 1\" gap in parts, but if that gap wasn't there, it would be a headache to get in and out of position. Slap it up there, flip the sun visors down to hold it in place, and you're good to go.",

It is obviously more expensive than most alternatives but I bought a cheaper one for another vehicle and I've determined I got what I paid for. If you want something that helps a little and kind of fits then get a cheap one. If you want one that makes a big difference and fits perfectly then the extra $ you'll spend on this will be worth it.",

While it does the job, this is by no means a custom fit cover, despite what the company claims. This particular one (which is the correct one for my vehicle) leaves a gap on one side or the other. Also, in order to put it up into the windshield, it is constantly knocking my rear view mirror out of alignment. Shouldn't happen if this was 'custom fit'. I regret spending this kind of money on this. As others have stated, at this price a storage bag should have been included.",
