Thankfully there are these reusable K-Cup Coffee Filters. This is all we'll use at home. They are durable (we have one that is going strong after 4 years, being used daily), easy to wash, fit perfectly into a Keurig, and are easy to fill with coffee grinds. I sincerely hope that anyone with a Keurig will consider this product - it is SO simple to use and has a positive impact on the environment!",

      "text": "What a great way to enjoy Keurig coffee maker and a coffee of your preference without having to buy expensive k-pods! Absolutely love it. Easy to install, use, and clean. Just remove the built-in k-cup and replace it with this reusable coffee filter. Use the ground coffee of your choice. I use one tea spoon of coffee with mine, but it will accept as many as 2 - 2.5 teaspoons easy. Watch out though, using as much coffee per cup will probably give you a heart attack. :)",

We purchased this to reduce the amount of k-cups we were throwing into the trash. It is a simple mesh filter that is washable, the filter fits into the hard plastic case and that case replaces the standard K-cup holder in your brewer. It is a bit of pain to clean when you are in rush. If you grind your own coffee, grind it on a more course scale. I noticed finely ground coffee ends up in the bottom of my mug.",

In my K10/B31 Mini that I use at work it works perfect. Never leaks and makes a great cup of coffee. I think this is because its pump is not a powerful so it allows the coffee to begin to flow before sending too much to the filter preventing overflow. I can get it to work in the K60 if I put less coffee in the filter basket which also causes a weaker cup of joe.",

This could be because of my grounds are too fine. I'll have to experiment with the crush. Overall, I like it and am glad to be rid of the very wasteful plastic cups!",

Maybe is that the lid doesn't seal or the lack of a puncture into a foil that creates a seal there... either way, I don't think there is an excuse for this.

My current coffe cost $10 and I've been using it for 3 months so far. One full filter with this product will make a nice cup of large keurig size.",

Even with coarse coffee grounds, the grounds float up and get into the coffee, it clogs the machine and I only get a half cup of coffee.

There are numerous other brands that offer a container that is so much easier. I like the ecobrew type, but there are others I haven't tried that might be just as good. I also see somebody sells a little cap, so that you can just reuse one of the containers from the ready-filled k-cups.",
