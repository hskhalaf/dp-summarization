The solution was a rollaway bed and this Decorative Freestanding Beige Woven Bamboo 4 Panel Screen. The screen is sturdy and good looking, and when it is open it provides about 6 feet of space; it is tall enough that you cannot see over it - truly offers a good amount of privacy. The four panels fold up nicely and it is easy to store when not in use. It is an easy and economical way to provide privacy, but can also be used as a partial room divider. The bamboo is a nice neutral color. I definitely recommend this screen.",
