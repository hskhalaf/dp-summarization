My rms and the speakers pretty much match and I feel like the speaker can take even more. Very impressive. i was running a 12 p3d2 and a type r swd4(I think that's the model). This is pretty much meeting them. The ohm load was 1.47 this speaker is 2.04 so less power and the same sound but a lot better sq. I have it in the q power big box.",
