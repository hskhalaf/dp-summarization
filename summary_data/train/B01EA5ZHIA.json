The biggest problem is that the coffee flavor is not comparable to any of the predecessor Braun models. The coffee taste is just as uninspired as that produced by Cuisinart makers, which this item exactly matches. As with Cuisinarts, one cannot accurately fill the water, because there is no external window to view the water height (all previous Brauns had this). One is supposed to guess water height by little platforms at 2 cup intervals -- just horrible.",
