With a more form-fitting upper, runners will get to experience again the superb arch support, firm and responsive cushioning, and efficient movement through the gait cycle. This is a very solid option for those looking for a high-mileage trainer that has noticeable stability and shock-absorbing features.",
      "pros": [
        "The general consensus from a good number of reviews show that the 18th version of the Rider is a comfortable shoe",
        "It is a value for the money investment",

        "It has excellent arch support",
        "The Rider 18 is relatively lightweight for a neutral trainer",
        "A handful loved the pop coming from the midsole",
        "The heel to toe transition is quick, according to several runners"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "Quite a few runners saw the soles of the Rider 18 getting separated from the upper",

However, it's important to visit a specialist before purchasing online to ensure you're getting the correct shoe for your feet and running style. Overall though Mizuno are a fantastic brand, only downside is the stitching never seems to last long.",

I'm hoping that through use it will ease up - run about 17 miles so far. Apart from that they feel supportive and look good!",

A real shame. I wish trainers came in wide sizes for women in good colours and then I would have far more choices. Not every girl has dainty narrow feet!!! So rating them for style and not for fit. I should add the price was fantastic and they arrived the next day which was excellent. Just a downer I had to return them straight away and pay double for men's instead.",

Light but provide good cushioning, especially in the front foot (fore-foot) - once I changed to Mizuno Waves I said goodbye to achy knees.",

They rubbed on the inside of each heel particularly the right. Once id worn them i couldnt sent them back. I had to wear them everyother day to try and break them in. Ive never had to break trainers in. Even after 3 - 4 weeks they still rub slightly in the right foot. The reduced price certainly make you wonder if they are a reduced quality product. I won't be purchasing again and would not recommend.",

    "description": "Cushioning and stability from preceding versions is retained and expanded upon with the Mizuno Wave Rider 18 Women's Running Shoes through a redesigned upper which sees several overlays removed to offer greater freedom in the forefoot. Finer mesh detailing works with the honeycombing of Mizuno's Intercool technology to deliver even more breathability with an internal structure that conforms to your running stride, in turn improving both fit and comfort. SR Touch again features, but this time lighter. A softer heel with cushioning compound giving yielding improved impact resistance upon heelstrike and a much smoother transition period. The Mizuno U4iC Wave midsole has been designed to be unlike comparable shoe technologies. When the foot touches the ground, Wave attenuates and redirects impact forces away from the foot. Acting much like a car's suspension, it cushions and keeps the foot centred in the shoe throughout the stride. Through the use of differing wave shapes and designs, Mizuno are ultimately equipping each model to fit the unique stride of the individual runner; if its a local jog or running past the 20 mile marker, Wave will always feel amazing underfoot. Research carried out by Mizuno has indicated that there is a significant difference between the biomechanics of the male and female running gait. Tests revealed that the angle, velocity and speed of pronation is higher in women than in men. Research has also found that the transition from foot strike to toe off is slower in men than in women and that the angle at which the heel contacts the ground is more severe in women than in men. As such, Mizuno products employ specific male/female designs that accommodate these differences.",
