I do suggest you go to YouTube to figure out how to install and configure on your computer, as the directions you get with the camera are sketchy and not the best English. Overall a great value.",

The microphone is EXTREMELY sensitive, will pick up whispers, the battery has lasted me over 1 hour and 45 min of bike riding and the picture quality is true 1080. all in all I'm happy***** UPDATE - HAD TO LOWER SCORE DUE TO IT DYING AFTER FOUR USES!",

The product itself feels solid and durable. Even comes with a cloth to keep the lense clean. This camera is definately a steal for the price!",

The lens is built into the clip you hook onto your pocket. A fine idea, but the clip itself is separate from the body. So with very little pull--say by someone who wants to hurt you and not be filmed doing it--one can break off the clip. And then take the lens with it. I have great video of the person assaulting me, but now I can't use the camera anymore.",
