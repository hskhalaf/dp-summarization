      "text": "We were looking for a moderately price patio table after our glass tabletop broke into a thousand little pieces on our deck. We never wanted to deal with that again, so looked for a metal table with some prettiness to it. Happy with this table. Assembly was straight forward with simple instructions. Also the hardware came shrink wrapped to cardboard so you could see everything was there. They also give you one extra of the nuts, bolts, washers and black cover caps. There are little levelers on the legs in case your surface is a little wonky.",

Fortunately nothing fell out during shipping. The table went together easily, and all of the parts were well organized with easy to follow directions. The only problem was that the screw covers did not stay on the screws, so we just did without putting them on. The screws only show from underneath the table. This comfortably seats 4, but if you used small chairs it should seat 6.",

Also, I ordered it on a Wednesday afternoon & received it nicely boxed next to our garage door nestled close to the house on Friday!! Super fast shipping! Easy to assemble with clear instructions in 20 minutes. Very sturdy & beautiful. It matches the rest of our highly expensive wrought iron furniture, and this is very high quality looking bistro table that definitely measures up for the price.",

The open surface design allows moisture and tree droppings to fall through. I use a blower on the deck to keep things tidy. So much easier than my old glass topped table which required constant wiping. We use trays or place mats to create a solid surface when we eat. A great addition to the deck. It is just what I was looking for and I am well pleased. I recommend this table.",

Once unpacked the separate components are easy to move into position, and the table is quite simple to set up with basic tools. Its leveling feet provide good stability. The instructions are well illustrated, with all hardware carefully separated and blister packed on a separate card. My only quibble was that there is no lower umbrella support; the lower ring visible on the photo connects the leg supports but it does not have an inner circle to help support the umbrella shaft.",

It\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s just a simple mistake when even their shipping box labels it as a 48\u201d table. It appears they\u2019re simply marketing and selling a 46\u201d table as a 48\u201d table and they know it\u2019s only 46\u201d. Interestingly, they market it as a 46\u201d table on Houzz. Go figure.
