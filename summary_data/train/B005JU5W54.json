The other reviewers who complain about these blades need to replace their wiper arm springs which pull the wiper towards the windshield. If this spring is old there is not enough tension for the blade to be flush against the windshield. This causes vibration, sounds, and streaking. For me these wipers work perfect.",

These Bosch wipers are awesome. They are well built and are designed in a way that the spine is more flexible. The 28\" wiper lays perfectly against the windshield.

The answer: 6 years. After about 3 or 4 years, they didn't seem to work quite as well, but they were still as good as any other new blades I have tried. Finally, after 6 years, one of the two blades developed a tear. Although YMMV (your mileage may vary), that seems like pretty good longevity to me.",

Dramatic difference than other blades we have tried. Definitely worth the higher initial cost (amortized due to the longevity it's actually CHEAPER than buying the \"cheap\" blades).

The Honda brand mounts these replaced were all metal, these are plastic and the insert that attaches blade mount housing to wiper arm on vehicle is very thin plastic. The rubber blades are impressive, much wider surface against glass than factory originals. The installation procedure is nothing like Bosch video on YouTube but I finally got all the pieces to snap together. With the plastic construction, I doubt these arms will last more than one hot Texas summer.",

They most likely work pretty well everywhere else though. For the hot spots though, just stick with Rain X or something. At least they are more affordable and can be easier to work with (not that these are that bad to install).",
