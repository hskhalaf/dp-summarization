The flashlight was a good addition and was really happy with my purchase until it stopped charging. I\u2019ve only had the product for a month and a few days and it just stopped charging. I tried different wires and wall sockets and it won\u2019t charge. It had a good performance but I am very disappointed that it broke after just a month....so if that is how these are, I would not recommend getting this charger. Maybe look for other alternatives that have a guarantee longevity.",
