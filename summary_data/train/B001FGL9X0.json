She saw the pic of it and tried picking it up from the pic then crying cause she couldn\u2019t grab it. I would high recommenced this. I also worked at toys r us and they were a Great seller. That is where I bought her first one. Great great great. If a little one likes it is great",

She likes playing the with puppy now and sometimes used the pacifier when playing with the puppy ( she's 10 1/2 months currently). Update: At 12 months she finally got into playing with it and sucking on it, but it's not her favorite still.",

I am familiar with the pacifiers as I have purchased multiple Super Soothie pacifiers from Philips' Avent line (these are what WubbaNub uses to attach to the stuffed toy)... none of the Philips' pacifiers ever smelled that way. I also had a friend give me their baby's WubbaNub, which did not smell. I am concerned that the material used is not of a grade suitable for babies.",

The giraffe's neck makes it a little less stable than the animals with the normal necks. We have yet to lose one of these because they're very visible, and my son loves the soft animal to grasp. Such a great invention! I make sure to have one with us at all times. The weight of the animals make them stay in place more than traditional pacifiers. They are also to clean (machine washable) and air dry very quickly. Don't hesitate to buy this-your baby will love it!",

Just wish there were more animal choices and that these were a little bit easier to find in stores. The one downside is that they're a little hard to clean without getting the animal attached soaked, but that's such a small point that it doesn't take away from how wonderful these things are!",

He loves to hold, feel, and squeeze the puppy and as he grows and gets more interested in things around him he seems to like it even more.",

It helped him find his pacifier at night so we didn't have to go into his room and find it for him, and it works like a stuffed animal too, giving him comfort from the personality of the animal. If our second son, born recently, desires a pacifier as well, we'll be getting him a WubbaNub as well.",

It's been great not to have to worry as much about pacis falling on the floor. This one is really cute and one of our favorites. I guess if I had a complaint, I'd ask to have more \"beans\" or filling in them to make them a tab bit heavier.",
