This feeder, for some unknown reason, has never been touched by any critter. The other two are filled and emptied daily. The lid isn't any more difficult to open than the other two. Maybe it's because it's made of metal? I tried moving it to a different location, same results. It doesn't have a ledge for the beastie to stand or sit on like the other two, but I placed it so the tree branch acted as a ledge. Maybe a different type of food will do the trick.",

I note other people have had problems but I think training the squirrels that they had to come through the top by making it easy on them led to them quickly learning to open the lid.",

So they have to climb inside to eat - which means I can't fill it all the way, and because they eat inside it, it often looks full when it actually just has tons of shells and cast-offs from the food they've eaten already. It's held up well, but I will be purchasing a different style that includes a platform.",
