We've had them about a month and so far, so good, However, I do often wash them by hand because of other reviewers' complaints about the color coming off in the dishwasher. They look to me like the color is actually IN the base of the glass, not applied to the outside and subject to flaking off, but I'm just being cautious. UPDATE: We've now had these for nearly nine months and I've been washing them in the dishwasher with no problems. Very happy with them.",

      "title": "Pretty and fun to use",
      "text": "The glasses are really neat if you enjoy color, particularly with water, as the glass color gets refracted into the liquid. The color is contained inside the glass and does not scrape off, but one of the glass's color got disturbed, scraped in the manufacturing process, so it appears to be scratched off partially, as seen in the photo. I cannot scrape it off any further, and there is no wear after multiple dishwashings. So, I can conclude that the color is permanently imbedded. So far, we have had no breakage, but the glass rims are thin enough to be a risk. The bases are heavy and comfortable to hold. I would recommend these glasses.",

Also, know that is poured to the very top of the glass and not what you would normally pour in order to use it easily without spillage.That is my best advice. In addition to these being smaller than what we normally use for a glass like this, there is something about the way the colored glass was made that does not look very appealing. It's not saturated throughout the bottom and I think that affects the overall appearance of the glass. Look fairly sturdy but overall, not a fan.",
