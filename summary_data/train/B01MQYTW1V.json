Better than I imagined even after watching the Youtube reviews; I love it! I've got a 34\" monitor and a heavier table top. Even fully extended, there is no wobble. The ONLY thing I am really wanting that this doesn't have is the ability to control the height with Alexa/Smartthings/or IFTTT. I'm hoping someone is working on this. \"Alexa, set desk to Standing\" Edit: ApexDesk responded to an email I sent to them and they say they are already working on this. :-)",

Besides that mishap the table was very easy to assemble, and I wish the controller is a bit more responsive. You have to hold the button for a second for the motor to bring the table up or down. Aesthetically the table is very good looking, thankfully due to the handling and boxing during the shipping process. The table is wide enough for a 27 inch and a 24 inch monitor; although technically you can get a monitor mount and get a triple monitor setup.",

Fantastic customer service, great product - I waited to write my review to have some time for real experience. 4. I use this desk every day. It is very stable at all heights. 5. Speed is very good - it goes from a little over 47 inches tall to 28 inches in about 26 seconds (at highest speed setting). About the same going up.",

Unfortunately, the controller became defective after two days. It elevates .2 inches per click but I'm able to control it with my phone until I receive a new controller. Customer support was surprisingly responsive (I e-mailed them on Christmas). They state they'll send a new controller.",
