There's no point in buying one unless you can get access to the code and think the hardware is worthwhile.",

In the first month or so, the product had a couple of nice features: alerts (motion-sensing video clips) and \"Live View\" (see who's in the room). Now, neither of these two features works. They were supposed to work without Sentri's (expensive) subscription. So what one is left with is an attractive but very expensive wall clock. Sentri appears to only marginally exist as a company. They've posted that they are \"rethinking [their] corporate direction\", but as a practical matter you can expect to get little or no support. It's a shame. It's a nicely-designed physical product, but the software and the service are essentially non-functional.",

We get alerts everywhere and can also view the live feed whenever, wherever. The only thing I wish for is an update where you can speak through the device from my phone. The Sentri has a microphone and a speaker so I'm curious why it wasn't baked in initially. Either way I really like it and plan on buying another unit.",
