New design has a pin that prevents this from happening. Should have paid more attention to the specs for air movement when purchasing. This particular model is a low air-mover unless operated at high speed. Not a big deal since this is a quiet fan, but still annoying. Fan came with four 75w equivalent CFL bulbs. Really lights up the room. Fan installed by electrician so can't comment on ease of installation. Instructions looked easy enough to install, but probably does require 2 people if you are not skilled.",

I would prefer just a double switch (on and off), since we often let the fan run without the light being on (there's only one switch to control the total fan).",

My old fans were like that, but moved so much more air. I'm not sure why newer fans have a problem with this. After all, isn't the purpose of a ceiling fan to move air??

The blades are reversible for color preference. I would call the lighter side more of a\"gunstock oak\" color. And the reverse a dark espresso brown.
