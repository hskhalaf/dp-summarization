I'd have to constantly put my foot down and peddle right to correct it. For other reasons I just gave up and sent it back. I'm not sure what was up with that though",

The plastic wrap over the whole thing is not good either. It took a complete disassemble of the board to clear out the plastic.

It is no longer safe to ride it so i upgraded to a magneto board which is better for about 100$ more But i would definetly get another quest board later on if i need a spare board thats reliable and aforbadle :)",

      "text": "The bearings on this thing are very dry and need oil when you receive the board, so buy some oil, or just some new bearings along with the board. Personally, I would've enjoyed a drop-through board more because I'm a beginner and I think they look cooler. Also, the trucks will need to be tightened if you are a beginner and you will need to use a tool for that, so buy that as well.",

I did and don't regret it. Edit: many people including me noticed long cracks along the underside of the board. I realized it's only the bottom layer splitting so it's not much to worry about in my opinion although I understand it still does not look pretty.",

The wheel and trucks make the difference between most of these boards if you believe the reviews from other boards, and these are good.

Saw the high reviews for this board, took the plunge, and just took it out for its first ride. The board was shipped SOOOO quickly and very securely.

This classic Longboard will take you where you need to go in style. It's great for around town, getting to class or cruising along the boardwalk. Top quality components ensure maximum durability and optimal performance. Life is a Quest, enjoy the ride.\n\nAbout Our Company\n\nMade in Mars is a rethinking of what a board sports company is all about. Due to our \"alien\" company culture, we embraced the \"Made in Mars\" name. Looking around we saw a lot of companies in our Biz, many that were doing a good, and sometimes even a great job at making boards and trying to fit into the \"Action Sports lifestyle\". This was all great, but it just wasn't for us.\n\nWe design and make our own product, so we know what we are asking you to spend your money on. Next we wanted to offer the best of the tradition brands, and by working with some of the real pioneers of the Skateboard, Surf and Snow Board world, help reinvent them using today's best components, great fresh art and new technology. We also dreamed up a couple of brand new initiatives, because one size never fits all. We did all this, keeping better components and the highest quality. Trust us that isn\u2019t easy and definitely makes for some long days.",
