We had a very warm fall and these were worn just a handful of times before the sole separated from the boot. I contacted the seller to see if they would exchange and received a very curt/rude reply about it being past the 30 day return date. I have never had bad service with Amazon. This was absolutely the worst customer service ever. In my opinion \u201cTina\u201d did not do her job! Makes me wonder if these are knock offs because Bearpaw is usually a superior product.",

In fact it seems to me like she aims for snowbanks and puddles, as I imagine all of the little savages do. As with any type of boot like this, I did give them a generous coat of suede rated sealant spray prior to use. I would recommend that regardless, though I\u2019m not even sure how effective that stuff really is. I\u2019m also not exactly sure what kind of arch support expectations one would have in a boot like this, but they seem very comfortable.",

The children's sizes tend to run small, so we go up a size and buy thick, fun patterned tights and knee high socks.

The only \"problem\" is that they have so much cozy faux fur on the inside is that sometimes my daughter's feet get too hot (but that's not a bad problem to have in the Northeast).",

We wanted these to last through the winter. My husband bought and used the water repellent spray that the boot instructions recommend and made sure it was dry before she started wearing them. They keep her feet warm and don't make her feet sweat, like other boots. We're very pleased.",

I purchased these for my daughter in black and purple. She loves them as well. They do run small in the youth/girls size. My daughter is a size 12/13 in shoes depending on they run. I read previous reviews on these boots & I ordered a size 1 due to reviews stating they ran small for girls. While they fit perfectly I think we could've ordered a size 2 with room to go. Will order these again- We are wanting to get pink & possibly brown.",
