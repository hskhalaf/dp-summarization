Besides being THE best vacuum I've ever owned, Dyson has a really nice design and is easy to move around. It's better at reaching corners than all other vacuum cleaners I've owned and it doesn't give me as much of a backache. The canister and filter are easy to clean too.

The vacuum itself has powerful suction which is all I really care about... but whenever I use it, the ball squeaks constantly, and it's quite annoying. It makes me feel like I may have spent a lot of money on something very cheap and flimsy. When I pick up the vacuum, I feel the same way as well. It is lightweight, which is a plus, but the plastic also bends a bit, which is a bit concerning. The hose nozzle never stays locked into place either, I've found it poking out after lifting the vacuum. Not sure if the money is worth it, only time will tell.",

This thing is probably half the weight of my Hoover Wind Tunnel, and brings up amazing amounts of stuff from carpets I thought were clean. Outperforms any vacuum I've tried and does a fantastic job in this multiple-dog house. Actually sucks itself down onto the floor versus the Hoover just being heavy; the ability for it to steer around stuff and the awesome beater-bar performance makes this unbeatable. I will buy another if anything ever happens to this.",

(I think in an effort to make it lighter weight the plastic does not seem to be as sturdy). The plastic hose is a little warped as well (possible during shipping?) because I have to bend it slightly in order to get it to lock back into place after use. The cord is shorter than my previous Dyson and therefore, I can't reach all of the stairs without changing outlets. The suction is fantastic for carpets and rugs! I really like that you can turn the brush head off for bare floors.",

The wand is very stiff and awkward. It clogs easier than any vacumn I've had, sometimes because it sucks so hard one cannot stop an item from going in.
