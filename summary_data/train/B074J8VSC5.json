She works for a large jewelry chain and I think she\u2019s a qualified and discerning judge of quality in a cleaner. The cleaner works on everything from diamonds to ink the heads on your printer. She usually brings her jewelry to the store for cleaning, but now says she won\u2019t need to any longer. As with most uktrasonic cleaners like this, it\u2019s NOT FOR TANZANITE. We ruined a large and expensive stone doing this, so I thought it might be worth mentioning. It\u2019s not however a flaw in this product.",

Cleans up any oils from your face and gets rid of dirt at the nose pieces. Each piece of jewelry I have cleaned has come out shining and clean. I can see the cloudiness in the water for especially dirty pieces (rings get so dirty) so I know it is cleaning well. How it works, I can't tell you, but the vibrations and whatever it is doing is great.",
