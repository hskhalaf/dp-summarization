They all worked pretty well, especially the flash light and phone charger. The flash light is very bright and clear, which can make me see anything in the dark and people can notice me as well. I tried the hand cracking charger as well. It charged my phone up to 5% within in 6 mins. It's definitely an \"insurance\" for me when I need charge my phone in an emergency situation. I highly recommend this product!!!",

The Tungsten steel tip shattered the glass (safely) and the entire window fell out. It was easier to use on the driver side because I am right handed, it took two hits when I was in the passenger seat. However, both windows were successfully shattered and removed. It also makes short work of cutting a seat belt. Great tool!",
