Maybe I am being harsh but I read all these great reviews and was exciting because the sugar and carbs are low. There is a reason for this! Cause they taste like chewy cardboard!!

I have a subscription for Quest Bars that is sent monthly, but they are so popular at my house that everyone helps themselves and they are gobbled up fast. I bought this sampler set to taste other flavors. My favorites are Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough (chewy deliciousness), S'mores (campfire memories), Cookies and Cream (pass the milk, please), and White Chocolate Raspberry (nice clean taste on the palate). My least favorite thing about these bars? How fast they disappear! They are yummy...!",

I eat one on my commute home from work. Sometimes I have one as a mid afternoon snack. They are easy to throw in a bag and take anywhere. I will be bringing them along on vacation to have a healthy option while sitting in airports or on the plane. Yummy flavors, great nutrition, and no guilt. Love!",

    "description": "Flavor Name:America's VarietyQuest Nutrition's mission is to revolutionize food and make clean eating fun! Quest Bars were created from a simple idea: Food should taste as good as it is good for you. \n\n QUEST NUTRITION\nFounded in 2010, a small group of wellness enthusiasts gathered around a kitchen with a vision for a NEW kind of protein bar that they actually wanted to eat. They knew they weren\u2019t the only ones in need of a product that doesn\u2019t compromise. Others were looking for a way to cheat clean, and it wasn\u2019t out there. So Quest decided to make it. Not just for them, but for everyone who wants to eat better and enjoy every bite. \n\n ROLLING PINS AND HAND-HELD KNIVES\nAfter several months huddled around Quest Creator Shannon Penna, slowly but surely Quest was able to learn what works and what doesn\u2019t. Finally, they got to the point where the bars were delicious and nutritious enough to sell. Made with rolling pins and hand-held knives, Quest propelled forward by a clear goal to change lives. \n\n FLAVORS FOR EVERYONE \nWhat started out as a brand that had two flavors, Quest Nutrition how has over 20 unique flavors and bars that are made for everyone. Vanilla Almond Crunch and Peanut Butter Supreme have been around since the creation of Quest, with new flavors added in the years following to expand their already delicious flavors!",
