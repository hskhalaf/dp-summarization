      "text": "I ordered this for my 14\" Jet 1HP Bandsaw and while I was impressed with the cutting action and tracking for resawing, I don't think my saw is powerful enough for this blade. I actually acquired this saw with a generic 3/8\" blade with 6 tpi and found it actually cut quicker, but wandered horribly. I've since added the riser block for this saw and bought the larger Timber Wolf blade but in 1/2\" size with 4tpi and I think it is much more balanced for this saw. In my limited experience, I think larger motor saws should be able to handle this blade without issue... 1HP saws may do better with a narrower blade.",

If you are using riser blocks, I don't think a 14 inch saw has the structural strength to tension or the power to run this blade through anything substantial. It just smoked my delta. I will try replacing my drive belt and getting more tension on the blade because I see others have had good results, but that's my experience thus far.",

    "description": "Timber Wolf makes the world's only thin-kerf, low tension, silicon steel bandsaw blades that will outlast your old carbon steel blades by a mile! Your bandsaw will cut better and faster, with less wear on bearings, shafts and tires. Tooth angles and gullet symmetries, combined with a unique set pattern, create a blade that is everything a wood-cutting blade was meant to be. Blade has over 60% of the speed capabilities of a hook blade while giving you the great finish of a skip. The round design of the gullet eliminates any work hardening zones. Couple that with the special 6.5\u00b0 rake, 5-tooth set pattern, and .025\" thick thin-kerf blade and you have an awesome bandsaw blade!",
