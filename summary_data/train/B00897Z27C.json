Sometimes I'll wait 45 seconds for a load screen, then walk to a door to open it only to have it load again.... Also, when you die you lose every thing you had unless you can find your old zombie person before you due again. All in all its a fun game.",

      "text": "Silly title aside, Zombie U is one of the finest \"classic\" survival horror adventure games in recent years. I am shocked at the game's poor reception. Gamers and critic complain about horror games going away, and cry for the good old days of Resident Evil...yet when such title comes along, they complain about its archaic structure and sluggish gameplay. The thing is, if you like Fatal Frame, the original Resident Evil, Dino Crisis, or even the new Outlast, then Zombie U is for you. It's a true \"survival\" experience, even if the graphics aren't particularly impressive. Heck, this may be one of Ubisoft's best titles in years. A must for fans of survival horror!",

There is a good balance of cut scenes and story to actual game play. My only complaint is there was one particularly difficult boss battle (it involves cages) that had me cursing the game, but when I finally got through it successfully (after many failed attempts) I felt like king of the (zombie) world. This game is also currently so cheap that there's no reason not to take a chance on it.",

Go play Medal of Honor...This is reminiscent of the original Resident Evil style platforms and I think its great...Go Ubisoft!!!!",

It takes survival in zombie games to the next level with permadeath if you get caught in a bad spot with zombies. Careful thinking and good use of weapons are the key points of survival in this game. They even have a survival type mode where you can see how far you can get in the campaign before you die. Once you die, your save is automatically unable to be played again. Mainly for the hardcore fans, but everyone should give it a try at least once! It is so satisfying to make it far without dying!",

Slight con: I wish I could use the wiimote to point-n-shoot instead of the tablet -- it's easier for me to aim.

The gameplay is immersive bordering on realism. If you own a Wii-U, are an adult, and enjoy a thrilling challenge or fright, get this game.",
