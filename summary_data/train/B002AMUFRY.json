I was introduced to the Clarins line from my mum and was actually using the cleansing milk with gentian before switching to the correct type of cleanser with alpine herbs. DO your research about how to use this product. Apply to your hands, rub on your face in circular motions and suction with hands 5-7 times. My first wash with this cleanser I was overwhelmed by the scent but then looked at the ingredient list and realized how botanical it is. It's been about 2 months of use and my skin is noticeably softer with more bounce. Do yourself a favour and invest in this while you can.",
