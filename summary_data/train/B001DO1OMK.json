It cut through a 100+ year old oak with ease and went through pine even easier. The chain is not your typical chain found on most for home use saws. One feature I love is the decompression valve. When you don't use a saw regularly starting it is a pain. Hit that button and follow the procedure and it fires up in a couple/three pulls. I have used various saws over the years and this is the best I have ever used outside of a Stihl and at a much lower cost.",

My Husky 45 may be a lonely backup to this saw as it seems far advanced. It is miserly on gas and chain oil. It starts easily, cuts quickly and is easier to handle than my old 45.The Husky chains have also improved dramatically. In hindsight, I would have purchased the 460 Rancher for greater durability and even greater air filtration technology.",

The engine features Husqvarna's special X-Torq technology, which reduces emission levels by up to 60 percent and fuel consumption by up to 30 percent, so you'll be able to harness the power of a gas-powered chainsaw without having to worry about heavy pollutant output.\n\nDURABLE ENGINE BUILT FOR LONG LIFE\nThe 450's engine has been built to withstand years of use.

And the transparent fuel indicator makes it easy to check fuel level.\n\nOther features include an inertia activated chain brake that helps reduce the likelihood of injury due to kickback, distinct marks for better felling precision, and an air purge function that removes air from the carburetor and fuel system for easier starting. It's backed by a 2-year limited warranty.\n\nKEY SPECIFICATIONS\n * Power output: 3.2 HP \n * Cylinder displacement: 50.2 cc \n * Maximum power speed: 9600 RPM \n * Fuel tank volume: 0.95 pint (15.2 fluid ounces) \n * Oil pump type: Fixed flow \n * Chain speed at max power: 56.89 fts \n * Weight: 11.33 pounds \n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\nHusqvarna 450 chainsaw and manual\n\nHUSQVARNA: EXCEPTIONAL PRODUCTS FOR EXCEPTIONAL YARDS\nGreat yards demand equipment that is as dedicated and hardworking as you are.
