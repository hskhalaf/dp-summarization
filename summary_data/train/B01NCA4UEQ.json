I love the shoe and from day one the shoe has performed perfectly and is completely comfortable. I will be staying with New Balance (USA) made from now on.

Also, the curve seems tighter so that my little toes are getting crushed a bit more than than the earlier versions. I think V2 was a better shoe. BTW, I wear 11 6E (very wide).",
