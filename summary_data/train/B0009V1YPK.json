My muscle mass and water % also changed by about 1.5% during that time. It is my own fault that I did not check that this item is not returnable. Either splurge on the best quality Tanita model or just buy cheaper scales with a consistent weight.",

Now I measure everything every day and pay attention to the week averages. Very happy with this scale.",

Based on a little web research I settled on this scale for my current morning bad news machine. I'ts by far the most accurate and repeatable (digital) scale I've used so far, and I've compared it side by side with the professional scale in my gym to confirm that. I think the body fat measurement and % water retention are useless gimicks (like all such features) but for weight measurement alone, two thumbs up. Lets see if it last more than 12months (the average life of a digital scale in my experience).",

    "description": "Do you want to lose weight or improve your total health and fitness? Then a Tanita BF-679W Body Fat / Body Water Monitor is the right addition to your routine. A weight scale alone is not enough. This monitor calculates body fat and body water levels using bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA); sending a safe, low-level electrical signal through the body. The BF-679 does not include Athlete Mode.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nThe Tanita BF679W Duo Scale Plus Body Fat Monitor can monitor both your body fat and body water percentages.

Why You Should Monitor Body Water and Fat Percentage\nIf you're like most people, you're not drinking enough water. If you wait until you feel thirsty, your body is already suffering from the effects of mild dehydration. You continually lose water during the day through sweat, urine and breathing. The amount varies due to several reasons, including your physical activity level, illness, medications, poor nutrition, or even climatic conditions. Monitoring your body water percentage allows you to quickly compensate if your levels are low, allowing your body to function more efficiently. Having the right amount of water in your body will not only make you feel healthier, but you'll also reduce your risk of developing serious health problems in the longer term.\n\n High body fat levels can reduce your endurance and have been linked to heart disease cancer and diabetes. Tanita's body composition analyzers monitor your body fat and body water levels with Bioelectric Impedance Analysis, or BIA, the same advanced technology used by doctors. Foot pads send a low-level electrical signal. Then BIA measures the resistance to this signal as it travels through the body. \n\n The Tanita BF679W is calibrated for standard adults and children and stores data for 2 people and measures body fat in increments of 0.5 percentage points. This scale also features a guest mode, allowing you to use the unit without losing information already assigned to the personal keys. The scale's large, easy-to-read 2.25-inch, 2-line LCD shows weight and body fat simultaneously, and instantly compares these readings to healthy ranges based on the user's age and gender. Simply supply your gender, age, height and weight into the memory, step on the scale, and the monitor does the rest. The results are analyzed according to each user's information, and the result is the one of the most comprehensive at-home readings you can get.\n\n \nOperating on four AA batteries (included), the Tanita BF679W is intended for use by persons up to 300 pounds and is backed by Tanita's three-year warranty. \n\n \n\n\nBody fat percentages are important indicators of good health.
