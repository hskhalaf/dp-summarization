The control's are not cumbersome nor confusing. The camera is built specifically for people who learned to shoot using film. The nature of photography for me is getting artistic photos and archival purposes of art work. If you're looking for a camera that does it all, this is not for you. It's a a camera with a very modern sensor for people who like to shoot photos only. The sensor produces beautiful photos and that's it.",

At least 50% of my work involves low-light scenes and this camera performs well, even at 12,800 ISO.

Really, really wanted to like this one but it has too many cut corners in the design. Returned in frustration. Pros: lightweight, fast, and takes beautiful photos.
