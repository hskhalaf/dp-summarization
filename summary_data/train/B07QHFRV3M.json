It will not stay connected to WiFi, though none of our other devices have this problem. I have to completely shut it off and turn it on again to get it to connect. Gets hung up occasionally and will not finish loading an app. With occasional use (less than 2 hours a day) the battery needs rechargng every two to three days. Not at all the quality I expected from Asus.",

You can still throw a micro sd card in it to expand the storage to take care of that and a little more memory than 4gb...say 6 or 8gb would have been nice. Still, with the 4gb of memory it has it will run any app you install on it and it is really fast. Otherwise this tablet is GREAT!",
