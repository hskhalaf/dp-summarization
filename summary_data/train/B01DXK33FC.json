Thought they are louder, their noise is only noticeable under very quiet or silent conditions. -So far, I prefer the Lixada over the U'King. We'll see how they stand up over time...",

But one of them has a range of motion problem and won't turn on the x or y axis completely, putting it out of sync with the others and making it unusable as a moving head (which is why I bought these). I'm going to contact customer service and see if they actually help. Will update my review after that. UPDATE: Customer service never contacted me back after I emailed them. So I returned my original light that was faulty only to find the new one was even WORSE!",

I coupled them with an old Chauvet Obey 10 controller (a controller IS required, by the way, along with some DMX cables) and they work splendidly. You can pan, tilt, change colours, brightness and even strobe with these guys. I just needed them to augment my lighting here in the studio, so I'm not planning on using them live. But if one were so inclined they would do splendidly in a small live setting, and you can daisy-chain as many as your controller can handle. Peace!",
