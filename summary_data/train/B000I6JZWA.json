Chopping onions is a pure joy if you\u2019re used to chopping by hand. While the design seems primitive by today\u2019s desired electronic gadgetry, it performs very well with it simplistic design. It is strong and appears to be durable given the use it has endured thus far. Not sure how long it will last but even if it does eventually fail, it is inexpensive enough to easily replace.

So, I ended up buying Kuhn Rikon Swiss Pull Chop with my mother's suggestion. It does chopp really fast, yet it doesn't have a perfect dice shape. It saves so much of chopping time.

      "text": "I have been using the same brand for the past 7 years or so. Their plastic quality has decreased steadily and it is not at a point where every time I use it I feel like the plastic is going to break - it is cheap sounding and very brittle. I have to chop the veggies extra fine so that there is not much pressure on the device. Despite of that it takes a lot of force and I have no doubt that this will break soon. DO NOT BUY THIS! If the management of this company is reading this review, please know that your customers are seeing your cheap tactics to increase margins and profitability. Bad business practice!",

I loved it for few months because I like cooking everyday after going back from work and this made chopping veggies like carrots, capsicums, onions, tomatoes, etc quick and easy (now I have fewer cuts on my fingers :)). The reason I gave only 4 stars is that I felt the blades and the transperant bottom container were not strong enough. One of the blades in the smaller mesh was broken white chopping onions, this was about 8 months after I bought it. Nevertheless, I would recommend Vidalia chop wizard as it worked great for the price. But becareful while using it, do not put too much pressure on the cutter.",

The first one lasted for years, the blades stayed sharp, the measurements on the side extremely useful. I didn't see a need to switch to a different brand that only had so-so ratings.
