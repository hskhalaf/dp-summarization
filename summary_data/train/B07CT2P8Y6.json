Couldn\u2019t figure out how to lock in the back to make it stay up-took me a whole of pushing it up until it somehow did. The side pillows /hand rests are just there-they do not attach-therefore if you sit on the sofa they easily come off. Don\u2019t get that!",

The couch was delivered with a rip in the top which is pretty annoying but it's not large enough to make going thru the entire dismantle and return process. Its not super comfortable for every day use but it will probably only get used 2-3 times a year so it serves it's purpose.",
