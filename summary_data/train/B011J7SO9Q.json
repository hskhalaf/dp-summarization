I have been a long distance swimmer for >6 decades and finally, I'm over shaking me head and twisting my neck to clear my ears of pool water. I will miss though, the warm water draining from my ears that marked the last drop of pool water was gone. Speedo does it again;)",

I seem to get swimmers ear easily in my later years, and am not sure why. I purchased these earplugs to keep from losing my hearing when water gets into my ear canals, and sometimes it takes days before my hearing returns. Very irritating!",

The big different that I can see is the satellite dish-shaped element that creates a seal of sorts at the entry of your ear. I have long ear tubes and get clogged and waxy easily. These eliminate the issue.",

This is a complete life saver as water in my ears is extremely uncomfortable and does not come out easily. You do end up paying about $1 for shipping built into the price if you add it up plus account for about 90 cents state tax (in my case). Overall it's still great value and super convenient to be able to buy it here.",
