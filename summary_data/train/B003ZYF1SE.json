She is a approximately 25lb blue heeler/husky mix not a large dog at all and had no problem chewing right through this without any hesitation. I was picking up small tuffs of stuffing and the metallic plastic layer from my yard like it has blown up. Probably not safe for a dog to ingest. Maybe would work for a cat or an older more very mellow dog, but not for any chewers or more active dogs at all.",

I bought 2 K&H heated kitty houses (amazing by the way but they only give off 20 watts of heat and that's not enough when the temps drop below 20 degrees with heavy wind). So, I decided buying 2 warming mats to put inside the houses should do it. Well, the kitties love it and they are hardly ever not in their houses (only when it's breakfast or dinner time). Well worth the money and investment, very happy with the purchase!",

You'll save yourself about $13 and should be able to make a few of these types of blankets.",

In the past, when we have had to crate him during the day he would destroy what we put in there for him to lay on. This he has not and if he gets cold I've noticed he will leave his other mats around the house and go lay in his crate. If I take this mat out of the crate and put it on top of one of the other fluffy mats in the house he goes straight over and lays down. So a definite winner at a very reasonable price.",
