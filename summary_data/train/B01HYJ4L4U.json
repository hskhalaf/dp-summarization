Take a look sometime at the nutrition label for those tasty bars and you'll as shocked as I was. All I wanted was a convenient form of protein that I could consume on the go, or at home when I am not in the mood to make a whey protein shake, and this does the job. I'm not looking for a tasty snack, that's not what this is supposed to be. This is a nutrition supplement intended for those pursuing a health lifestyle and this product hits it out of the park.",

Once the flavor goes away they taste pretty bad, so I spat it out and threw the rest away. Based on other reviews, it looks like you have to drink water while chewing in order to dissolve the stuff.",

Although the low amount of net carbs (4g for the chocolate chip cookie dough variety), high fiber (around 13g per bar - wow!), and low sugar (only 2g, much lower than General Mills' Fiber One bars) are very appealing, these bars are far from being sweet enough. While the chips themselves are similar in taste to chocolate chips used for baking (i.e. bitter-sweet), the rest of the bar is not. The overall taste is good, but PowerBar could really improve the taste of the bar if they added a little more sweetener.",

The only thing good was the chocolate. The macros are hugely similar to the quest bar. Honestly I regretted not getting it instead but hey at least I know now.",
