Although the shoe is generally not recommended for heavy Olympic weightlifting, it presents a versatile alternative for functional fitness workouts. Comfortable and supportive, it will keep the foot covered for HIIT and moderate weightlifting.",

Makes a huge difference when doing a lot of jumping and left-right movements like in a circuits class. Wouldnt use for running as their is a lot of resistance coming from the soles which felt like you had to use more energy to push off every step. I am size 7.5 UK normally and size 7.5UK fits well and feels roomy at the toes.",
