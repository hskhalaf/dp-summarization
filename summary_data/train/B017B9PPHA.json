So far the chairs I bought for half of the cost of this chair have held up much better. Update - I contacted the product manufacture Westfield Outdoors and was told that Amazon and Koftech are not authorized dealers so my warranty is void.",

The locking mechanism is much easier to operate and the extra width adds to the comfort. Bottom line is it's worth the higher price. One possible negative is the XL does not have the built in side table. Just a clip on cup holder. I never used it so don't care personally. Highly recommended.",

      "text": "OMG! purchased this zero gravity lounger chair to sit on my porch and view the beautiful Colorado Mountains in comfort. This chair is so sturdy, solid and comfortable without the back pain of inexpensive camp chairs I have it in my family room. Zero gravity furniture is super expensive $2000 to $4000 for one lounger chair. Get the XL oversized padded version of this chair and you\u2019ll always sit and lounge in comfort. For me the absence of lower back pain was the number 1 priority. It is weighty if you are going to take it camping. It\u2019s not a chair you pick up and throw in the back of your SUV.",

It also has a locking mechanism to set the position you prefer, and a beverage holder which comes in handy!

None of this detracts from the quality and sturdiness of this otherwise very comfortable chair.",
