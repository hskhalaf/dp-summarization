Since it's a new purchase for me, so far the battery life seems to be decent. Night vision is pretty good too. But my favorite feature is the temperature sensor, I can never quite be sure of the right temperature in the nursery and how to appropriately dress the baby, so this is such a bonus!

The camera stopped working and wouldn\u2019t move left at all and worked intermittently when moving right. I reached out to customer service they got back to me immediately attempted to trouble shoot and replaced my unit when that didn\u2019t work! It was very fast and painless and they shipped my replacement out immediately! Very happy with their customer service!!!!!",

The battery issue where suddenly the battery seems to drain happened to me too. It seems if you drop or jostle the monitor, the battery loosens its connection inside. All I have to do is open up the battery compartment and push on the connection and the battery holds its charge. Glad I read other reviews and didn\u2019t just replace the battery. Infant Optics customer service has been amazing. Had an issue with the charge port and they sent a replacement with no hassle. Very responsive and helpful. I\u2019d buy it again.",

It suddenly stopped charging so I would leave it constantly on light charging and hoping the wire follows me around(which is pretty long enough). I came on here to read reviews if anyone is having same issue. I came across someone mentioning the infant optics customer service which I reached out to them. Omg they are super helpful and they respond fast with fast solution. They had it resolved just by asking me to follow simple instructions. I love efficient customer service like that! I am a happy customer and would refer. Thank you, infant optics!",

I initially thought about using a ring cam since we have other cams but that stops working often enough that I\u2019ll feel better with this dedicated unit. The fact that it paired immediately and didn\u2019t require my home WiFi added to that peace of mind.

If you're looking to see more of the room, I recommend buying the wide lenses right off the bat. I have 2 kids in a room and the regular lenses just cover the one kid. I love the battery life so far, outlasts almost every monitor I've ever tried. I also love the moving feature, and the picture is fantastic. I even love the beeping alert when you're out if range even though I would have thought the range would be better, I'm still really impressed with this monitor and I've only had it one day so far!",

      "title": "Sound went soon after purchase!",
      "text": "We purchased this March 7th, sound went within 2 weeks.. Initially we were very happy. However, the sound on it has basically gone. You can\u2019t hear anything really. Someone can stand 6\u201d from it and talk and it\u2019s barely audible. The sound is turned all the way up, so I\u2019m not certain what\u2019s going on, as it has not been moved or even adjusted or anything since we bought it (it\u2019s in one spot facing our toddler\u2019s bed). The picture is still ok, just no sound.",
