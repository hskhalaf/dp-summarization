I've had it a while, and tried and tried to find out if this one is defective, even factory resetting it twice. But again, it's just too slow to use. If they could fix the speed, the unit appears well designed and solid, the screen is beautiful, and it's very slim. Sad such a well built unit is soo slow.",
