      "text": "The build quality is excellent, beautiful band and thick stainless steel watch. But that is were the quality stops, The OS is very primitive and very difficult to read. The six buttons have to be pressed hard to function and sometimes appear unresponsive. It shows the battery life of the phone but still can not find the battery life for the watch. Forget about readable watch faces.The charger seems to work well and is simple to use. Its a shame, great quality watch but horrible interface. Pebble should have purchased Meta,",
