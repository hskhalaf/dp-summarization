With the addition of some hanging ab straps it is a pretty versatile setup. When we squat, we will go over 400 lbs and this cage has no problems with that weight. If you aren't going to bolt this to your floor, you will need to be careful how hard you re-rack your bar since it tends to lean forward when finishing squats. The cage came with some touch up paint, but we didn't bother using it. The original gray will wear off, but that is just normal wear and tear.",

Like other reviewers have said, the hole spacing is too much, it doesn't accommodate for the depth of each person's chest (too much play). As many folks have stated, the paint flakes off immediately, both on the frame and the bars. It'll do fine without contact, but otherwise, better get used to it. it doesn't bother me, however -- nature of the beast.",

Building it took ~1hour which was a little longer but I was going slowly making sure I do It right the first time.

Also, steel pegs allow weight to be stored at or above shoulder level until needed. Structure is easy to assemble in about 30 minutes. Rack can handle several hundred pounds. For the price, this is a good quality rack for most of us. The really heavy squatters may need something with greater capacity.",

Also, the Lat Pull Down attachment has friction due to its design, on both the to and fro action. :( Not a total detractor from using it, but if you like smooth working attachments, this would not be for you.

Only two negative observations, that really do not detract much from the product: Instructions are not incredibly clear in the choice of screw size at each step of assembly, and the rack could ship with more washers (you can only one per screw, but two would be better).",

The pulley attachment gives you quite a few nice options, and there's several nice little pieces you can buy to store your weights (this also gives it some weight to keep it down).
