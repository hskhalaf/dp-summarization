I don't play latest games, and if I did wouldn't do it on a tab. Its the obvious step up from \u00a3100 tabs like Amazon Fire, and those not wanting to spend \u00a3300+ on Apple or Samsung offerings. Its 16:9 screen is perfect for video, movies, books, net browsing ... unlike the silly square aspect ratios of its Samsung and Apple rivals.",

The hardware is beautifully designed and crafted, the screen is excellent and so is the sound quality. For my purposes though the irremovable bloatware on this device damages the usability of Android to the point where I would never use it. To find that a Facebook app cannot be removed because it is required by the system was for me the last straw. Sadly, after being an Amazon customer since the beginning, this has become the first product that I've had to return, luckily the process seems simple enough.",

I use this tablet when away from home as quite often the 10 inch tablets don't fit into hotel safes, whereas the smaller ones do. I'm quite happy buying an Huawei tablet as we already have two Honor (Huawei) phones which we're very pleased with. It looks well made, has a clear and sharp screen and works quickly, so absolutely fine there. The sound from the speakers is exceptional and I would say is a lot better than other more expensive tablets. No complaints, a very good unit, especially for the price.",

It has a super fast processor, with inbuilt 'Tablet Manager', which easily allows you clean up the crud of temporary files, cache & to free up memory, to keep the Tablet running smoothly. The best bit is the battery life, which lasts more than twice as long as my previous Samsung Tablet, even when it was new. I can highly recommend this Tablet, and is good value for money! I don't care if the Chinese have the potential to spy on me as I doubt they would be interested in my toilet habits, or dining preferences!!!! Lol",

The fingerprint reader is fast and the other buttons work well. I've only used it for general browsing, email, video streaming, kindle reading and so on so I can't comment on gaming performance.

      "text": "Very nice tablet - the only downside is that the version of Android installed here does *not* permit multiple user profiles. We've installed Android families to control our 8yo's usage, but we cannot have an adult login (which we need to allow him occasional access to youtube).... and we didn't want to give him an adult login. Very nice tablet otherwise, the screen is excellent.",
