      "text": "Had to replace the battery charger for my modified 2005 EZ Go TXT golf cart. The old charger was probably 20 years old and weighed a ton. Took a few days to get this replacement, but I'm satisfied with the wait since this is a much, much lighter unit and easier to move around my garage. Charged the cart in a couple of hours, so now we're back on the neighborhood roads. Hope this lasts as long as the old charger.",

It remained flashing red, low charge for the entire 8 hours and never went to green. So my unit is either defective or incredibly slow. I cannot give it more than 1 star like all of the other reviewers. I really wanted to love it...I needed it badly as my older charger recently died. Sadly, I am returning.",

Supposedly you can leave it plugged in to the golf cart at all times, but I'm almost afraid to try that as the batteries are new and I don't want to push my luck.
