      "text": "I purchased this unit months ago to replace my old one. Ironically I did not have to use it until today. Took it out of box. Hooked it up (correctly) pushed charge and about 30 seconds later it started to smoke. Turned off and unhooked. Return date passed in Feb but is there any chance I might be able to return it for another unit??? Thank You cheers John",
