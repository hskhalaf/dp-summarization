Only one little issue -- top won't stay open on its own, Coleman should add a folding hinge that locks in place on one side to prop it up. Otherwise, great product.",

Within 24 hours of driving the ice was almost all gone, and I\u2019d only opened the cooler maybe three times to grab a drink. The second time I grabbed the lifting handles one of them broke off. No, I wasn\u2019t abusing it in any way. Overall, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this nor would I buy it again. Over priced and under performing, in my opinion.",

      "text": "I did a ton of research before buying this cooler. First and most importantly, this cooler kept my food cold for days. I was camping for 4 days and there was ice still unmelted after we got back! Secondly, this cooler is made really well. The top fits super tightly which is one of the reasons things stay cool. Also the multiple handles make it easy to carry and move around. It\u2019s the perfect size. Not too big and not too small. I can\u2019t say enough how great this cooler is and what a value it is. I considered briefly buying a Yeti but am so glad I didn\u2019t have to.",

There was a very minimal amount of water at the end of the 5 days and everything stayed really cold despite sitting in the direct sun most of the trip. We did put a light blanket over the cooler in hopes of keeping ice from melting but it was not heavy enough to make much difference. Very impressed with the this item.",
