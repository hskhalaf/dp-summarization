The bottles were all damaged although we adhered to the guidance found in the instructions. This did not happen with any of the other Medela bottles we purchased previously on Amazon.

I have had 2 friends have their diaper bags tip over, and the milk spills in the nipple cover cap because they don\u2019t come with a storage cap for the milk that\u2019s actually in the bottle. I love the storage caps that come with the Medela bottles not only because they save from a mess, but also make it easier to shake up the breast milk or formula before ready to put the nipple cap on.",
