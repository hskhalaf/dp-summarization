With one set of six drawers, the open side of the bed can be pushed against the wall or used for storage baskets/shoes/laundry...if it pushed against the wall, it can still be accessed by a door in the footboard and makes for a good hiding place. Also purchased the daybed style. Highly recommend. Assembly is easy for a beginner- just need help lifting some parts. But the bookcase and drawers are pre-assembled. My kids helped and we did two beds in two hours. Photo is with bunk mattress, otherwise mattress would be twice as high. The bookshelves are adjustable and include a hole for cords to trail out the back of the headboard.",
