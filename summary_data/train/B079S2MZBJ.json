It's better constructed than the others and the ability to angle the whiteboard is something I didn't think I'd care about, but I really like it. It enables me to write on the bottom of the board by tilting it up, and I don't have to hold it while in that position like other \"clip and hold\" boards with just a flip option. Thanks.",

I put off buying a whiteboard because they're expensive and tend to be hit-or-miss quality, but this one is sturdy and professional-quality, with finish caps for fasteners, locking wheels, etc. The whiteboard surface feels like it will last and won't be stained easily. The marker tray could be a bit more rigid or reinforced or attached differently (it's affixed with 3 machine screws, but this is a long, thin and flat piece that might be subject to bending if someone is tempted to lean on the tray), but it looks very good and is obviously high quality. No missing pieces. Very satisfied.",

We were looking for something that would last a long time so those reviews made us keep looking and we stumbled across this one. Not only was it comparatively priced to the other ones that people didn't like but it comes with so many extra accessories - grid tape, magnet push pins, dry/erase sponge and even a ruler. We are very happy with this purchase.",

Eventually I had to remove all the wheels since two parts of the frame that they screw into bent.

One hole was drilled too large for the screw to catch; one hole was too small for the screw to be tightened. All of these culminate to a compromise in the final sturdiness and integrity of the product. All very avoidable flaws with the proper manufacturing. The screw caps do not appear to fit over the screws. Very disappointed with the quality of the manufacturing. Would not purchase again. The pros are the white board itself seems to be in good qualities, the casters work well without any issues of moving the board around.",
