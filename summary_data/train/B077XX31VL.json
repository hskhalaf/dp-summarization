The touchpad wasn\u2019t perfect, and the battery didn\u2019t last very long, but I had absolutely no problems and would have given it 4-5 stars, until the damn automatic dell update. Now I log in and the restart screen pops up freezing everything until it restarts and repeats the process, over and over... After reading the reviews, most seem to be within a few months of purchasing. Are these things just built to not last? Not sure if it\u2019s an isolated problem or Dell, but it\u2019s unacceptable regardless. Be cautious before purchasing as it\u2019s going to be a pain trying to get repaired/replaced",

In the last two months, the keyboard malfunctioned (various keys simply do not work), the laptop simply shut down and would not restart, and now again various keys are not working. Dell has \"fixed\" each problem without cost to me, but it takes about 10 days to two weeks between malfunction, call customer service, receiving a shipping box from Dell, and then waiting for its return from the regional service center. When it is not broken, it is fast, screen is bright and does what I need. But 30 plus days out for repairs in 9 months is unacceptable. Will not purchase a Dell again",

It`s my first and the last dell product. Many \"thanks\" to both dell and this seller for the troubles I haven`t expected. In comparison with Lenovo Yoga 910 I bought a month earlier, this item is rather f piece of shit than a nootebook.",
