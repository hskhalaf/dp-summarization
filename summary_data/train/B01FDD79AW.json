      "text": "I like this lamp so much I ordered the desktop version. First, concerns about brightness were totally dispensed when I first turned it on. The brightest setting is enough to do surgery by. The touch control works flawlessly and perhaps I won't have to deal with switch failure down the road. Amazingly the clamp is metal, not plastic. Measured watt usage and got 2-5-10 watts with each of the three settings. Quality of materials and build are self evident. The neck will not rotate much, but bends nicely. The only improvement might be to make the head itself able to rotate from the neck for superior positioning. The diffuser and color temperature are spot on. Excellent product.",

      "text": "A very nice quality lamp that while not particularly bright, is sufficient to provide good illumination of the immediate work area surrounding my keyboard and desktop. I suspect I'd favor the brighter 11W version with adjustable color temperature but went with this 9W version to save a few dollars, given I already have a brighter desk lamp available should I need it. The clamp is indeed strong enough to support the light panel with virtually any placement, and is a great alternative to the larger \"engineers' light\" with a screw-down clamp. .Color temperature is unimportant for me as long as a daylight temperature lamp is available, which is another reason I chose this lamp.",

The dimming feature would be useful if it was being used as a reading light. It's a clip light, so you need to have something to clip it to where you want to use it. Only have a week of use on it, so can't comment on durability but the construction seems good.",

I bought it to use while I paint and it works well other than having to reclamp it anytime I move the light around or else it will fall over.

Easily positioned without disturbing clamp and stays in place the first time. Looks great (except for the clamp, but hey, it's a clamp). I got it for $25 and find it well worth it. Might hesitate at $60. Improvements? Maybe a very, very low setting to use as a night light? That's outside its purpose but it's so good I want to multi task it.",

After all, that is how every other touch lamp I've used works. The press and hold is annoying because you have to press so long. Other than that, it is a great lamp.

Bought it for my wife as a reading light to use in bed, and even on the lowest setting, it's so bright that it keeps me awake. So, I bought a different reading light and brought this it into my shop. That's where I found out that it won't stay in place with that clamp. The head and the gooseneck seem to be too heavy to hold it in place and it's always falling over. Buy a different light.",

The light is diffuse enough to not project any hard shadows that obscure tiny details in small projects. Also good for snapping photos of documents. The brightest setting is brighter than necessary for most tasks, so that's good. The tiniest complaint is that holding the touch sensor to turn it off takes about a half-second longer than you'd expect, so you just start wondering whether you've touched it in the right place when it turns off.",
