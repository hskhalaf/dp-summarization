It caused my scalp to become super red, irritated, and itchy and then also caused my hair to fall and thin out, leaving huge bald spots in certain sections of my head. This product is NOT WORTH IT. Especially if you have sensitive skin or scalp. I have spent MONTHS trying to get my hair back to where it once was and talked with my hair stylist who said she knows multiple people who have had reactions to this same product. DO NOT BUY.",

That said, if you use grocery store product lines, this is the addition you\u2019ll need weekly to keep your hair care routine spot on. Those products tend to be high in wax which is what gives that appearance of shine. This will strip that wax out, so use extra conditioner as to avoid tangling.",

I have been using once a week and following with a fortifying conditioner - my hair does feel lighter after. I would highly recommend using a conditioner afterwards or I think your hair would be completely tangled and dry. Overall, it works for lifting residue.

My shampoo and conditioner have also worked better since then. I only use it once a week.",
