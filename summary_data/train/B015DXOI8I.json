So here is my story, I blew sand back in my pool from my filter by mistake, it has been in there for a year because it just wouldn\u2019t come out, it was a significant amount also. Anyways, I charged this up and decided to give it a go not expecting much. This has 2 attachments , use the one that looks more like a broom and it works amazingly. It actually picked up all of the sand and every other tiny thing on the bottom of my pool.",

I wanted something that didn't need to be plugged in or require that we disconnect the filter in order to vacuum. This Intex rechargeable vacuum fits the bill perfectly. It works for about 40 minutes between charges, which means we can clean our small pool 5-6 times before having to charge it. It's easy to clean; just open the dirt cup and dump. So far, it's sucking up everything that the desert throws at it, from sand to beetles.",

For 4 years I drug the pool vacuum hose out, inserted into the scupper, vacuumed and subsequently shut down the pool motor, clean the pre-screen and cartridge filter, all of which took about 2 hours.

It IS best to stop periodically and empty the filter (saves battery life and better for the motor) but that is super easy. I compared this one to another highly rated vacuum but the number of 5 stars was higher on this one. Buy it, buy it, BUY IT, you won't regret it.",

So in one cleaning of my 15\u2019 round pool I have to empty the bag about 7 times which I find pretty inconvenient. It does pickup well though, Ilike the rechargeable battery, and the telescoping rod is easy to use.",

I live that I dnt have to worry about that but also that it actually sucks up the small particles also. This was definitely a good investment.",

We\u2019re now on our 3rd summer with this little vacuum. Still does a great job. Battery and charger still work fine.
