The motor was purring along, but it would not engage the mixing blades. Returned and will not try another. It's great that the lower half disconnects for easy cleanup (no worries about getting the electrical bits wet), but the design and/or materials used are bad.

      "text": "For the $10 premium over some cheaper blenders on amazon this is great. Makes mayo perfectly and everything else in between. Just follow the \"break\" rule (blend for a minute, relax for 30 seconds) and this should last a long time. Leave blenders for smoothies and crushing. And leave food processors for chopping. Other than that, the immersion does it all",

That's what I thought. I got this for the whisk, on a whim. Whisk on a whim. I use both interchangably to make basically everything and anything, and it works like magic. I love it! Love love love it, don't know how I lived without a stick blender. This one is very good, though I can't really compare to other brands or kinds, because this is my first, ever.",
