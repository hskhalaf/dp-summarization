The keyboard dock won't charge anymore, which is a real bear. I have to remove it from the keyboard to charge, and the micro-usb on the side fits my OTG cable so poorly, that regular usb devices are pretty much out of the question while not docked. What a waste of money this has been! And the customer support has been awful. Really awful. Acer'd give Verizon a run for it's money as the worst customer service of all!",

Windows 8 takes a little getting used to but once you go through their tutorials which may take 15-25 minutes you pretty much know how to use Windows 8. I was debating between this one and another tablet, this one came with a keyboard so I went with it and it was a good price. I really wanted a Microsoft Surface but they were just too expensive, so I decided to get this one. I use it mainly for emails, browsing the web, and watching some things online. I highly recommend getting the 64gb version because Windows 8 eats up about 20gigs of space.",
