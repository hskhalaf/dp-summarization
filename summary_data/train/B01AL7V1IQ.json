    "description": "Tell pesky parasites to \u2018bug off\u2019 with the Hartz UltraGuard Plus Orange Reflective Flea & Tick Collar for Dogs & Puppies. This bright orange collar kills and repels both fleas and ticks on pups with necks up to 22 inches for 7 months, and also prevents flea eggs from hatching for over half the year - stopping the flea life cycle and inhibiting reinfestation. The water resistant design remains effective even after getting caught in the rain. Additionally, the Reflect-X Shield reflects direct light for up to 300 feet for an added dimension of nighttime safety. For continuous flea and tick protection from head to tail, replace the collar every 7 months. For use on puppies 12 weeks of age and older. Directions: Remove collar from package, unroll and stretch to activate insecticide generator. Do not use on puppies under 12 weeks of age. Do not unroll collar until ready to use. Place the collar around the dog\u2019s neck, adjust for proper fit and buckle in place. The collar must be worn loosely to allow for growth of the dog and to permit the collar to move about the neck. Generally, a properly fitted collar is one that, when fastened, will snugly slide over the dog\u2019s head. Leave 2 or 3 inches on the collar for extra adjustment and cut off and dispose of the extra length. Consult a veterinarian before using this product on debilitated, aged or medicated pets. Sensitivity may occur after using any pesticide product for pets. Some animals may become irritated by the collar if it is applied too tightly. If this occurs, loosen the collar. If irritation continues, remove the collar and bathe your dog with mild soap and rinse with large amount of water. If signs continue, consult a veterinarian immediately. Do not use this product on dogs simultaneously or within 30 days before or after treatment of other flea and tick products. However, flea and tick collars may be replaced immediately.",
