The water resistant cover is conveniently stored in the bottom also couple as a hiding place for small items and it also has a secret pocket at the bottom of the inside strap. Storage is sufficient as i have camera, flash, led lights, extra batteries and storage media and still cant fill the bag. For the price this bag looks good. If i find issues i will update.",

Plenty of additional little pockets to hold spare battery, sd card, etc. I can't figure out how to configure the dividers that come with it to keep spare lens from rubbing against camera body, seems like a velcro strip is missing, so I keep the spare lens in a small padded bag inside this one. This bag is better than the big bulky bag that came with my camera, but could use a few small design tweeks. Overall, however, happy with bag.",

In addition you can swing the bag to the front so you don't have to take the bag off your shoulder in order to remove items from it. I highly recommend this bag.",

This bag simply had too many compartments. Seems hard for designers to resist the temptation to add another zipper and pocket. This one had pockets everywhere. It was hard to remember which pocket contained which item so I was always fumbling with zippers.",

The padding on this bag is thick and there are all kinds of small pockets to carry memory cards, cables and batteries. The sewing was done well. The zippers feel slightly more robust on the Altura but these on the Qipi function fine. Interestingly, the lining of both bags is purple. The Altura is a satin-like material while Qipi is a flannel, like fabric typically used in pajamas. I really like the functionality and compact size of a sling bag and this one can easily accommodate an impressive amount of gear.",

Easy to carry light on the back and well designed, it takes a while to get used to the compartments when deploying the camera for an impromptu shot, but I admit that I am a novice at this so far. For a seasoned photographer and trekker, it should be an essential addition to the experience.",

When wearing the bag as designed theres a strap that goes over your chest and an additional strap the clips in under the ribcage. This means if your a woman it clips under one of your boobs. If youre anything above a b cup its gonna look semi inappropriate. Without using the strap that goes under your boob the bag doesn't sit securely as cross body camera bag. bag itself is great quality though. loved all the separate compartments.",

The purple interior is very vibrant and pretty. Cons: it's smaller than I had expected. The largest pocket isn't large enough for my dslr and lens. I have to take the lens off first. The strap for wearing the bag across your chest gets confusing to wear sometimes and it is difficult to swing the bad around to access the storage, line I had wanted. I wish I could return the item and spend a little more money for something I really wanted.",
