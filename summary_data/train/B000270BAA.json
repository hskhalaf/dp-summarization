      "text": "I bought this gauge for my husband to use in his rose garden. This summer has been hot and dry, and it's been hard to know if the plants were getting enough moisture. We're halfway between the 2 airports giving \"official\" rainfall totals and their numbers usually have no relation to what's happened our area. The gauge is easy to read from inside the kitchen door, and looks like an attractive garden sculpture. It also helped us to know how long to set sprinklers in the rest of the yard to get the required moisture.",

Maybe there is a product that could replace only the foam, but normal Styrofoam or rubber won't do the trick. If you look at my review of the replacement tube available, you will see that it is not a guaranteed fit... But love the rain gauge. Easy to see from inside window - required 10 feet from any structure. Still looks good after patina develops on the brass. Very sturdy and fits easily into a large potted plant on patio..,",
