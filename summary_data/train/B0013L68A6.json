I can verbally count my tempo out better then this can measure, and the speed indicator is all over the map giving random numbers anywhere between 50MPH and 80MPH (7 iron) for identical swings. I set it up exactly as recommended in the owners manual and even try other variations to try and get it to perform accurately. It is totally worthless for its intended purpose. Can't figure out all the positive reviews. Maybe they can market it as a random number generator.",

Next item would be launch monitor ( cost a lot more). You can, if you know how to swing a golf club, learn in less than an 30 min how to speed up the club head even without hitting a golf ball. Works even better when hitting golfballs. You can then see the result of club head speed and effortless swing....",
