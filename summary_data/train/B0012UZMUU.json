    "title": "Sony Cybershot DSCW150 8.1MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom with Super Steady Shot (Silver)",
    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n Take stunning shots in a variety of conditions. This 8.1-megapixel Cyber-shot digital camera features an Intelligent Scene mode which automatically selects the right settings for your environment. Smile Shutter technology is also included, letting you instantly capture smiles the moment they happen. A 2.7-inch LCD, Carl Zeiss 5x optical zoom lens and Sony's Double Anti-Blur solution are also there for crisp, clear images and tight zooms. All this combined with an attractive body make the W150 an excellent choice for capturing the moment no matter where you are. \n\nCyber-shot W150 Highlights \n\n8.1-megapixel Super HAD CCD\nMore megapixels give you more detail and definition when you make big prints or crop in tight on your subject. The advanced Sony Super HAD (Hole Accumulated Diode) CCD design allows more light to pass to each pixel, increasing sensitivity and reducing noise. \n\nCarl Zeiss 5x Optical Zoom Lens\n5x optical zoom gives you the power to get even closer to the action -- a real benefit for distant landscape views and dramatic portraits. \n\nWide-Angle Lens\nWide-angle (30mm-150mm) lens captures more of the scene. \n\n2.7-inch Clear Photo LCD Display\nA large, bright 2.7-inch Clear Photo LCD (230K) display includes an anti-reflective coating that provides for excellent visibility to help you compose, view, and share photos with superb clarity and color reproduction, even in bright sunlight. \n\nFace Detection\nFace Detection technology automatically controls flash, focus, exposure, and white balance to help reveal faces in shadows, make skin tones look more natural, reduce red-eye, and eliminates harsh facial glare. \n\nSmile Shutter Mode\nSmile Shutter technology captures smiles the moment they happen. The mode can be set to capture when your subject laughs, smiles or even grins, and like Face Detection Smile Shutter is able to differentiate between children and adults to set priority. \n\nSony Double Anti-Blur Solution\nThe combination of Super SteadyShot optical image stabilization and high ISO sensitivity helps compensate for shaky hands, minimizes blur, and allow flash-free shooting to preserve the mood. \n\nSuper SteadyShot Optical Image Stabilization\nSuper SteadyShot Image Stabilization compensates for shaky hands and minimizes blur with a built-in gyro sensor that detects movement and sends correcting signals to a stabilization lens -- so theres no need to crop in on your shot to reduce blur. \n\nHigh Sensitivity (ISO 3200) Mode\nWith high sensitivity of ISO 3200, you can shoot effectively in low light without flash to preserve the mood, while the Sony Clear RAW Noise Reduction system helps suppress the color noise that can degrade low-light shots. \n\nIntelligent Scene Recognition Mode\nIntelligent Scene Recognition mode automatically detects 5 different types of scenes and selects the appropriate camera setting: Backlight, Backlight Portrait, Twilight, Twilight Portrait, Twilight using a Tripod. Intelligent Scene Recognition has two different modes, advanced and auto. In Advanced mode, if the camera detects the particular scene, it will take one more picture. In Auto mode takes a single shot, arbitrarily deciding on the proper setting. \n\nDynamic Range Optimization Standard & Plus\nPowered by the exclusive Sony BIONZ high-speed processing engine, Dynamic Range Optimization preserves image data in bright highlights and reveals more detail in shadows or backlit areas -- for great results even in difficult lighting conditions. New DRO Plus mode enhances optimization, analyzing each region of an image and performing additional image processing. \n\nConvenient Photo Modes\nTo adjust quickly for specific shooting situations, you can choose from several convenient photo modes, including Auto, Program Auto, and Scene Selections such as Twilight, Twilight Portrait, Fireworks, Smile Shutter, Underwater, Landscape, Soft Snap, Snow, High Sensitivity, and Beach environments. \n\nMPEG Movie VX Fine Mode\nCapture VGA (640 x 480) audio/video clips at a high frame rate (up to 30 frames per second). The maximum length of time you can shoot continuously is about 10 minutes. \n\nAutomatic Macro Shooting\nStandard Auto Focus now covers the macro focus range, eliminating the need to manually change focus modes for close-up photography. The Macro mode has not been eliminated, and enabling it accelerates Auto Focus when shooting at point-blank range. \n\n9-Point Auto Focus\nBecause an off-center subject can make your shot more interesting, a 9-point auto focus measures auto-focus at 9 precision points instead of 5 -- giving you greater creative freedom to compose your image. \n\nSmart Zoom Feature\nThe Sony Smart Zoom feature intelligently \"crops into\" the central portion of interest in your photo, helping avoid the image degradation of other digital zooms. \n\nBurst Mode\nBurst Mode You can fire off up to one hundred (100) shots at approx.0.62 second intervals (at any resolution: VGA to full resolution mode) -- a great way to capture a childs first steps or a pets best tricks. \n\nSimple Setup Controls\nA quick press of the Home button opens your user-friendly graphical interface -- and you can select functions by simply moving a cursor vertically or horizontally to the appropriate icon. Function names and the on-screen Function Guide display make it easier to learn camera setup operations. \n\nEasy Shooting Mode\nA simplified camera environment especially attractive to beginners or digital camera users who want to keep things simple, Easy Shooting provides easy-to-read, on-screen instructions and limits the number of camera settings to help prevent misuse of the camera while still providing excellent results. \n\nFunction Guide\nThis beginner-friendly function helps manage various functions and settings by displaying the description of chosen functions or settings on the LCD screen. The Function Guide can also be switched off. \n\nOptical Viewfinder\nIn addition to the LCD display, a built-in optical viewfinder lets you compose your photos in traditional rangefinder camera style, and also helps save battery power by turning off your LCD display. \n\n15MB Internal Memory\nEven if you forget your flash memory card, you can get the shot because 15 MB internal memory lets you capture a limited number of shots with in-camera convenience, then easily transfer your shots to a PC or optional Memory Stick Duo media. \n\nMemory Stick Duo Media Convenience\nA built-in slot accepts optional Memory Stick Duo media or Memory Stick PRO Duo media -- the compact, high-capacity storage media that make it easily to upload photos to your PC and are compatible with millions of devices worldwide. \n\nStamina Battery Power\nProvides extended battery life and shooting capacity when using a fully charged Lithium Ion battery-- enough to cover a long weekend or a whole vacation. \n\nEasy Image Management\nTo help you find the right image among many, Date View Mode and Favorites Mode have been added to the standard Folder View. Date View Mode displays a calendar view, while Favorites Mode shows only user-selected images. Furthermore, you can filter photos by face types such as portrait, child, baby, and smile. \n\nHDTV Compatibility\nHigh-resolution images can be enjoyed in all their beauty simply by connecting the camera directly to a Sony BRAVIA HDTV or other compatible HDTV. This provides an excellent alternative to viewing photos as prints or on a computer monitor, and is ideal for users who want to share photos in the comfort of their living room. Optional HD solutions include a Cyber-shot cradle/charger with component cable output, or component cable directly to your HDTV. \n\n\"PhotoTV HD\"\nPhotoTV HD compatibility allows the camera to be connected to a PhotoTV HD-capable Sony BRAVIA HDTV via the optional HD output adaptor, for highly detailed, high-definition color images displayed in unprecedented realism and full HD quality. \n\n16:9 High-Resolution Mode\nIn addition to the standard 2-megapixel size, the convenient 16:9 aspect ratio shooting mode for HDTV display can now be shot in 7-megapixels, making it possible to obtain beautiful, high-definition prints with the same aspect ratio as HDTV. \n\nWide Zoom Display\nTo use the entire image area of the compatible HDTV3 screens, Wide Zoom automatically expands standard 4:3 and 3:2 images to 16:9. \n\nPhoto Music\nExpanding the HD Slide Show with Music feature, PHOTOMUSIC combines images with music to produce fun and entertaining slide shows. The five standard visual effects (Simple, Basic, Nostalgic, Active and Stylish) have been supplemented with Face1: Basic, Face2: Nostalgic and Face3: Stylish for a total of eight effects. Additionally, the number of music tracks stored in the camera memory has been doubled from four to eight, and music playback time has been extended from three to five minutes per track. More personalized slide shows are also possible by transferring music from a PC to the camera. \n\nIn-Camera Retouching\nAdd creative effects to photos after you shoot using any of 10 retouching functions, including: Trimming, Red-Eye Correction, Soft Focus filter, Unsharp Masking, Cross filter, Partial Color filter, Fish-eye filter, Retro, Radial Blur and Happy Face. The Happy Face effect uses photo retouching to put a smile on faces, with smile levels adjustable from 1 to 5. \n\nIn-Camera Red-Eye Correction\nIrritating \"glowing eyes\" can ruin even the most creative photos, but in-camera red eye correction corrects your photos at the touch of a button to reduce lingering red-eye effect that other systems might miss. \n\nMulti-Resizing Function\nResize your photos in-camera for virtually any purpose! Any size picture images can be resized to widescreen 16:9 and 2 MP resolution for display on an HDTV. Conversely, high resolution, widescreen 16:9 images or any size picture can be resized to 4:3 size with VGA (640 x 480) resolution -- perfect for sharing with friends and family via e-mail (internet connection required). \n\nPicture Motion Browser Software\nSupplied software makes it easier to upload, organize, and search photos on your PC. When shooting photos using your camera and an optional GPS unit, the software even provides a convenient map view function that lets you sort photos by location and display their origin on a world map. \n\nBIONZ\nBIONZ image processor delivers speed and precision. \n\nWhat's in the Box \n\n * Cyber-shot W150 digital camera \n * NP-BG1 rechargeable battery \n * BC-CSG battery charger \n * A/V and USB multi-connector cables \n * Wrist strap \n * Software CD-ROM \n * Note: No Memory Stick DUO Media or adaptors are included.",
