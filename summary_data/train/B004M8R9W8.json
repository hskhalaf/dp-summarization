I had completely overlooked the torque-limit setting because it is not located by the chuck as on most drill-drivers. And, since the torque-limiter on this drill is electronic the drill just stops when it reaches its limit and you don't get the buzzing sound you get from a friction clutch. Once I cranked up the torque setting, it has done everything I've asked of it.",

When purchase this tool I was debating between the 12V and the 18V, the 12V version look slim, smaller, but to use 2 types of batteries is a hassle. I purchase the M18 tool. it works fine, but it is too big, and with the battery it will not fit into small places (and it was bought in order to be used in places that regular drill does not fit). another annoying feature is to pass between normal and reverse mode. the button is small and not contactable.",

There is a torque level dial setting. Need to set on high for drilling or high torque screw needs. Only thing I would improve is sensitivity of speed trigger. It's quite difficult to maintain very low speed vs. normal electric drill. I was on fence about buying this cause of reviews mentioning low torque. Torque is not an issue. Definitely recommend for anyone who needs to drill in tight spaces.",

It's lightweight with plenty of heft to ensure full user control. Its lithium battery (with wonderful fuel gauge) holds a charge for months -- perfectly enabling the user to keep it at the ready without constantly recharging. Its power and the extent to which it continues to operate through a long series of tasks both contribute to an excellent user experience. We have a host of power tools from Milwaukee, Porter Cable, Craftsman, Dewalt and others, but this is one of our very favorite drills.",

So just be aware of this when you review the tool description. I decided to return the one I bought since I have no desire to invest in the newer design batteries or tools. All my Milwaukee 18 volt cordless tools use the older design V18 battery. BTW, tool is definitely made in China. Way to go Milwaukee.",
