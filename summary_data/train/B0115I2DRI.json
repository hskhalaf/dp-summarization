The LED indicator stays lit, but nothing else happens. Both razors weren't abused and probably had 10-20 charges between them. From what I see online this isn't a rarity, happens all the time.

I contacted them & they emailed the necessary paperwork along with a prepaid mailing label. I filled it out & returned it & they immediately called me, saying the head was not guaranteed, only the motor. I had to pay for the new head & was told it broke because my husband apparently pressed down too hard when he used it. It arrived yesterday & he shaved today & still Is not as efficient as expected. Very disappointed in this product. To top it off, this is a replacement for one our son gifted him which also broke in the same way.",

Very little skin irritation (if any), even right after the shave. Wet shaving is a HUGE plus. After a few tries (to learn how you hair grow), with good quality shaving cream results are practically indistinguishable from those obtained with manual razor. Update: with experience, use of shaving cream becomes unnecessary, just splash some water on the skin. For really really flat growing hair, dry shaving helps to get better results. 1 stars taken away just for one reason - I would like to have a charging stand for this unit.",

Anyhow it did do an awesome job but it did not do it as the page said in one swipe. One thing I did notice though is how close the shave was wich surprised me. I bought it while it was on discount for $60 but it's definitely worth the unit price.",

I had no desire to have two different razors to trim up with. So, I somewhat reluctantly bought a second one of the same model because I like how it shaves. Guess we'll see how long the second one lasts! Recommend overall.",

      "text": "After being faithful to Remington shavers for 10 years, I decided to try Braun based on a great product line and above average consumer reviews. So far I am pleased with the type of shave the Series 3 provides. It maneuvers smoothly across the face and neck to provide an accurate cover. The battery life is great to shave 2-3 times weekly with a single charge, I am sure the charge will hold much longer, however I like to keep mines plugged-in. If your battleing the choice of shavers, the Braun Series 3 is worth the try. Also I found Amazon to be the cheapest compared to other online retail stores.",
