      "text": "A very good rice cooker for the price. It has many functions for convenience whether you're cooking white or brown rice or porridge. After using it, I found the cooking quality to be nearly as good as Zojirushi for half the price for a comparable product. I would definitely recommend this rice cooker for people who want good quality rice, but who are on a budget.",
