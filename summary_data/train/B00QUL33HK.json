There was a potent chemical smell when we first got it and most of it went away after a few weeks of use, but the smell was still slightly there. Second, the boil option was inefficient because it continued to boil for awhile even after it reached the boiling point, so it was wasting energy. Other than those 2 things, I liked the look and feel of it. The company apparently doesn't exist anymore.",

When the water boils, condensation forms and drips back into the water. I gave it 3 stars because everything else was great. Well the beeps were annoying like others have said, but it was beautiful and well made. So, my search continues for the perfect electric tea kettle.",
