      "text": "So far I have been using this tab for 3 weeks and its great. The back camera is not all that great the pictures only looks good if you take it out. The front camera is better then the back in my opinion. Watching Netflix and playing games is not a problem, the screen is bright and precise. I would recommend this for anyone especially persons who are studying like me. Its small to fit in my bag and pull out in class and I have my notes and books on it.",

      "text": "Bought 2 of these, one for each of my boys. It's a great tablet... however you cannot move apps to run off a memory card without rooting and installing a custom ROM. I expect to do this soon to make it easier for my gamer to have more games, and also easier for me for my \"tv/movie\" kid to get things on the tablet. Without the custom ROM I need to copy a file to the tablet's internal storage, then move it to the SD card. 5 stars if it had Android 5.x or didn't have this manufacturer limit for only running apps from internal storage.",

Typing on one is outright horrible, and get used to backspacing many, MANY times, as it loves double- and triple-typing letters/numbers/etc. Also, they're a little quirky. One of mine right out of the box loses functionality in its 'BACK' button (actually, most of the very lower left corner of the screen) after 10mins. or so of use and has to be restarted. After that it stays working.",

Not good for playing games though, some games don't even run on it and others do but the tablet gets very hot and usually shuts off if you play more than 20 mins. Would spend more money on a tablet next time to get something better like a Samsung.",
