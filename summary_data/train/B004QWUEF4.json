If a crow is within sight all I see is a crow that can't wait to put more distance between this sound and himself. In the right hands it might be a hunters delight; suppose that leave crow watcher out - keep using my binoculars...",

One problem with it is it sounds kind of like a duck call. The instructions say to adjust the reed, but I'm not sure how to get to it. Anyways the kids love it and you get crows calling back if you do it right (YouTube videos have good instructions for other calls)",
