I see a lot of reviews saying it cracks but I believe this is because of not properly following instructions. Save your money! this 16 dollar set up balloon arch is way worth it compared to spending over $300 on getting it professionally done. Definitely worth buying and trying out for any occasion!",

I used a six foot table and 20 balloon rings with four balloons each so 80 12' balloons. Also I really like the fact that the company has instructional videos on YouTube so you can see exactly how it's done. The only thing i didn't use was the little hand pump. I recommend using an electric pump to blow balloon.",
