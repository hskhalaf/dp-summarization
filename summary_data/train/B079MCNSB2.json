It arrived in the pictured wrapping (clearly not the WotC wrapping) which I didn't pay attention to until I opened it and saw every single pack open. If I wanted to buy overpriced singles, I would have got to my local game store. Unacceptable to claim factory sealed and charge full price. Flash advertising and a clear attempt to rip off customers. I have requested a replacement and will update once I recieve it. UPDATE: 7/8/2020: Received the replacement and once again, all packs have been opened and rares removed. I am returning it and will not be buying from this seller ever again.",
