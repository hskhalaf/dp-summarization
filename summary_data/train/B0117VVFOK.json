My only problem is that the bb cream is too light/ pink even for me (I'm probably the most fair skinned peachy person out there) so I end up looking really creepy if I use more than a dime sized amount of product. Hoping it will look more natural in the Winter...",

Not too heavy but perfect coverage. The container and dipensing of product is clean and easy enough. I would never have been exposed to this without my birchbox. It doesnt break my skin out, easy to get off, great coverage without feeling gunky.",
