Due to living in an apartment the first winter we had the grill and the cover, it was all left outside under a covered porch. It protected my grill so well, that in the spring, when we moved to our home, I couldn't even tell that the grill, or the cover, was outside over the winter. Very durable product that I have no issue recommending.",

New grill is a four burner with a side burner and a side shelf on the other side and it fits perfectly. Well worth picking up and really happy with how it fits. Only downside is if your grill sits in the sun, the cover holds the heat in so the metal on your grill will get very hot.",

Water resistance is better than I hoped for. Very satisfied.",

Since receiving it I've been very impressed. It's sturdy and not a flimsy material which is what I was expecting at this price point. Also, it doesn't hang too low or high with my grill. If you have the same grill or a similar one, I highly recommend this cover since its a great bang for the buck. Lastly, since getting it, it has withstood two snowstorms with no problem.",
