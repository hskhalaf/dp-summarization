I found the instruction manual to be confusing as there are two supports that can be used, and the one shown is the one they suggest not to use first. However a YouTube search helped me find a video on the other version. Also: I had to buy a very small tire pump as my regulars didn\u2019t fit in the narrow space allowed to reach the inner tube.",

The instructions and pictures differed entirely and were next to impossible to piece together. When I finally did and tried it out, my dog's leg got stuck in the harness. Then she peed all over it because of the placement of the harness. So now I'm stuck with this incredibly expensive, torn, urine soaked, unusable wheelchair.",
