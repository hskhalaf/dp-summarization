I have only tried it on a very small canvas as an experiment and was happy with the results. I would add a quick drying medium just to speed up the drying process next time though.",

I found painting with mere water was an unsatisfying experience, but I guess it would work well for those who absolutely cannot tolerate fumes of any kind. I am happy to recommend this paint to anyone, even the 'pros.,' since it will also mix well with standard oil paints though you lose the water cleanup if you use too much regular oils. A great paint line!",

You can thin it down as much as you want with water to look like either watercolor or thin it less to resemble acrylic. Or you can thin with just a tad of matte medium for a nice thick classic oil effect. I've found that if you thin it with the matte medium it dries faster than if you use water, which is nice as, to me, it tends to dry pretty slowly. This is a very nice set as you can mix these colors to get pretty much any shade you want.",

Like traditional oil color, Artisan Water Mixable Oil Color is made from linseed oil and safflower oil. The only difference is the linseed oil and safflower oil used in Artisan have been modified so that they will mix and clean up with water. Artisan has been specifically developed to appear and work just like conventional oil depth of color, buttery consistency, light fastness, opacity/transparency, performance and drying times of Artisan, allow artists to use this range for all oil color techniques.
