Replaced an Otter Box \"Commuter\" case for an iPhone 6S because the plastic corner chipped after being dropped (this has happened with numerous Otter Box \"Commuter\" cases on varying iPhone models I've had, so it got annoying paying for a new case regularly). The great thing about this Spigen case is that the corners are part of the hard rubber-type compound that encases the phone, rather than being hard plastic like the outer shell. So, it doesn't seem like the corners will chip/crack like the Otter Box. Most important, the price is great for a quality case!",

I have the same model case on my iPad and those edges are not sharp.

The bad: The black rubber trim that surrounds the screen is the same height as the screen itself, so it offers virtually no protection to the screen. This would be a perfect case if they simply added to the height of the black rubber trim so it created a 1mm recess for screen. If you drop your phone and it lands screen down...its going to be damaged...and that's the whole point of the case in my view, protect the screen.Also, as others have said, the beveled edges are sharp and very hard...improvement would be to round the edges.",

The rubber is thick and snugs well over the phone and it gives me confindence it'll protect it well. I bought the rose gold for my silver iPhone because it's the color I originally wanted but wasn't available. The rose gold is beautiful and it looks fantastic with the black. Even with the little silver that appears in the back with the apple symbol. Overall it's perfect, slick and super stylish. I'm picky so this met my wants.",

Just bought the same case again because after 5 years the rubber split by the volume buttons. Well worth the money",

The material hugging the phone is lifted relative to the screen, so the screen does not make contact with the surface if you set the phone down with the screen facing down. One downside is that the button parts of the case is poorly built because the buttons are kind of hard to press. It is not that bad but it could be much better with a more well-thought design. I would say that's pretty much the only flaw though. Satisfied with the purchase.",

      "text": "This is the best iPhone case I have ever bought. I have previously bought all major brands such as Trident, Armor, Otterbox, etc. all have broken by dropping or tugging. I have had many silicon cases tear and plastics break. This two shell case is perfect. It doesn't come apart so you cannot separate the two shells. It makes it easier to put on the phone and stays snug. It doesn't move at all and is very protective. I had dropped it many times and have had it for over a year.",

These cases offer fantastic protection for a very reasonable price. Headphone jack cutout is plenty big for any style jack. Case does add some size to your phone, which I really liked on my 5s and 6s. Not sure I would like it on a plus-size model. Only issue I\u2019ve noticed is that the case seems to scoop up pocket lint over time. Recommend checking/cleaning the case and phone every other month. A can of air duster does the trick \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc.",
