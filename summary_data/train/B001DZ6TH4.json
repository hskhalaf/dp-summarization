With all of the cheap junk on the market, it was a challenge to find a citrus juicer that could stand up to daily use, is easy to clean and the dimensions I wanted, so it could fit on my counter under the upper cabinets. I LOVE this juicer. I use it multiple times per day and the removable strainer and reamers, (2 different sizes are included!), are washed nightly in the dishwasher. So far, it is holding up beautifully. I will buy again if it becomes necessary. LOVE this so much!",

But what I haven't seen mentioned is the ingenious spout that tilts down when you're ready to fill your glass. The juice tray will hold 8 oz. of juice, so you don't have to have a glass under the spout while you're juicing. Even if you want more than 8 oz., you'll probably want to let the juice out and clean the strainer around then. Gives the juicer time to \"rest,\" too. Then you can tilt the spout back up and keep on juicing!",

While there are more expensive juicers on the market of higher quality, the CS-1000 is a great alternative for those not looking to drop a fortune.

      "text": "We use this juicer almost daily, and can't recommend it highly enough. Super easy to use - works like a dream. What a little work horse. It takes no time to make a quart of fresh OJ or mojitos for a party. I used a friend's more expensive brand and it doesn't compare to this little gem. Look no further, and don't waste your money on the more expensive name brands!",
