I have $10 earbuds I like better than these stupid things. Won't be buying from this company ever again.",

After the session, he asked the producers and others which vocal track they liked and the Audio-Technica won! ROFL. Great stuff. The only issue with this headset is some pressure on your head.

Metal adjusters slide continuously rather than locking at specific points (like many headphones) creating a more precise fit on the head.

These ATH-M20x's have impressive sound and are super comfortable to wear. If I would complain about anything it's that the cable is GIGANTIC. Though, seeing as these are intended more for studio work, i can understand why the cable is so long. Overall - fantastic buy. Would definitely recommend.",

This may be related to the headphones being small but I can hear my voice vibrate as If I were wearing earbuds if you ever wore in ear earbuds you know how they plug your ear canals and you can feel and hear your voice vibrate this is really annoying to me.

These headphones are very comfortable, there is no feedback or buzzing sound, as with some other headphones, the cord is long, but doesn't tangle easily, our ears don't sweat, as with some other brands, and the ear cushioning does not crack easily.

Comfort is great, possibly a touch too heavy for my tastes, but well cushioned on the head and ears which is good enough for you to forget you are wearing them after a while. Overall I'd definitely recommend these to people looking to make a purchase at this price point.",
