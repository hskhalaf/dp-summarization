      "text": "Very pleased so far. I purchased this violin for my 12 yr old daughter. It arrived promptly and in excellent condition. All I had to do was adjust the fine tuners slightly, and rosin up the bow. She has practiced on it twice, and I still have not needed to touch the pegs. Stays in tune. She loves the case because the straps allow her to wear as a backpack. The sound is much better than I thought it would be; it is very deep and loud when compared to my violin I have been playing for over 30 years. If you are considering making this purchase you should add it to your cart with confidence.",

I know this was impossible for it to have during the shipping process. The product was well packed. Well secured in the case with a cover on top of it in the case for protection. Evidently who ever packed the violin did not care about the scratch on the product. Or the condition of the bow. But this is not the end of the world. I was please with the rest of the outcome.",

To my surprise, even though the warranty on the bow is only 1 year, they decided to send me a brand new bow anyway. It came in a very sturdy package, and we're very happy about it. We'd definitely be a return customer.",

The instrument came fully set up, nearly fully tuned, and the bow seemed dusty (meaning that it was conveniently rosined surprisingly). The customer service and warranty actually exceed my expectations. My only qualm, really, is that I can't tell the true origin of this violin.",

My 9yr old told me to make sure to mention that the string cloth was not provided. The reason I knocked off a star is because of the case. The part where the rosin goes does not close flush. Also after using it a few days with the shoulder straps (our preferred method since we walk a long time with the violin), it looks like the part holding the straps is going to break off of the case. So, violin= great, case= not so great, in our opinion",

We bought this Kennedy because of the great review and compared the sound before we return the other to my friend. The result was amazing. Honestly, I never thought it would make such difference. This Kennedy Violin sounds a lot louder, deeper, and clearer than the other. I'm not a music professional at all, but even I could tell the difference. It's that different. This one sounds more like an intermediate violin that we tried at a local store. I highly recommend this Kennedy Violin.",
