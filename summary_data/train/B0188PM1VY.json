I used one of them for my beaded top (pic attached). None of the sequins fell off. None of the beads fell off. I did turn the tops inside out prior to putting them in the mesh bags to avoid the beads and sequins snagging the mesh. I am very pleased with how the mesh bags held up in the washing machine (I did use the delicates cycle). The largest bag is HUGE and it worked well for my sequined squirrels on skis sweatshirt (don't judge me).",

Some bags are made well, but the holes are spaced so close together that the item never gets wet enough and/or takes way too long to dry. These a allow the water and air through and work exactly as I was hoping they would. They seem to be very well made.",

I only put 2-4 small items in the small bags to try to give it space to move around in the wash. I have also washed some stuffed animals in the bigger bags and it definitely helped keep them a little fluffier and less clumpy when they dried.",

I have one large one stored away in my gym bag so I can put my sweaty gym clothing in it and allow some air flow into the bag to help everything stay bacteria free. Overall, worth the price!

I also use it for delicates that have lace on it when washing bras, because the hooks on the bras don't catch on the material of the bags. I highly recommend and would buy again without question, if I needed more!",

They are also held in place under an elastic pocket so they are not even able to contact wash items. These are fine mesh, preferable for delicate items that might be damaged in a large open mesh bag. The sizes are large enough to be of real use as opposed to the tiny one item bags I have gotten before. As the person responsible for laundry duty these will keep me out of the dog house by insuring safe laundering of household delicates.",

Much larger than I expected. I was able to use one for baby socks. One for my 3 year olds socks and another for my 7 year olds socks. All in all, sock washing has become so much easier in my house and I never lose a stock! If I ever need more, I'll be back!",
