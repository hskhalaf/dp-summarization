This is the newer model with the white bushnell lettering and the red dot DOES disappear at around the 10 o'clock when you look through it at a certain angle. But as long as it's mounted it shouldn't really be much of an issue. I just wish bushnell would've kept the original model! Other than that it's still a good optic. Makes my dpms look good. And when you recieve your optic the battery is already in it and there's a clear lens that keeps the battery from touching the battery mount so be sure to remove that or else it won't work!",

They keep zero, hold up well to the recoil of even 30 cal rifles, aren't affected by rain, and stay solid on the gun. I like the variable red dot brightness and ease of adjustments. This is like a poor man's aimpoint. I'd go so far as to say that if you're on a budge, I'd even be willing to put it on a combat or duty rifle. Mine have held up through thousands of rounds, several rifle courses, and many competitions. Well worth the money and weight. Highly recommended. I am comfortable staking my life on this product.",

Now it won't go back on; threads don't seem to engage properly and the combination of spring tension/rubber o-rings pops it back off either immediately or after firing a few rounds. I have the battery held in with tape for now until I can fund a replacement with a better warranty.",

The Bushnell Trophy TRS-25 truly fits the old saying - you get what you pay for. There's a reason some red dots are 20 bucks and some are closer to $100 or higher. Its because they can be mounted on a high recoil rifle and stay zeroed. I love this red dot.",

Once I sat and zeroed it on the bench and got it set up properly, it works like a champ. You still need to check your sight, whatever kind you buy before or after shooting to make sure it is still tight on the mount. After shooting for several sessions, it may loosen and thus go out of adjustment. Also, for Takedowns, make sure you tighten the barrel adjustment into the receiver to ensure accuracy. For $50.00, it is well worth it.",
