It measured 6\" short on the width and 10\" short on the length; hello, that's almost a foot! Yet it was packaged as a 3' x 5' anyway. That's deceiving. Buyer beware.",

So far my rug has not slipped. It is doing its job. It does not ad much padding, but my rug is heavy and thick so that is fine.",
