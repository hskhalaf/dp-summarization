I haven't taken it underwater to test it's \"waterproof-ness.\" The only thing I've done is take pictures of random stuff not even related to the reason I bought the camera in the first place! I pretty much only bought a waterproof camera \"just in case\" I go tubing this summer, which didn't happen. This actually wasn't my first choice... I returned the other one to RITZ and bought this Panasonic because Ikelite makes a waterproof case, good for 200 ft (60m)... Plenty deep for recreational SCUBA diving, for which I've wanted a camera a while!! The GPS thing is pretty accurate. Maybe one day that will be useful.",

It's blinking on and off an error message on the screen, and then it shuts down. Unbelieveable. Perhaps we got REALLY UNLUCKY but I don't believe in luck.

Did great while swimming in the ocean or even in the pool; just need to remember to rinse it out per instructions. Dropped it a few times when trying to pull it out of my pant pocket for that quick shot of something, but no issues/damage. I even use it for weddings and parties when I don't want to use a full size camera. Good HD video quality. Wait for a sale.",

The corrosion was probably from water getting through the seal. They would not let me speak to a Supervisor or revisit their decision on refusing the warranty but offered to replace it for only $210. What is the purpose of a warranty on a supposed waterproof camera if they do not cover leakage?",

      "text": "I'm very disappointed with this camera and Panasonic. The camera stopped working the first day my daughter received it(she's 25). Which just happened to be Chritmas, bad timing. I called Panasonic for help, after an hour on the phone. I was told i had to send the camera back. I was told i would receive the camera back in 7-10 days, that was 3 weeks ago. Panasonic called me and said they were still working on it. I asked for a new camera and was told NO! Panasonic does not replace them. I had to wait for it to be fixed. I'm still waiting.",

I bought a Fujifilm Finepix waterproof camera recently and had to ship it back because I didn't like its slow focus & shutter issue. Lumix's is great at this.

I'm comfortable carrying it everywhere in the back of my bag without fear that it will be crushed by books, electronics, etc. My biggest gripe is the proprietary battery from Panasonic.

      "text": "Worked great except it leaked on 2nd use. 1st use worked fine, I followed instructions and also put in fresh water afterward. I had an Olympus before this and the Panasonic did take better pictures but this doesn't help if it doesn't stand up to its advertised purpose. Of course it is now out of warranty even though it is only 1.5 years. FAIL Panasonic.",

We did purchase some cut to fit screen protectors as we are rough on equipment. Overall we are very happy with this camera.",

Of course, it died in the middle of a vacation where I wanted to take pictures snorkeling, and couldn't. I had it in the ocean once before, and it was used many times in the pool, but it died within minutes of it's second trip to the ocean. It was never deeper than 10', and it died in 3' of water. The seals were clean, and undamaged, so they just don't last (and when you look at the seals, even when new, it's a miracle they would ever work.)",

While pictures and video clips are on par with most good point-and-shoot cameras there are issues. 1) The battery life is poor. Count on 100 photos of normal use. 2) The GPS is hit or miss. Don't count on your pictures being geo tagged. So, if battery life and GPS don't matter to you buy the DMC-TS3. You will have a rugged water proof camera that takes good pics.",

Recently, it was dropped onto the beach when getting out of a kayak. At that time, water got into the camera and it no longer turns on. My theory is that the water seal rings deteriorated over time. So, be careful putting it underwater after you've had it for a while. Given the price I paid for it, I am disappointed that it broke.",

It certainly is a good camera for taking pictures, but since I did get it because of the GPS and that is disappointing, I cannot rate it very high.",
