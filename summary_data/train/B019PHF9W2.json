Also noted that the design of this adapter does tend itself toward potential damage to the adapter or your usb c port. Because it's so long, it's easily twisted and broken at the usb c connector. Just an observation with this type of adapter. For this many connections, you are safer with a separate hub that plugs in via cable.",

At that point it would not register anything plugged into it and I gave up because the sound didn't sound good at all. I am in the process of returning the item.",

It hangs extremely loosely as it's only being held by the USB c port, there's nothing else holding it up, therefore, it disconnects often with the littlest nudge. You would think there would be some sort of clamp to hold it securely instead of just relying on the port. Also good to note that it doesn't work any better with a case either. Overall wouldn't recommend, just a wired one instead of this garbage.",

I lost all my data on that sd card. User error? Maybe a little. But definitely, mostly a product error.",

It may be that this product is just optimized for the MacBook, as opposed to the MacBook Pro 2016. Because the MacBook is thinner it will be able to rest on whatever surface you are using and be less prone to disconnecting. But be advised if you own the Pro, it will come out very easily.",
