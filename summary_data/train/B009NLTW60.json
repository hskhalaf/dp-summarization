      "text": "First, I love how easy this was to get working. It's surprisingly nice. I didn't expect for it to be so compatible with Spotify. I drive all day, making multiple stops. I am usually lazy when it comes to doing a series of things over and over (connect to Bluetooth, open Spotify, play a song, etc.). With this I have been listening to music more than ever because you don't have to do anything (as long as Bluetooth is on). Turn off vehicle, music pauses. Turn vehicle back on, music starts again right where it left off! That is bad ass! My 2017 Jeep with Bluetooth doesn't even do that! Highly recommend this!",

But that's just a quick push on the center button so no big deal and actually sometimes that is better. No problems connecting with my phone (Samsung Galaxy Note 5) every time. Nice sound quality although I mainly listen to podcasts not music with it so probably not the best judge of that.",

I like that there's a usb port for charging in the plug for it, I dont know how fast it is but it does work. I like that when you plug it in it turns on, no pairing to force or anything, I paid full price for it, and I like it.",

It wasn't long before the wires in the cord broke (after about a month of use). For this reason, I stopped using this car kit and bought the more expensive Belkin option.",

Since I installed it, it has been absolutely bulletproof. Audio is clear, it starts up properly each time the vehicle starts, play/pause works as intended. Sometimes things completely meet your expectations - this is one of those times - highly recommended!",

It has been working flawlessly since. I was hesitant because I didn't recognize this brand but this is a quality unit. When it comes to electronics and especially cell phone accessories I find that they either work great or are simply horrible. This is a hit. I highly recommend this product.",

And the bonus is that I can take and make hands-free calls without ever touching my phone. The sound quality is fantastic... can't tell any difference between Pandora and the quality of sound I was getting with my Sirius subscription. Fantastic product!!",
