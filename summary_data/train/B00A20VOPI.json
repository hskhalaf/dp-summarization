It was in the correct box (model ST1055) of the one we ordered, which seems very odd. Simplehuman should tape their boxes so that we, as consumers, will know if it\u2019s a returned product (and we will know that it's a used and/or defective product before opening the box).",

This rechargeable model holds a charge for a reasonable period, but holds so little soap that it needs to be refilled much too often. Maybe the next iteration will get both things right: adequate capacity and long life for batteries. The appearance of this model is excellent.",
