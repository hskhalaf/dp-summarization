      "text": "I purchased this for my basement entryway, the shipment speed was very fast, everything came within 1 box which you would need a handcart to move around if you are alone. The overall construction of the product was pretty strong, however, I would recommend them to make sure they label all their pcs properly. I ran into problem during assembling because someone had mislabeled the E and F pcs which required me to dissemble some parts which resulted in broken cam locks. I contacted their customer service department the rep was very nice over the phone and send over my requested replacement parts within 1 week. Overall I am satisfied with this product hopefully it will last a long time.",
