I was looking for a bolster that would keep its shape under pressure. This is nothing more than a cylindrical pillow and a cheap one to boot. If that's what you're looking for, you probably won't feel as I do. In case you couldn't already tell, I hate this thing. I wanted to return it, but it would have cost over half the purchase price and been a hassle on top of that. I will likely throw it out without using it.",
