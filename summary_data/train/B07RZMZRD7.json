      "text": "Nice, lightweight practice football. I like that it is full size and not a tiny, toy football. The football senses motion, which turns on the LED light. As long as you keep throwing, it continues to put off light. When you stop, it turns itself off after a few minutes. It came with everything you need to inflate and a tool to swap out batteries if you need to. When I unpackaged mine, I initially thought that they forgot to include the needle tool for inflating it. It was stored inside the plunger of the pump. My son loves practicing with this football. It is a neat little novelty.",

      "text": "The first ball I received would not stay on so they sent me another one. The new ball works about 75% of the time - it routinely turns off mid flight or while we are tossing it around. The size, brightness and material of the ball is great but overall, the design is poor. Instead of a manual switch to turn the ball on or off, it relies on a sensor hot glued to a circuit board that is wedged inside the ball.",
