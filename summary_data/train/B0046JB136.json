      "text": "Very fine item- effective, well designed, easy to use and attractive. Suggestion to owners: Do NOT pour the coffee grounds into your Coffeevac . Rather, place the new foil bag ( usually 12 oz size) of coffee into the unit- because: (1) Added freshness protection- without added cost (2) when contents near empty it is easier to scoop out grounds from foil bag and ( 3) if you like to rotate your brand or level of roast-- keeping the grounds in the bag will remind you of exactly what type you are currently using. Works for me!",

It simply has a ONE WAY valve on the lid which releases the amount of air inside the container with the lid completely placed on the container. To have a true vacuum sealed container it would be necessary to pump out or evacuate the air from within the container after the lid is completely placed on the container. This container does not perform this function. So if you want a plastic container that holds coffee or other dry goods this can do it but don't expect a vacuum sealed container as it is promoted.",

We put our coffee in the container, and we open and close it at least once a day, it is simple to open and close once you get the hang of it. Our coffee stays fresh till the end, and we put in about a week's worth of coffee in the container at a time. If something were to happen to it, I would buy another one.",

If you have a container that's 1/4 full, it's still 3/4 full of air. I think Airscape is a better solution, it has a plunger that goes inside and displaces air in the container, so if the container is 1/4 full, the plunger displaces and evacuates the 3/4 of the air that was in there and sits flush on the coffee, or whatever. Little pricier, but actually does what it is supposed to do, eliminate air from the container, plus it does it in an elegantly simple way.",

This sound, along with the equally reassuring resistance offered by the lid, makes me feel that my coffee is almost definitely shielded from unnecessary oxidation when it is snugly stored inside this airtight bean sheath. Go ahead. You can easily afford to give yourself this peace of mind.",

What's strange is that the directions say to keep the inside clean. How can you keep the inside clean if you always have coffee beans in it? I considered putting the beans in a bag than in the container, but I'm just keeping the beans only in it. UPDATE - 4 years later and still using. Cap has loosened just a bit but still works great.",

    "title": "Coffeevac 1 lb - The Ultimate Vacuum Sealed Coffee Container, Black Cap & Body",
    "description": "Color:Black Cap & Body\n\nThe Ultimate 1 lb Coffee Container\n\nThe CFV2 was specifically designed for 1 pound of Coffee. Tea people - it will hold 10 to 16 oz of Darjeeling and green teas. Coffeevac's have a unique patented vacuum closure system, our 2 way valve, allows the carbon dioxide from the beans to slowly escape, without letting oxygen in. Solid and tinted models protect light sensitive beans and tea leaves. Coffeevac's save you money and guarantee smooth rich coffee flavor. The multiuse 16 oz Coffevac can also be used for most dry & wet goods. Store conveniently on the countertop, in the pantry, the fridge or freezer.\n\n\n\nIs the Coffeevac patented system easy to use? How does it work?\n\nYes - To open simply push the press button on the cap, and pull the cap off. To close, push the press button, no need to pump, push cap down onto the body and with this motion the cap volume of air is eliminated, creating a vacuum seal, it\u2019s that simple!\n\nIs this a vacuum sealed container?\n\nThe United States patent office granted us a patent on a vacuum container \u2013 Our Vacs create a partial vacuum \u2013 The same volume of air as the cap is removed and for human purposes this is enough to keep most goods fresh and edible for long periods of time. For the engineers out there technically speaking there is no vacuum until the cap is pulled upward without pressing the button. Either way the Vacs will keep goods fresher for longer and prevent weevil & bug infestations. This reality is why globally we have sold over 10 million Vacs without advertising. No batteries or electricity required!\n\nAre the Vacs smell proof?\n\nThe Coffeevac patented system is able to preserve goods for 1 year and beyond by allowing products to breath and degas. Almost all food goods are smell proof inside the Vacs , however some products like freshly roasted coffee and medical herbs may degas, leaking there odor. Our 2 way valve allows gas build up to slowly escape \u2013 without letting oxygen in. This is one of the main reasons it can preserve goods for long periods of time.\n\nNote:Medical herbs that are sticky & smelly we recommend using a strong zip lock bag inside the Vac. This helps contain the smell and keeps the area clean where the body and the cap meet. This is essential to create a smell proof situation. The sticky resin often created by these products can compromise the open and close system, causing the caps to crack when opening and closing under such pressure of a glue like substance. Keep these areas free from resin buildup. Use a product like Grundge off. Thus maximizing the efficiency of use and longevity of the Vacs.\n\nIs it moisture and oxygen free?\n\nYes the Tightvac patented system keeps moisture and oxygen out \u2013 these elements cannot enter the container unless you decide to take the cap off.\n\nAre the Vacs durable? How long will they last?\n\nYes the Vacs are made with NSF & FDA approved PS # 6, this plastic is very strong. These days shipping methods are very rough, packages being thrown, automated systems dropping huge parcels on top of smaller ones. If your Vac arrives damaged please report this IMMEDIATELY UPON RECIEPT for a part or full replacement.\n\nMy cap seems loose? \n\nWe offer 10 different sizes and 3 styles of Vacs \u2013 Solid \u2013 Clear and Tint. Often a Solid & Tint Vac will have a slightly looser fitting cap then a clear model. It is a misconception that a tighter fitting cap is working better or holding more of a seal. Loose caps function just as well and will tighten with time and use.\n\nHow should I clean the Vacs?\n\nHand wash only - Use mild or natural cleaners. Do not microwave or put in dishwasher. Always keep the interior of the cap and the top of the container clean. This will ensure easy open and closure.\n\nWhat does NSF International certified mean?\n\nRecognized by regulatory agencies at the local, state, federal and international level, NSF International certification demonstrates that a product complies with all standard requirements. NSF conducts yearly manufacturing facility audits and product testing to verify that the product continues to comply with the standards set by the FDA. In our case all packaging claims have been tested. The plastics we use have been tested for food safety and our manufacturing facility has been visited and complies with all standards.
