One thing we did (as someone else suggested) was to put grommets in each corner of the mat and tie them to the sides so the mat doesn't slide around. Hopefully the video shows up which will demonstrate how easily my dog took to the cart.",

I emailed Solvit, they said it was engineered for bikes with 26in wheels. It would be nice if this was in the description- now i have a very expensive grocery carrier. Also, I have a 30lb dog, and would say a large would have been a better fit. Update: Solvit said putting the 20in wheels (from the larger size) would fix my issue and are sending them at no cost to me. They earned my 5 stars!",

It took our pup a few miles to get comfortable but after making the trek to the river and letting him run and swim, it seemed like he enjoyed the ride back a little better (or he was too pooped to care). Either way, this trailer has gave the opportunity to bring our pup along for the ride!",

Only suggestion/qualm with this product is that the cushion is very slick to where it bunches up and doesn't allow my 90 pound German Shepherd to get much padding. I'm thinking about either putting something in there with more loft and what doesn't slide or maybe putting some velcro underneath the padding to keep it in place. Great fun and lots of looks!",
