They are comfortable enough, but unfortunately the foam soles make a very noticeable and embarrassing swishing/squishing sound when walking.

Now I'm wishing I had returned them instead.",

It originally seemed perfect for those of us who do a lot of daily walking, along with some occasional off-road hiking/walking. But, unfortunately, after about 3 weeks of wear, this shoe's significant weakness-- lack of ventilation -- began to make itself evident. Warning - this shoe will function as a sweatbox for your feet, with the usual ramifications -- including dry skin and odor control issues -- none of which are a problem with my other New Balance shoes. Too bad -- properly ventilated, these would've been the best shoes I ever owned.",

It says waterproof but I don't plan to submerge my feet while wearing these shoes to test that claim. I just want to prevent my socks and feet from getting soaked by dew or the occasional rainfall. Cushion is definitely soft so these are not going to replace my hiking boots either. They do provide solid traction on grass and asphalt and for the price I believe they should be an economical replacement for the pair of Adidas that were Gore-Tex that barely lasted a full year before disintegrating.
