This scrub is even better -- the wash requires you to rub your skin for 2 full minutes before rinsing. This only requires 15 seconds of rubbing.

Instant relief that lasted about 15-18 hours. Not a cure, but gives you some relief while your body heals naturally.

I find that Technu works quite well even after a rash has developed, often stopping it within hours after scrubbing. Be aware, however, that peoples' sensitivities vary greatly and also change over time. My wife and I live in poison oak country and are exposed often. This product has repeatedly saved us much suffering.",

    "title": "Tecnu Extreme Poison Ivy and Oak Scrub, Removes Poisonous Plant Oils That Cause Rash and Itching, 4 Ounces",
    "description": "Size:4 Ounce (Pack of 1)Don\u2019t let poison oak or ivy ruin your outdoor plans! Tecnu Extreme Poison Ivy and Oak Scrub is the first step in your poison oak or ivy treatment regimen. Use before or after the rash has appeared. Our special skin cleanser works by washing away urushiol, the toxic resin found in poisonous plants, allowing the skin to begin its natural healing process. Tecnu Extreme is an excellent first choice before a cortisone or hydrocortisone treatment. If the rash has already begun, we recommend using Tecnu Extreme as an all-over body application. Apply product to wet skin. Then gently scrub the affected areas to remove the rash-causing poison ivy oil from your skin. Complete your treatment regimen by following up with an anti-itch and pain relieving gel or spray. Be proactive next time. Tecnu Extreme can also be used before a rash begins. After coming in contact with poisonous plants, apply Tecnu Extreme to exposed areas of skin. If you\u2019re hypersensitive, do an all- over application, since the rash-causing oils are invisible and can spread to other parts of the body. Tecnu products are designed for those who love the outdoors, adventure and exploring. Our product collection includes the Tecnu Original Outdoor Cleanser, Tecnu Extreme Poison Ivy and Oak Scrub, Tecnu Rash Relief Spray and Calagel Anti-Itch Gel. Tecnu products allow you to wander confidently, knowing you have powerful protection and fast-acting itch relief at your fingertips. Tecnu Extreme does not contain plastic microbeads. The exfoliating ingredient in Tecnu Extreme is silicon dioxide (SiO2), also known as silica. It is a natural compound made of two of the earth\u2019s most abundant materials: silicon (Si) and oxygen (O2). Silicon dioxide is most often recognized in the form of quartz, and It\u2019s found naturally in water, plants, animals, and the earth.",
