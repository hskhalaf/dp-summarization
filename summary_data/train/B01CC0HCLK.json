It doesn't mattify my oily skin, but also doesn't need a ton of powder to set it. You can thin it out or add more without it getting cakey. At the very lightest coverage, your skin looks smooth and even, and on the heavier end, it's obvious you're wearing makeup, but in a \"your makeup looks lovely\" kind of way. It doesn't irritate my skin, clog pores, or get extra oily. The only thing keeping it from perfection, is that it lacks SPF.",

Mixed with a drop of Nyx's total coverage foundation, it's the perfect tone for pink undertone redheads! I mostly ordered this because I need something that will stay on in the Texas heat and this definitly accomplished that! Great price. Fast delivery. Will buy again.",

The only downside that I have with it is that it's too thick to be applied with a brush without it looking streaky - it requires the use of a blending sponge to apply if you want a smooth application, which is definitely more work than a brush in my opinion. Otherwise, this is very full coverage, buildable, and lasts all day. Highly recommend.",
