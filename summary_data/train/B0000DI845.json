      "text": "It's ok. After testing old container soil and finding it to be within normal/average range for everything, I wonder about its accuracy. I hate that they make the color ranges so close together. It's really hard to determine which area your tested soil falls in depending on the background lighting. Individual capsules can be a little hard to separate. Just go slow and twist while you're gently pulling them apart. I guess it's ok.",

      "text": "My yard is mostly clay, but i have been working to improve it for years. I was unsure of the nitrogen, potash, and ph levels in different areas so i got the kit. I pulled out 8 samples from various areas and tested them, then was able to treat the area for its needs. I live on a lake, and i had always heard that i did not need to use fertilizer because i irrigate with lake water and it is full of farm fertilizer run off. I decided to test the lake water, and found that the stories were false. This test allows me to properly fertilize and augment the soil.",

Or do that in one location where you also take a sample with this, and if it matches then continue on with this. If not, chuck it and write a review!",
