A month ago, after purchasing this printer in 2009, a \"B200\" error appeared on the screen, preventing the printer from DOING ANYTHING (printing/scanning/faxing). This B200 error SEEMS TO BE DUE TO a print head burning out, but even after replacing it (which costed $90, a rather expensive part, don't you think?), no resolution. Fortunatley, I bought this printer for $146 in 2009. I see the current price is around $400. That's just ridiculout. So, as much as I like Canon products, DOOOOOO NOOOOT BUUUUUY THIS.",

I've used their printers for years, including the i850, i4200 (still my favorite printer!) and the multifunction MP530 (my favorite multifunction), MX830 and the MX850. I bought the MX860 for the wireless functionality. I find this is the first Canon product I would not recommend. The wireless printing speed is incredibly slow, either from Mac or PC. Printing through USB is faster, but still far slower than previous models. The new ink is quickly used up and it's expensive. These ink cartridges are not commonly found other than on-line. All-in-all, a real disappointment. I did get the wireless connectivity I wanted but gave up much more in exchange.",

The drivers installed without problem on all four of these machines, but installation was easier on the Macs. The standard black cartridge (Canon 220) gets used up faster, so make sure you have spares of the black and the color. I think Canon, like all the other ink jet printer manufacturers, makes more money on the replacement ink cartridges than the printer itself. The photocopier and scanner work relatively well. Bottom line, this is a good printer for home use and for light business use.",

The Pixma has filled the gap and the results have been nothing less than excellent. 8x10 prints are stunning, tonal quality is superb and the ink cartridges have outlasted their competitors. I do miss the larger sized paper abilities of the R2400 but what the Pixma does, it does very well.

As for the ink, it tells you long before you run out, that you are really low on ink. Not very accurate, or a ploy to sell more ink. Other than that, it's been a great printer.

Not a problem for large print jobs, but if you have to go through this each time you do a half-page job, doing a even a few such jobs can slow you down. The remainder of the functionality is great. The unit was easy to set up. I had it running wireless within an hour of unpacking it, so I have not had to find out how good Canon Customer service is. I also don't know how long the ink reservoirs last. At this point, I am pleased with my purchase of this machine.",

      "text": "I've only had this a few weeks, but am very satisfied with it so far. It was easy to set up and works on my wireless network at home, accessible by 3 different PCs. Very helpful to be able to feed in a set of double-sided pages and fax them, or copy them. Nice to have 2 paper sources (rear feeder and bottom tray). Auto duplex is also super convenient. As far as ink use, only time will tell. But I've bought replacement cartridges for other printers on eBay, non-OEM, never had problem, and bought a couple of sets for this printer already (haven't had to use them yet). Bottom line, based on a few weeks of use, highly recommended.",
