      "text": "This is my second purchase of this keyboard. This first one I ruined by spilling drinks on it (multiple times, oops.). The keyboard doesn't have excessive features, but it's a very nice keyboard for the price. No quirks, good build quality. I find it a nice keyboard for gaming. It isn't too small, my hands are large, and I have no problem quickly typing, or using multiple hotkey bindings for games. Update: Honestly, I wouldn't want to use any other keyboard at this point. I think they found the perfect button height, keypress firmness, keypress pressure, etc. Everything about this keyboard is made for efficiency, and it really shows once you get used to it.

      "text": "It sounds like a really loud electronic mosquito deep in your ear canal. I ultimately had to turn the lights off for most of my use because the constant hum gave me a headache and felt damaging to my ears. Sometimes I turn the lights on again if I'm gaming at night with headphones to drown out the humming. In my view, this makes the entire lighting system absolutely garbage since it is unusable without pain. If it didn't hum, it would be pretty good. Also, the keys are a bit on the sticky side. Occasionally I have to double tap a key to get it to go down and register.",

I'm not a hardcore gamer and I only really play single player games aside from Ark so I can't testify for games that you'd use a lot of key bindings for but like I've said I've had it for a couple years and nothing is worn away and nothing sticks. 10/10 it's pretty good",

The lighting (of the expert, monochromatic) of the keyboard is ideal. The size is surely XL, it takes a lot of space, but its slim design balances it out. The only drawback is that the keystroke \"feels cheap\", although there is nothing cheap about the quality of the DeathStalker. Yet, is really with the price! The feeling of cheap might be due to the kind of material used for the keystroke, but it seems to also be of good quality. So, if you are purchasing it, expect to have responsiveness, low profile keys, a flat yet large keyboard that looks good.",

Turns out the keyboard is divided into sections instead of having the individual lights that it's more expensive version (the BlackWidow) has. Really it's false advertisement. They posted a video about a completely different keyboard on Amazon when in actuality it's not nearly as cool, in fact it's a really lame boring keyboard. 2 stars for false advertising.

The only complaint is that the labels on the keys are light grey and don't stand out too well from the dark grey color of the keyboard. This normally won't be a problem for the backlit models, but for the \"Essential\" model, the keys can be difficult to discern. I had to return it--an otherwise very good keyboard--simply for that reason.",

A good feeling from the keys, decent tactile feedback for a non-mechanical keyboard, etc. The Chroma lighting effects are sharp looking, and easy to edit and customize with the software.

      "text": "The action is great. The lighting is fantastic. The \"Razer Synapse\" software allows for assigning certain color schemes to applications. My only critique is that the keyboard has been left out of the SDK, which allows for things like audio visualizations. If you want the full-on experience, you might want to go with the mechanical Black Widow Chroma. The \"Stealth\" model is available from Razer's website and their website only. If you're OK without the kitsch, pick this keyboard up. You won't be disappointed.",

Though as stated above i bought this keyboard loking for comfort and silence and on both accounts this keyboard is a success. Pros: -Easy on the fingers for extended use -Silent -Nice clear green led -wrist rest Cons -No auxiliary usb input -100% plastic Overall i am very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend.",

The keyboard in general is very cheaply made and seems like will break if I press a button too hard. I would much rather have an amazon basic keyboard than this as this is not worth the $40. The keyboard is a $10 cheap plastic with razed logo on it that makes it expensive. Definitely not recommend",
