      "text": "A very nice item that lacks proper instructions and is poorly packaged, hence 4 starts instead of 5. If you want to cut the ladder, as I had to since I installed the lower mount on the bumper, use a plumbing pipe cutter. I also shortened all 4 standoffs to match the distance from the RV wall at the bumper, so the standoffs needed trimming also. BTW, the screw catches in the standoff can be pushed in further, using a hammer and socket with extension. This is an Amazon link to the pipe cutters, which all make nice clean cuts around the pipe and is a lot easier to use than a hacksaw:",

A very poor design. The steps are supposed to be 12 inches apart and based on the pictures they are. It's not because the area you are supposed to cut is at the hinge. There was a picture here on Amazon where the ladder broke. I can believe that just by how its designed. Instead of cutting the middle, there should be expandable rods at the roof line. The ladder mounted looks sturdy but I'm nervous about climbing it based on the design.",

Also you are not supposed to be on your camper roof more than 2 to 3 times per year. Most important point (maybe just me?) is that install was tough and you will need at least 2 people to pull it off.",
