Ive been using the same brushes since I was 16, that I purchased from HEB (a grocery store in TX). I like my makeup, but I don't like it enough to spend over $20 on a set of brushes lol. So when I found these for $10 I felt like I hit the jackpot! The brussels are not flimsy, and apply my makeup evenly. I would recommend these to all of my friends!",

They feel great and look great but will irritate the skin severely ! No wonder it is so affordable. I won't ever purchase again.

I would definitely recommend this for a starter set of brushes, the price just can't be beat.",

Since I'm no makeup guru, these were a very affordable option for me to kick off my makeup routine. I can use the brushes for foundation, contouring, concealer, and eyeshadow, so it really covers all the bases! The brushes are very soft and don't feel cheap at all. I wish they had some smaller/thinner brushes, but otherwise, it was a great purchase.",

These are affordable but in no way cheap quality (update ..... love my brushes but after a few mos. of use my handles are falling off :( ) so sad I loved these and recommend them to friends but not too sure now due to durability)",

      "text": "Like other reviewers have mentioned, these brushes arrived with a STRONG chemical smell. The first thing I did was wash them in a mild baby shampoo (like I do for my other makeup brushes) and let them air dry overnight. A few of the them shed while I was washing them, but not a lot. The next day I noticed that the chemical smell was still there, but only on the brush handles, not the bristles themselves. I think it may be the kind of paint they used on the handles. The brushes are good quality, as they are soft yet dense. If you can get past the lingering smell, I think they're worth the $12.",
