Furthermore, the sound delivery is compromised by loose fit, no matter which size bud you use. That said, it works; it does the job; so good \"enough\".",

Also as stated in other reviews crackling sound, left side cuts sound in and out, and for some reason it just stopped playing after a certain track. Shuffle mode is on so I don't understand. Maybe it's at the end of my 300 song list, and I now must reinstall all the songs. Not happened.",

They're a bit awkward to wear until you fuss with the band / adjust your swim goggles to accommodate another loop around the back of your head.

Just like other comment says, should i go for other high-end like Sony? or go another one to admit that it is part of my living cost to maintain my health... im still holding my decision though",

Even though it can reportedly work for swimmers, which I never tried, its performance for runners and other workouts is superb. The following advantages are worth mentioning: 1) gentle, yet close contact with ears and excellent stability allowing any type of workouts; 2) no complications due to sweating; 3) a simple file structure: just one folder, very robust, multiple file structures tested all worked fine; 4) simple robust button design excluding undesired mechanical perturbations and unwanted interruptions due to random movements. Being so much impressed, I have then bought the same for my mom, wife, and a couple of friends as present -- excellent product.",

I just wish there was some small beep that played when turning them off so I know they are actually off. *Note, I have not tried swimming in these yet, will update when I do",
