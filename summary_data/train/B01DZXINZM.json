We specifically picked this picnic basket because it \"looked like the one in the movies\". However, whenever it arrived...there is no lid on the basket. I am assuming and hopeful that this is just an error on my basket as the one pictured online and the tag attached to the basket both state there is a wooden lid. I was going to return the item for a refund and just purchase another basket elsewhere, however, it seems ridiculous that the cost to ship it back will be deducted from my refund whenever this was not my error to begin with.",

I had received a picnic basket as a wedding gift in 1968, and I still use it to carry food dishes to family dinners throughout the year. Someone always comments on the basket, so when my grand niece announced her engagement, I decided that this basket would be a good gift. It was. It is sturdy, beautiful, and a good large size. I added a red and white checkered \"American Summertime Gingham Tablecloth 100% Cotton | Premium Quality\" tablecloth (from Amazon) inside the basket.",

It\u2019s a really decent weight too, it isn\u2019t like some cheap basket material, it can actually be pretty heavy when loaded.

I honestly really like this basket but for $30 its kinda a steep price. I think $20 would of been more value for what your getting.",

It is sturdy, but you want to always be cautious as it will probably be the first thing to go down the road in its life as it will wear the most often from movement. Can't recommend it enough.
