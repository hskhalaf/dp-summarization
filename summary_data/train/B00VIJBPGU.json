I was skeptical about purchasing this because there wasn't enough pics for me to know for sure if it would look right. This was the only shower curtain that could really bring texture into my bathroom as well as that romantic flair I wanted. I took a bit of a risk and it was well worth it! My only issue is that I noticed a couple tiny black stains on it. Other than that I'm extremely pleased with how it turned out.",
