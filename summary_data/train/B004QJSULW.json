The pockets on the side are perfect for the mags. It feels like a good quality build, though not super tough like a fire hose. It has just enough padding to protect from normal bumping and moving. It's just what I wanted to take my AR from its safe storage place at my home to the range and back. If you plan to carry it through the jungle on the back of a donkey, you should look for a more durable case. Great value, good quality.",

I would recommend a 42\" version if you plan on using a longer barrel or a fixed stock. Also, the front magazine pockets are a bit tight for a 30 rd AR-15 PMAG. Perfectly usable, though.

It may not have the best place for the attachment points to be put but it works just fine and comfortable to carry that way. And yes individually Velcro cover for each mag pouch instead just one big one would have been nice but I am sure the price would jump way up. I am very happy with the purchase . Give it a good spray of water repellent. Had it out in some pretty heavy rain and it did pick up moisture and had to be dried out.",

I don't have a scope or red-dot fitted though so I can't say how the fit would be regarding that. Shoulder strap works just fine, carrying handle works just fine. Only thing holding me back from giving 5 stars is that personally I would like the Velcro on the magazine pouches to be individualized to each pouch, rather than one catch-all flap that covers all 5 pouches. That being said, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to any AR15 owner looking for a low-cost case.",

There are five large magazine pockets on the side that can hold 30rd AR or AK mags and are covered with a large Velcro secured flap but would have preferred individual covers. The case also has good carrying handles and a shoulder strap. This is a real value for what you get! Highly Recommended! CFH",

I replaced my stock with a magpul ACS which I think does not change the overall length as much but is much thicker. My gun from the factory is 32 inches collapsed but the 36 inch case just barely fits my AR with all the accessories. Hope this helps in your selection.",

Looks like my old kit. Just need to have my service patches stiched on and we are good to go. Nice job NcStar !",
