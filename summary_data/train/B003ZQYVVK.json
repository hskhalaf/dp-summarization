      "text": "When first receiving this product we loved it. The sound was great, the remote was a bonus and it was great to be able to charge both our phones. However, after only having it three weeks it stopped charging on one side. I didn't want to mess with returning it so we just used one side (REALLY inconvenient when you put your phone on at night on the 'wrong' side and then take it to work dead because it didn't charge). However it just stopped charging on the OTHER side last night. Exactly 7 days after the return window. Very disappointing.",

Make sure you put the adaptors on the connectors, otherwise the plugs could get bent (much like any Apple stand).",

    "title": "Altec Lansing M202 Dual-Charging iPod Dock (30-pin connector)",
    "description": "Ipod home audio dock with dual chargers\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nHave more than one iDevice in your family? The Altec Lansing Octiv Duo has you covered. Adding a new twist on the duel dock speaker, the Octiv Duo lets you charge and play two iPhone/iPods at the same time. Its unique wedge design fits nicely in kitchen nooks, bedrooms, and just about anywhere. And the innovative Music Mix App allows you to shuffle through all the music on both devices, hopefully ending the music battle in your house.\n\nAT A GLANCE:\n * Dual-docking speaker charges and plays your iPhones and iPods at the same time\n   \n   \n * Free Music Mix app shuffles the music of both docked devices\n   \n   \n * Built-in USB port lets you charge a third device\n   \n   \n * Compact, wedge-shaped profile fits anywhere\n   \n   \n * Room-filling sound with enhanced bass response\n   \n   \n * Full-featured remote control included\n   \n   \n * Works with all iPhone and iPod models\n\nCharge and play two iDevices simultaneously. View larger.DUAL-DOCKING SPEAKER CHARGES AND PLAYS IPHONE AND IPOD\nImagine charging two iPhones or iPods and listening to your favorite tunes at the same time. The Octiv Duo lets you do just that--it docks, charges, and plays two iDevices at once. Have more than 2 devices that need charging? That is no longer a problem--with the built-in USB charging port you can plug in a third device such as a Blackberry, Droid, or Bluetooth Headset, and with the aux in jack you can play the tunes from those devices as well. \n\nBIG SOUND IN A SMALL PACKAGE\nThe stylish Octiv Duo has a footprint of only 3.8 by 10.7 by 5.7 inches (H x W x D), but with Audio Alignment technology you get the same amazing clarity and room-filling sound for which Altec Lansing is famous. And thanks to its innovative wedge design, the Octiv Duo tucks nicely into corners, saving space and fitting just about anywhere.\n\nWith duel firing ports on the sides of the Octiv Duo, you'll be able to hear fantastic low end bass tones that you wouldn't normally hear on such a small speaker. And to make sure your audio is always optimized, the Octiv Duo includes built-in shielded protection to prevent magnetic interference from the iPhone 4 and other mobile devices.\n\nINCLUDED MUSIC MIX APP\nDownloadable free to your iPhone or iPod Touch (with iOS 3.1 or later), the innovative Music Mix app allows you to seamlessly shuffle through all the music on both your devices. Using the colored slider at the top, you can choose what percentage of music you want playing from each device. Music Mix also displays battery levels, so you know when your gadgets are charged, and it turns on the stereo widening feature of the Octiv Duo.\n\nConvenient remote attaches magnetically to speaker's reverse side. View larger.HANDY, FULL-FEATURED REMOTE\nWith the Octiv Duo, there's no need to get up from your comfortable chair to change tunes or adjust the volume. A convenient full-featured remote puts control in the palm of your hand. And when the unit is not in use, the remote clicks in magnetically to the back of the speaker.\n\nCOMPATIBLE WITH ALL IPOD AND IPHONE MODELS\nThe Octiv Duo works with all models of iPhones and iPods including the iPhone 4 and the new iPod Touch and Nano models, so all you need to do is dock, play, and charge. And the Octiv Duo features the \"Works with iPhone\" and \"Made for iPod\" certifications, so you're assured it meets Apple's strict performance standards. \n\nThe Altec Lansing Octiv Duo is backed by a one-year limited warranty.\n\nABOUT ALTEC LANSING: 70 YEARS OF AUDIO INNOVATION\nFor more than 70 years, Altec Lansing has been shaping the history of sound delivery. The company boasts a unique history of invention that includes the introduction of the first \"talkie\" film speakers, the first set of desktop computer speakers, the first iPod docking station, and the first \"Works with iPhone\" speaker system. Altec Lansing, LLC is and American company headquartered in Milford, Pennsylvania.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\nAltec Lansing Octiv Duo.\n\n\n\nMusic Mix App lets you choose the percentage of music you want playing from each docked device.\n\nMusic Mix App also displays battery levels for both devices.
