With three additional programs and a 33% larger grilling surface than the original OptiGrill +, the OptiGrill + XL offers added versatility and convenience. Choose from nine pre set programs: Burger, Poultry, Sandwich, Sausage, Red Meat and Fish, as well as Pork, Bacon and Shellfish. The grill's precision grilling technology with sensors measures the thickness of food for auto cooking based on the program selected. When the flashing light turns solid purple, the grill has properly preheated place food on the grill, lower the lid and it takes care of the rest. A cooking level indicator light changes from yellow to orange to red signifying the cooking progress with audible beeps that alert when food gets to each stage: rare, medium and well done.
