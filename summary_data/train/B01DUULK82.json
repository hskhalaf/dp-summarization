      "text": "My almost 3-year-old has ongoing constipation issues from holding in her stool too long. We were giving her Miralax daily as per her pediatrician, and after the second week she broke out in a rash. Come to find out she has an allergy to PEG, which is pretty much all children's stool softeners/laxatives. I ended up needing to give her an enema on a few occasions which was traumatic for the both of us. In doing some research online I decided to try a probiotic in hopes that it would promote bowel regularity. This product has worked wonderfully for her, and she has no issues chewing one tablet up every day. Glad to have found this product!",
