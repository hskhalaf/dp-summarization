The suction is great, but I can't help but feel like power is missing from the brush head. We previously had a Dyson DC17 animal that finally just broke down after ~10 years.

      "text": "The cinetic turbine head is supposed to work on every floor, but it is not. Instead, on hard wood floor it is blowing the dirt around and it takes 10x more time to clean hard wood flow than with my Riccar1300 and the motor brush. Check this video if the link comes across:  It is easy to handle and works ok on carpet stairs. But since the turbines and nozzles are not powered and since their underside is flat, they do not have channels to clean corners effectively. So far I am not impressed with this device at all and the reputation is way ahead of the real performance.",
