So far I have cooked shrimps, chicken thighs, fish and chips, stuffed vegetables etc. All have turned out amazing and a breeze to cook. My only issue is that there are no properly listed accessories for this model (the one Amazon suggests does not fit this model). Buy one today and keep on experimenting.",

Even though it said no pre-heat is required, I still recommend pre-heat. It makes difference. We use it to cook fried chicken, grilled fish, and a hamburger. No need to put any oil. Instead, it will extract the grease from the meat, and make the healthy meal. We do not have much luck on steaks and french fries.",

    "description": "Air is the new oil, and now with the Philips Airfryer you can use that air to fry in a healthier way with up to 75%** less fat!
