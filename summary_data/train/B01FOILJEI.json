The good: - Yanking out the blanket was smooth and easy - the fire was eventually smothered. The bad: - the black strap immediately detached when pulling, so I had to pry out the blanket from the bag - the blanket melted through partially and let air in - blanket is not very pliable, so getting airtight seal was a little hard Tips for fellow buyers: - keep these mounted on a wall within easy reach. - be careful, blanket heats up rapidly",
