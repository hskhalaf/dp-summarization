It makes for gorgeous, ethereal pictures. At 5.6 and above, this is a super sharp lens. I was a little intimated by the manual focus, but it is actually quite easy to use.",

I\u2019ve been using manual focusing since I was a teen and can tell you that even old used manual lenses don\u2019t turn this easy. It feels like an overly used lens. - I believe the lens is overpriced for the play and the loose aperture ring.",

      "text": "This lens is sharp. The images are crisp and wonderful. However, when focusing on f5 or less, the glowing effect tends to overpower the image for my taste... and focusing properly for the image can be difficult in certain circumstances. The lens is also quite hefty in terms of weight, but it is definitely a solid build. Creative and fun, as always is expected from Lensbaby. I enjoy their brand immensely and recommend them to anyone professional and hobbyist alike.",

I find the bokeh very unattractive and the effects are pretty much lost at smaller f stops. Even though I have gotten a few very good photos with it, I will be selling it. The lens is well made and easy to use. No complaints on the quality. All of this is just my opinion. You may well like it.",
