I\u2019m very picky and I have not one complaint about these. I wear a 7.5 ordered an 8 . True to size but still worked without my foot sliding about inside. Looked narrow when I brought them out of the box - a concern since I have wide feet but they felt fine. Worth every penny.",

I had to affirm someone that I did not, in fact, have Silky Toes. They're comfortable though, and they do protect from rain. I plan to wear them often during the rainy/snowy seasons because of this, despite the roasts. Note: Wear them outside of your pants or with long socks, because they rubbed my skin til they bled when I wore regular socks and pants over the shoes.",

They come with a thinner pair of insoles in case they are too tight, but my feet felt fine with them. I have slightly narrow feed that are also \"low rise\" in that sandal straps are usually loose on me. These fit great with socks (not thin ones, regular ones) and I might even want to wear thicker socks so my (narrow-ish) heel doesn't lift out of them.

But if you like to have more room to wiggle your toes, they come with a bonus pair of thinner insoles. I haven\u2019t wore them on a rainy day yet! I will update my review if anything changes. I highly recommend them!",

The sparkle version I ordered is subtle and I like it. I would highly recommend purchasing these",
