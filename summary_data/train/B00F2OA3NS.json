The noise cancellation was not on par with the Bose QuietComfort 15's but the Sony's are very good for a 1/3 price difference compared to the Bose. Only grip I have with the Sony's is that I'm not crazy about the right angle headphone cable they include but it is detachable and 3.5mm cables are inexpensive. Can't wait to use these on in-flight in the future. Best headphones I have owned yet.",

I'm not a huge audiophile but just about everything on these sounds crisp and clean to me. There is a good amount of bass and the sound cancelling works well. Would recommend these for everyday use, they seem pretty rugged and durable. Will be breaking them in further over the next few weeks and will update if anything changes, but so far I am in love!",
