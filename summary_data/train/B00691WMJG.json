I was so happy with it, I wiped it clean and put it into an original ps4 on day 1 and its still there with everyday use. My only issue is games that save too much, it can cause data to corrupt. Only happened to a handful of games such as Skyrim, Dragon's Dogma, and once in a blue moon to Final Fantasy XIV. Always back up your files, it can happen with any drive though. Always was tempted to get a second for laptop if SSD prices were too high.",

However, when I say plug-and-play, what I mean is that there wasn't too much to figure out. With some micro tools and google search, I did it in 10 minutes (minus the waiting period for the hard drive cloning part): after cloning the new hard drive, remove battery cover, remove screw securing hard drive, unplug hard drive, plug in new hard drive, secure it, and you're done. I think I have extended the life of my computer by another 3-4 years before I'll need a new one.",

Day to day use you can feel the small size of the cache, sometimes it takes forever to open a program, and you just know that one isn't in there. Also takes a really long time to come out of hibernation, maybe even longer than the 5900 rpm it replaced. Also you can really notice the increased power draw in reduced battery life.

I was extremely surprised this thing worked at all. I gave it 4 stars because it's noticably loud and I can feel the HDD moving inside the laptop.

The RPM boost improves performance even of data not cached in the SSD. The drive has far less vibration than the older 500GB hybrid, and a larger SSD cache -- in the 500GB drive my working set of files was bigger than the cache so I wasn't getting the performance improvement I expected. Not so here. As an added benefit, this drive uses 3/4 the power of the drive that came in my MacBook Pro. This will translate into greater battery life.",

The hybrid drives offers an instant improvement in start up speed, and most of commonly used apps (Word, Excel, Photoshop, DVD player etc.) come up much faster than with regular hard drives. Apparently, the limited solid-state storage in the hybrid drives means that it can only store the \"most often used\" information, so I am not expecting their overall performance to fully match the stand-alone solid state drives.

      "text": "Lots of great reviews here with tests and stats. They were very helpful in making my decision. Just first impressions here. I'm amazed at the speed increase. I replaced a 5400 500GB Hitachi drive that came in my Sony laptop. The laptop is just over a year and a half old, has 4GB of RAM and a Core 2 Duo processor. Everything is noticeably faster. Where it had been sluggish it's much more snappy. Wish I had done this sooner.",

      "text": "I have had the drive since June (about 7 months) and it is now giving me all sorts of errors. I tried calling OnSale, and they hung up on me three times. I was polite and just asked the procedure for return. The first one didn't answer and the phone went dead. The second one was asking me to look up the serial number and the phone went dead. The third time I called, the person said hello, and the phone went dead. I am hoping to get a replacement directly from Seagate, but I would never buy another thing from OnSale.",

      "text": "Okay, I just bought this to replace the old 500gb 5400rpm stock HDD in my Toshiba Qosmio X770. The new drive is not only much much faster, but is extremely quite. I use my laptop to play video games, which during cinematics and other fast passed actions had a \"Stutter\" which is a lag in the game with no FPS drop. This new drive fixed the problem right up. The boot time is also much quicker. The \"Flag\" screen that appears when windows is loading is almost entirely skipped. The only bad thing I have to say about this drive is that there is a noticeable difference in temperature when the drive is under load.",
