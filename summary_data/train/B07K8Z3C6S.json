It really bothers me that the seal on the box was cut, so it had been opened by someone else. The entire appearance makes me question it\u2019s authenticity. Will likely return due to this reason. Now I know to buy directly from the manufacturer. How disappointing!",

The design features a streamlined dome so you don't get the bobble head look and the vents offer plenty of ventilation for air circulation. The fit with the eps liner is comfortable and the chin strap works well without tangling up to this point. The style of this helmet puts it at home for multi-purpose riding and would be a good choice if you only had one helmet. Overall, great style and comfortable fit.",

I've always worn Bell helmets since other brands I've tried didn't fit or feel comfortable on my noggin. This one happens to fit comfortably with hardly noticeable weight. Appears comparable to an aero helmet and the high gloss shell looks sick. I'm shaving off a star because I wish it came with spare pads, and the front vents aren't much of a garage for your shields depending on what you have.",
