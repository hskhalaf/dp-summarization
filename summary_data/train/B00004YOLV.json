The only alternative is a real cold saw that weighs 600lbs runs on 3 phase and costs many thousands of dollars so the choice seems clear for the light fabricator and or garage builder. The cuts are accurate and precise. The only thing that is lacking is a way to set stops at 90 and 45 degree so I don't have to get out my triangle every time I change the fence...maybe I will find a work around.",

Just use your angle grinder. 1B) If you have to ignore 1A, then make sure the the piece is clamped down really tight and go slow. The piece can jump out and catch the blade. I've cracked a few teeth not heeding the advice of 1A and now could use a new blade. It still works pretty well. Overall, this is a really nice tool and great for doing fast miter cuts on mild steel and chromoly stock.",

      "text": "This saw cuts really well. However, the 1st one started leaking oil after one month of light use. The replacement was worse; it arrived having leaked in the box. Even more problematic is that the blade is so mis-aligned, it is non-usable. In addition, the clamp is poorly designed- it does not hold tight to the table and rises up a bit when tightening. This causes the material to angle slightly and results in cuts that are not square. I do still like the saw, it is powerful and cuts clean. Makita needs to add a hold down like the dewalt has and fix the leak problem and I\u2019d definitely give it 5stars",

I will say that you can easily go a little past 45 as well as under 0, but the angle indicator was dead on straight from the factory.
