Clients have been very positive about the comfort of the table, and the thickness of the padding. It's portable and fits in my small car, albeit tightly. I would recommend to zip the cover to the edge of the handles of the table itself and use them to help lift it instead of using the shoulder strap on the cover.",

It is light weight, easy to carry and set up, and the cushion is so comfortable that almost all of my clients fall asleep on the table. I especially recommend it for Reiki practitioners because it's ends are open ended and when sitting on a stool you can work without any obstructions. This table is an excellent table especially for the value.",

It fits my regular size massage sheets and the open ends allows room for my knees when I\u2019m working on the neck or feet. Seriously worth every penny!",

Always having Oakworks or Earthlite tables which cost at least twice that I felt I couldn't find a table to live up to those. Not sure how I came across this one ... but it is made by Earthlite. It has an adjustable headrest, open ends to sit and work comfortably at neck and feet. I am impressed with the density and comfort of the foam. The table is also very sturdy. Of course it is new and hopefully will have many years of service. With Amazon Prime free shipping it was UNDER $200.00 and delivered in a day!",

I often use a heating pad with a soft cover over it, and that makes it plenty soft. It's heavy, as all tables are, but I think it's on the lighter end.
