We have played this almost every night since we got it a week or so ago. We love it!! Only wish more players could play at one time but other than that it's amazing!! The speed of this game gives you a chance to play multiple rounds. It's fast, fun and a nice change from the classic. Never thought I would ever say that!! Thanks for making our vacation that much more fun!!!",

The scanning device screws up a lot which basically stops the game till you read the manual and try to solve the problem. Annoying. This version has no railroads or utilities either which is strange.The device ends the game for you which is not fun either. Basically a no go in my opinion.",

I think there is still some work that needs to be done to improve this version of the game because it should be quick and not as complicated when playing the game.

Neat little machine with only three buttons, but with various combinations of keystrokes it does a lot more than I thought possible. Much faster game than the old classic monopoly, which is nice! Somehow, the board feels less cluttered, more straightforward. Sharp bright colors, bank machine working well, bank cards seem sturdy, playing cards averagely so. Overall great fun game, even my toddler loves feeding cards into the machine! Another con: the machine \"talks\" in beeps and sounds, and for the adult trying to get some thinking done in the same house, it gets annoying after a while!",

I never once looked at how much money I had in the automated machine because it would tell me when I was broke. In the \"cash\" Monopoly the fun was in watching the money and actually seeing yourself go broke. I am sure it is a generational thing since nowadays plastic money is the way to go and no one uses cash. Better to get Dave Ramsey's game which teaches a more financial side of things.",

As far as players who enjoy the traditional game which I count myself as one this will be fairly different than what you'd expect, there is no trading which is a big part of what separated players and there is very little to no strategy instead it's just a luck of the dice game.",

We played the first time during Thanksgiving after dinner. The greatest problem with this game is you can only have four players.

I really enjoyed playing this version as it's a bit more fast-paced compared to the other versions. The electronic banking system is very cool and everyone enjoys buying and passing go. I highly recommend this series ..Lot's of fun!",

      "text": "Been wanting it for awhile and I love it! Works great, makes game faster because you don't need to handle any money just the card and machine you use to scan your card. Only issue is you only get 4 cards so that means only 4 players can play. Another issue is the box doesn't come with batteries so you have to purchase batteries ahead of time or with it. You need 3 triple A batteries.",

While the original will always be awesome, this was great too! Kinda nice not having to keep up with all the money. No chance of the banker slipping himself some 500s lol",

They should make a little groove to secure the house in the appropriate spot or something like that. It is difficult to see what level the properties are at.",

    "description": "Style:exclusiveIntroducing a modern banking version of the Monopoly game: the Ultimate Banking Edition. In this edition, Monopoly money is no more! The Monopoly Ultimate Banking game features an all-in-one Ultimate Banking unit with touch technology that makes the game fast and fun. Now players can instantly buy properties, set rent, and tap their way to fortune. Each player gets a bankcard and the Ultimate Banking unit keeps track of everyone's fortunes. It also scans the game's property cards and can boost or crash the market. Traditional Monopoly play gets amped up with this edition -- the game introduces Event cards and Location spaces instead of Chance cards and Community Chest cards. Land on an Event Space, and rents may be raised or lowered, a player may earn or lose money, or someone could get sent to Jail. Location Spaces allow players to pay and move to any property space on the gameboard. Challenge friends and family to win it all with the Monopoly Ultimate Banking game! The Hasbro Gaming and Monopoly names and logos, the distinctive design of the gameboard, the four corner squares, the Mr. Monopoly name and character, as well as each of the distinctive elements of the board and playing pieces are trademarks of Hasbro for its property trading game and game equipment.",
