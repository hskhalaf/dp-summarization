Well mine ran like crap, shaking with low pressure then ran for 15 minutes with good pressure, then stopped and wouldn't start. Changed the gas out thinking that could be the problem and put in fresh gas. Continued shaking low pressure ran like that for 10 minutes and then stopped. Again wouldn't start back up. My last gas pressure washer lasted 12 years. This one, 15 minutes. I then bought a Power Stroke with a Honda engine. That one starts easily and runs smooth.",

On/off switch was hanging off of machine. Luckily was able to put back in without breaking it. Second manual calls for 20oz of SAE 30 oil but they only include 16oz. Not sure why. Was given detergent hose but no detergent cap as shown in manual. Guess spending $300 doesn't get you plastic cap. All in all poorly made. Not like the generac of 20+ years ago. Definitely returning and looking elsewhere. Won't get one year out of this machine unfortunately.",

One thing to keep in mind though, I found out the hard way that the carburetor was filled with machining oil which prevented the motor from getting fuel. Simple fix, just remove the bowl at the bottom of the carburetor and empty the oil. Once I did that, the motor started right up. My only complaint is that as complete as the user manual was for this item, I believe this step should have been included.",

Only two problems I had were: #1 making sure the suction hose for the detergent was at the bottom of the container. The plastic hose is curved (from being curled in packaging?) and you can insert it too far and it curls upward and will stop suctioning the detergent before the container is empty. #2 the hose for the water and wand connections are too close together and this makes them hard to connect once one is connected. Not a big issue but I think they could have been designed further apart.",
