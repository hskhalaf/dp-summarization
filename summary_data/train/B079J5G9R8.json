You can't have it both ways. Amend your descriptions to match the product. I will amend my review after that happens.",

      "text": "Good option for just a raised toilet seat but with the handles it was a little unsafe for my 86 year old mother who is recovering from a broken pelvis and needed something to hold onto to boost her up as well. The locking mechanism just does not stay in place if you put weight on one or the other handle and it will flip off. In the end we just removed the handles as she can use the bathroom grab bars and the elevation of the seat is still quite helpful. To note, if you do hold onto both handles evenly it is quite stable, we just couldn't rely on her remembering to always do that.",

We keep it at our home for visits - it does work on our toilet. YOU CANNOT RETURN by the way. Understandably.",
