Very happy they were able to find a solution. 5-stars now. ORIG: This switch uses the RealTek chipset which broadcasts out special packets every 2 seconds for the RRCP featureset of RealTek chips. Check wikipedia for RRCP description. Because these packets have no payload, our servers drop them which increases 'drop packet counters' which causes monitoring alarms to go off. TPLink tech support confirms no way to disable this \"feature.\" Will probably end up returning it and going with a different manufacturer who doesn't embed these pointless packets.",

The first package/item was defective but the replacement pkg received a day later works perfectly. I think the first package may have been sent to me in error because it didn't appear to have the same shrink wrap around it, and the gummies that stick under the switch to keep it from sliding were not in the first pkg but were in a little baggy in the second package. Either way, day one with new item, it works great and was really plug and play and ready to go. Exactly what I needed, even if a day late.",
