While we did not use the side table, it's nice to have them available if we decide to use them in the future. So much better than air mattresses because we now have the room underneath the cot to store all our camping stuff. All in all it was one of the best buys we've found.",

In an emergency or maybe if kid gets scared at night. Love this purchase!!,cannot beat the price!!!",

I just need something a little softer. I used it for a three night trip and a two night trip. The next trip I went back to an air mattress. Also, it is heavy to carry--it weighs more than my Coleman 6-person instant Tent (which I love!).",

What I dislike about that is it feels like you are often times having to push down on it to fully open it or you feel like it could cave in on you. It has never done that, just prefer a more simple mechanical feature even if it means connecting pieces to feel secure but thats just me. Otherwise its fine, it was just big for a 4 person tent compared to our other 2 cots.",
