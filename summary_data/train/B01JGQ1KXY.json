Easy to use, makes a significant improvement (darkens) plastic pieces, doesn't seem to stain paint, and comes off paint and window surfaces easily. I have a convertible, and this stuff made a MAJOR improvement on boot, tops of doors, tops of dash - all those places that get bleached by the sun. I read previous rave reviews on this product -- they were absolutely right!",

While it is not meant clean off hardened dirt, it does a could job of maintaining inbetween full washes. The reason for a 4 instead of a 5, is that it feels like it is a suped up or a concentrate version of a quick detailer. Cause it kind of does everything a quick detailer does.",
