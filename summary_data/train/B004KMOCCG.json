Neither of mine have much if any drop off in clarity around the edge. FOV in the 7 is wonderful. Ergonomics and overall handling are great for me. The accessories are very nice and functional, especially the harness. I own and regularly use Swarovski, Leica ,Zeiss and Nikon EDG as well as bins costing less than $100.

They fell off the only two times that I used the binoculars and were lost on the second day out!!! When I contacted Celestron for replacements I learned that two replacement rubber lens caps would cost me $30 plus $11 for shipping.

I own several pairs of binoculars, but have gotten frustrated with lack of clarity and detail, so I bumped up this purchase to another level, with the excuse of being my birthday present. I also checked with Cornell Labs Birds reports on various suggestions. This was the mid-price suggestion one year. I am glad I did my research first. When I first pointed them at something I wanted to see, I think my comment, out loud, was Wow. Color is good, detail is there, it is very easy to focus. Very pleased. Lois Benson",

The Granite had a very bright picture and a bit larger sweet spot than the either of the others but I couldn't get past the cloudy (misty) ring on the very outer edge. I wanted to like these binoculars but could not get past the visual ring. Perhaps this was a defect with just this one binocular, who knows.

The ED lenses ensure that each wavelength of light is kept in balance with all the others to provide an image which is true-to-life. They are also useful in lowlight situations helping you to pick out details in subjects in dense brush even at dawn and dusk. They stand up well against the much more expensive European and higher end Japanese manufactured binoculars at a fraction of their cost - a real value! EXTRA LOW DISPERSION GLASS - Granite Binoculars feature ED (Extra-Low Dispersion) glass, delivering edge-to-edge sharpness with excellent color correction and razor sharp images while virtually eliminating chromatic aberration. Coupled with fully broadband multi-coatings the optical design delivers crisp, high contrast images with accurate color reproduction for unrivaled image quality superior to standard optical glass. FULLY MULTI-COATED OPTICS AND BAK-4 PRISMS - The Phase Coated Prisms correct out-of-phase shifts of light rays to ensure maximum contrast while providing superb natural color fidelity and vivid color saturation. High grade BaK-4 prism glass renders sharp images and the reflectivity coatings increases the throughput transmission to provide bright images that are rich in detail. LIGHTWEIGHT, WATERPROOF CONSTRUCTION - State-of-the-art modern open frame style provides an excellent grip and is comfortable to handle (even single handed) with the reduced weight. The body is made of magnesium alloy which is lighter than aluminum, and more rugged and tough for handling in any environment. They are a mid-sized binocular, perfect for travel because of their weight and small form factor yet are packed with features that match up well optically, mechanically and ergonomically with binoculars costing two to five times as much. Metal Twist Up Eyecups: More durable and a longer life than plastic eyecups. Less susceptible to breaking. Twist-up eyecup for correct positioning of the users eyes for comfortable viewing with or without eyeglasses. Waterproof construction provides peace of mind when unexpected weather rolls in. The housing is also filled with dry nitrogen gas to prevent the internal lenses from fogging when moving between extreme temperatures or when using the binocular in damp conditions.
