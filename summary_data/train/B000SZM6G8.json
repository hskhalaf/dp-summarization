If I'm prepping food and need to throw away something wet or sticky then it either gets all over the lid or I have to go to great lengths to avoid touching the lid. After the first day, I just took the lid off and hid it in a cabinet. This kind would be much better suited to office use where you're pushing dry items like paper through the lid.",
