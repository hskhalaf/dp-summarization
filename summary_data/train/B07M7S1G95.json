Was a little rough waiting 72 hours for it to completely rise but it was well worth the wait. It's firm yet soft if that makes sense. I just don't see the reason to spend thoughts of dollars on the brand name mattress when this is just fine. No complaints. Perfect item to have and package good, shipping fast.",

However, beware, the plastic is muy slippery so while I was trying to put the mattress on the boxspringamajig I slipped on the plastic and broke my wrist and banged up my knee. I wish I was kidding but this is for real guys. Enjoy the mattress but watch out for that dastardly plastic.",

I have bought a few other mattresses online for my rental properties that were very good, but not amazing. This one is the absolute best. And it was incredibly affordable. I have such a hard time staying asleep all night and since I have been using this, I have slept so great. It arrived on time, and gained its full form in a day. The new mattress smell was gone quickly. No damage. I\u2019m just so happy with this purchase!",

      "text": "The first night after full decompression might feel awkward as the foam is a little stiff, but given a couple of hours it will conform for your body. The mattress came in a moderately sized box that we were able to fit in our car to get home. Easy to unwrap with the little opener included, just do so carefully. Allow the full 72+ hours for decompression. It's worth it. Highly comfortable. Husband felt shoulder relief after the first night. My hips quit hurting and my neck isn't stiff. Great product.",

It's got a huge dip in the middle now. You sink right in and it's very uncomfortable. And I know it's not my bed frame or box spring, because its sitting on 3/4\" plywood on top of my box spring. I tried reaching out to the company months ago asking if this was a flip-able bed or if there was a warranty but go no response. I ordered through my boyfriend's Amazon account and even he has seen no response.",

We let it fully expand for the 72+ hrs recommended. It did have a slight smell, but it dicepaded quickly after only a couple of hours. The top of the mattress is plush, but you do not sink in. You feel the sturdiness holding your back in perfect position. Overall, I am very happy with our purchase. Finally got some well deserved sleep. We haven't woken up this rested in a very long time. We have a new love affair, and it is our bed!",
