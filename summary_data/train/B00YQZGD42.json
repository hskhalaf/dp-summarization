The leash snapped near one of the knots that separate the stretch and nonstretch part. Luckily we were just in the back yard at the time.

Also I'm still within the 60 day manufacture warranty, but since I bought it on Amazon I'm apparently not covered past 30 day.",

      "text": "My husband and I have a 40-lb Australian Shepherd/Husky mix and a 22-lb blind and deaf full-bred Australian Shepherd puppy. The puppy requires more hands on leading, so when we can't both walk them this is the perfect way to still focus on the puppy's need and walk our well-trained dog hands-free. The handle helps if I need to pull her back during our run/walks. The main reason I gave this four out of five stars, there was one instance where our dog saw a squirrel and when she pulled the belt unclipped. Thankfully there was enough tension in the beginning our dog hesitated instead of bolting, but caution to those who may have a more active dog.",

I bought a no-pull harness (the one where you attach the leash on the chest of the dog). It works so well. The bungee on the leash acts as a buffer when it stretched. It has resistance so you don\u2019t feel it on you right away. My tip is to use this with the no pull harness as I\u2019ve described. One day I used a regular dog harness and my dog just pulled and pulled. It was annoying.",

The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because it's so long that if your dog runs right next to you (rather that a few feet out to your side) the leash gets close to dragging on the ground and feels like it could trip you. And there's really no way to shorten the length of the leash, aside from tying knots into it (which is what I've done).",

A note for newbie's to the hands free leash. You may think it would pull you off balance, not necessarily true. The leash is connected to the core area of the body and is much less affected and far more stable than holding it with your hands. Hope this helps.",

Running is the only way to get his energy out but he\u2019s pulled free a few times to chase dogs or squirrels. With the harness I still end up holding the leash to direct him and keep him under control, but it does allow me to use my hands if I need to. We aren\u2019t ready for hands free yet.",

The only drawback for me is that the actual lead part is not adjustable, I'm figuring that is near impossible to do with the bungee aspect, and so every so often I need to tug on the lead to bring her up to not pull.

My dog is a little bit of a puller but the bungee feature is amazing. Also was surprised how having the leash around the CORE would be stronger than using my arm. I was pleasantly surprised how awesome this leash is!",

The strap fits around my waist even when wearing a winter coat and I can just clip it to my regular leash. (The leash it comes with is fine and probably great for running but for my purposes I prefer to use my own leash.) I have used it several times this winter and it has definitely put my mind at ease.",

It would through off my gait and was difficult to control his pulling. Getting this has completely changed the running experience. My pup is able to run ahead of me and can weave without pulling my hand and messing up my gait. He also has darted for a bunny or two, and the bungy cord totally saves me from being lurched forward.",

We took a test drive around the block and she quickly bought another so we could use these exclusively on vacation where we take long walks with the dogs. The lease is solid and the bungie action is perfect - it's not too loose that it doesn't do anything but it's tight enough that it slows a sudden lunge by the dog so you're not taking a direct assault to the waist. A huge plus is that there's a handle near the hook so you can detach it at will and it becomes a regular leash. This is a great product.",
