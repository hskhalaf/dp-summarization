Now, a bluray movie it played flawlessly 2 days ago will not play, nor will any bluray disk. Standard DVDs play fine, but firmware has locked out all blurays. Programmed obsolescence - Stay away from Panasonic and consider any other brand that does not force you to buy a new player through firmware shenanigans. You'll be sorry !!",

Overtime, it stopped loading them completely (i assumed because the firmware was defective). So I tried updating the firmware. Whomever came up with the update procedure should be forced to provide on-line customer service for this POS unit as punishment. FYI, the techs who do actually handle support aren't PhDs either. This is the second Panasonic device that I am unhappy with which surprised me as I thought they had a good reputation.",

Compared with the older Panasonic multi-disc DVD player I have it seems to upscale DVDs to 1080i more effectively. The cons: No controls on the box itself other than power and eject. I've got lots of photos I'd like to load to CD/DVD (eventually Blu-ray) to display on the HD TV, but I can never seem to find the right combination of settings with the DVD burner so the data CD/DVD actually works in the Blu-ray player or so the photos display. (Had the same problem with the DVD player.) It does fine with video DVDs, though.",

I watched Wall-e and Tropic Thunder on my 60\" Sony KDS2000 in full 1080p - what can can I say - it blows you away. The picture quality is beautiful. The sound through my Pioneer 1018 Receiver is also incredible. The player operates without a glitch and synced seamlessly with my other components. Load time, though I didn't time it - was certainly reasonable. My first venture into Bluray and I'm going to find it difficult to ever watch or listen to a movie in another format. Good stuff. As a bonus, it came double boxed in a flawless shipping carton. Love Amazon.",

Even your plain old-school DVDs will look much better on this machine and Blu-ray discs look very, very good. I'm not maxing this thing out by any means (50\" 720p plasma and 2-channel audio thru a 1st-generation Bose 3-2-1) but the difference vs. my old player is dramatic. Cnet convinced me to buy this model; you might want to check out their review. And Netflix only added $1 more per month to add Blu-ray to my account, so I'm renting lots of movies I've seen before to check out what they look like now. Great stuff!",

No noise whatsoever from the Panasonic, so no distractions while watching movies. The remote key layout on the Panasonic is also more straight-forward. Both players take a while to recognize a disc, but that seems to be an issue with all BD players. Finally, the Panasonic recognized and played DVD-R recordings the LG wouldn't. Although this model is no longer manufactured, it is available via the refurb market and a great value for under $200.",

The BD10AK is discontinued and it's replacement seems to be the DMP-BD50. The DMP-BD30 looks nice on paper but it seems to be targeting a lower price point (ie. fewer features). I went with the BD10AK because I needed the analog decoding built into the player as I have an older AVR that cannot decode the new higher definition audio formats. With the BD50 now announced, it is best to get that instead.",

      "text": "Remember the old, \"Product specifications are subject to change without notice.\" Well, they did. Before I bought this, I downloaded the manual to make sure I would have no connection problems. Okay: HDMI to the Panasonic Plasma Display and Digital Coaxial to my Onkyo. When the BD35 arrived, the manual was the same as downloaded, but there simply was no Digital Coaxial Output on the back of the player. None, zero, zip. A quick trip to Radio Shack and a new $27 Optical Cable made everything right with the world. Just a note to prospective buyers, if you need the Digital Coaxial Output, you're in trouble with this unit. Otherwise, I am very pleased so far. TBT Memphis, TN",

      "text": "This is my first blu-ray player and I am very happy with it. I went by the reviews here and the CET review and it turned out to be a good choice. I have seen the Sylvania one available for $178 at Costco and the Panasosonic player is much lighter and prettier. Did not do a close comparison of picture quality between the two. However, I recall that the Sylvania one was short on some audio connectors compared to this one. If you just intend to use the HDMI cable for audio output it may not be a factor.",
