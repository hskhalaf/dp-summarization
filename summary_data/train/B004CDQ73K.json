My poor baby had smeared, melted nail polish Everywhere I touched or applied the sunscreen. Make sure you are not wearing any when applying.",

Smells good, thick, but easy to apply. Gentle on her skin (used at 2-3 months). Have already recommended to some of my other mom friends with the same concern. Only con is that it's very expensive for such a small amount and as she gets bigger we have to use more and more. If there were coupons or discounts I would order crates and use it until she could put on her on sunscreen ;)",
