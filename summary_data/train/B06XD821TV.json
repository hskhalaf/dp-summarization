Draw strings are on the adult ponchos only, and help sinch the hood around your face. After we wore them, it is possible to get them back into the storage bags, but it was tough. They do take up more room after putting them back in the storage bags. Overall, good quality. Not the thickets ponchos I've ever worn, but they were just right for the trip.",

Came in a very nice packaged box and each poncho is individually packaged in a plastic zip lock to re use. . I Put a few in my car for emergencies and our family used it for an outdoor concert last weekend and they were perfect! I stand 6'1 and it fit really well. The long sleeves , elastic band and string on the hood prevented it from flapping around like those cheap trash bag types. My children loved the different colors as well. After use we packed them back in the zip lock bag so we can use it again. I highly recommend Lingitos ponchos.",

We didn\u2019t end up having to use them but we\u2019re thankfuk we had them in case we needed them.",

They are quite thin and blow up easily in the wind. A welcomed improved would be to increase thickness. I would be willing to pay more for thicker ponchos!",

Great price on these too, didnt feel bad for using it once and just tossing it in the trash.",
