      "verdict": "Overall, the PlayStation Vita is the most advanced portable gaming system ever made. While the price is deceiving because of a hidden cost, gamers are getting an impressively complete package. Now priced at $200, the Vita makes a compelling case as the ultimate indie portable console.",
      "pros": [
        "The PlayStation Vita delivers amazing visuals on its 5-inch OLED touch screen that look almost as good as PS3 graphics",
        "The system's game lineup has matured into an indie haven, though AAA titles are scarce",
        "The Vita allows for downloading of some games (including all first-party titles) over the PlayStation Network",
        "The Vita's operating system is smartly designed, easy to use, and ultraresponsive",
        "The unit feels great to hold and has excellent standby battery life",
        "A lot of PSN titles can be purchased on PS3 and Vita for one price"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "The Vita uses proprietary media and connections across the board, and even requires the purchase of a separate memory card to play most games and use most apps, which results in a hidden cost",
        "Battery life could be better, and there's no way it can be replaced by the user",
        "There's also no video out",
        "Also, some antipiracy implementations are a bit cumbersome to deal with (for example, mounting the Vita to a PC/Mac for file transfer)",
        "It's also unclear how much storage the Vita has onboard, and it'll cost you more money for larger Vita Memory Cards"

My only complaint cannot be attributed to the seller, but rather Sony for not giving this thing any internal memory for downloads. Tracking down a memory card isn't going to be easy and retailers will try to gouge you real good on prices. My advice is to purchase a card with the vita or else you will only be able to use it for remote play until you get a card or game (and you still can't save).",

Some scratches on outside casing but once again nothing too noticeable. Note: as usual it doesn\u2019t come with a PlayStation Vita SIM Card; you will need one of these in order to play ANY game, even cartridge games. Regular SIM cards will not fit the Vita; you will need a proprietary one made by PlayStation.",

One major drawback is the requirement for memory to even play games, and the price of said memory.",

I had pretty high expectations for this as Sony really talked this up. Overall, I am pretty happy with getting it. The graphics are a large improvement, and the gameplay finally feels full fledges as opposed to the portable version where generally you lose most of the features of the console version. You still see that at times on the Vita, but I'm sure as time goes on that will only get better and better. If you play portable games a lot, you will probably enjoy it.",

      "text": "I bought this for my son's birthday and assumed, after reading the Q&A, that there would be a 4GB memory card included. Imagine our surprise when my son opened this on his birthday and couldn't play it. We are sending it back after finding the exact same product elsewhere, and for $89 less, allowing us to get the device and the card for around the same price as this one. Very deceptive to have a Q&A that doesn't actually reflect the purchase. Seller should be keeping an eye on their page to make sure it reflects their product. Buyer beware!",
