It comes with different fitting parts for a hose connection, but if you use a regular garden hose, you will need to add your own hose washer to the receiving end of the connection.",

Unfortunately, during the second use, a seam for the main water sprayer ripped on the BOTTOM of the slide. Since the children weren't making contact with the bottom of the slide, they didn't rip it which tells me that the unit is underbuilt for the amount of pressure that builds up in the main sprinkler running down the slide. That being said, I'll be returning it and getting a new one because the kids enjoyed it so much. Hopefully, I'll have better luck with the new and I'll update this review accordingly.",

After it started we still had to put some baby tear free soap on it for her to slide because it wasn't wetting it very well. She doesnt really know any difference but for more than $60 I think it was a bust",
