I use this night and day and the bonus is I can mix this with body lotion and put it my hair. Instead of having so many different products for different things it\u2019s convenient to have 1 product to be able to benefit all my skin/hair needs.",

I usually use jojoba oil mixed with castor oil to clean my face, then I sleep with a few drops of jojoba oil at night. I use jojoba oil and lavender oil on my skin at night to sleep and wake up with the softest skin ever. I love it!",
