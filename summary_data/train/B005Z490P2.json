And when I ordered it, they provided me with a delivery date prior to my wife's birth date. But they kept on changing the delivery date and the product finally arrived on 7th July past my wife's birthday. I was really disappointed as I couldn't bake a cake for her (which I have been baking on her every birthday). And after arrival when I tried using, quality-wise it wasn't even close to the one that I was previously using. My recommendation is don't fall for this product's false advertisement.",
