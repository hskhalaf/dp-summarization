I installed the new firmware BEFORE reading online about some bad firmware updates. I think that this was my problem because after the update it would drop wired and wireless connections at random.

      "text": "I ordered this to replace an aging Linksys WRT54GL that would crash when kids and grandkids filled the house with their handheld devices. Also hoped to get better coverage in my workshop about 100' away. No more crashes. However, the distance is no better. Recently had an issue where I couldn't access a specific website whether I was connected wirelessly or wired. I tried multiple browsers and multiple devices with no luck. I didn't suspect the Asus, so I called my cable internet provider (after power cycling their modem). After some tests, they suggested I power cycle the Asus. That eliminated the problem. Strange! I probably wouldn't buy another one of these knowing what I know now.",

      "text": "After upgrading my Internet service to 60mb/s, my old D-Link DIR-825 router started dropping connections with various of my devices. I tried upgrading to longer antennas, and although that slightly increased the signal strength, it didn't solve the randomly dropped connections. That's why I decided to upgrade to this Asus router. It was simple to set up. Now I have all of my devices--two TVs, two blu-ray players, two iPads, one android tablet, two iPhones, one Internet land phone, three computers, and one printer--all connected at the new, fast speed. I have had no dropped connections in three days of continuous service. Perfect!",

The router is located at one end of the house on the upper floor and reaches the farthest room with ease.

Voila, problem solved! The fan is available on Amazon as well, and is good insurance to add additional life expectancy.",

      "text": "I purchased this for use as a sound Wireless Network to interface two devices without an internet connection. Unfortunately this device requires an internet connection to properly function. I'm sure taht's great for a home network, but I needed it for a professional setting, which is why I purchased a far too expensive router with ultra fast bandwidth. I now have 3 antennaes attached to a paper weight. Since our theater was under renovation I didn't find this out until 6 months after purchase. Not likely buying any ASUS anything again.",
