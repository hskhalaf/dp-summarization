      "text": "I use this day bag to transport my long board in the bed of my truck to and from the beach. The bag provides basic bump and storage protection, and it has room for your leash and other items that will not damage your board. My biggest dislike is that the bag is advertised as Heat Resistant but in reality the tarpaulin material provides very little to no heat resistant protection when my board is in the bag in the back of my truck. I found the bag more effective to heat resistance if you take the board out of the bag and lay the bag over the board and strapping it to the your tailgate rack.",

Fit is nice, material is thick enough for day to day use.",
