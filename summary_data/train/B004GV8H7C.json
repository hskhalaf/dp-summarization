It is a mild detangler, volumizer, texturized and also makes it shiny. It also smells great! This also responds very well to heat styling. When I curl my hair after using this, my curls are shiny and bouncy and last longer. There also seems to be some humidity control happening. 5 stars!",

      "text": "I am 44 with shoulder length, thin, straight, highlighted hair. I love this product! It makes my thin hair so much fuller!! Even a friend of mine commented on how full my hair looked compared to usual. It took me 5 months to go through my first bottle. BUT my mom who is 72 tried it on her very short, straight, fine hair and she said it made her hair too soft. So it may not work for everyone but it definitely makes a huge difference for me!",
