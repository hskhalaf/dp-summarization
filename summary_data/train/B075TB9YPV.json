Ear buds tended to fall out on treadmill and fast walking outside. Noise canceling was about 50% bc I could carry on a conversation with both ear buds in place and hear noises around me. For the money it\u2019s a 3 star rating based on ease of pairing and good sound minus all the other not good things. Would not purchase again. Went back to much older and cheaper ear buds.",

They are a little bigger and heavier than I would have liked, but have worked fine so far as minimal-profile wireless headphones for workouts where I don't want any wires or heavy over-the-ear headphones while I am being active and moving a lot. Pairing with my iPhone X on iOS 12 is fine although tricky at the first try. The batteries seem to not last very long or have shortened capacity over time, but I really like the power bank that came with it which seems to hold plenty of charge for a long time.",
