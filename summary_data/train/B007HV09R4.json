It\u2019s an impressively durable and versatile piece of climbing gear. Unfortunately, not everyone would appreciate this boot outright as reports concerning its ultra-stiff construction and long break-in period might be enough to turn them away. All in all, if mountaineers can give the boot enough time to loosen up, they would eventually discover how magnificently well-made the Scarpa Fuego really is.",
      "pros": [
        "Many purchasers swore by the Scarpa Fuego\u2019s tanklike durability",

        "This Scarpa footwear quelled the worries of numerous users with its supportive ankle shaft",
        "A decent percentage of Fuego reviewers only had great things to say about the boot and its remarkable lightness",
        "Several mountaineers never lost their footing on uneven terrain in their Fuegos, and they couldn\u2019t be any happier",
        "Less than a handful of buyers admitted that their purchase of the boot was a wise investment",
