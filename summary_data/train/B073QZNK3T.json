Every component was wrapped, cushioned and protected. The table and benches were individually packed into smaller boxes with ease of assembly in mind. Also, assembly was easy as it only took 1 person to assemble with minimal effort. I did not have to spend any time at all figuring out which legs are for the benches or tables. Every component was well made and precisely aligned for a perfect fit, unlike some other affordable self-assembled furniture I've assembled before.",

The legs looked super cheap and 2/4 of the corners were smashed in like someone hit them with the hammer (completely unacceptable and not something you could cover up with putty and stain) and considering how well it\u2019a Packed this has got to be due to a quality control issue at the warehouse or factory they are built/packed at Not to mention it has sheets of crumbly foam instead, which got everywhere and was an overall epic pain to repackage and send back to amazon.

Also make sure not to slide the benches as that will dislodge the foam padding on the leg bottoms and risk scratching your floor.

I have had at least 450 lb on one of these benches and was still sturdy as a rock. The material is very durable and easily cleaned. I was planning on this holding me over for a year or so, but honestly, until I can afford something ridiculous, I can see no need to replace the table. Took me and a roommate maybe 45 minutes to put together including clean up. Even comes with all necessary tools",
