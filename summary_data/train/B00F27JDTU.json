The vita is a great handheld and I would recommend it to anyone interested. Just look elsewhere.",

The Vita, after having it for around a year, admittedly doesn't get played that often anymore. I like that I can use it for playing my PS4 system remotely. Technically you can do the same for like two PS3 games as well. The biggest flaw I found was how the system makes my hands/wrist feel after playing for longer than 30 minutes. It's got a nice screen, touchscreen is cool too.",

The more this happened, the shorter it got. It won't even turn on at all now. No, I'm not forgetting to charge it. It won't even turn on while it's plugged in.",

It feels so much better in your hands, and the LCD scrren is, in my opinion, better than the OLED one. The only downfall is the switched O and X buttons, but after a couple of days, you'll get used to it. Don't forget, the original PS1's confirm button was O not X. Hope this helps.",

It is still little bit worse than 1000's, but i like this one more than 1000 which is the old one.",
