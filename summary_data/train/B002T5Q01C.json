I've tried a lot of the flushable liners currently on the market, and these are my favorite thus far, for the following reasons: \u2714 They hold up well under the insufferable weight of poop \u2714 They flush easily \u2714 They are cheaper than a lot of the other varieties out there Great product for cloth diapering parents!",

We have had better luck with sturdier variations that don't shift around in the diaper so easily. We did not experience any trouble with clogging of our stool when flushing these, which is great. Honestly though, I haven't had that trouble with other brands either. If your baby has skinnier legs, this may work fine for you. The price point is awesome!!",

That way, you just throw away the entire diaper, and the cover can be easily wiped out. The only use I find for these is to wipe babe's bottom after he uses potty.
