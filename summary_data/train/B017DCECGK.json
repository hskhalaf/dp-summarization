Lightweight and stays on so did not effect swim effort at all. May fail early if one attempted use them as everyday active sneaker but should last if used as designed. Also have a sturdy pair of Keens water shoes to use as everyday sneaker but they are little too heavy to swim with. The two are good pairing. Because of sock-like design, there is little extra room in toe area so if 1/2 size may consider ordering down.",

The original estimated ship date would have the shoe arriving while I was in the mountains camping. Michelle in customer service replied promptly and politely to my email. The shoes arrived much much earlier than estimated. Awesome!!! Now I can use them on my trip next week!! Thank you Outdoor Equipped!!",
