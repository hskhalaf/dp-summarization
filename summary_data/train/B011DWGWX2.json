I actually like that they are a little different than the standard ones - everyone knows they are mine, so none of the other coaches can steal them. Comes with a cool mesh bag, which I use to put pinnies in instead. (I recommend using a strap to collect the cones.)",

We received 50 cones (5 colors, 10 cones each), but they are paper thin (you can see through them in the attached pictures) and poorly made. I am unimpressed by the low quality of this product.",

The only thing I wish is that it had purple included in the color as most PE equipment come in a rainbow color set and I love to color code my lessons for easy student management.

You can set up grids and tell some kids to go to the red grid, the yellow grid, etc. It just makes things a little more clear. The only con is that these cones are not easy to stack up at the end of practice. With other cones, you stack them and they stay in place. These are convex more than conical, so a cone can slide around on top of the cones underneath. When you're collecting and stacking more than a few, they tend to slide apart awkwardly.",
