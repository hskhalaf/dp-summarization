      "text": "I had a single din kenwood radio in my car. Personally I wanted to add a radio with screen so I could play videos off my phone to my car screen. This jvc radio worked perfect. I have an iPhone and I also got the Apple hdmi to iPhone port. This allowed my iPhone screen to appear on my radio screen. Equalizer allows to great options to find the perfect sound quality you want. Only dislike was the custom background screen options. If it's a personal picture you could barely see the options on the home screen. Also USB port is only for charging. Other than that perfect buy.",

Only thing I could ask for is more screen customization and a truly adjustable eq but I do realize the model up(820bt) has that feature. I'm am pleased with sound quality due to the xover and sub options. It is a bit confusing at first with all the different connection options but take your time to learn the os and you'll be surprised how much you can do with the receiver. Seamless app integration including Spotify pandora iHeartRadio and Waze. Watch dvds in the back and listen to radio in the front. It does its job very well and I'm happy I purchased it.",

      "text": "The HDMI input is *Extremely* specific and will not function with most HDMI devices (Don't consider it a proper AV input) but, the worst part about this stereo is the LCD, it looks and feels like a color LCD from the early 90s, the viewing angles are 100% in front of it or nothing and *even then* the picture is washed out and very, very ugly. The included themes are hideous. It felt *worse* than non-brand Chinese double-dins that I've owned, if you're wondering why this is so cheap, from JVC with all these features, now you know. If you want something even remotely good looking and functional, pass on this.",
