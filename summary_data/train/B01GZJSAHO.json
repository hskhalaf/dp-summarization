I have used as my office chair all week, and my back and neck are less sore and achy. While it is somewhat of a myth that these balls will improve your \"core strength,\" what they do is force you to keep your head straight above your shoulders, in the proper posture. The 75 cm size, with the ring, makes it more usable in an office setting, keeps the ball from rolling away when not in use. Others in my office have tried and are getting their own.",
