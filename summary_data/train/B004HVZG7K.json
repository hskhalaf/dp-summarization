Stupidly easy to assemble, extremely sturdy, and very comfortable. Ive only gone as high as 15\u2019 but once i find the right tree ill go up higher. People complain about the harness but its really not that bad for coming with it. This is definitely a heavier stand but i apprecite that while up in the tree. Overall definitely reccomend for $140",

So I wouldn\u2019t recommend this for a long hike and set up or if you are planning on hunting in that area right away but is a good stand to set up in the morning or night before and go out. I was hesitant about the mesh seat when I bout it but it feels great was able to sit for 6 hours without problems. Lastly for the price you can\u2019t go wrong.",

CONS: The foam padding that covers the foot/gun rest tears easy, be careful. The padding covers are black, not camo. It sucks to carry on your back, kinda like every other stand.

It is very relieving whenever I'm in the stand and I have safety straps on climber to know that when I'm that high up that wont be dropping from stand.",

I have since removed it after installing it. The padding can make a small amount of noise and I don't really see much use for it.",
