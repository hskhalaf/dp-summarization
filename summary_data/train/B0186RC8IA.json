They have a natural-looking candle flicker and the remote is easy to use. Speaking of the remote, it recently stopped working and I contacted Antizer through Amazon. They responded immediately, and sent me a new remote along with an additional free candle! I can't say enough good things about these candles or the customer service of Antizer. Highly recommended.",

The great little remote gives you all kinds of options...on/off, timer for 2/4/6/8 hrs, brightness level and lighted candle or not. No glass to break, no smoke, no melted wax and no hunting for matches. You will love these candles.",

      "text": "I had one of these on continually for close to 2 weeks and it's still going strong. I love the realistic flicker and it serves it's purpose. I would definitely recommend these and will buy more when I get ready to decorate for Christmas again. It gives off a very nice amber glow. I am still amazed at how long it lasts! I had other tealights that don't go as long. This is a lovely well made battery operated candle. I haven't even used the remote control ---but when I do I will update my review.",

These flameless candles fill their place in the middle of that centerpiece perfectly! I never tried the timer function as I only turned them on when I was home to enjoy them. The flames actually flicker and are pale yellow in color (not orange like a lot of LED candles).",

I am going to buy a few more sets. They are beautiful for weddings.,parties, and for home ,or Holiday use. I can't say enough about how happy I am to have these.",

      "text": "These candles are absolutely gorgeous! I have had many battery operated candles in the past & these are the most beautiful & realistic looking that I\u2019ve ever seen. They are dipped in wax so it makes them look even more realistic and the flickering of the flame is so beautiful. It gives a great soft Amber lighting to the room. The picture doesn\u2019t do it justice. Just get them! They are gorgeous!",

      "text": "I have a Luminara candle that i was gifted and I love. However, when looking at buying several candles, I did not want to pay the hearty price. These candles are so comparable. The ONLY two differences are as follows: 1.) the timer function relies on a controller, versus a switch on the bottom of the candle. The only risk with that is if the controller dies, so does that function. 2.) these candles use two AA batteries versus the Luminara 2 D batteries, so they do have to be replaced much more often. The nifty thing is, with these, you can control brightness, length of \u201con\u201d time, candle vs light function, etc. overall, amazing value for the product!",

      "text": "I really like the look of these, especially since they are thinner than most LED candles. I liked getting a collection of different sizes all together. I liked the look of them when lit. The likes stop there though. I have several different LED candles that I've bought over the years and I've never seen any of them burn through batteries like these do. They burned through 2 sets of brand new AAs in about 1 week. I also tried rechargeable batteries and they burnt through them in a week and a half. I don't know what these LED candles are doing but it is ridiculous. Seriously disappointed, would never, ever, ever buy them again.",

      "text": "Got 2 sets of these. They look great, work great, love everything about them except that they drain all life out of batteries in about 3 weeks no matter if the LED is even on. This means while \"on\" is pushed on the candle, turning the light on or off with the remote is meaningless to the battery, it will still drain. I manually turn each of them on when i want to use them so as to not go through 12 double A's at least once a month....",

      "text": "When I was young and dumb, I thought to myself, why would you buy fake candles? Just buy real ones! Then I got pet birds. These are pretty good; not great. The light is slightly too amber/orange, and the flickering not random enough. They look pretty good if you turn the highest part so you can't see the \"wick/flame\", or if they're above your head. The biggest giveaway is the reflected light on a wall/surface -- it doesn't look right. Also, they suck up battery pretty fast. That being said, I'm pretty happy with the atmosphere they give, and they were great during Halloween -- it's nice to set a timer, rather than worrying about blowing out candles!",
