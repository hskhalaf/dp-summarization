      "text": "This wand is wonderful. It is stronger than any other wand system ever purchased for playing with the cats. Including home-made wooden ones. More flexible. The toy attachment system has lasted longer than any other. There are some toys in the set that are stand alone toys and don't attach to the wand. They liked all of them except for the hard sisal-type mouse. Biggest hit was the fuzzy worm thingy. I had to buy more of those. The company made those available as a separate group because they were very popular.",

The clip that came with this wand was quite big and I imagine would hurt if she got hit with it. I do really like the thickness of the rope and the foam handle. I\u2019ll definetly be ordering refill feathers from this company as she really likes those and they flew and spun excellently.",

The little black mouse is my cat's favorite and she has a little destroyed it by now 3 months later. I wish I could buy some of the little mice by themselves. The wand is nice but it keeps wanting to come unscrewed so I gently used some pliers to tighten up and no more issues",

The only negative is a couple of the loose toys (not the ones that attach to the wand) did not hold up after only a few hours of extreme cat play. The cat literally tore them apart. They became an undone danger; rope pieces to be swallowed. The wand is sturdy and is still holding up well, even with my fat cat pulling it down and trying to bend it. She totally enjoys playing and exercising with it, jumping surprisingly high to catch the \"birds\". My cat is really fast!",
