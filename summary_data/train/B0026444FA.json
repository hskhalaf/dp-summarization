If you like chocolate and coconut, you'll enjoy this. I really enjoy ON's Gold Standard 100% Whey protein. It really works for me. The amino acids blunt that lactic acid build-up that causes so much of the soreness after a good day at the gym. Consider their creatine to add to your post-workout shake.",

The chocolate coconut flavor is a little intense for me and a 1-to-1 ratio is too strong for my liking, so I dilute the serving just a bit.

      "text": "Optimum Whey Gold Standard has always been great for me through the years. Upgrading to Prime got me to purchase through Amazon, and I was excited at seeing Chocolate Coconut as a flavor. It did not disappoint. Tastes fine with water, and delicious with milk. I often look forward to having my shake. The coconut flavor wasn't too artificial/disgusting, it just added a mellow, tropical sweetness.",
