I washed it with my laundry when I came home and it held up perfectly! Very excited to have this bag and will be purchasing for all of my children.. Update - 1 year in and about 10 trips later, the bag is starting to tear and the fabric is not holding up well. I still love it, just would like a more heavy duty fabric.",
