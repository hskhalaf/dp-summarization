The big openings in the bottle make it really easy to clean. Also it doesn't fit in a conventional cup holder of any sort, car, backpack water bottle pocket, bike, etc. Be prepared to carry it or figure a creative way to not have to carry it.",

The cap stows away in the the carrying hook so it stays out of my way and I don't have to continuously remove it. I really don't think I could ask for more in a water bottle.",

This bottle has served me well over the last year. However, it's absurdly difficult to clean. The worst part is the threading where the smaller cap screws onto the part you drink from. And I can't reach it with cleaning implements because the gunk is on the underside of the threading. No room to angle brushes or toothpicks or -anything-. I do like this bottle enough that I will be purchasing a replacement cap. Just be warned - these things get gross after a year even if you clean them regularly.",

I used to carry it around with me in my backpack but it ended up leaking all over my work laptop one night. I figured it was my own fault and resolved to tighten the cap more but today, it leaked again. I'll definitely keep it for home use, but I won't be carrying this around with me again.",

Well with this new bottle I can't! Several times I have found my bed just drenched in water because of it leaking! I'm so disappointed with this product.

The only other issue I have is that the mouthpiece can sometimes drip water when pulling it away from your mouth, making you look like youve never had a bowl of moose soup in your life...

Some people have complained about peeling of the lid, but I haven't had any issues - I hand wash it. And not to mention the size is great as well. I fill it up at work and it lasts me a good 4 - 5 hours at my desk until lunch when I fill it up again. I love not having to get up and fill up every hour or so. I plan on buying another to keep one at home and one at work.",
