At the beginning of our weight-loss journey we weighed a total of over 500lbs and both of us did step ups and knee repeaters on this step at the same time with no problem. We use this step for everything from step ups, to low squats, as a bench for chest presses, flys, for tricep dips, and just about anything else you could think of. Love having this piece in my home gym.",

I was able to go to Gin Miller's website and purchase the original Step Video and the Power Step video's for under $20.00 each instead of paying an insane $48.00 dollars. Gin Miller is the person who invented the original step and the video. She is awesome. This step works perfect and if you are heavy it will hold your weight without cracking.",

I would recommend this to those that are looking for a step like this. You can also use it as a step stool if doing something else around the house. I like that it can be adjusted to three different heights quickly without using any tools. It is wide enough and long enough to fit your needs.",
