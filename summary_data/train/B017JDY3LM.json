Pros - Cooks quickly without burning food easily - Nonstick works as advertised - Difficult to burn anything - Great quality for the price Cons - I wish an additional lid was included in the package",

The steam holes in the lids were a really nice surprise, although they are a little bit small so depending on how much steam I'm working with, sometimes I still have to set them down cockeyed to avoid bubbling. Cons - the handles on the pans and the small pot are loosening up over time. Hasn't been a problem at all while cooking but I notice it when I'm holding onto the handles. Overall 7/10 would recommend. Good value for the price.",

Other than that the pots are very useful and cook food well. Another thing is that in the first day of using the pots they will give off a certain burnt chemical smell even after I had washed them.
