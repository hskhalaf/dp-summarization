It is a wonderful natural product that I use for every household job from cleaning the bathroom to walls to non wood floors to the garage door, removing dirt, mildew whatever to prepping the walls before painting. You don't need much. Suggestion: using a toothpick poke several holes in the top of the paper seal instead of removing it. This way you can spray a smaller amount into the container your using...instead of glugging it in and using too much.",

Since the real stuff is incredibly expensive, we needed something for more everyday use and this stuff works well. It contains enough orange oil to kill pet odors and to leave floors smelling clean and fresh. It doesn't impart the same shine as the real stuff, but if you think of this as a lower-cost filler for everyday use, it is great. We've bought this item repeatedly and will continue to do so as long as the manufacturer doesn't change its formula and messes up the product.",

      "text": "Citra Solv has been one of my favorite cleaners for years, it's powerful, and it smells divine, everybody loves the smell of my house after I clean w/CitraSolv. The only thing you need to watch-out for, is that it is truly a solvent, and it will damage plastics, ie make them \"gummy,\" if you put it directly on full-strength, so dilute it properly for cleaning. If you need to use a solvent to get rid of something like mineral scale on plastic, use white vinegar. It is not a bleach of any kind, fyi.",
