My son goes behind it and loves selling me, the food and pretends to drive away. It is a great imaginary toy for him...and works on counting and colors and things like that. His older sister (12) will even play with it too haha (but I'm sure she wouldn't admit to it to other people).",

My only suggestion for improvement of pls would be a horn that beeps, and maybe some driving sounds when the gears are played with. Wasn\u2019t too terribly difficult to construct, have a screwdriver ready. Can\u2019t beleive the amazing price I was able to purchase this at! Under 60 was a steal!

We were disappointed, though, that the truck itself makes no car sounds---a honking horn or engine sound would have been neat when she pretends to drive it.

But, this was one of the most annoying purchases I have ever ordered from Amazon!! What made it worse is that it was a gift. I kept getting notices that it would be late, and then I'd get another notice that it would be even later. This kept going for weeks. I bought it on Prime Day so was a reduced price and I felt like they just kept trying to get me to cancel the order.",

If you can find this, not easy to do, then i recommend buying it and putting it up for a child within the 1 yr. to 4 yr. old range. Even older kids loved this and played with it",
