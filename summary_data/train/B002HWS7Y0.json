It looks like the button was not crimped properly. This may not sound like a big deal, but it ruins the the whole thing. We've tried several ways to put the button back together, but it won't stay together. An upholstery shop or a special tool is what it needs. I've now seen other reviews of this product with the same problem, so it's a problem the manufacturer and Amazon should know about. If I can return this one, I'd order another one",

I had to go to 3 hardware stores to find a particular bolt to fit it. It was really odd! Also, now the stitching near two of the tufted buttons is coming undone. We do not abuse the ottoman. I just occasionally rest my socked feet (no shoes) on the ottoman, and once in awhile sit on it, but why is the stitching now coming apart around two of the tufted buttons? Very disappointed. Have only had it about 3 months I think. Thus, I would hesitate to recommend it.",

I purchased two of them to use in front of my couch instead of one large ottoman because the room is smaller and this gave me a little more flexibility with how I could set the room up. We are using it to store our library books in our musical instruments in our homeschool room.",

You only need to screw on the feet and it's ready to go. We are able to fit 4 blankets inside, which is what we were looking for. Would be perfect for storing a few games or whatever else you need.
