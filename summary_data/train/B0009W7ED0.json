The side handles are fused. This is what you want...heats evenly and I even made gravy on the top of the stove after the bird was done. Proved to heat evenly and was excellent. Cant even tell you how many pans I have thrown away for this reason alone. Even heat is everything. Spot on in every way.",

The end handles curve it which makes other things fit easily in the stove with it, the inner rack is durable and easy to clean. I do hand wash this, as I do with all my cookware, but it's worth it!

This year's turkey was the most beautiful and juiciest ever. All this and it looked gorgeous, too. I know there are lot of cheaper roasting pans but overall I am thrilled with this one.",

      "text": "We bought the Calphalon roasting pan after reviewing many styles in stores and on-line. It was priced well by Amazon and my son gave my wife a gift certificate to Amazon. The pan was used the day it arrived to cook a turkey. My wife was overly pleased with the rack, its fit in the oven and the large handles. She now uses it for chicken, roasts and turkey. It is very easy to clean, the stainless steel is truly stainless. I get the job of cleaning and there is no scrubbing on this one. We are very pleased.",

We made our Thanksgiving turkey in it, it worked great and the lift out rack is nice also, rack keeps meat off from bottom of pan. I was worried how it would clean up but it cleaned beautifully, very easy clean up. Might have cost a bit more but I always say you get what you pay for and it is well worth it.",
