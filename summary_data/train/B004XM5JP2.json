It's very heavy, absorbent, and long. He bought me a robe for Christmas, and it's okay, but we both wish he had bought one of these. As for some people's comments that it falls apart....I bleach this every time I wash it and line dry it. So far it has held up fine. My husband is 5ft 10 and around 200 lbs. He got the XL. He might have been fine with a large, but I'd rather it be a little big than too tight.",

You can tell it's made of a quality thick cotton, HOWEVER, when you first use it and get it wet my husband (who I bought it for) experienced tons of blue shedding all over his body. So much shedding that he didn't want to use it again. We found a solution online of washing it in hot water with a 1/2 a cup of baking soda in the laundry and it 'sealed' the fibers so that it no longer sheds. Aside from that it's a great luxurious robe.",

Apparently Turkish cotton is better at drying/evaporating the moisture that it absorbs compared to Egyptian cotton while Egyptian cotton supposedly absorbs a little more water to help dry you. I'm not wearing this robe all the time right after the shower, I'm just wearing it around the house when I'm feeling lazy, so I feel more comfortable with the Turkish cotton (which it's made from).",

Not so great. 2) The robe is so long that it is actually kind of difficult to walk in. Have to keep steps very small and short.",

      "text": "I would live in this robe 24/7 if convention allowed, but it's kind of hard to explain walking the dog in it, especially in the rain. It is luxurious and comfortable, but very heavy. In fact, the reason for four stars instead of five is because I'm really concerned about laundering it. It will need a heavy duty washing machine and a long time in the dryer or the sun, whenever that may return. I hope it doesn't shrink because the just-below-ankle length is just what I wanted. I'd be happy to add to this once the robe has been laundered.",

I'm not sure how the price compared to what I could've gotten in a store, but I will say the price that I paid is very fair (even a little low actually) based upon the quality of the product we received.",

This one goes to mid-finger length when hanging, but when sitting and resting my arms on a table while writing reviews of things I have bought on Amazon, the sleeves pull back to my wrists.
