I'm guessing the manufacturer is using a cheap regulator, there can't be this many reviews with regulator problems to conclude otherwise. I tried the reset procedure, etc. Still little tiny flame regardless of the control setting. Also, I too have had challenges not burning the pizza's (when the regulator was working). I have established a workaround process rotating and screens, but I wouldn't buy this again. I recommend you find a better solution than this oven.",

The oven gets hot pretty fast with the door closed and only takes a few minutes to get to the type of pizza we love. I do have to rotate it about every 20-30 seconds.

After a bit you can always slide it off the parchment and directly on the stone, but you don't have to. Experiment with shapes, move the pies around including off the stone and closer to the top of the oven as needed. Have fun.",

He loves it & I enjoy eating whatever comes out of it!",
