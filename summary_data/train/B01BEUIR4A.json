I will play with the adjustment and maybe add some stones to get a little more \"rush\" sound rather than trickle/pouring water. Set up super easy, had it running in 5 minutes after unpacking.

A previous fountain I had which was ceramic was damaged by landscapers so I went for resin this time. If using inside, I recommend placing a towel under the fountain as when it first starts the water does jump out of the bottom pot when it first starts up. Wouldn't be an issue if placed on tile floor but would be an issue on hardwood.",
