When I opened the carry-bag, it had a strong chemical scent. The rubber figurines have a strong chemical scent that doesn't seem to go away. Of course my son put them in his mouth right away, and Owl's painted on eyes are peeling off---so what's that paint made of? Despite the chemical problem, they are just too big. They take up a lot of space. I thought they were the size of Fisher Price Little People. Wish I returned them!",

I am very pleased with it and the service I received. It was packaged nicely. Thank you.",

It was hard to get him to put them down to open his other presents. All the figures are larger than I expected. If your little one is a fan of Pooh, Tigger, & the gang, it doesn't matter that these are bath toys, he'll love them. The bath bag is a nice quality with suction cups to keep in the bath.",

      "text": "These are larger than they look in pic. They are really squishy which my 7 month old loves and they do not have any holes in them so no water gets in them. My daughter loves to chew them. They are really cute but I paid $25 for them. I see the price is up to $36 now. Update: My daughter is now 16 months and still loves these. The paint is coming off Tigger and Piglet where she has chewed his ear. I see the price is now over $100 which is ridiculous. Like I said I paid $25 and they were great investment as they are my daughter's favorite toys.",
