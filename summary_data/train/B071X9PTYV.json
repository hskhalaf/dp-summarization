I probably will not have them in three years and that, again, for the price, make them an excellent value. Great if cooking for two people, these are not very big. That said, pay attention to how they are used, If you need to cook something on the stove top that requires high heat, use another pan. Don't use canned spray oil. Do not ever put metal utensils anywhere near the pan; ust like almost all cad pots and pans, they chip/scratch easily. No Dishwasher, no need, they are easy to clean.",

My brand new pots and pans all have burned, blackened handles. Even though these pans are very reasonably priced, it\u2019s still a waste of money. So disappointed!",

(As for the other reviewers who have said it still gets burn marks on the bottom even when cooking on medium heat, that has not been my experience at all. Mine are in pristine condition.)",
