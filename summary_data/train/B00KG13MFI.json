I do recommend a good weather protecting spray to help repel water. The cover does a \"good\" job repelling water but the seams do allow leakage without the help of a seam sealer or water repellent spray. I recommend Star Brite waterproofing. I recommend and would purchase this cover again.",

The tie downs are very good and the price was cheaper than the others so that was a pleasant surprise. This one even comes with vents (very important) at no extra cost. The material is a little heavier (600) which I like. I have been averaging 1-1.1/2 years with the previous ones in the south Florida sun.",
