I plan on using a coat of polyurethane on them to help with that. I keep one on my ottoman and another on my dining table and they were fine for the purpose I'm using them for. I wouldn't say they would be great for actual food serving bc of the sealing issue. You may want laquer trays if you are going for that.",

Unfortunately, the small tray had a broken handle when it arrived. I spoke with the company and they treated me well, handled my issue quickly and refunded my money immediately.
