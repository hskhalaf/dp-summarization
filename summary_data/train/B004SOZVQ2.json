I do and he was right about the better taste in coffee. Besides, I never have to worry about having paper filters at the ready. I love this machine.",

The best improvement is the side float that tells you how much water is in the machine.

It's also more difficult to fill with water (since you can't really see what's going on inside) and we can't tell how much is left unless we open it up. I didn't think about these things but overall it's a bigger pain than the regular glass carafe.",

I liked it so much I bought another for my parents as a gift when their coffee machine died and they have enjoyed it as well. It's sleek and clean and it's basic with some nice extra functions as well. I am a coffee lover and I have other kinds of ways to brew coffee like a french press, a Keurig B60 and a Bialetti stovetop espresso maker and I by far use this one the most.",

I wish there was more effective quality control. I like the design and the lid has a quality feel to it. The warming plate for the carafe got really hot which was great. There are 3 settings for this. Very impressive look and I couldn't tell from looking at it that it was plastic instead of stainless steel. I went ahead and ordered another one from Warehouse Deals. Hopefully I'll have better luck this time.",
