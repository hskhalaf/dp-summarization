      "text": "Nicely designed and attractive. Holds 3 bottles with built in separation to cushion the cargo. Tall enough to handle most bottle shapes. Has two zippered pockets to house tools and misc.. Can hold a rabbit sized opener but its going to protrude a bit. Otherwise, plenty of room to hold your Laguiole and screen. Its not going to handle a big funnel but should handle the narrow modern style funnel. My only criticism is that the it features a web shoulder strap when a leather one would have really set it all off nicely. Nice construction, good detail and nice finish work. Very light. Highly recommend.",

It can carry up to 3 bottles of wine if needed! Or you can do like we do and carry one bottle of wine two nice wine mugs and a decanter for letting the wine breath before drinking! In either case it is a nice accessory to your travel luggage or afternoon picnic!",
