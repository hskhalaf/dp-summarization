I'll definitely buy a wig from this company again!",

It's not that easy and they won't stay where you put them without being sprayed--a lot. Still deciding what to do. The wig cap that comes with the wig is excellent and very helpful.",

The wig would fall back slightly but I could readjust, and it has two drawstrings to hold in place. To give some insight. I wore this wig for a half marathon as a costume. It stayed in place, AND my head wasn't overheated. I love it for costumes. I don't think the quality could be said for everyday use but I'm not an expert. It is VERY tangled following the race. I have not tried to untangle yet.",
