      "text": "Bought my first headset on March 27, 2017 and they were perfectly fine. Great sound quality, microphone was amazing, and they were comfortable. Fast forward 7 months and the stitching on the earphone ripped. Another month and the other earphone stitching ripped. By the one year mark I figured I would give them another try because they were on sale. $149.99 -> $129.41 Bought the 2nd pair on April 7, 2018 and its now November 23, 2018 and the earphone stitching has ripped again. I would advise purchasing a different headphone if you want long lasting ones. Although great, they will not last more than a year if your lucky.",

      "text": "This is the second HyperX headset I have purchased. The original HyperX's mic started making static every time I had moved it. This product itself is great, Kingston makes these headsets feel premium without a huge price tag. I am a bit let down however that this is their flagship headset but the older versions have more accessories. The headset is geared towards gamers but it is a bit subtle and sleek in its design. The comfort level on this headset is great! I can wear for hours on end and it feels light yet is securely on your head. I would recommend this item.",

The sound was great for about two weeks and then would short circuit (or something) and shock/electrocute my ears and killed the picture (black out) on my PS4 for about 5 seconds before returning, Not a pleasurable experience! I sent them back and went with the Cloud II's, which to be honest do not sound as good as the Revolver S, and do not have working inline controls like the Revolver on PS4.",

      "text": "The sound and overall quality of the headset is excellent! My one gripe (and the reason I only gave 4 stars) is that the headband uses a tension system to hold itself in place, and it isn't very helpful if you have a smaller or more narrow head shape. It can place some of the weight on your ears instead of your head. Also, some people mention hitting the metal part of the headband makes noise that you can hear--which is true, though I don't find myself hitting the metal (and don't see this as a problem).",

The Headset is a bit heavy, if you dont have a big head it puts a bit of strain on your ears. Im looking into a way to modify it to sit properly on my head.

Unfortunately I believe my headset came with a defective mic port as no one seems to be able to hear me on both PC and PS4. I called Kingston customer support and they were very nice and knowledgeable, and even overnighted me a new mic. The new mic did not resolve my issue and so I returned the headset to Amazon.

(PC) The sound quality of the headset is of pretty good quality, however, it runs very quiet and does a poor job of isolating outside noise. In addition, wires/plugs on the headset wear out rather quickly, and fall out of their sockets for constant annoyance. The preset sound options are useless, as they only make the sound shift to a certain part of the headset (Front/back etc). Summed up, the headset as not impressed me enough to justify the price. I've played with a variety of high end to low end headsets and this one seems to be on the lower end of the spectrum.",

The sound quality is excellent (I'm not an audiophile, so I won't get into highs, lows, ohms, whatever here), and the voice comes through very well in Discord and in game. The quality of the headset is excellent and I can see it lasting for a good while. I was nervous about over the ear cups, but they are very comfortable and I don't get hot wearing them. It's a good purchase and I highly recommend it.",

I am so disappointed that even if the dongle isn't supported that maybe it should bring one that does... maybe one that has 3.5mm for party chat and optical for the console itself. Now i am unsure of whether or not i am going to be keeping this because of the short comings. I love the quality and feel but not getting the full virtual 7.1 dolby surround is a deal breaker, on top of not having the dongle controls.",
