Small enough to stick in a back pocket and whip out to clean out shrubs or expand it to use as a 'big hand\" to pick up debree quickly, or make it narrow to reach into shrubs to clean out old leaves and debree. Added bonus is that the handle is red for quick location in keeping track of tools. Just love this tool!",
