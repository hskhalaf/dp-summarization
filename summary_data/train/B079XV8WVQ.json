      "text": "This veil is CHEAP and not at all what is pictured. I tried to return the item but had trouble locating a package that it would fit in. So, now I am stuck with this garbage. My fault. However, what I received typically sell for $9. I ordered and paid for the item in the photo. This does not tie down but has cheap, elastic that goes under arms. What this results in, in NC humidity, is terrible chaffing. The veil also blocks anything below so you are constantly readjusting to be able to see clearly. Maybe for a casual bystander but not for someone actively working a hive.",
