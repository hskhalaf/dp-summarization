Those little beads get stuck in my beard on occasion, scrub scent isn't great, wish it was in cream form instead of liquid form, and the cost is way too much. This product does have good cleaning power, and a semi-refreshing quality. I've been trying a lot of different facial scrubs/cleaners to find what works for me. This one doesn't, though the ManCave Olivestone scrub does, and it's 1/4 the price. Hope that helps!",

I have to use an intensive scrub and black mask to get rid of my white and black heads. This face wash doesn't really help with this issue. The goods news is I am buying it again because it keeps my face in good shape, smells good, and I have to admit, the black bottle is aesthetically pleasing for me.",

If you are someone that has purchased this I encourage you to compare the two. I am not sure what they were going for but it is quite strange.

I use it just about every day and I get around 5 months of usage out of one bottle. I follow up this with the Rugged & Dapper facial moisturizer after shaving.",
