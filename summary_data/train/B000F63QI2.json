Should have bought the one from goodwill for $50...it was more accurate...it was the better quality scale. Even tho this was \"cheaper\" I would expect that the quality standards should apply for all healthometer scales so I am disappointed but don't have the energy to send back. Lesson learned. Don't buy online. Should see/test product in person.",
