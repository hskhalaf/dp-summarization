Good idea to examine the decor when you get it, nearly cut my finger on a sharp (thumbtack-like) piece sticking out near the top, which I just simply chipped off (would have cut a fish if they rubbed against it, for sure.) Other than that, no problems, bit pricey but worth it for fish that would interact with it.",

I've done a 15% water change 3 days in a row without an improvement in water quality so I decided to take out the mangrove. Waiting to see if this is the issue. It did smell pretty bad when I took it out.",

It didn't shader because of careless shipping the thing is actually really fragile. so I called up wag.com and told them it broke and they had another one shipped right away and the customer service was amazing. They also let me keep the broken one and I just went to petco the next day and picked up some aquarium safe glue for 8 bucks. I ended up with two which turned out weird because they look exactly the same so I can't put them in the same tank. But over all the product is good lookin.",
