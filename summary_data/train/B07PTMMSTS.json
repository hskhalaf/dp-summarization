I use this mainly for playing CoD: Warzone, and I can hear EVERYTHING. I also have the mixamp which helps, as my settings allow for footsteps to be heard clearly. I'm now never surprised by someone who may be even crouched and walking, as you can still hear steps although very very slightly. Even if these headphones are damaged (I reckon they'll last me years), I 'll be getting another. For gaming, and watching movies, and everything in between, I use these headphones. Well worth it but expensive.",

The build quality is outstanding and the sound is fantastic the ear cups cover my large ears easily and are very comfy on long gaming sessions and the pro amp is fantastic that I have complete control of game/chat at my fingertips. If you don\u2019t mind having a wired gaming headset these are fantastic but I wanted a wireless set and went for the Astro a50 which are a little more expensive but worth the extra in my opinion.",
