      "text": "Didn't look at the dimensions before I bought this, so that's my fault, but it's the size of a large book. I was also hoping that the cover would be removable like most video game cases, but it's a plastic cover with print on it. Does not come off. It's good for owning a lot of Switch games, but i don't see why 3ds cases can fit like 20 games in them and are still the size of a 3ds game case but Switch cartridge cases with similar capacity are 3 times larger than a Switch game case unless you get a travel case. Anywho, TL:DR big case, large capacity, not exactly portable.",

Prio to purchasing this beautiful Nintendo Switch cartridge holder I was using HORI cartridge/game holder, but I didnt like that you litteraly had to fight to snap them off and to secure them safely.",
