      "text": "We're finishing the first season with these balls and I've been so pleased! Our league has a 4 homers/game rule and out of 7 games we've gone over the limit 3 times. These balls are extremely responsive even though they comply with the new standards of ASA. There's not any wondering when we get into a ball. I won't name our precious brand but it felt like we were hitting with foam nerf balls. I'll try to remember to update through the summer and fall to let y'all know endurance wise how they hold up. 7 games in and besides losing a few to a treeline some 370ft away the balls we have are in like new condition.",

      "text": "ASA some years back switched to the 52 .cor 300lb compression. Dudley makes the most durable and quality ball. The leather cover provides a better grip and feel and protects against ball wear and tear during a game or practice. I play in a league that requires managers to provide game balls and other managers tend to go cheap and buy non Dudley with composite covers and the performance is simply not the same. These balls have never disappointed. Seller quick to send.",
