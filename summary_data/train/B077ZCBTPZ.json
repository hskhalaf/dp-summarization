However, a considerable number of users were not able to benefit from the trainer because it fit too small and narrow. Some people also disfavored the \u201crubber ball\u201d in the heel section of the sole. But in the end, many owners still recommended it because of the comfort it delivered.",
      "pros": [
        "Many users agreed that the Reebok Cloudride DMX 3.0 was comfortable for casual wear",

      "cons": [
        "Some purchasers complained that the footwear ran small and narrow than what they expected",
        "This walking shoe lacked support and felt unstable, according to several wearers",
        "A few users griped about the ball-like structure in the heel portion as it pushed the foot to slide forward and put pressure on the toes"

I've slept on pillows that weren't as plush as these shoes, but with that said I've also had pillows that would have made for a better looking shoe than these, ha. Looks of course are subjective and I wasn't quite sold on the looks before purchasing but bought them anyway because I knew that Reebok's DMX line of shoes are hard to beat when it comes to plush comfort right out of the box.",

Just one note though, the non-flat sole makes it feel that you are unbalanced. it will take time and thread wear to flatten it out. Meanwhile, it feels smaller that it seems. Therefore, get a bigger size than usual. Once again, I got it on sale so it WELL WORTH IT!",
