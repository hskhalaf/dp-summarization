I am using this drive in the car for music only. Also brought another 128gb samsung at the same time. No problem with the samsung. Just like other reviewer mentioned, this particular 128gb sandisk runs super hot. Worse of all. This card skips music randomly... I know because I swap this with the samsung between 2 cars, and it seem to happen only on this card, so it's not the car.... I have another SD card that is SanDisk which I used for camera only. Also starting to having issues with it....",

If the flash drive gets too hot (if it surpasses operating temperature) then it will eject itself from the computer. This flash drive is practically useless to me as I need to transfer 30+ GB file sizes. Because it gets too hot easily, it will disconnect itself before the transfers are finished. If you only need to transfer small files (< 10GB) at a time then this works perfectly fine. But if you work with large files like I do then save your money and find a better flash drive that can handle heat.",

With plastic, the part inside will be hotter and the outside of the plastic will be cooler.

The encryption software is pure crap; a free seemingly beta program that is there to get you to buy an upgrade. It is slow and not intuitive. The encrypted folders are not hidden from view. Basically you get a free sample of encryption software I certainly wouldn't pay to upgrade after trying it. If you want encryption on a flash drive, the Kingston Datatraveler Vault is the way to go. Alternately there are a number of third party encryption programs that are much-much better than what Sandisk provides with this drive.",

It doesn't get that hot even after using for hours of transmitting data back & forth, and it is solidly made and simple to use - plug it in, create ID & PW for protection and copy/paste or drag/drop. And, the data transfer speed is super fast. Highly recommend it.",

I used it to download media creation tool and boot up my new PC with no issues. This thing is 16GB! And for its price definitely worth it. Few cons (but minor): - heats up fairly quickly if connected to the port for 15 minutes and over. - good built but could be slight better Okay that's all I have ^o^",
