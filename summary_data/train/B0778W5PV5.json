Just so you all know.. if the inside unit led display doesn't light up.. just unscrew the screw on the remote unit.. plug the loose wire in and its good to go!! Been running two days.. keeps the temp in the workshop at a constant 70 degrees.. It is beyond quiet.. I had to go to the back of the work shop to see if it was even running, cause you can not hear it!! I am very pleased with this purchase.",

I hired a professional company to install it, they did not have any complaints, and it was a smooth procedure. The reason I bought this 18,000 Btu rather than a 12,000 Btu unit for aproximately 500 square feet area, was because of the 18 foot high point of the ceiling, 10 Windows, and the Florida heat. The price made it easy to upgrade from the 12,000 Btu to the 18,000 Btu. We are very satisfied with this purchase. The remote has a lot of features for the users.",

The install is easy if you have any experience working with basic carpentry and plumbing tools. If not I wouldn't attempt it without guidance. I installed within 3 hours and our local HVAC guy tested the pressure, vacuum and released the refrigerant within a 1 1/2 hour visit.
