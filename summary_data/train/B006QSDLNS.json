I liked the bright red of this to match the interior of my jeep. Loads of plastic will make it easier to wipe clean than my son's horrid high back booster (seriously, kids are gross and too much fabric makes it harder to get super clean). The padding isn't thick, but my son says it's comfortable. \"Like sitting on a cloud,\" is what he actually said, but he's nearing 7 and awfully dramatic.",
