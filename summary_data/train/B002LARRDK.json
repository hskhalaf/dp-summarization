      "text": "We bought this little internet radio 11 years ago. It's still going strong, although we did have to replace the battery a year or so ago. The sound quality is exceptional. We have used it for hours every day since we bought it \u2014 I'm guessing at least 20,000 hours total. It's portable and can be easily carried around the house or out into the garden. It's so much easier to use than using an iPhone connected to a Bluetooth speaker. We use it to listen to our local NPR radio station but also to our favorite foreign radio stations such as France Culture and France Inter, and also to podcasts. I can't understand why it was discontinued by Logitech.",

But truth be told, it is very nice to just push a button and hear the music that you want to hear. The sleep timer is a real bonus as you can go to sleep to your favorite music. I don't know that I would recommend this as the most \"open\" platform, but the music that it does stream sounds pretty good.",

Lots of lag between screens. Disappointing interface. Thankfully there is a smart-phone app that works slightly better and can be used to send music to the squeezebox directly without using this annoying interface on the radio itself. Still...the only way this provides headache-free operation is by plugging into the stereo with an auxillary cord on the back of the unit, which is sad. A $10 radio can do that for me.",

You can have something different in each room or synchronize them o play the same thing in multiple rooms. The sound quality is very nice, but not stereo. The price is a little high, and sometimes you have to fiddle around to get them to synch properly, but not often. They will play your music files, internet radio station and with apps you can play your Sirius/XM favorites and even your Pandora stations.",

I got the Smash Box for my husband so he could listen to the radio anywhere in the house. It is a portable unit as I'd hoped and the sound is great. We now only pay for an internet subsription to Sirius, which is a big savings. For some reason the Sirius stations will play for a while and then just stop, it seems to be something with permissions. I'm sure we'll figure it out soon enough. This is a great product!",
