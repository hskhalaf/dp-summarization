I have emailed the seller, but no answer as of two days later. Only asking for that replacement piece, as we don't want to remove all of them because it may damage the $200 skimboard. Hopefully the company upholds it's claim to 'guarantee of a lifetime adhesive'. I will report back next week. Here we are 2 weeks later and the seller never responded to me asking about sending a replacement piece. Very disappointing.",

I have yet to take my board into the water so it isn't 'battle tested' just yet but I can leave a follow-up review on that. I highly recommend this product, but I have not been in the water yet but I am pretty confident that these pads will hold up.",

Punt Surf sends a follow-up email after purchase to make sure evrything is good with the product, so I was able to email them back directly about the situation and they immediately refunded me no questions asked!

I had to take them off and reapply to get them right. Then after some use they started to peel off the board from the bottom up. I had to get 3M spay adhesive in order to actually make them stick again so be careful when applying them. Get out a ruler and a pencil and make sure you get them where you want them. Overall decent pads; again a little bit small especially if you're using a bigger skimboard. Good for the price though.",
