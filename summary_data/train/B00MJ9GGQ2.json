Not sure if this was just a bad batch but couldn't return; just threw them away. I reordered the same treats but through a different company. Hopefully, they are received fresh!!!!",

I teach classes and if a dog simply isn't interested, I dig around to see if I have any of these in my pouch. Great value for the price and quality. Good ingredients, big bag. Very happy with the Plato brand. The only downside is that I do have to break these up into about a dozen little treats for each \"bar\" they come in. But, I put the bars in my treat pouch and break them up while I have the dogs sit, stay, heel, etc. It really keeps their attention!",

The probiotic coating definitely works and is the main reason why I will continue buying this product. I love this brand because they use non-GMO ingredients.",
