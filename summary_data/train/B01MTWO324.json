We were surprised when our guys hoped right in so we set out to find the same bed. Happily , this is way more affordable than manynout there from the catalog companies. The bolster surround is nice and acts as a nice head or chin rest. The firm center sections seem to provide nice support And have crevices for legs/feet/chin spots. The photos are of our Large size bed. The dogs are 23 and 16 pounds.",
