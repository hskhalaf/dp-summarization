My plexiglass was not attached at the top but I was ready to hang a jersey so I decided just to deal with it. The frame looks wonderful but its lacking high quality. I'd say this is a medium quality frame for a medium quality price. Works for me to hang a jersey I won at a fundraiser silent auction.",
