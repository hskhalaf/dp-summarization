The cookbook is excellent - the recipes are easy to follow and easy to make for those like myself who are not that skilled in the kitchen. My only complaint would be that a lot of the recipes call for replacement items (i.e. vegan butter for butter, vegan cream cheese for cream cheese, etc.) instead of finding plant based ingredients that aren't made to mimic animal derived items. For this reason, I only make these recipes sparingly. But I must say that almost everything I've made has been excellent, I will continue using it, and I'd definitely recommend this!",

There is definitely a theme to her meals which I would categorize as Thai, Indian or Middle Eastern types of foods. Many use the same ingredients and can be made in 30 mins or less. However, as most vegetarians/vegans know, you have to plan what meals you'll be making to make sure you have the ingredients in hand. Once you've got her basics you're set! I love the Vegan No Tuna Salad Sandwich and the Thai Baked Sweet Potatoes.",

One of the many joys of the whole food, plant-based lifestyle is learning the science behind what we eat. Thanks to luminaries such as Dr. T. Colin Campbell and Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn we know that added oils in foods are very damaging to our arteries and contribute to serious chronic disease. I have learned that cooking without oil is easy and tasty, and since there is no such thing as a \"heart healthy\" oil, I will simply omit the oil from these recipes. The book itself is beautifully put together and I look forward to using it often, hopefully.",
