Also, in this design you can squeeze hard to get the water on the bottom of the bottle out without popping the top off.",

It goes without saying, but you must of course wash the bottle thoroughly at least once a day, or it will promptly get smelly.

Obviously I found that both disturbing and sad so I wanted to have water ready for her at all times. She loves it!!! I keep it in the cup holder when we drive and on the night stand when we are home. She\u2019s always thirsty when she wakes and I\u2019m glad I can make her happy with little effort. Such a great product and price! Not to mention, say to clean!",

      "text": "While I love the concept and overall it does what it needs to do, It's a bit hard to squeeze. It does fit nicely in a car's cupholders. However, you have to squeeze it with both hands and hold it there so the top cup remains filled with water. If you let go, no more water for your pooch. So, not a deal breaker but wish it was a bit easier to squeeze with one hand. It's great for traveling. I still used it quite a bit and seems to work vs. getting out a dish and filling it.",

Needless to say, our dog took to it right away and seems to enjoy it. A little too large for me to want to carry it around on our normal everyday walk, but will be a great solution for those longer outings. In future iterations, would love to see the ability to close or lock the bottle top so that I can store it in a backpack and don't have to worry about it getting squeezed and spilling while in transit. Otherwise, I have no complaints.",

I love that the water retracts when you release the bottle so less water is wasted. Easy to clean and more convenient than silicone pop up bowls that we also have. I\u2019m not sure what the strap around the center is for, but maybe I didn\u2019t read the description thoroughly. I would recommend this product!",
