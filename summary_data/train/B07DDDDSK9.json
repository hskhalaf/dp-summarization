Replaced my batter in the vehicle and then ran a crank and load test with the TT TOPDON AB101. Charing system is working well per the tool and haven't had any additional issues with my new battery since. Handy tool. Also tested our newer Subaru's battery and it shows as healthy as well.",

At first I liked to choose another brand since it was cheaper than this one, but the way it showed the result was a little bit confusing, at least for me. Luckily I decided to buy this brand eventually and it showed that the battery was in good condition. And I decided never to go to that auto repair shop again.",
