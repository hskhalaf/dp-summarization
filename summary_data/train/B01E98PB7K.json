      "text": "Edit 2020 The neck rubs and cuts up my neck pretty bad. I love the rest of the suit but after a long swim my neck is in pretty bad shape. Old review My wife and I both purchased these suits and I have used it for a year now and I can say that its our favorite suit we have ever had. I use it for recreational swimming and for triathlons. It is smooth in the water and keeps your butt and legs up to create less drag. The price is awesome and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a reliable suit at a good price.",

Now we can't even return it as they don't allow return once it's in the water. But how can you tell if you don't try it on in the water?",
