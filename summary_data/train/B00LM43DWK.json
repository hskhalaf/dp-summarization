I initially really disliked this one because it was so wide (I'm a female about 5' 7\" tall, not sure about my tongue size compared to others), felt like it was hard to manipulate, but once you get used to it it works fine. I think it comes down to preference, but its definitely bigger than Dr. Tungs",

      "text": "I was a bit nervous because of it being steel but I absolutely love it! I hate going through the day with the feeling of something on my tongue especially after a heavy meal or after smoking! I also use this tool in my daily dental hygiene routine! I used to use my toothbrush to clean my tongue but that was too harsh. This tongue cleaner is a nice smooth glide across the tongue and you can see the saliva on it when done! Easy clean up and storage is up to you but if you are a neat freak like me, I store it in a clean area.",

WOW, was I ever proved wrong by this thing. My mouth has never felt so clean. This is the only tongue scraper I have used but I can't imagine using anything else (ie a plastic one), everything about it superb and leaves my mouth feeling so much fresher than just brushing and using mouthwash. I cannot recommend it enough.",

The perforation on the packaging made opening it easy and the scraper slid out without dropping unsanitarily. The instructions state to wash it first, which I did with soap and hot water. I brushed my teeth first (as recommended), and then scraped my tongue efficiently without any pain. I went down my tongue about 3 times and the result was a pinker(/cuter) tongue and a fresher feeling in my mouth. I love this product! All the stars! I'm addicted and can't want to see the long-term impact on the looks and health of my tongue. Cheers to oral health!",
