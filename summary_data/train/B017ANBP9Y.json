It is about the same weight as an otterbox, but I like this design much better. Overall the screen clarity is good, and it does not seem to affect any of the functions. I am overall very pleased with this product. I travel alot with my ipad and I feel that I will be well protected and the price made it even better. Thank you",

The only problem I have had is the screen protector part of the case got very scratched, and was hard to see through. I got this particular case when bought my iPad Pro, 12.9 type 1 . For me this case fills the bill in the major thing I want in my cases , Safety and Protection! Try it you\u2019ll like it!",

      "text": "Looking for an iPad Pro 12.9\" case that can be used on the go? This is the one that we are happy with: with a built-in (rotating!) handle and kickstand, it is easy to support with one hand while the other uses the app. A little challenging to assemble, but it's my impression that cases with good protection are like that. Just got these, so can't speak to long-term durability, but appears well built, so we have high hopes in that regard.",
