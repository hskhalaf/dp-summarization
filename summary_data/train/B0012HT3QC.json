No, they didn't \"fix\" my heels but these shoes sure made it less uncomfortable to walk for any length of distance. So far, they appear to be very durable and clean easily with a quick wipe with a damp cloth. Rain and water are not an issue. These shoes are not cheap but they were very much worth the price just for the comfort level they gave me. Even without hell issues, they would still be a great value with all-day comfort.",

After a couple months I found they weren\u2019t supporting my feet as well. A few weeks later they started falling apart. The soles started separating from the uppers and they looked terrible. 3 months out of a $120 pair of shoes isn\u2019t acceptable. Glad I didn\u2019t buy the extra pairs. Sorry for the lack of pictures- I threw these away a while ago. Only writing because they were in my suggestions this morning.",
