With any heater, expect 2-3 years life and just plan to replace them, especially if you care about your pets(fish). Don't be cheap and expect them to last for much longer. They're the best priced, quality heaters, cheaper than the higher quality brands. The cons, they're clumsy to operate and dial in and the electrical cord is so thick that they are clumsy as well to get in your tank and hide, they are best suited in a sump or large tank where you can hide them.",

Anyway, my previous Eheim Jager lasted at least 17 years, hopefully this new heater will last at least half as long. My previous Eheim Jager was a 100 Watt, this one is a 125 Watt. Internet \"experts\" recommended 125 Watt for 35 gallon aquarium, side panel on Eheim Jager box states 100 Watt for 26-40 gallon aquarium size. See photo. The 125 Watt should not be overkill. Simple calibration of adjusting ring to match water temperature and heater dial. Heater is staying within a degree with some house temperature fluctuations.",

If you set the temp higher than the water temp it will turn on until it reaches approx the right temp. Actually I used a lab calibrated temp indicator to get it where I want. It's off by about 7\u00b0F. Then it will shut off as expected but never turn back on again to maintain the temp. If you touch or move it then it will turn back on but then fail again. Over and over and over. My last Eheim.",

This is not a fault, but I hate suction cups on aquarium products simply because the heater can become easily dislodged from the suction cups. Trying to remove the suction cups from the aquarium is at times, hard to do. Temperature dial on my thermometer was \"stiff\" and difficult to adjust. I am hower still pleased with the thermometer, and while it is large, it fits inside my 5 gallon betta tank perfectly. I would recommend this to other aquarium enthusiasts.",

My tanks are 20 - 30g, so it's much smaller than 53g.This should be clearly noted in description; it is not. I'm not sure if it's safe to use in a smaller tank, or not...",

I have it hooked to a 75 Gallon freshwater tank, sideways halfway down. set to 72 the calibration ring may be nice, but it's still off by 2 degrees. not enough adjustment there. get yourself a floating thermometer and a sticky one for calibration. NEVER trust the marks on the heater. That said, it never strays more that +-1.5 deg safety tip. always unplug the heater before pulling out of water or adjusting the temp. also, after pulling out of water, wait 10 minutes before plugging back in. thermal shock can shatter the glass, and potentially electrocute your fish (this is a good practice no matter the brand/style heater you buy)",

All three used on a 75 bare bottom tank and the 200w enough to raise the temperature 12 degrees above room temperature. Thought I was going to need the 300 but going with the 200 makes more sense should the sensor get stuck as the tank shouldn't get too hot. I have a few more 75s and getting more of these.
