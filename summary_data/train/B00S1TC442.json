And two, the most frustrating this is that after 1 wash it was destroyed!! Do they expect you to never wash this?? I followed the instructions and never even got to dry it because all the stitching came out and material was all over. So annoyed I spent the money on this, I hope the seller can give me a refund thank god I have a spare blanket in the mean time. I don\u2019t recommend this product despite its great reviews.",
