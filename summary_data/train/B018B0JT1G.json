I used it on 2 sweaters yesterday and it breezed right over them in just a few minutes and one was really linty from washing with a new towel. Now see the photo and have a good laugh. Just remember, you can keep the noodles!! I couldn't get the photo upright - Amazon pay attention. We need to be able to rotate photos.",

The lint contaner is shallow and requires frequent emptying but it's not a big deal to me. The bottom line is that it's effective at safely removing fuzz from my threads (slang for clothes).",
