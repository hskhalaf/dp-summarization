Good thick fabric, nice and warm, SUPER cute and very budget friendly. I'm obsessed. For reference I'm 6' tall and 205 pounds. The XL zips up but doesn't have a ton of room underneath if I wanted to wear something thick and zip it. Fortunately I'm going to wear it open. BUY IT.",

Pockets are not very secure in that there\u2019s no zippers and things can easily fall out. I don\u2019t think I have washed it yet so I cannot comment on post-wash results.

I ordered a small which is my typical size for a vest or coat. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t size down or I wouldn\u2019t have been able to wear a thick sweater and zip it.
