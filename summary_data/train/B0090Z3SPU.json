It folds closed with an nice cover you will need the new don't. Sounds the same as the new. Only gripe is if you leave it on all day by accident aux mode it will NEVER ever turn off it self???? In Bluetooth it will go off by it self eventually. Fix this boys.",

Also, it recharges quickly and lasts fairly long on a charge. I have never run out of \"juice\" but usually connect the charger after a couple hours of use, if disconnected. I was also pleased I could use this as a speaker for my bedroom TV connecting it to the headphone out on the TV, and the Aux. In connection on the Soundlink. You use the type connection you use for playing your phone on your car radio speaker. I believe that is a 3.5mm male connectors which are available just about anywhere.",

Given the bluetooth connection, you can take the devices anywhere and play your recorded (i.e. iTunes) music. If you have Wifi, you can connect with Pandora or any of the other internet music programs. The sound quality is acceptable...not awesome, but a great improvement over you device speakers. The downside is that it can become disconnected to your device. Reconnecting requires some know-how that the Bose makers did not include in the manual.. A call to Bose support fixed the problem quickly, but they need to put the word out since this can happen on a regular basis.",

It is exactly what they say it is.... what a pleasant surprise. I'd give it 6 stars if I could. LOVE IT! I loved it so much that I went to the Bose web-site and purchased a wave radio and CD changer. BUY this thing!",

      "text": "There are definitely cheaper solutions but the sound quality is good for a bluetooth speaker. The battery life is good, getting about six hours at medium volume. Bass is not as pronounced as I expected but acceptable for a small speaker. One big disappointment was the lack of any transport control buttons (play,pause,skip) which I have seen on other systems. Overall, I am happy with this item and have enjoyed having music in places I had not before.",
