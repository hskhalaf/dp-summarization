I've purchased two amp/dacs from FIIO, both have died after 3~6 months. Lesson: Don't by FIIO. I know it can be financially annoying to spend more money than you expected, but a good amp should last at least as long as a *few* pairs of headphones (3~5 years. I've had my sennheisers 10 years, shures for 3 years, and beyerdynamics for 1 year and the FIIO amps should have lived to power all of them). TLDR; Don't buy FIIO. Buy something from Schiit Audio, Audioquest, or Chord.",

      "text": "Excellent value for money, very good sound quality, significantly better than most PC's on-board sound. Eliminates of a lot of distortion in comparison to the headphone out socket of most PCs or laptops. Makes listening to Spotify etc more enjoyable. Able to drive most headphones to reasonable levels, even 600ohm DT880's. Sound signature is fairly neutral and pleasing. Small portable and easy to use. Very happy with it.",

From my experience it allows you to hear more of whats going on, adds a cleaner bass and doesn't seem to add any bias to the audio aside from the bass switch function.",

      "text": "This little DAC has surprised me, to be honest, with how much better and cleaner it sounds compared to the onboard soundcard in the Dell laptops I use. While it does support 96kHz from Windows I was slightly disappointed that it does not natively support DTS Audio or Dolby Digital (maybe that is just expected for external DACs?). Regardless, I would definitely buy this again and I will probably buy a second one to use at home.",
