These are a more cooler white than regular incandescent light bulbs. It takes a little getting used to. Also - if you have a dimmable light switch, you may need to replace the light switch. Apparently ordinary dimmable switches still leave a trickle current ~ 1 watt even when off. Too little to illuminate a regular light bulb, but when LEDs use only 7 watts, it's more than enough electricity to illuminate these just a little.",

Contrary to other reviews, these bulbs are indeed dimmable, as I have them in several dimmable fixtures, and they're flicker free all the way to the cutoff. The other reviewers that say they aren't dimmable are either reviewing the wrong item or received the wrong item. However, while they do dim, they don't go nearly as low as an incandescent bulb before going out completely. That's the only down side. Otherwise, great bulbs!",
