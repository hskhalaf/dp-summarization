      "text": "Great hairdryer! This dryer dries my hair in 3-4 minutes, where my old dryer took 10-15 and I usually gave up and left the house with wet ends. There are two speed settings (this is good so that I don't blow my two year old away when she wants to use mommy' hairdryer!) and three heat settings, one of which is actually cool- which is nice since you don't have to hold down a button for it. (Although I believe there is still a \"cool blast\" button.). All in all, this dryer was a great purchase, and was offered at a great price!",
