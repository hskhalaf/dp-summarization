I reckon i can patch it up if I glue on a metal strut to hold everything together, but on 300 quids' worth of electronics I really shouldn't have to. Shame on you, Sony. Not impressed.",

Sound quality much better than competition (Bose because Beats are no a competition at all for them). Battery still outstanding despite very heavy use (over 8h per day at work), no problem with connectivity or sound quality. A bit weird NC but I cannot compare because these are my first NC headphones. Although NC does the job. Touch panel is very intuitive and easy to use. No problems at all with it even when I fall asleep in the plane. I would never chose any buttons over this touch panel to be honest. Quality is outstanding, and they look luxury.

Other reviewers have said that the headband is liable to break, so I also bought the Amazon extra insurance for peace of mind. It puts up the price a bit but means I can return them within two years with no quibble if anything goes wrong. Altogether I'm very pleased (and so I should be at the price!).",
