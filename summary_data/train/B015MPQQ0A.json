But the space bar is losing sensitivity and dropping keys, makingmytypinglooklikethis at random times. This is unacceptable. A mechanical keyboard's keys should not start failing in three months!",

The loud click and feel doesn't quite correspond with the point of electrical contact, which makes a much quieter click. So it's not the actual switch contacts making the loud click. You can let a key up partway and push it down again and it will register another keystroke without the loud click.",

While features vary between boards, the quality of the KG010 is right up there with the more expensive and better known manufacturers. The back-lighting looks and works great, the feel and responsiveness of the keys is satisfying, and the board feels solid. The only criticisms I could level are the two screws at the top of the board would have looked better if they were flushed (subjective) and the brightness settings do not stick on boot up. This is one of the budget options I recommend using so you have more to invest in things you get more of a benefit from, like graphics cards and monitors.",

Coming from a Unicomp buckling-spring keyboard (updated model M), I'd say the keypress isn't quite as nice but that's a quibble. It's half the price of a Unicomp and the responsiveness is worlds better-- it doesn't have any startup lag like Unicomps do and its rollover behavior is worlds better. (Compared to a buckling-spring keyboard, the keypress -depth- is less, which means your fingers will bottom out on the keypress more. This is common for most mechanical keyswitches, though.)",

It is very similar in design to the Corsair keyboard, and in fact, it looks almost identical, except that this keyboard doesn't include a volume control wheel in the top right corner and the logo, of course.

For the price id say yes its worth it and seems like is should hold up for years to come. hope to find a compatable wrist rest for it soon.",

The build on it is impressive for the cost as well. There is a metal base layer under the keys, and plastic on the bottom. It has a significant weight to it that keeps it quite stable. Legs are small be well designed. I dont think this keyboard will break for years to come.",
