The keyboard backlight blinks. This does not appear to be fixed on the Yoga 3. Just do a little searching and you will find many people with this problem. The only real solution appears to be to replace the motherboard - an expensive option. I can't find any responses from Lenovo - no recall - no option for replacement or a fix. It's a cool little laptop and it's going to be tempting - don't do it.",

Finally they agree for me to send the machine back for repair. I send out the machine for 1 month and did not see any update from Lenovo. This is extremely bad. took 1 month to replace new battery? How could a battery dying slowly and dead in a few months. I spend more of my time with Ipad and barely turn them on and use it.",
