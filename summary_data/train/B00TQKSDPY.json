They arrived in a plastic bag with dirty lenses. The other two styles are made in Italy, but this one was made in Japan. That would not matter if they were of good quality. For a $200 pair of sunglasses, they felt like about $5.",

I am pretty rough on my sunglasses and even my husband encouraged me to return. The lenses did not disappoint... just the frames.",

These were thin, light, and felt cheaply made for the $198.00 I spent on them. Very disappointed. Having said that, the company was amazing with their return policy and directions.
