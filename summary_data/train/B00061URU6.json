We purchased a trap and put this food, along with leafy green veggies that they like, and found that they will eat the leafy green veggies, but do not care for Nature Zone Bites for Iguanas. I have a feeling that iguanas, no matter where they are, pretty much like the same kind of food. Therefore, I can not recommend that you purchase this for your iguanas. Sorry.",

I've had my can for over a month, which is a great buy. I will be buying more once I run out. Just make sure after opening, to put it in the fridge!",
