Just be aware this is a smaller shelter, which is ok bc I bought it knowing that. It's probably big enough to fit one adult a child comfortably if you're sitting. The benefit is that it'd not an obnoxious beach item that blocks other's view, is very easy to transport, setup, etc. It functions well in medium wind with just sandbags filled on the sides. I havent had to use the stakes yet.",

Its super easy to put together by yourself and take down with minimal effort. In total it takes about 5 minutes to put together and take apart. I took it to the beach and just put my mini cooler in the back of the tent and didn't even need to add the stakes. At the end I just flipped it over and shook it out then broke it down and it was good to go.",

My only complaint is that one of the split. It still works, but gets stuck when setting it up. I'm hoping this was a defect in the one we bought because we will be buying another one for next season.",

I set it up in my back yard twice by myself and it was super easy to set up and take down. Also I am not the best at rolling or folding things back up perfectly. But the tent still fit in the bag it came in. It is a bit smaller then what I thought but I am looking forward to using it on the beach. I also bought a wonder wheel beach cart to make things easier. I am ready for the beach.",

With that said, if you don't anchor it and are pointing directly into the wind, it will take off like Mary Poppins. So be mindful of the basic rules of physics and don't let your shelter become a sail.",

I opened my backpack chair, and it was a tight fit against the back of the shelter to keep it away from the front, and out of the sand. So this is a good shelter for one person at best, but if you're looking to hang out at the beach with others, this is not the shelter for you.",
