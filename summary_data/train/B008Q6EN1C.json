I would think that the warm or LOW setting would be about 85 degrees and go up from there to 100 degrees max. I do wish that the lid was a little sturdier to sit on but all in all, the seat is well constructed and met expectations except for the temp levels. I did contact them and was told that there was no way to soften the settings with a resistor or replacement heating element. I really wanted to keep it but hot is not warm.",

Granted, our house is set at 71 so it's not exactly frigid, but I'm a wimp (aren't we all-we're buying a heated toilet seat after all) and I still turned it down to medium heat. Second, I don't think I'll end up using the light, but it's included so whatever. I've wanted one of these for years (always seemed too ridiculous to spend $100 on a toilet seat) and it's everything I hoped and dreamed it would be!!! Glad my husband gave me my Christmas present early!",

Her old one was temperature sensitive and would only provide a heated seat when the room temperature was cool. It could also use a 'stay on' feature.

It\u2019s very inexpensive to run. It\u2019s a luxury most people don\u2019t talk about but it is worth every penny in the winter!!",

But, of course, few of us have that. In my case there was power nearby I could tap into and add a GFCI outlet near the toilet. This only took me about 2 hours. This is my second lumiwarm.

I have only had this for about 3 weeks, but absolutely love it. I love all the features. It is very well made and is of very good quality. In looking at the cheaper ones I noticed much mention of discolor (that telling me the product was made of some type of memory foam). This product is the same material as that of one bought at a home improvement store, so I'm counting on it to last and keep its color.",
