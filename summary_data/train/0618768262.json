There is so much information but the guide makes it easy by providing clear info on ranges, habitat and seasons, plus how to accurately use the guide itself.

      "text": "A few years ago I started getting interested in butterflies and went to the library for an identification book, and ended up with Kaufman's. I was instantly hooked on a hobby that makes bird watching seem kind of boring, and decided to order a book of my own. But in order to save a few bucks I decided on another guide, and when It arrived realized I'd made a mistake. So I ordered this book and know I have the best. I'll be checking into other Kaufman guides.",

Having all the info on the page you are opened to is also helpful when you are busy in the field. Being a visual person I appreciate ALL the butterfly plates are in color. My only one thought is I would like to see more of the caterpillars included. There are some included but not all. All in all a very good field guide.",
