      "text": "Nice little device. A little outdated, but still a great option if you want a reasonably priced smartphone-esque device with a decent amount of storage. Pros- Price, durability, battery life, memory expansion, two speakers, GPS (can be used as a car GPS, there are offline apps for this purpose), fast WiFi. Cons- Not upgradeable to ICS, some apps aren't supported, won't play high resolution video files, camera sucks, camera has no flash, low amount of RAM so some heavy apps won't run right. I'd probably buy this again, price point being the deciding factor. However, if you're looking for a faster, better, dedicated Android media player, I'd go with a used Samsung Galaxy S II over this.",

I have a dock and stereo dock and an alarm clock dock for the iPod that are not compatible with this galaxy player. But I found a bluetooth transmitter/receiver at Target that I plugged into the docks and wallah - my new Galaxy connects to them wirelessly! I actually like this a lot better than docking because when I play games I can listen to the sound really loud through the dock device! Or, I can listen to music and cruise the web at the same time.",

Plus, it is compatible with Google Play store AND the Amazon app store. My only complaint is that the only way to turn off the alarm is to hit the Home button -- though it does snooze okay.",

For those considering this size screen (4.2\"), please be aware that you do sacrifice readability to get portability. In addition, I needed to use a stylus to accurately press buttons in apps or enter text or numbers. If you don't need portability, recommend a tablet with a screen size of 7\" or larger.",

My 5 yr old loves using voice to text which is great since he can read but cant really spell. Camera is ok but I think no flash with it. Works well to play Minecraft too.

But as time went on it started not working right. I had it for under a month and it started shutting itself off, turning my music off halfway through. I had to return it because there was no fixing the problems, even after resetting it numerous times.",

Sure you can put a lot music on it. with a 32GB mircosd plus the around 6GB internal.. & you can use the spotify app.. but it downloads music to the internal memory.. See no way to change it possibly for copyright reason? Anyway you can only download like two list if they contain a lot of songs. I decided to buy this. & may bite the bullet an upgrade to a smartphone someday..",
