Now if the local radio stations would put out more info for the HD channels, that would be great - but that's not Alpine's fault. I have had Alpine HU's in the past, but this is the best one yet (if you remain at the single din size HU). Great choice here - you won't be disappointed. The picture here doesn't do the HU justice - it definitely looks better where the lit-up square areas are. It's very clear and not as bright as the picture conveys.",

It just looks and feels cheap. For a $350 stereo, I expected a lot more. I feel like I've purchased much cheaper Pioneer and Kenwood car stereos in the past and the control, concept, interface was so much better. Also, it is a pain to figure out how to scroll through radio stations one by one. By default, it wants to skip through like 10 at a time. Sound quality seems good overall. This is not the Alpine car stereo that Fresh Price referred to in his \"Summertime\" song.",

The Bluetooth setup is simple, and having it paired with my iPhone all my calls now display on my receiver and audio is run through my car sound system. The USB connection is probably my favorite option, allowing me to just connect a flash drive and have access to countless songs.

The buttons are a tad bit loose and cheap feeling and the HD radio gets an echo as it goes back and fourth between SD and HD. I live in a suburb of KC and don't get too many HD stations, it's a bit of a let down in that respect.",
