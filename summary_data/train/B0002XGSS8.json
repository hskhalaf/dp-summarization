The keys feel great, the only issue is the \"0\" on the keypad, I don't know why they have a \"000\" next to it and I often hit it by mistake; but it's not bad enough to want to knock down a star from this oherwise great product.",

Perfect combination and I love Logitech products and their customer service is US based, so not only do they understand you clearly, they seem to be trained clearly on how to troubleshoot.",
