You get what you pay for, etc. I have the lamp top(?) twisted off the vertical, so it shines on the whole desk, because I had to keep it on the side of the desk. It is very maneuverable, and that's one of the reasons I bought it. If I use FaceTime at night, I'll just raise it up a bit and there's plenty of light to see me clearly. I would highly recommend this over similar products with the higher price tags!",

Lithium-Ion 3 cells in series is just about 11.8 volt is perfect. Because the cord is a tripping hazard from living room table to wall plug/outlet. So I had rigged up battery for several hours of use on single charge. She is so happy with not so expensive lamp. Regular power supply isn't recommend because of 13.8 to 15 volts instead of just on border-line 12 volt. Lithium-Ion 12 volt battery is the safest way to go as the power outages.",

From my nightstand, it can reach over across my lap and allows reading while sitting up in bed. Also, I will often use it with the light folded all the way in to the support arm and the power setting on dim if I need a soft light when waking in the middle of the night for a glass of water. I have another one at my fly tying desk that provides excellent lighting.",

Light is bright enough on high level.The only small issue is that the adapter plug seems like it does not retain real well into the back of the light base. Can easily be dislodged and happened a couple of times as I was first positioning the light. The wire length is fine (59\") coming off the 12V adapter. Leaving light base in one place seems to work fine. I would rate at least 4.5 stars and 5 if retention was improved on connector. Also my eyes could use a double strip of these lights but it is a nice light for the price.",

I wish it swiveled just a little more but not a deal breaker for me. You can adjust the brightness of the daylight LED bulbs to meet your needs. That's all. It's a great reading lamp.",

Unnecessarily takes up desk space. Also, the red indicator light stays on when it's off, leaving a red glow in the corner of our bedroom. Not huge issues, but prevents it from being 5 star.",
