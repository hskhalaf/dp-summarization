Their paint jobs are almost always terrible and they always have these terrible lines all over them. However, I actually love the dinosaurs from Jurassic Park. They're extremely adorable looking, but even though I feel they're more worth the price they still have their flaws. They have some really bad paint jobs that I'm not too much of a big fan of and you can see multiple spots where the glue was coming out of it but other than that I think these are fantastic little figures!

Side note I like that the Chase has no frill, like the real life dinosaur. My dilophosaurus left arm is slightly out of place, doesn't bother me though.",
