I was happy to be able to find this toy on Amazon. Our 7 month old son and his friends all love this toy. The beads do get a little stuck but he just shakes it around and they fall to the bottom.",

      "text": "Ordered this for my nine month old neighbor who loves to shake things. She loves it. The plus with this toy is that the colored beads making the shaking noise are visible. Some complained about it being too small, but for this nine month old, it is a perfect size. Not too heavy or too big for her hands. Free shipping was a plus.",
