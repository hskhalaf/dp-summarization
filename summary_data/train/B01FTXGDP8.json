Just the fact you can see it through a bra and shirt is reason enough for me to not buy again.",

I have had nonleacks and I wash them with my towel laundry. 14 pads is plenty to get me thru 3-4 days and I still have some clean ones left over while I wash the used ones.

They are soft, and the convenience of the laundry bag is unbeatable. I leak a lot when I first let down, so these keep me dry, and do not feel clammy or uncomfortable on my skin. The only thing that may bother some people is that if you wear one of the thinner nursing bras under a thinner shirt you definitely see the circle shape of these through your clothing. On days where I wear thinner blouses to work I just have to wear a thicker nursing bra or go with the disposable pads.",

They are absorbent if you don't leak much and they definitely aren't flattering. They aren't all that soft, but I washex them before first use and that seemed to soften them a bit.",

I like the washable bag but I use it for storage instead and got a bigger laundry bag so I felt they were getting a little bit more clean not being stacked on top of each other so tightly. Im a size DD or E and the large covers perfectly.",

It's not too big of a deal I just have to reposition and it is fine. The largest were just a little too big and bunch up in my bra.",

Also wash them as soon as possible as they start to smell and move them from the washer to the dryer quickly as they smell musty if they have been left wet too long, even when they are dried",
