Now when I reboot it gets stuck 'optimizing app' for a half hour before you can use it, utterly worthless. I am purchasing a new phone and I will take great pleasure with taking a sledge hammer to this device. $180 in the hole, what a waste.",

From the start, I had problems with this phone--stopping, slow response. Those problems went away. Then people I was talking to all started (at once) saying they heard their voice echo. I swear, it must have been from an update. There is no echo if I use speaker phone. Searched for a fix and found a lot of suggestions but nothing worked. This phone has been a lot of problems. Should have returned it to Amazon at the start.",

It's a little thicker than a premium phone but not so much that I'd call it a big con. Hooked it up to GoSmart Mobile and it works great. I used to use Motorola back in the flip phone days as their build quality was top notch. This phone seems solid as well. Can't do much better for $100 these days.",

So far I like this better than the Nexus 4. Its responsive and that battery life. Its ENDLESS. I have gotten almost 20 hours out of one single charge. That alone makes this phone a superb buy.

This phone is just perfect for me. The note 3 turned out to be too big (I have small hands). The iphones did not give me enough control of my phone. The only down side to this phone for me is the non removable battery. Which sucks if your phone freezes up you are helpless. This phone has not froze up on me yet though.",
