So far I have been able to unlock this safe with 12 different numbers and it is quite easy to do without looking; just by feel. The first number is correct but the middle two have a huge margin of error. The last one is easy to find since everything falls into place when you get there. I will write another review if my house burns down and let you know what happens with the contents.",

I discovered upon assembly it was not properly set so that the bolts would fully deploy. It took 15 minutes to disassemble and put together again with so the bolts would deploy. This safe is more for show than for go but it beats an underwear drawer. So I am happy for the price.",

Very few if any gun safes are actually UL rated against FIRE. Fireboard is not concrete. Now I feel that my cash and important papers are much safer being in a 60 minute UL listed Fire safe inside of a 75 minute manufacturer rated gun safe. This is probably not a secure safe against anyone willing to break it to get in. Of course, it is better than a shoe box especially if bolted down properly.",
