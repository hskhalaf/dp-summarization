This POS can only handle maybe a fraction of 500 watts, more like 100- 200 watts max RMS. Don't waste your hard earned money on this joke of a sub unless you like to smell the off-gassing of glowing voice coils.",

The bass from this sub is thunderous. I set the crossover at about 90 and it delivers all the low frequencies needed to shake the foundation of my house. Ive used car subs in the house for many years now and this pioneer is better than the JL audio I was using before. This sub is definitely worth more than 60 bucks.

Plenty of bass, and with the right size cabinet it will sound even better. $50 price range is a very good value.
