Please make sure you turn off the Eco Power function. For months I was hating this thing because it almost always needed to be, restart, reset or repaired. One day I thought to myself? \"I wonder if it's cutting off on its own and not remembering its last state?\" Many times the app would show it still online when the power was off. Turn off Echo power and have not had the issue since. Only wish Vizio would give more info on why Eco Power is not as functional as it reads.",

I was told to return it. I actually ended up buying another Vizio product with the larger cube subwoofer, and it works perfect.

I did have to play with the sound settings, after I installed the phone app. to my preferences.

Now it has completely failed to connect, only way to get it to connect is by unplugging from the wall and back again. This is a very inconvenient because the subwoofer is under the couch and the couch is against the wall where the AC plug and Subwoofer is connected to, meaning we have to Pull the couch out in order to reset the power. Vizio, Amazon, someone must fix this, please. Thanks",

      "text": "The sound is great. The slim line easily fits under a non-wall mounted TV. Still very buggy though. The sub (and therefore the satellite speakers) still unpair after most uses. So I have to pull the couch out (the slimline speaker is awesome because it is out of sight), unplug the sub, and plug it back in for it to pair up again and work....2 stars for now, but could easily be 5 stars without this hassle.",

      "text": "Same pairing issues as with other reviews for this product I have read. Sounds is awesome at first, but the subwoofer s***s off after awhile. Then can't get it to work again. I am on the third unit now and waiting for a fourth. Same problem each time. If the 4th bit doesn't work, then will not try again with this unit. Vizio support tries, but told me they have not had any reported issues with this type of situation. I don't think they truly care. Do NOT purchase this item, as is seems this issue this a real problem that hasn't been corrected.",

I don't know why people leave bad reviews for this item. Their are no issues with it what so ever. Bluetooth works flawlessly. Casting audio works with no issues. I love that feature. Movies and games sound incredible. The bass is just right and smooth for me. I love the thin subwoofer. I have the sound bar in my room and I put the subwoofer under my bed.",
