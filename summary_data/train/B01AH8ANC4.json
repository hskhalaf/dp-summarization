If you have a wider foot it may be hard for you to get them on (at first, they\u2019ll soften up) but I didn\u2019t have an issue! I also love the fact that they are not bulky like UGG\u2019s usually are. In fact they make my feet look small. I love them so much I just ordered the same pair in black- size 10!",

The 7.5 were a bit too snug for socks but with sock liners or barefoot they feel amazing. Like other reviewer(s) there were minor markings that I believe for 150 bucks doesnt belong there. Let the owner get them dirty not the seller. Otherwise cute shoe and will make the best of it.",
