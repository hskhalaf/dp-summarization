Its a beautiful phone, and it functions incredibly well. The camera was a big selling point for me - and this delivers on what it promises. The software for the camera doesn't quite unleash the power of the name brand lenses the way it could, but wow it's a tremendous upgrade from the ZTE. Great phone, worth the $$$.",

Great phone with amazing camera and battery life. The screen is also absolutely gorgeous (coming from a Mate 9 Pro with an OLED screen) and just love the feel of the device.",

I don't use my phone much for actual phone calls, mainly for a text and internet device, and for those things it is great. The Leica camera in it seems better than the Sony camera in my last phone even though the Sony was a megapixel more in resolution. And they seem to have tech support. It's worth spending the extra money for this phone.",
