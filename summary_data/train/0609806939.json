One of the first was to change what I praise her for. For example, when she masters something I let her know how proud I am of the effort she put into learning to do it rather than telling her how smart she is. The effect has been seen already. She doesn't get as frustrated because, as she puts it, she just has to work a little harder and she'll get it.",

But I would highly recommend if you're tired of trying to find the right way to parent, you know you fall in to either commanding or over lenient depending on the situation which isn't helpful to your child at all and very damaging. This shows you how to not walk over your kids but not let them walk all over you either.",

These are not some gimmicks or tactics, but healthy and fulfilling ways of dealing with people.

      "text": "THis book has some good ideas about listening actively, and involving all parties in decision making and conflicts. However, this author does not believe that parents are a child's authority, and that children will be blessed by obeying parents, (basic Biblical foundations for family structure.) I've read lots of Christian parenting books which teach you how to understand your child better, and how to talk to your child better, and which don't rely so heavily on corporal punishment. But this book flies against the very nature of the family structure which I believe God has put in place.",
