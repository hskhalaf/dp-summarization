      "text": "We haven't been able to use this device for conference calls because everyone else on the line says they can't hear because voices sound like mumbling or a lot of echo. This is despite their being no other caller's microphones in the area and holding the remote microphones of the system in hand by the speaker. We're having to buy a new/different system. Its too late for me to return now so its an expensive paper weight.",

      "text": "Works great! The Grandstream is better? Yeah, right. Hands down the easiest conference phone to use without unnecessary bells and whistles that nobody ever ends up using anyways. My office and our executives wanted a phone that was simple and easy to use. A phone with great voice quality and the ability to talk over each other without cutting each others off (full duplex). The detachable microphones are a bonus and a great feature since it is built into the hardware. I would recommend this phone if your executives have been complaining about the Polycoms in your office.",

We used this in a small room, and having the extra mics would have made our experience better. Otherwise connects perfectly to a cell phone via Bluetooth, no special service required. Use your cell phone conferencing features/services to initiate the calls.",

I guess that's more of a problem with the Mac Mini's bluetooth radio than the vTech, but I just wanted others to know... if you plan to use this speakerphone for connecting to a PC, get the USB version (VCS754). We bought the VCS754 and now the sound is crystal clear.",

Without prompting we immediately started getting comments about the clarity of the sound from other people on calls. They are inexpensive, well constructed, have a wide variety of features, and provide very clear sound. I LOVE these phones. One note: You may wish to uncheck LLDP-MED. It is a protocol designed to make deploying VOIP telephones easier. In our case it confused some of our voip phones, causing them to reboot.",
