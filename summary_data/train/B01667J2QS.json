It sounds very rich and authentic. What I liked most was the quality of the guitar, and how nice the case and extras were! The case alone is at least $70. The only thing I didn't like about the guitar is that there was an annoying sticker put on it that did not come off easily, and caused me to scratch it trying to get it off. Overall, it is a very nice, solid, guitar that is very well worth the money.",
