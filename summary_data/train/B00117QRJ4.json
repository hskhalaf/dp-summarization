But then again, there's no way to test the item without doing that so I guess we're stuck with over-priced wooden blocks to take up space in the toy box. I will try to return for a refund.",

It's fun for the whole family. When I first opened the package I thought it was a little strange that the xylophone is all wood(I was expecting metal bars. It took a little while to get used to the sound of the wooden bars compared with metal. My only complaint is that some of the paint has chipped off of the green bar after a couple weeks of use. Otherwise a great way to introduce your child to the world of instrumental music!",
