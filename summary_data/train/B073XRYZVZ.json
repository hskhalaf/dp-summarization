It is not too chalky and has a good coconut flavor. I had bought the single packets and have been resisting buying the large one because it was so expensive, but this is a nice big package and should last awhile. I will buy it again. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 are: this one (like all of that contain stevia) does have the \"stevia aftertaste\" and the price is very high.",
