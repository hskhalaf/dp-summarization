Each piece placed expands on the main image of the owl and also creates a starlit landscape filled with wildlife and plants in the cut lines of the puzzle. What it lacks in difficulty to put together, it more than makes up for in overall enjoyment of the meditative practice of seeing the connections and shapes form as one places each new puzzle piece.",
