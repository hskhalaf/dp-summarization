Comfort may remain a priority, but other qualities are also distinguished.\u00a0The features of the shoe are simply built to deal with the various challenges of the sport. It is waterproof, stable, supportive, and grippy. Its fashionable look is a bonus for those who are on the hunt for both style and performance.",

They are very comfortable but the rubber coating on the mesh upper (it's what makes them waterproof) that runs around the shoe to about an inch above the sole makes a sort of popping noise every time it flexes and unflexes. It's an odd sound and rather annoying. My playing partners were having a lot of fun with it. You won't be able to sneak up on anybody wearing these. If I had it to do over again I'd order the original Flex model without the rubber coating.",
