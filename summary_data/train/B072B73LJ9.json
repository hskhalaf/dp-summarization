It is very easy to read, and has exactly the amount of functionality that I wanted. It is comfortable and durable, and can go through just about anything you can go through. It\u2019s displays are clear and well organized, with an efficient system to set your alarm, timer, and clock. It id designed and laid out well, and I can say for sure I will be wearing it for years to come. I highly recommend this, as I am sure you will never look back.",

It was in the shop for a couple of months so I bought this Etevon to hold me over when I went diving in the Virgin Islands. I dove to 65' without a problem. It has more functions than my TAG and looks pretty damn sharp for a $24 watch. I was reluctant to put my TAG back on. I will be diving with the ETEVON from now on. I can buy 20 ETEVONs for what it cost me to get my TAG repaired.",

I've had the watch submersed in ice cold trout streams and banging into trees and brush and it hasn't missed a beat. The only downside for me is that it's bigger than needed but that's a minor thing in a watch that performs this well at this price.

There are only a couple of things that I am not excited about: first, the instructions are not very clear. There could be one or two more diagrams. Second, my watch came with some dust on the inside of the glass. I do not want to take the glass off, although it looks like I could, because I don't want to break it. Other than that, this is a nice watch.",
