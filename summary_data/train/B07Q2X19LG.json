I cannot register Huawei ID because the US is not in the country list so I cannot access such as Huawei AppGallery and anything that require Huawei ID. 2nd, many Huawei apps state clearly on the privacy policy that Huawei will collect private information such as birthday. If I choose decline, then apps became not acceptable. I concerned pretty a lot on this because I have no idea how they will use my private information.",

Night shots are phenomenal and the battery can last up to two days depending how you use the phone and not to mention the very quick charge this has!!
