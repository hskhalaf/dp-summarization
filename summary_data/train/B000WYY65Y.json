It works wonderfully but you have to realize that instead of lighting your charcoal in a chimney and walking away, you're going to stand around with smoke wafting in your face while you even out the coals. BUT the extra 5-10 minutes you spend doing this will ignite all your charcoal evenly and you will see an extra 30-50% burn time! Less worry about temperature dropping and fewer briquette re-loads. If you have the extra money and an electrical outlet handy this may be for you.",

The problem is (if you grill frequently and will be putting more wear on yours), some of the cheap ones also have 2 year warranties so there's no real point in spending the extra money. Cheaper models also offer a blower only mode which would be nice. Also having to hold the button down can be annoying, but I could see how it can be explained as a \"safety feature.\"",

Sadly it will only last two years with use 3-4 times per week, so assume you will be able to light your grill about 400 times before it stops working.

Two notes: read the instructions...the unit gets REALLY hot, and I actually partially melted the aluminum shield by sticking it too deep in the coals (okay, I'm a guy and I didn't read the instructions). Also, I would not store this outdoors...I keep mine in the garage to keep it out of the elements.",
