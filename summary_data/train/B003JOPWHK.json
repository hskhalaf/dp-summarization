I installed 1 speaker in her bathroom, and 1 in the bedroom. The sound quality is amazing; there's enough \"thump\" to make you believe there's a subwoofer hidden somewhere. The aimable tweeters mean she can keep the volume low but still hear the soundtrack to whatever \"tweens\" listen to these days, even over the shower. I'm an Audiophile (who scoffs at in-wall or in-ceiling ANYTHING), but I'm pretty impressed.",

I just put together a 5.1 setup for a small living room useing four Micca M-8S (main and surround) one Micca M-CS (center) and one Polk Audio PSW 10 (subwoofer). All together I spent around $350. The sound quality is fanamenal. I love that you can adjust the tweeter, allowing them to angle towards the listener. One could easily spend $1000 dollars on a set of speakers without yielding sound comparable to these. I could not be any happier.",

Luckily it was in a drop ceiling and I remembered what i did with these type speakers over a decade ago. The anchors holes are not threaded so if the start is not done perfectly, you may have issues. Solution for this, predrill the screws and then back them out and the anchors will act like you want them to when you goto mount them in drywall or drop ceiling. Installed a couple this weekend - they sound great.",

I used the Polk Audio V60 for my FL/FR and RL/RR and and a Klipsch 10-SW subwoofer. My receiver is an outdated YAMAHA on optical cable (which still put out a great sound), but I will replace this fall for one with a HDMI/Wi-Fi/DOLBY Atmos receiver. Good Luck!",

The speaker is above the Flat-screen TV in the image. It is considerably more efficient than my other speakers so I had to adjust the surround settings in my stereo. Overall a great buy, though!",

And they have good bass, which was very important since I was buying them for sorround sound, and I watch a lot of action movies. And, I bought them to connect to my Sonos Connect Amp, and the music sounds great. After installing the first of 4, the remaining 3 were very easy to install.",
