Tried all suggestions to fix it. I would even try replacing the battery if it was even possible to find a replacement. There are just so many better options on the market for a tablet in this price range. Not to mention I had to return the initial unit I received because the back light was leaking so badly through the screen. The 2nd unit I got had the same issue but it wasn't as bad so I just lived with it. Really disappointed in this product.",

I installed it in the hopes that would fix the problem. This morning the battery went dead in less than two hours, with most of the time being spent unattended.",

It is a little hard to charge sometimes, but that is to be expected because any battery will start to wear out over time. it does still keep a fairly long charge though.",

I did this and same issue. Black screen. I was then told I need to send tablet in to have their techs do further troubleshooting...all atmy cost!! I can't believe they will not fix this on their dime. I guess it's the norm to have expensive electronics crap out on you after only 6 months and a couple days. Do not buy a Nexus tablet!

But it performs really well, does everything I need it to do, and I've had few issues with it so far other than a couple of random crashes, which I chalk up to being on the bleeding edge of android.",
