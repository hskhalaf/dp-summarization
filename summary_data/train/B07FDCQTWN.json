Hikers who would invest in this true-to-size Merrell piece are also likely to be mind-blown by its stellar grip performance on the trail.It is just a shame, however, that this incredibly lightweight hiking boot might be too restrictive widthwise for some. To sum up, minus its lone misstep, the Merrell Ontario Mid Waterproof is a stunning footgear that goes beyond expectations in both function and form.",

This is my first pair of Merrell boots so I can't comment on the durability or how long they'll last. They are however awesome looking boots and REALLY comfortable!",
