I got this thing, which is well made, professional in look and feel, and found out there were things to learn in sit-up land. This device positions and supports you, and ever so slightly changes the pre-rep positioning and adds a bit of stretch, increasing the rep work load. More importantly it changes the yield of the time spent exercising. There has been a significant strength and definition enhancement using this mat. I like it a lot. I recommend you give it a try.",

So just seems a bit cheap in the guts. But I could be wrong, time will tell. Overall I'm happy with it and will use it a lot.",
