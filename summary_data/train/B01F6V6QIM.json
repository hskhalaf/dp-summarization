However, after about six months, the power and menu buttons on the bottom of the monitor have ceased to function. In order to power the monitor off I have to unplug it, and the menu options are now appearing erratically in the bottom right-hand corner of my screen. I recommend spending the extra 40 or 50 dollars to purchase a better quality screen.",

It is (25\") on a larger size than typical and my older 24\", which also helps and I like it in this size. With HD resolution that would be the largest sensible monitor size. For larger size like 27\" this resolution won't be useful. All in all it is a good monitor for basic applications and it is big improvement to my older 24\" lcd.",

Fortunately, HP makes a sophisticated problem one can download and install to control the picture in many dimensions. It took me several hours of work and experimentation, but I did get the monitor adjusted such that it is comfortable to look at. As typical with IPS monitors, the picture quality is not smooth at the edges, but this is a very attractive monitor.",
