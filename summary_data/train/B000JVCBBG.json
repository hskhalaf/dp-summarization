It actually worked better than my chapstick. Next I used it on my feet and then for any part of my skin that was dry. I even used it on my two month olds dry skin and mild cradle cap. A teeny tiny bit goes a long way.",

It's also organic and my son didn't mind the taste but I would apply after a feed so it had time to absorb.",

I had bought the lansinoh organic nipple balm, but it doesn't work as well. Mama's also smells really good and you don't need to wash it off before breast feeding. I will say that with my sample packs it has more of a gritty texture, and with the jar it comes out smoother, but it takes a while to loosen it in the jar. Overall, I highly recommend it!",
