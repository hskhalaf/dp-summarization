Because now in order for me to be able to use it and charge it, I have to order a charger that is going to cost just as much as the camera itself.

The zoom and panoramic features seem to be working well and are the reason we bought this one over other cameras for a similar price. The flash also works well but the button is sometimes held down by mistake because of the location of where it pops up. I'm sure our daughter, who we bought the camera for, will get used to that and it won't be a problem. She is still learning all of the features and settings but it seems to be working well and the quality of the pictures has been good.",

The compact size makes it easy to take with you in a pocket, purse, or backpack.\n\n\n720P MP4 HD MOVIE MODE\n\nIn 720p MP4 movie mode, the DSC-H90 shoots 1280 x 720 high definition movies at 30 fps, a standard format when working with a PC. Users will create high quality movies with full use of optical zoom in files small enough to transfer to compatible PC or Mac computer.1 Once transferred to your computer and connected to the internet, you can effortlessly upload your media to popular photo and video-sharing websites such as Photobucket and YouTube.\n\nSWEEP PANORAMA MODE-UP TO 360\u00b0\nReach beyond the traditional wide angle lens, and capture more breathtaking shots with Sweep Panorama mode. Simply press the shutter button and sweep the camera in the desired direction and the camera continuously shoots at a high speed, then seamlessly stitches the images together with automatic position adjustment to create one stunning panoramic image. Available in wide and up to 360\u00b0 full circle, the DSC-H90 can take a variety of panoramic shots. Now capturing wide landscapes is as easy as press and sweep.\n\n\n16.1 MEGAPIXEL IMAGE SENSOR\n\nA powerful 16.1 megapixel Super HAD CCD image sensor helps you capture gorgeous images with superb contrast and clarity down to the finest detail. With 16.1 megapixels, you can create stunning, photo-quality prints up to A3+ (13x19 inch) size, or crop your images and still come away with high resolution shots.\n\n\nOPTICAL STEADYSHOT IMAGE STABILIZATION\n\nOptical SteadyShot image stabilization uses a built-in gyro sensor to detect camera shake and automatically shifts the lens to help prevent blur without sacrificing image quality.\n\n\nINTELLIGENT AUTO MODE\nUnlike traditional auto mode, Intelligent Auto (iAuto) mode thinks for you, recognizing scenes, lighting conditions, faces, and adjusts settings resulting in clear images, faces with natural skin tone and less blur. Take advantage of all the technology without leaving Auto mode. Kids on the playground, landscape shots, a beautiful flower or an indoor birthday party; all result in clear images without leaving auto mode.\n\nPICTURE EFFECT FOR MORE EXPRESSIVE PHOTOS \n\nPicture Effect adds a new level of expression to photos, making ordinary landscapes and portraits come to life by heightening mood and emphasizing certain attributes. Select camera models have up to nine different effects. \n\nPHOTO CREATIVITY\nPhoto Creativity allows you to fine-tune your exposure settings, such as brightness, color, and vividness, and quickly choose the right enhancement for your subject. Now you can view Picture Effects and Photo Creativity effects in real time on the camera\u2019s monitor or in the viewfinder before shooting.\n\nFACE DETECTION TECHNOLOGY \n\nFace Detection technology detects up to eight individual faces and adjusts focus, exposure, and white balance to help deliver crisp, properly lit images of family and friends.\n\n\nSMILE SHUTTER TECHNOLOGY \n\n\nSmile Shutter technology captures a smile the moment it happens. Simply press the Smile Shutter button and the camera does the rest. You can also select adult and child priority andindicate the degree of Smile Detection sensitivity. Intelligent Scene Recognition can now be used together with Smile Shutter mode when the Intelligent Auto mode is on. This means that beautiful smiles can be captured with settings optimized for the particular scene, even in difficult conditions such as twilight and backlighting. \n\n\n\nANTI-BLINK FUNCTION \n\nIt\u2019s frustrating to capture the perfect shot, only to review it later and discover subjects blinked during the photo. The Anti-blink function works to help counter blinking and squinting. When the camera is set to Soft Snap, the Anti-blink function captures two images, recording only the photo with less squinting. If a blink is detected in other shooting modes, a warning will be displayed after you take the shot.\n\nSOFT SKIN MODE\n\nPortrait subjects will love the results. Soft Skin mode recognizes skin tones and reduces the appearance of blemishes and wrinkles without affecting the rest of the shot.\n\nINTELLIGENT SCENE RECOGNITION (ISCN) MODE\n\nIntelligent Scene Recognition (iSCN) Mode automatically detects 33 different types of scenes and selects the appropriate camera settings. In Auto Mode, the camera takes a single shot using the optimal settings. In Advanced Mode, the camera takes a photo with the optimal settings and, if in difficult lighting (low light or back light) immediately takes a second photo with another optimized setting so you can choose which to keep.\n\nNATURAL FLASH\n\nConventional point-and-shoot camera flash shots just don't capture colors the way the eye sees them. Natural Flash mode takes a reference shot without flash and then uses that reference to correct the color, for far more lifelike images.\n\nMOTION DETECTION\n\nMotion Detection, along with Face Motion Detection adjusts ISO sensitivity and increases the shutter speed when movement is detected, reducing blur in moving subjects and faces.\n\n\n * \n * \n\n1.
