I do leave in a bit more leave-in conditioner or hair milk/cream to compensate.",

It doesn't add a super large amount of volume, but it does add a nice amount of lift at the roots and thickens the hair overall. I can also usually skip the dry shampoo on day two hair when using this product - which is a great bonus. It goes on clear and doesn't leave a residue or buildup either.",
