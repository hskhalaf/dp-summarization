Not only the rock, I even find a piece of broken bone of bird. The rock was larger before being broken by the grinder.",

I'm glad I decided to try this Lavazza Super Crema in my new Barista Warrior French press as it was absolutely delicious. Fresh, smooth, not bitter at all. I'm waiting for my Breville espresso machine to be delivered, so I can try the Lavazza as an espresso as well. I'm sure it will be great, if I enjoyed it so much in my French press. Highly recommend this coffee and will buy again!",

I bought this because I like a good heady espresso and this does have a nice bit of Crema to the top of your shot, but so do most if you pull your shot right.
