There is NO extra padding where the top corner of a laptop will hit the zippers, nor is there padding at the bottom of the laptop holding sleeve.

After the bag is zipped, there is no padding between the zipper and the laptop, so gouges WILL happen.",

It is even better in person. I felt like a kid on Christmas morning the moment I unboxed this beast. There are so many storage options and I love the two places it has to stay fully charged. I got the velcro version and ordered some patches from my favorite game to display on the backpack proudly. I am now a super fan of thos company. Bravo!",

When I travel for business, I take my work laptop, personal laptop and iPad with me. There is plenty of room plus organization for everything. I hated being cramped in a smaller bag with messy cords. There's plenty of storage compartments to separate business from pleasure and I'm the coolest commuter in the office. It's very comfortable and it doesn't feel bulky to me. What's a few more inches of bag to have the perfect setup? I'll never go back. Love this backpack!!",
