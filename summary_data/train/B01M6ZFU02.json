What I like about this storage bin is that it lifts up from the bottom and the excess water remains while the toys dry. So I didn't have to try and hold the bin upside down to drain the water while trying my best not to let toys fall out. Out of all the bath bins we've tried before this is definitely my favorite and fits perfectly on our tub ledge.",
