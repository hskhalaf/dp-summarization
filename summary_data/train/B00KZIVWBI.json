      "verdict": "The Bare Access Arc 4 from Merrell is a running companion that many athletes and casual individuals can enjoy. It\u2019s a neutral running shoe that\u2019s catered to minimalist enthusiasts. Its durability is superb and the underfoot comfort is adequate, but it doesn\u2019t have arch supports.",
      "pros": [
        "The upper coverage of this running shoe comes from the Synthetic Leather & Air Mesh",
        "Most reviewers appreciated this 4th version\u2019s overall comfortable design and unbulky nature",
        "The lightweight disposition of the Bare Access Arc 4 is a positive feature for testers",
        "It\u2019s a running shoe that\u2019s effective for many activities, such as running, exercising or even walking",
        "The durability of the individual parts is also very dependable",

      "cons": [
        "There were complaints with regard to the Merrell Bare Access Arc 4 being a bit narrow for the feet",
        "There is little support for the arch, therefore it\u2019s not the best option for over-pronators",
        "Some runners noted that the aesthetic of this shoe was too similar to the previous versions",
        "Some reviewers felt that the upper unit wasn\u2019t able to snugly wrap their feet properly"

      "title": "Brilliant shoes",
      "text": "My favourite Merrell shoe to date. I have worn the Pace Glove shoes for a long time mainly for walking or short runs though as while very comfortable the soles are very thin. The padding on these though made them extremely comfortable for longer road runs. Wore them for Loch Ness Marathon and several other road races and my legs and feet felt great after. They have helped me transition fully to minimalist running. There feels to be some slight arch support which when running helps make sure you always land forefoot first. I wear them all the time - walking, working and running!",
