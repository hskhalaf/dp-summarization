      "text": "Day 1... loved it! My previous experience with Terry products was the bike shorts. I love them. However, I was stubborn and rode with my original Trek seat for miles/months in my training for RAGBRAI (bike ride across Iowa). Weeks before RAGBRAI, I met someone who had a Terry seat and said she loved it from the git-go as well. That day, I ordered this seat, received it and rode on it the first day 20 plus miles and loved it. We made it across Iowa as well (411 miles).",

      "text": "Very comfy saddle at first, plusher than it looks. The gel is a nice touch. The surface is more slick than saddles I have had. The one issue I have is the 2 metal mounting rails are not completely parallel with the seat surface, so even if I max out the tilt on the seatpost, I still can't get the seat level, so there is tendency to slide forward a little. Feels great first 2 miles, the next 10 miles was uncomfortable. The saddle rubs on my legs and causes some chaffing on long rides.",

Usually when I ride any distance I have swollen seat bones. Even just sitting on the old seat hurt. We went on a longer ride recently, and I had no discomfort at all. No discomfort during the ride or after. Finally, no swelling and no pain! I'm very pleased with this brand. I definitely recommend this seat, and would purchase this again.",

I was also trying to break the saddle that came with my new TREK 27'5 and was having a hard time... finally decide to buy the Terry saddle and I am very pleased with it. It is very comfortable and I am not sore anymore, at least for my use (no competitions!). My advice is to test and make small adjustments on the inclination until you find the perfect fit for your body.",
