I would never lay down on a hotel room floor, but could with this. Worth every penny! My only complaint and suggestion. We also bought the full cover to use it outside.

The green fabric can not be taken off and cleaned. If it can it\u2019s complicated and not worth it. The annoying part on set up is you have to pull the end of every pole with a strap to latch it on so it stays up. Tedious work.",

The play yard was easy to set up and fold back up. It took very little room when folded, making it perfect for traveling. It was big enough for two toddlers and their toys, with room to move around. YMMV, but they tried to climb out only once, fell, and never tried again, allowing us to use this until they were over age 2. The only problem is cleaning the floor of it, since it doesn't come off, so it does have some stains. Overall, however, I highly recommend this!",

We also purchased the sunshade, which is ok, but would be much better if it covered the entire playard like a tent.

      "text": "Bought two plastic play yards because I was concerned about he limited space of this transportable one. The other play yards are too bulky and, although they fold, take up a lot of space when not in use. This transportable play yard is much better! It has an adequate amount of space for kids, has very clear lines of sight for parents and is easily collapsible so that it can be stored out of the way and in the closet. Wish I saved my money and bought this first before buying the other two play yards",

She is at the stage where she stills looses her balance and falls. I'm afraid she could hit her head on them. Also, the bottom needs a large cushion for hard floors. I think one is sold separately? I decided this Playard is not safe and returned it.",
