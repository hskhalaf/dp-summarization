Had to use crescent wrench to loosen them up and could not advance screws without silicon. It appears to be a lower quality version of one in picture. Amazon needs to update pic and not be accused of \"bait and switch\". BUYER BEWARE !!!",

It's nervous carrying six-gallons of fresh wort in a glass jug across twenty-feet of concrete but this dolly makes it a breeze. I place the empty carboy in the dolly before filling, it rolls smoothly, and I can lock it in place while moving the carboy in to the fermentation chamber. Solidly built, had none of the issues with missing parts others had described, my back and nerves are happy with the purchase.",
