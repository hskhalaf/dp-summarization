      "text": "I was hesitant in buying this since Milwaukee is known to make tools for construction work mainly. I needed a 1/2\" impact driver to remove wheel lugs off of cars and trucks but didn't want to spend over 5-600 for a snap-on. I took a gamble with it cause of the price but also cause I have all Milwaukee tools for construction work as well. Gotta say this thing does the job and more even for automotive work! Very strong, just pair it with a 5.0 or higher battery for longer lasting! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is in a spot that I was about buying this for other types of work.",

Really it is a impact gun and only use this if you need a lot of power or have used impact guns before. The only downside it is heavy and a little too big for some tight areas where a air powered impact gun might fit. I have both so I can't complain too much but the cordless thing is priceless. If you do buy this get the 5.0 or 9.0 batteries or it's not worth it. The power comes from the batteries so they do matter.",
