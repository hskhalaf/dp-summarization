Tends to be a bit off with regard to tracking actual steps. Sometimes just refuses to sync for whatever reason - then sometimes it just does. Stopped using it after a month. Cant complain too much as the only reason I bought it was for a work \"Step challenge\" so for 20 bucks it did its job (I guess).",

This device pairs with a ton of fitness programs (I use it with myfitnesspal) and is a great tracker if you don't want to pay for a fancy FitBit or something more expensive. It will still tell you what your sleep cycles are like and even somehow knows when you eat. Love it!!",

Actual steps shows up in the app. 3) Also goal setting is with respect to those \"POINTS\" and not actual steps.",

I loved the app and still use it for the slew sounds but I have converted to the fit bit. My suggestion is go ahead and spend the extra money on a different tracker of your choice. You get what you pay for & this is especially true!",

My husband was always so nervous about it falling out of the band that we ended up taping it in. I would say that the only thing it has on the shine is the physical button rather than the unreliable tap required by the Shine.",

      "text": "Cons: Band broke after only two weeks, with normal use. The \"clock\" function will not sync to the proper time. The sleep tracker doesn't recognize if you get up briefly in the night and then go back to bed. It thinks you had an incredibly short night of sleep. Pros: App is decent and I'm pleased with the exercise tracking. For the price, it's not a bad tracker.",

I went back in the pool two days later and it stopped working completely. I was very disappointed. Also, the flash frequently says it is disconnected in the app and you have to really be patient going through numerous steps to reconnect the flash to the flash app. I would not recommend this product and wish I could return it for a refund.",

I ended up buying for my wife and two teenagers, and they all love their misfit because it's so easy. 3-17-15: update - after buying 4 misfits for family, 2 have stopped working, and two bands have broken where it holds the fitness monitor.
