Also great for adults who like chess but do not have a partner. I relate it a lot to chess as you have to predict several moves/positions ahead of time, to visually picture the layout in order to win. I highly recommend this as not only a 1-person game but as a teaching tool as well.",

The base has rubber non-slip pads for great traction and holds motionless while snapping the game pieces in place and when the bearing is rolling through them. The difficulty progresses at a comfortable level and it's fun watching the ball bearing travel downward through the game pieces in the hopes of making it all the way to the goal, the red box.

He wanted to stay up way past his bedtime to \"play\" with this. Before we opened it, I told him it was for learning, and he groaned. I told him learning can be fun. He didn't believe me. I think he believes me, now. Highly recommended!",

He's worked thru 6 of the challenges, which really (to me) go from super-basic to more challenging pretty quickly. Took him about 30 min on card 6 to figure it out, and that was with papa's help. Something he can grow with. Even though it's very challenging, he still wants to try and is even experimenting with his own laser paths, which I encourage.",

The puzzles are pretty easy up into the 30s, but would be a better challenge for younger people (I'm 32). Some puzzles have a few ways to solve them which makes you feel a bit cheated when you go to check your maze and you actually didn't have the right answer but it worked anyway. Probably not much replay-ability once you've completed the puzzles. But a good game for what it is. Solid time waster that makes you think a bit.",

She's not much of an athlete, but she loves to challenge herself. This game is perfect because she can play alone or ask others for help in playing along with her. She's been really into it, and it pulls her away from the tablet for a little while, at least.",
