      "text": "I have had multiple dog brushes with these types of wires before. The best part about this brush is that the wires actually go back inside the brush when you're not using it. It makes it easy to clean so you're not bending in the wires while you're trying to get the hair out and it also makes it so the wires don't get bent when they're just in your basket or your drawer or where ever you keep your dogs brushes. Because the wires go back inside it protects them so that when you need to use it it does not scratch your dog. Excellent product highly recommend it to anyone with the pets especially who needs regular brushing!",

Ethel had enjoyed her brushing, my hand had not cramped, and I had all this loose hair in hand. What that means is I will have a lot less of Ethel's hair on my bed and favorite chair.",

Bodie lay on the floor and thoroughly enjoyed the process which lasted for just a few minutes. The result: a happy and nice looking dog, hair amounting the size of a small soccer ball and easily disposed in the trash can, and no mess whatsoever. Impressive, very impressive.",

THE REVIEW: it works like a brush oughta, takes off loose hair, and thins the undercoat very well. Press till it clicks and it remains exposed for brushing, hold it over a can or other container press the button again it closes again dumping all of the trapped hair! MIRACLE, compared to what I was doing!!! Your mileage may vary!",

I was worried that the sharp little tines on this brush would irritate him but he LOVED it - and it was so easy to clean after every couple of strokes. Just push the button and the hair falls onto the ground in a neat little rectangle. Best grooming tool I've bought in years. I'm sure it will also aid in removing his winter coat when he sheds THAT.

Other brushes haven't been ideal at getting all the extra hair off, but this one does a fantastic job. A few brushing sessions post-winter fur and there's already a substantial difference in her coat. She seems more comfortable and enjoys being brushed. It's also really effective at getting any mats out, ones that standard brushes don't touch. The handle is a little awkward, only comfortably brushes a certain way. Cleaning is literally a click and tap into the trash. Easiest cleanup possible. The bristles are a bit stabby, so don't use a ton of pressure. Overall, absolutely worth the buy.",

For most cats you can\u2019t really use it for all parts of the body because it\u2019s huge. It\u2019s a very large brush. I can do the back and sides of my larger cats. But I can\u2019t do underneath, chest, etc. I don\u2019t think you can really use it at all on a small cat as it\u2019s just too big. I gave it four stars because it\u2019s a nice brush for the right size animal. I just took one star because I bought it for my cats and it\u2019s not really suitable for a thorough grooming.",

This self cleaning slicker brush is part of the answer. The strong, springy needlelike teeth pull smoothly through her outer coat, reaching down to the undercoat where the shedding is taking place. She seems puzzled by how good it feels! Cleaning really is a snap: push the button, the teeth retract, and the fur comes off in a nice woven clump. Could NOT be easier! The sound the mechanism makes (a loud snap) startles my dog just a bit, but she's getting used to it. This brush is a great way to finish our evening grooming sessions.",

When I retract the comb, most of the fur sits on top and I can brush it off with my hand. However, there are some that stay stuck to the comb and is harder to clean but you can't expect it to work perfectly ya know. I'd say it was a pretty worthy investment.",

She seemed to not enjoy the metal tines on her skin even though I so lightly brushed her. Pressed the button to retract the brushes tines, which worked great, but the static electricity caused by the brushing made my dog's hairs stick to the plastic of the brush like crazy. The seller should have emphatically said that this brush was not good and not meant for short haired dogs.",

      "text": "This self cleaning slicker brush is awesome. My dog has a really thick undercoat, and the self cleaning function on this brush makes it super easy to finish a brushing session quickly. I use the slicker brush as the finishing brush for when I brush out my dog. This brush helps a lot because you don't have to spend any time picking fur out of the pins, you just push a button and the fur stuck in the pins falls off the brush. Also, it makes storing the brush without damaging the pins.",

      "text": "Hertzko Slicker Brush is larger than I thought, so a bit big for cats, although they seem to like it. It removes more hair from my shorthaired cats than the long-haired cat. It's kind of hard to depress the button to clean, but that could be due to my arthritis. I think this particular brush is more suited to dog owners, the larger surface seems better for a bit larger animal. It's definitely good at self cleaning, if your have no trouble with depressing and impressing the button.",

      "text": "I bought this because I have a cat that has long fur and as she has aged, she has developed tangles in her fur that I need to remove. This brush does an amazing job removing lose fur and tangles. The design makes it easy to clean off the fur you brushed. My only complaint is that the brush is a bit of an odd size. I would say it is perfect for a medium size dog. It is a touch large and awkward for a cat (which is fine, I'll make due as it still works great), and it would be too small for a large dog.",
