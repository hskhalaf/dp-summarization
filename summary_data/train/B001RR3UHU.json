      "text": "My niece recommended this for my plantar fasciitis which has been horrible for 2 years. I watched the KT video online to make sure I used it correctly. The tape made a huge difference right away, and after about a week of the tape plus a stretching exercise I found, I was about 90% pain free. Now I'm using it on my sore elbow. The only downside is that no matter how carefully I apply it, the darn tape only stays on for about 2 days. The edges start peeling up within hours. I trim it off as it comes up. Still, it's worth it to relieve the pain in my foot. I've gone through 4 boxes so far.",

I had a groin strain and was skeptical about using this since it didn't work well for my daughter but didn't have other options since it was late. I taped late evening and the next morning my leg pain was minimal. I took the tape off after 4 days and it never once peeled off. I'm fully recovered and back to exercising.",

He recommended that I look for, and purchase KT Tape, which I did at a Sports Store.... It was so expensive, I looked for KT Tape thru amazon.com and found it! I was so Happy and purchased the KT Tape immediately! I highly recommend this tape for pain and injuries!! You really Must clean the area, use Alcohol and dry it before applying the tape. Great stuff!!",

Used it for my shoulder too for \"bicep tendonitis\" it also worked and stuck around a little longer in that area.",

You're able to use a mouse and keyboard without having an inch of material under your wrists that make it difficult to use a mouse or keyboard.",
