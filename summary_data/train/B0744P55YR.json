      "text": "Very happy with the soldering iron kit. It comes in a nice zippered case to keep everything together. I soldered a loose connection in a circuit board as soon as i received it. Heated up fast and melted the solder quickly, even on the lowest temp setting and cooled off quickly after i unplugged it. Extremely happy with my purchase after the first use, especially for the price.",

Although I had no prior experience performing any complex electronic repairs, this kit had everything I needed at an unbeatable price. Purchasing everything separately not only would have been a hassle, but it would have cost a great deal more. I couldn't possibly be more pleased with the combination of quality and value in this kit.",
