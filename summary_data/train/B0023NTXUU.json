Right where the rubber foot meets the canvas upper there is a rubber seam the sticks out pretty far into the inner boot - right at the bend of foot to chin.

The biggest disappointment was when I took them off they were wet inside, I thought it might be sweat, but when I took the inserts out you could see the wetness in the bottom of the boot. My kids never complained, so they at least did the trick for this trip, but will be ordering a different brand for the next one.",

He has wide feet and I thought it would be better if we order these boots in size wide and one size up. When boots arrived they looked so small and narrow. I got even more upset when I saw the lining. It is very narrow and makes it impossible to put these boots on. Very disappointed. Stay away from this product !",
