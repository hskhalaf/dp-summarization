I'm 6'6, and i seen a review saying it isn't for guys over 5'11 or something like that, but it works well for me. I worked out for about 30 minutes with them and when i took them off, it felt like my legs were extra bouncy lol. Anyways, it seems to work, I'll leave another review after a few months",

The two smaller cuffs attach to your legs and have no problems. The second part of this device is a belt that you wear above your waist. You connect the cuffs and the belt with tension bands to add vertical resistance to your jumps. Because the belt is above your waist and the tension bands are below it, the belt tries to move down during exercise. This makes the belt cut down into your hips.",
