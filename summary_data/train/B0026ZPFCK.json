The other fans have speed control and are set to lowest setting, as for this one just spins at its default speed. This was an emergency purchase so I didn't attempt to purchase oem case fans. But seeing the difference in brightness and speed, I might purchase two more to finish out the case set up.",

The fan isn't designed so it can be opened up, so I can't get even try to lubricate it. Of course, it could very well be shot bearings, anyway. Either way, I can't fix the problem.",

I replaced it with the 2nd fan and the 2nd fan was just a noisy. I will probably return it. But be advised neither one of my 2 fans are silent. Nor are they as quiet as the factory fan.

This means if my fans aren't running at full-speed the LEDs flicker proportionally to the power reduction. Needless to say, it was an annoyance I didn't want to deal with.

      "text": "Ordered two of these to replace the front fans in my Antec 900 case. They ran fine but the color was off. Not exactly what the picture shows. They look blue until they are next to my existing fans and all of my blue LED peripherals. They have a bit of a violet hue. Very close to blue, but off just enough to annoy me every time I looked at them. Decided to return them and pay a bit extra for original, 3-speed Antec fans I found elswhere. If you're not picky about exactly matching the color like I am, they are fine.",

      "text": "Fan has become incredibly clanky, rattly, and loud upon start up. The sound can be heard from quite far away and almost sounds like the fan is hitting something (which it isn't based on the look of my set up). But, after 5 to 15 minutes, the fan 'warms up' or something and quiets back down. The fan is still pretty loud (its a large fan) but completely stops its rattling after the warm up period. Don't get this if you are specifically looking for some quiet. I am a little worried that the rattling I hear could mean more problems in the future but so far it's lasted more than 2 months in its current state without getting worse.",

The bottom line is, this is a fan that does the job, looks nice, and runs super quiet IF you plug it into the motherboard directly or use a fan controller. Unless you are deaf, or want to be, I would never recommend plugging it directly into the supply.",

Running at 2000 rpms its nice and quiet, functioning as the only exhaust fan it keeps my system at 77 degrees even when playing high demanding games. That says alot when u add the fact I live in the western Texas desert in a room with poor airflow. Installation was a snap for someone of limited tech experience and the LED look is stellar.",

The Good: Quiet - You can hear it but not a jet engine like other models I have tried. Provides a nice amount of air movement Lowered CPU temp by a good 10 degrees Light output not overly bright that it's annoying Cons: No fan grill included but for the price that's fine. Overall great performance. For $10 it was just what I needed",

The only thing I don't like is the slight bit of increased noise, but that's an acceptable trade-off for increased airflow. Next server I build, I'll probably opt for a liquid cooling solution, but for now, this fan helps out a lot.",
