It is a perfect set of gloves for any beginner, especially for a toddler who is into anything! These are a little big for his tiny hands, he just turned 3 but we tighten the Velcro so the gloves don't come lose. I don't think he is holding it right when he puts his hands inside but they stay on just fine, usually a couple of minutes when he is done playing with them LOL",
