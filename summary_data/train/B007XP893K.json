      "text": "This GPX CD player works well; highly recommended. A note about the BATTERIES, though: It requires two 1.5-volt AA batteries (for a total of 3 volts.) I would recommend using Akaline batteries. NiMH rechargable batteries (Nickle-metal-hydride) do not seem to work well, if at all. That's probably because NiMH batteries are actually 1.2 volts each (for a total of 2.4 volts, not 3.) It's because of the different chemistry they use. This CD player seems to be sensitive to the voltage level-- which is not that unusual, as some electronic devices just need the full 3 volts. Otherwise, the player works very well.",

I was struggling to find a portable CD player like this with decent reviews, but decided to give this one a chance. He says it works very well and it does not skip. He has no problem using it, despite his vision impairment. I believe he mostly uses it around his apartment and when walking around the halls in their retirement community. All in all, it seems like a good product.",

Never again! I must look for a different brand and I hope theirs will perform better. Since I must give a star rating I would do .001% of a star.

I purchased this one thinking it was going to be cheap and i was right. The plastic is super cheap and flimsy and the headphones are basically useless, but the CD player does work and sounds OK. If you are looking for a good quality player this isn't it. If you are looking for a cheap player that works this will suffice.",

He likes to be able to have the choice of CD or music. We were glad that these came with headphones, however the ear pieces were too large for his ears so we purchased smaller ones.

I already demolished the packing material ( Oops ). To close --- please refrain from buying this CD player and buy one that includes everything. Have an blessed day!!!",

So the CD option in my opinion is worthless. All I have now is a FM radio. This was a present for a family member that had a stroke and has limited movement and slight. Do Not Recommend this product.",

The anti-skip function does need to be turned on for most operations, I have found. Sound quality is good. FM tuner is a random scan type which eventually lands on the station sought, but it would have been preferable if the FM station's call sign would appear in the LED window to make tuning easier. It isn't always obvious the correct station has been located until the program presenters speak and are identifiable.",
