After just a month a bear decided to destroy the target, along with a less effective foam target I had. I'm not sure what bears have against archery targets, but they are both wrecked. If you are wondering what's inside, it's like a huge blanket was squeezed into the target. I'll post a picture. I'll be reordering the target and storing it inside.",

Absolutely I can still put other 1000 more on it before I turn it over for other side. I do use a paper target on top because the printing is all fade out after few hundred shoots. Pulling arrow out from this bag is much easier than these foam type targets. My bow is Hoyt Carbon Spyder with 50lb draw. Update, over 5000 shoots on both side, the bag is still useable but some area are too weak to hold the shot, the arrow when through.",

I end up shooting the nocks off many arrows because of how soft this target gets. I've shot it hundreds of times and it takes hit after hit but quickly becomes way to soft. It's annoying to hit dead center of any of the bullseye and have the arrow sag making a follow up shot impossible. You can turn the target around to expose a good side and it will take another few hundred impacts. I shoot a lot, I wore this out in a weekend.",

Although this may be set on the ground, we did set out an old folding ladder and strapped the target to it just for the practice. Better than chancing shooting the arrows into the ground...which my husband did...hence the ladder. My son is a quite the marksman with the compound bow...unlike his dad. LOL!

The main issue is that the cover tends to snag on field points and would sometimes pull your tips right off.

Because of that, you run the risk of hitting an embedded point and ruining your other arrows. Also note that the cover is quite tough and was a bit of a challenge for me to pin a target face down.

      "text": "Good crossbow target...for the money.So far, this target has met my expectations. I have a Barnett Jackal crossbow rated at 315fps using 20\" bolts and 100-125gr fieldtips...it will bury the bolts more than halfway into this target @ 20yds. Using a broadhead practice head will tear up the innards of this target, so suggest using those in moderation. Overall, I am pleased and can see this lasting for a long time.",
