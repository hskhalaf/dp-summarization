Otherwise, it is well-made. Color is beautiful. Anolon\u2019s marketing say their enamel products are made in China or Thailand. The product I received did not have any indication at all on the pot, lid or box about where it was made.",

I used this braiser to make a tagine that I had been making for years in a Pyrex, and this took it to the next level completely. My family couldn't get over how the same food became exponentially more moist, flavorful and delicious. The ease of use, even heating and beautiful design have me completely sold. This is my first piece of cast iron cookware, but I'm afraid that anything I buy after this will be a disappointment! With its beautiful looks and superior cooking abilities the bar has been set high.",

The basic features (handles on either side, curved lid handle - better than a nob!) are nice, but ultimately, it's how well it cooks that matters. We've been using it for a few months in the oven and on the stovetop, and aside from normal seasoning, it's not showing much sign of wear. It cooks evenly and thoroughly and I'm impressed.",

Otherwise as long as it is dried well, it will keep on looking great. Great idea for any level of home chefs.",
