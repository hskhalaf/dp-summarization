Anyway, I have high bocce standards and there are a lot of crappy sets out there. This set is perfect regulation size and weight- no complaints from my old school uncles who've been playing for half a century. The carrying case has nice dividers to keep the balls in place, but it's also flexible so it's easy to carry. Overall great in both style and quality - a great buy!",

We used this in the Texas hill country where there were bits of limestone all over the yard we played in. The balls took the abuse well and only suffered minor cosmetic damage even with hitting pretty solidly on rock several times. I think if these were used in a normal suburban yard or a beach or pretty much anywhere without rocks, they wouldn't even suffer cosmetic damage. I am very happy with the quality of the set!",

So far, playing on sandy grass (Florida backyard) I have seen minimal scuffing and no chipping, even with decent hits from other balls.

      "text": "This is a great set. The balls are regulation size and weight so there are no suprises with that. The bag is well made with padded dividers between the balls. I've used the set a few times now (mainly at the beach) and have gotten compliments on it each time. I have owned two other bocce sets and was frustrated either with construction, or durability. I've only had this set a short time but I'm really happy with it so far.",
