I recommend for women that don't have a lot of strands but that are looking for smoothness and volume especially at the roots. I find that a lot of thinning-hair products tend to dry hair out and make it frizzier in order to create the much-needed volume. This keeps my hair so sleek. I haven't had a chance to use this for long duration, but so far so good. The price is a bit higher than most, but you don't need a lot and it really works!",

I don't usually use conditioner because it makes my hair so greasy but this conditioner does not, it's the first one I've found that doesn't. I love that it's sulfate and parables free, we are exposed to enough chemicals on a daily basis who needs it in their conditioner, not me. I would reccomend to everyone!! I recieved this product at a discounted price in return for my honest review.",
