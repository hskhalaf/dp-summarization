The last 18650 battery pack apparently had a loose sensor wire that we did not see because of the packaging and when plugged in to the unit with a hardy high ho and a cloud of smoke the charger died. There is no reverse polarity protection in this unit and for $60.00 you would think they could buy a 50 cent diode. We have lost $60.00 and we are very upset about the loss. I am hoping I will hear from someone with a reasonable remedy.",

I specifically got it to charge my 5500ma S3 Lipo's thinking that \"6 amps\" would allow 1C charging. Turns out that the \"50 watts\" is the limiting factor. My S3 batteries will only charge at 4.5 amps, not the 5.5 I was hoping for. I know, it was pretty clear for those electricians out there but if you are a newbie just be aware that charging a battery like mine will take a bit longer. Great quality unit though!",

This version of the iMAX B6 can be plugged directly into a 110V outlet for home use and has separate DC inputs (11V~18V) for field use. At this point in time, I've only used the iMAX B6AC V2 to charge Turnigy nano-tech 1000mah 2S packs, so I cannot comment on it's ability to charge at higher current levels. Overall, it's a great little charger and well worth the premium price for a \"Genuine\" item.",

I checked them using a simple voltmeter (I have a PhD in physics so I know my way around electronics). Anyway, I bought another charger from another company and it worked no problem.

Definitely worth the buy.",
