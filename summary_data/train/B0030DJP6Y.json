      "text": "I purchased these Aqua Sphere Vista Junior goggles for my 5 year old son (he'll be 6 in August 2016) and he loves them. He's used them 5 times already in the swimming pool and said he can finally see when searching for those water rings in the pool. They do have a snug fit, but the straps can be adjusted. I love that they have good suction around the eyes that keeps the water out. These goggles are clear which helps my son's visibility in the pool. So far they seem very durable and haven't had any issues with them. They also come with a nice container to store them in when not in use.",

Sure enough he loves them and the 3 best features are 1 they have a little button to push while you pull the strap to fit perfectly, super easy! 2 the whole goggle is flexible which makes them comfortable and less likely to break. 3 they have a good suction. Awesome product!",

Bought a junior version for a 5 year old that has been afraid to even get in the pool until he was 3, and still afraid to get water above his neck. I had him put this on during his bath, sit in the bathtub, and just ask him to lean forward and put his face in the water and look at his toes. He did, and within a few days he was doing cannonballs in the pool. Turns out he was afraid of water in his eyes, but once he was brave enough to test this in the tub, he had confidence to do anything. Swim lessons are next!",

She has always been very rough with them so I was not surprised (i believe she stepped on them maybe). They did seem pretty durable though. In that time she used them quiet a bit and she never complained about them. Now our > 3.5 yr old has started using a pair of her own and she was able to use them the other day without much fuss. I would say that's definitely a good sign on these googles. We recommend them.",

It's very comfortable on the face while staying put, even with all the jumping and diving a busy body can do! It's very well made and we used all year long with no problem... We just ended up giving it to my niece , because she kept borrowing it, she loved so much.",

His amazing swim instructor at our local YMCA, \"Mr. Ken\", let him borrow a used, yet slightly cracked Aqua Sphere Vista Junior Swim mask on his first swim lesson to help overcome this fear. The crack didn't leak water into his eyes, surprisingly. He learned to swim quickly once he discovered the mask. It was such a helpful too that I invested in a brand new one from Amazon. At about $25, this swim mask may seem pricey, but it will not leak water. Even when cracked. Just be sure side straps are tightened enough.",

Then use the buttons to loosen again when taking off. No stretching over hair and face and adjusting for leaks if you follow directions.",

It never lets any water in and is much more soft and forgiving around the eyes and face. Now my toddler swims underwater longer, and just loves swim time!",
