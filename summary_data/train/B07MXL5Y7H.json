The unit worked perfectly, managed to reduce the temperature by a couple of degrees (30 to 27) when placed in the master bedroom with the door open so helped cool the landing and second and third bedrooms..which was enough to make it more bearable but most importantly reduced the humidity to a comfortable level. I paid just over \u00a3250 and I feel it was worth the money so happy with the purchase. Build quality was fine and I personally didn\u2019t feel it was overly noisy..",

It\u2019s loud & vibrates allot so the noise aspect is a bit of an issue, but it does cool off the room. I think for the price, I did expect allot better.

The compressor is almost inaudible when the fan is on full speed and certainly not intrusive. It proved amazingly effective in the recent heatwave, coping with external temperatures of 34 degrees C, even with substantial 'leakage' from the fanlight. We are now arranging to plumb the system into a wall vent, which should see the system even more effective.",

Would definitely recommend. I just bought a couple of window covers that unzip to put the hose through. Also it was a bargain at \u00a3250 when I ordered.",
