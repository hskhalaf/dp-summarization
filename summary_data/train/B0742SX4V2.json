I order a 9....I usually wear an 8.5 however I live in Northern Michigan and want room if I need to add winter socks. I had a similar pair from Cabelas that lasted through 2 puppies & several years. I always spray water repellant stuff on my boots to make them easier to clean. I like these boots instead of winter slippers...I don't have to wear socks with them....they are great for quickly getting on/off, doing errands, letting pups out, getting firewood, getting the mail, etc. I especially love wearing with leggings. Super comfy! We will see how they do this winter.",

The buttons are not just for looks they do function so that you can fold your boots down. I wear a size 8 and ordered a size 8 they are snug, but it's recommended that you order your normal size as they do stretch a bit. I have been walking around the house in them for a few hours and they are starting to get a bit looser. Definitely a good investment as I won't need to buy more boots for a few winters.",

They are the most comfortable pair of fuzzy boots i have ever bought!! They keep you warm and dry even on a rainy day. I would wear them all day if I could. I bought a 6 and fit just right, but i'm normally a 5, so consider one size larger when you purchase these. I'm already considering a second pair in a different color. If the shoe fits, buy it in every color!",

I also live in the Midwest so I understand when to wear a shoe like this. Fair warning: I have flat feet (hardly any arch) so of course these shoes are not healthy for extended wear if you have arch issues. Even with that being said, I will definitely be purchasing a black pair. Everything in moderation ;)",

They keep my feet warm and water doesn't soak through them (granite I put water resistant spray on them, so that may be why!). For 38$, this item is totally worth it. I know I got an insane deal... The next day I bought them they went back up to 76$. I am so glad I made the decision to buy these, I would definitely recommend! Heck, I like them better than my Ugg boots... That's just my personal opinion though!! (Bearpaw sounds better than Ugg anyway lol...)",

All of my Bearpaw boots fit as well as my UGGs, are just as warm, and are a whole lot cheaper! The only odd thing about this pair was that when I sprayed them with the usual waterproofing spray, this pair looks significantly darker than they did before I sprayed them, which was not the case with either the navy pair or the cranberry pair that I bought. They don't look bad, just darker, but it does seem peculiar.",

They are sized small - I usually wear 6 1/2 or 7 and needed an 8 - the 7 was tight in the arch across the top of my foot. The 8s are a big roomy in the toe but I would still recommend sizing up. They could use a little more support in the sole, but otherwise they are quite comfortable, very warm and I have gotten lots of compliments. I am satisfied with my purchase, and will buy this brand again.",

They are super soft, super comfy and super cute.",

I have not yet worn them I did try them on. I could have ordered my regular size. I have issues with my feet swelling so I ordered the next size. For those that are wondering if you want extra room for say warm socks then go ahead and get a size larger but I think they run pretty much to size. Really like them. I hope they stand up to the Winter!!",

The outside seems like genuine suede and is a soft beautiful gray. They are very warm. The sole seems pretty slip proof. I own a few pairs of these in different colors (winter blue and pom berry) and they have a different inside lining that is real wool. I always use a few coatings of the waterproofing spray on all my sheepskin suede boots and it really helps keep them looking nice.",
