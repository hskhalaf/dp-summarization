The thermal efficiency is LESS than water. BUT, the boiling point of this coolant is much higher, so you will be protected from potentially damaging hot spots and vaporization of coolant inside your heads. Does what it is supposed to do.",

So after running this stuff in my 70 aar cuda for 6 months and chasing my tail trying to get it to run cool I finally found the problem. It was the Evans coolant. This stuff works but you will run hotter. In my case I dropped 30 degrees temp by switching back to the old green antifreeze and water 50/50. I was not comfortable running 210 and watching it climb higher at stops. So if you have an old muscle car I would recommend saving your money and use what it had in it back in the day.",

The factory cooland, just like all the reat will build way too mutxh preasure and get way too hot causing excess preasure and over heating. The evans stops the cavitation and the heat issues preventing another radiator to pop. It works and its well worth the price even at $35 a gallon. If it keeps the radiator from getting a leak its great prevenative maint. Go get ya some, and maybe evans will sponsor me after this, but I know im not jay leno either.",

    "description": "Size:Pack of 1Evans High Performance Waterless Engine Coolant, EC53001, is specifically designed for all modern, classic, and vintage gasoline engines, light duty diesels, LP and CNG vehicles. Evans High Performance Coolant (HPC) defends against boil-over and corrosion while allowing the engine to continue producing its peak horsepower. When converting an engine from a water-based coolant to HPC, great care should be given during the installation (conversion) process to ensure that all of the old water-based coolant and water is removed before installing HPC. It is recommended that the system be flushed with Evans Prep Fluid prior to installing HPC When the installation is complete, the water content of the coolant should be no more than 3 percent for optimum performance. Evans HPC coolant contains a bittering agent/bitterant. Evans coolant is proudly made in the USA.",
