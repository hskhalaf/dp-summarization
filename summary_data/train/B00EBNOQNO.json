I could put several cards in my old one with no problem getting a card out. i love your design & the different compartments & i cant even tell its in my pocket' i will give you 5 stars based on the hope the slots will stretch.

Now, it's clipped in and with our digital payments, how many cards do you actually carry now? This is a good solution!",

The leather is a bit stiff making it difficult to insert cards into pockets but should become more pliable over time and use. Overall a good option if you don't want to carry a wallet in your back pocket. Shipping was fast and packaging was secure.",
