The brackets connect to the preexisting screw mounts in the back. I used a masonry bit and my lithium ion drill (not a hammer drill). Each hole took about 10 minutes of elbow grease. After that, I used tapcon screws, mounted the baskets and finished tightening. All in all, the boxes look great especially for the price. Fyi, mounting screws are NOT included so you'll need to buy them from a hardware store ($.35 each).",

In the past I purchased cheaper planters that came completely unassembled, they were very difficult to put together and still had to be secured with cable ties. I am very pleased with this planter.",

      "text": "This functions as expected. Is classy and contains plants! Minor observations include: 1) If your deck railing is thin, you may need to put in a piece of wood to buffer the brackets as they don't get very thin (especially vertically), 2) Birds will come sit near this and tend to enjoy picking away at and (I guess) eating the straw basket, and 3) If you live on a 2nd story or higher and have people living below you, they may experience some water trickle runoff after watering - as the straw basket is obviously porous. Overall, I'm satisfied with this product.",

I think that if someone had a very narrow railing it might be a problem though. The one modification we made was to wedge some wood (a piece of a tree branch would do) under the edge of the deck railing where the clamp connects. This helped the unit to sit more horizontally without pitching forward and also helped distribute the weight better.",

Instead the wing nut is permanently attached to the bolt and there is no way to use the wing nut because you need space under the brackets, yet these are over railing mounts. Luckily I have enough hardware around I was able to use bolts and nuts, but not 100% happy with the setup.",

When they arrived (I bought three), one of the planters was missing one of the braces that attaches it to the rail of my deck. So, I called customer service and they sent one to me with little trouble. My only other complaint is that after one summer on my deck, the braces started to rust. This summer, I'm going to spray paint them with Rustoleum and see if that helps. That's why I gave them only 4 stars. They are very pretty planters and really look nice on my deck.",
