We ordered based on mixed reviews, my husband set it up and after 5 minutes of cleaning the carpet it tripped the electric. We tried again think it could be a coincidence and it tripped again, my husband then saw water leaking from the canister into the electric ports of the carpet cleaner. Everything was attached as stated in instructions. Amazon were helpful and arrange a return the next day and posted out a new machine. Which had the exact same problem. We have now returned both. Clearly a manufacturing issue, so dangerous!",

It really made a massive difference on all of the carpets I've used it on. Doing stairs can be a little labour intensive with the attachment tool, but great for upholstery and car seats. All around a great purchase!",
