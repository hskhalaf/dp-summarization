It's probably an abnormality of my ear rather than a fault of the earphone, but ear hooks would be guaranteed to solve the problem for just about any ear. These earphones are made in Japan.",

Still SR80 seems to have more depth and the sound is more relaxed and more enjoyable. Now the bad: they may look like portable but they are open back and leak sound heavily. Also very unconfortable for my ears. The drivers never seem to cover my ears completely and after one hour my ear lobes hurt like hell. I will try to put iGrado drivers into some other cans casing to see what happens. Will keep posted",
