Jeffrey Starr is very nice make up and although this was a little pricey and again cost a lot more than I found it locally, The make up is good quality and I\u2019m very glad that I got it. There is actually a good amount of product and each color and the colors are very vibrant and pigmented and bright! I really recommend although it is a little pricey!",
