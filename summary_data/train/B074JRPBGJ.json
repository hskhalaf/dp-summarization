The whole top portion can be opened via velcro on both sides to slide a foot in very easy. Worth the extra $ for the lightness and design compared to a few other types of toddler footwear. The only questionable thing was it arrived in a clear cheapo crinkley plastic bag, not in a shoe box of its own. I thought it might have been a knock off but it was the real deal (thank goodness!) I am considering buying this again as it seems a good fit for my son as his feet grow.",
