Unfortunately, the first camera I ordered was totally jammed and defective... but since I liked the camera anyway I ordered an exchange. Much to my dismay, the replacement was defective as well! I am going to try and return it now. Honestly wanted to be satisfied and keep the camera, sad my products didn't work. Customer service was great though.",

      "text": "I am loving this camera! I'm not quite understanding why some of the reviews say that this is not a good camera, but their wrong. It doesn't feel like a toy camera, it doesn't have a weird texture feel to the camera surface or strong smell. It's perfect. It as exactly as seller described it and it comes with English instruction. I don't mind that it has Chinese writing on camera surface. The only complaint I have is the camera strap is a little flimsy so I would replace it as soon as possible. The camera works very well and it was a excellent condition when I took it out the box. I am very happy with this purchase.",

Not every retailer of photographic goods in the Western world ship to or do business with the Near East. Amazon is a blessing.",

Not to mention that it rips the film sprockets and gets stuck mid-roll. You're better off with a holga. Not worth $50.",
