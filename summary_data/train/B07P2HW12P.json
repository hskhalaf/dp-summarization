What I'm not going to ignore is the fact that it uses an ancient version of Bluetooth (specifically 3.0) that is highly vulnerable to attacks and shouldn't be considered acceptable for a portable input device. Bluetooth is not the most secure wireless technology to use anyway, but relying on a 10 year old protocol for a device that's likely to be used in public is pretty dumb. Returned it.",

Im glad I decided to give it a try as it didn\u2019t take me too long to get the hang of it. It seems very sturdy, compact and pairs easily, overall a really great product that I do recommend!",

The touchpad with mouse buttons is accurate and works well. This keyboard is supposed to work with Windows as well. One problem I found was that I can not charge it while in BT mode, as it thinks it is plugged in to a PC via USB. This didn't prove to be a problem though as the battery life is pretty long. A little pricey still, but I'm sure in time it will come down.",

It's responsiveness is lacking, especially with multi touch, and the left/right buttons are not discrete from the track pad resulting in the mouse pointer jumping locations when pressed. My biggest complaint is that the track pad goes to sleep very frequently and takes a long time to wake back up. Overall it is good in a pinch.",

Sometimes tapping the mousepad even gently will result in either a left-mouseclick or a right-mouseclick (50-50 chance). The only way to be sure it is a mouseclick of either type is to force depress the mousepad to do your click. Even then, the mousepad sometimes registers the wrong type of mouseclick.

I like the fact that when you are using the mouse cursor it shows a little dot on the screen to where you are moving. now the size you do have to get used to it because it is quite small but again I bought it for the convenience of it being small.

If any con I want to point out, is I hope it comes with a number keyboard as most of laptop don\u2019t have one. And I hope the folding parts can last long.",

I haven't had a power issue but, if i 'feel' as if i used it a lot.. will just plug it up. I did notice that i could not use keyboard if texting on FB, however. (strange). Highly recommended!",

There is also no dedicated escape key you have to hold function and the tilda key at the same time. there is also no dedicated delete key you have to hold function and the backspace key. I had intended to use this keyboard for playing some steam video games on the couch but the lack of these two dedicated keys made many games very frustrating. The keyboard is perfectly functional just does not work well for my intended purposes.",
