I will be moving them to another spot but I think the controller should be secured to them a bit better.",

We are currently trying to find other solutions. These also block the charging port, which means one cannot charge the controller while it us mounted.",

They look really nice on the wall and very sleek, you can barely see it when the controller is on it. Highly recommend in terms of look, value, and practicality!",
