Most media it works great for, but for some it's barely louder than the TVs built in speaker. Works great for a small room. But if you are like me and have a noisy wall air-conditioner and traffic noise outside, I would invest in a more powerful speaker. I also find it irritating having to point the remote at such a specific spot before it will work. I'm mostly happy with it, but I do wish I did more research before buying.",

You also have to max the volume up enable to get a fuller sound from it. Maybe because I'm a musician and i'm used to hearing big sounds all the time. This will work perfectly depending on your application.",
