      "text": "The bag does not stay on the mower. I often end up holding it as I zip around my lawn. Very bad design, since it appears that the blower blows grass mostly over the bag, through the space between the bag and mower cover, and not to the back of the bag. This blower interaction causes the bag to fall off. I love it otherwise, but it is a really big pain to keep putting the bag on or hold on to it. If you're not bagging the grass clippings, then no problem!",

      "text": "I've used corded electric for about 35 years and wasn't sure if I would like cordless. This works quite well for me as my front and back yard are not that large and it cuts nicely. It has more vacuum action than my B&D Lawn Hog but nothing compares the the Craftsman (made by B&D) in 1980. The grass catcher is harder to get off and on than my other ones. Being so narrow a cut makes it hard to keep a straight line. But going from corded to cordless is fantastic. I spend as much time mowing my yard now as I used to spend untangling the extension cord and winding it back up. How good is that?",

      "text": "I'm satisfied with the purchase The cons are: Only a 16 inch cutting width which makes more passes to complete and the 2 batteries that come with unit will wear down faster Rear bagging only feature Grass collection bag is on the small side which makes more trips to empty Did I mention it only comes with 2 batteries O.K. The pros are: Easy to adjust cutting height No gas to spill No tune ups No cords to pull and pull your shoulder out Quiet Easy to start up Easy to push Easy to store The cut is good as my gas powered unit The pros out weigh the cons by far",

It wouldn't stall when I pushed it very very slowly through the thicker areas, but had to raise the blade up higher than I wanted and go extremely slowly just so it would work at all. The first battery ran out of juice before I finished mowing the back yard, and the second battery wasn't able to complete the smaller front yard.",

So I got one of my plastic clamps I use to keep plywood in place when I saw and clamped open the shoot.

    "title": "BLACK+DECKER CM1640 40V MAX Cordless Lawn Mower,",
    "description": "Style:40V Cordless Lawn Mower Kit\n\nLightweight, easy to maneuver, and no cords (view larger). Designed for cutting efficiency and the freedom of cordless convenience, the Black & Decker CM1640 16-Inch Cordless Mower is ideal for smaller yards up to 1/8 of an acre. Weighing only 38 pounds, the CM1640 cordless mower is lightweight, compact, and easy to maneuver for great cutting results with minimal effort. It's powered by Black & Decker's 40-volt MAX lithium-ion battery system, and the two included batteries combine to give you up to 30 minutes of mowing. \n\nEASY STARTING\nThe CM1640 cordless mower easily starts with just a push of a button, and is a smart, no-mess, no-hassle alternative to gas powered lawn mowers. You'll save time by eliminating the frustration of pull cords, the hassle of mixing gas and oil, as well as trips to the gas station and engine maintenance.\n\nHandle folds down for convenient storage (view larger). CUTTING CONVENIENCE\nThe CM1640 features a cutting height range of 1 to 3 inches and a handy single lever height adjustment raises or lowers all four wheels simultaneously. When beginning to mow, the motor makes a smooth start and then easily tackles thick grass or uneven cutting terrain.\n\nThe 16-inch deck is ideal for smaller yards, and the durable and lightweight cutting deck never rusts, and is easy to clean. The soft fabric of the grass bag allows for easy checking by tapping the bag from the bottom to see if it is full. For convenient storage, the mower's handles fold down and over the mower so it fits nicely in small spaces in sheds or garages. Carrying handles on the mower make it easy to lift and carry.\n\n40-VOLT MAX CORDLESS POWER\nGet ready to experience the new Black & Decker 40-volt MAX lithium-ion batteries.1 They provide up to 33 percent increased battery pack capacity on single charge2 and are fully compatible with Black & Decker's 36-volt lithium-ion system, which include a string trimmer, hedge trimmer, sweeper vac, and a sweeper/blower vac. The battery is easily removed with the click of a button and conveniently recharges in the garage or shed via the included charger.\n\nThe 40V MAX* system offers you the power and performance you need to get the job done. \n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\nCM1640 16-inch cordless mower, two 40-volt batteries (LBXR2040), charger (LCS36), operating instructions\n\nABOUT BLACK & DECKER\nSince 1910, Black & Decker has been setting the standard for innovation and design of power tools, accessories, outdoor yard care equipment, home cleaning products, automotive and lighting products, hardware, and other home improvement products.
