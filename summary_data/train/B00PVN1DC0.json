I got it so i could try to remove a few links from my wifes new Fossel Smart Watch and it worked great. The link pins in her band were VERY difficult to remove without the specialty tool provided in this kit, with that tool it was painless. Worked so well i adjusted bands on both of my daughters watches as well.",

Now that I have this I can actually save myself a little bit of money here and there and change my own batteries whenever I need 2 and Beauty do so without hurting my watch at all. And it was so good that I've actually suggested to my brother who also has a couple Swiss timepieces to invest his money into this as well.",

It's cheap, it's crap, but it will do the trick for many purposes. Nevertheless, I regret this purchase.

      "text": "This is a great little set of watch repair tools for home use. I was able to easily separate the links of my watch band to gain unrestricted access to the watch back. Then, the included tools made it easy to securely hold the watch while I screwed off the back. Once the back was off, the included tweezers were perfect for resetting the \"perpetual\" date function in the watch once I had replaced the battery. Closing the watch back up was a snap and reassembling the band was easy too. Using this set of tools, I was able to save big bucks by not having to send my watch in for repair.",

This did help me get the back off the watches but getting the back on again took more hand strength than I have and nothing in this kit helped. Ended up taking them to a jeweler anyway...",

This will help me take care of them for a more reasonable cost. The kit was easy to use and made it fast to change out batteries. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t get one before.",

The handle is plastic and from the photo you can see that it's chipped, if I were to apply even a small amount of pressure this thing would snap right off. Don't buy if you are planning on using the watch case remover",
