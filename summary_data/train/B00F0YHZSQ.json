      "text": "This spinner is just what I was looking for and works perfectly. The axis of the spinner on almost all of the units at Amazon are offset from center and stick out beyond the steering wheel. This is much better with a centered axis. Fine quality metal and spins nicely. I think there are ball bearings supporting the handle, but not sure. The attachment hardware is extremely versatile. The only thing you would possibly have to change is to substitute longer attachment bolts if you had a very fat steering wheel, but these are easily obtained and may already be in your garage.",

The bolts are too short for the thick wheel. Bearings work well. The finish was rubbed off when I got it, new. The top cross plate won't stay on the top of the steering wheel so I put it at a 45* angle where the spoke meets the wheel. It works fine like that but it's not right. Good enough for this application, it's a lawn mower, but if it had to be nice I would have returned it.",
