Unfortunately, its negatives far outweigh the positives: your office productivity will take a major hit because of  sluggish output speeds and faulty paper handling. For a better rounded all-in-one printer, we recommend picking up the Lexmark x7675 Pro or investing an extra $90 in the HP Officejet J6480.",

Wireless is extremely buggy, requiring constant resets and reconfiguration. Had a last straw tonight when it, in quick succession, wasted eight sheets of paper during an important print job, ran out of ink, and jammed. It's going in the trash as soon as I can get another printer.",
