    "title": "Canon EOS-1D X 18.1MP Full Frame CMOS Digital SLR Camera (Discontinued by Manufacturer)",
    "description": "Style:BaseThe EOS 5D Mark IV camera builds on the powerful legacy of the 5D series, offering amazing refinements in image quality, performance and versatility. Canon\u2019s commitment to imaging excellence is the soul of the EOS 5D Mark IV. Wedding and portrait photographers, nature and landscape shooters, as well as creative videographers will appreciate the brilliance and power that the EOS 5D Mark IV delivers.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n The Ultimate EOS\n\nCanon has brought the best of the EOS-1D Series of digital cameras into one phenomenal model: the new flagship of the EOS line, the EOS-1D X*. Its full-frame 18.1 Megapixel CMOS sensor and all-new Dual DIGIC 5+ Image Processors deliver high quality image capture at up to 12 fps (14 fps in Super High Speed Mode) and a powerful ISO range of 100 - 51200 (up to 204800 in H2 mode) provides sharp, low-noise images even in the dimmest low-light conditions. An all-new, 61-Point High-Density Reticular AF and 100,000-pixel RGB Metering Sensor that uses a dedicated DIGIC 4 Image Processor, makes the EOS-1D X reach new levels of focus speed and accuracy delivering advanced tracking even for the most challenging shooting situations. Taken all together, the EOS-1D X\u2019s improved HD video capture, numerous connectivity options, combination of processing power and durable construction, including shutter durability tested to 400,000 cycles, make it the ultimate EOS.\n\nBrilliant Sensor, Supercharged Processors\n\n18.1 Megapixel full-frame SMOS sensor\n\nThe EOS-1D X features a newly developed Canon full-frame 18.1 Megapixel CMOS sensor that\u2019s designed from the ground up to create high resolution, perfectly detailed images with unprecedented speed and clarity. A full 24 x 36mm, the sensor captures 5184 x 3456 large individual 6.95 \u00b5m pixels and has a much-improved S/N ratio resulting in better images from the start. A new photodiode structure with an increased photoelectric conversion rate increases the sensor\u2019s sensitivity by approximately 2 stops over previous models, meaning higher ISOs with the lowest noise of any EOS digital camera. And a 2-line 16-channel simultaneous signal readout means speeds of up to 12 fps (RAW + JPEG) and even 14 fps (Super High Speed Mode) are possible!\n\n\nDual DIGIC 5+ Image Processors for enhanced noise reduction and blazing processing speed \nFor a whole new level of performance, the EOS-1D X uses Dual DIGIC 5+ Image Processors. Working with four 4-channel A/D converter front-end processing circuits, and delivering speeds of up to 12 fps (RAW + JPEG), and 14 fps (JPEG), and the Dual DIGIC 5+ Image Processors improve data processing performance up to 30% over previous processors and feature new algorithms that promote greater noise reduction at higher ISOs. In addition to conventional image processing functions the Dual DIGIC 5+ Image Processors offer real-time compensation for Chromatic Aberration in both still and motion images. With the power of these two processors, speed improvements are noticeable from the instant the camera is turned on and the stunning results speak for themselves\n\nCanon's Most Sophisticated AF, Period\n\nAll new 61-Point High Density Reticular AF \nThe newly designed 61-Point High Density Reticular AF features an Offset Array Sensor (with staggering AF point arrangement) to deliver greater accuracy, no matter the situation. It offers multi-zone wide-area AF for better tracking, has 5 central dual cross-type points (f/2.8 diagonal), 21 central cross-type points (f/5.6 horizontal & vertical) and 20 outer cross-type points (f/4.0 horizontal), and is sensitive in extremely low-light situations (EV-2 for a central point with a f/2.8 lens).\n\n\nIntelligent Exposure, Fast\n\nEOS iSA (Intelligent Subject Analysis System) Powered by Canon DIGIC 4 Image Processor\nThe EOS-1D X features a brand new 100,000-pixel RGB Metering Sensor with a dedicated DIGIC 4 Image Processor that delivers substantial improvements in evaluative ambient and flash metering. The sensor has 252 distinct zones, with 35 zones specifically designed for low-light metering. The meter\u2019s DIGIC 4 Image Processor uses a new EOS iSA (Intelligent Subject Analysis System) that incorporates face and color recognition data for more stable performance under rapidly changing lighting situations. \n\n\nSopisticated Full 1080 HD Recording at the Touch of a Button\n\nEOS HD Video Recording\nAddressing the requests of the pros, the EOS-1D X captures HD video with an unprecedented level of sophistication for a digital SLR. It offers both All-I and IPB compression, supports H.264/MPEG-4 AVC High Profile, and automatically splits files greater than 4GB (FAT specifications) for extended recording up to 29:59 minutes without interruption. It offers the option of timecoding only during recording (Rec Run) or at all times (Free Run)\u2014useful for multi-camera shoots. The EOS-1D X offers easy operation with the new Live View shooting/Movie shooting button. Improved sound recording adjustment capabilities offer 64-step volume control; and a sound recording level meter that is accessible through the Quick Control screen during video shooting. With the Silent Control function, adjustments can be made quietly with a touch pad located on the inner portion of the Quick Control Dial. The built-in wind filter helps suppress unwanted wind noise that can distort or muffle sound. \n\n\n\nAII-I\nCompresses each frame. Although the file size is larger than IPB, each frame is not affected by the previous and next frames, making it suitable for editing and extracting frames.\nIPB\nCompresses the movie frame by referencing the previous and next frames.
