You can spray your face with either water or this. The real product leaves your face tingling because it has ethanol and mint. Maybe you don\u2019t want your pores to shrink as a result of [basically rubbing] alcohol. In that case, use this. If you want the effect and feel of the product you actually purchased, you\u2019ll probably need to keep looking. and pay double the price for the real thing.",

While it's very refreshing as a midday spritz (or perhaps after a steamy shower to help close your pores), I didn't really find it amazing in any way. It smells essentially of peppermint. I didn't notice any extra hydration or smoothing. It's just a nice pick-me-up. Definitely an 'extra', not a skincare necessity (unless you just adore face mists, in which case I find Andalou Naturals Blossom + Leaf Toning Refresher to be a much better buy, and I get lots of compliments on its scent when used around others).",
