Each successive generation of the Canon SD line does more than the last, at a lower price. You can take a picture of the subject only 2\" away from the lens, great for insects, coins, etc - none of my other cameras - including one that cost a lot more - can focus this closely (excluding DSLRs).. Picture quality is good. Some issues with low light situations, but I have not had any pocket sized cameras that were better.",

This alone is the reason I pawned the camera off to another department so I could replace with a Canon 100HS. On top of that the battery life is pathetic, it's like they didn't even test this camera in the real world. I couldn't go half a day in the field without needing to charge the battery. Also, it is much bulkier than expected and is difficult to fit in a pocket. Bottom line, don't but this camera.",

The PowerShot Sd4500IS is a much better camera with image stabilization and the 10x optical zoom. My zoom pictures are not blurry anymore - and I can zoom way in compared to my old camera. These features are great for me since I like to take a lot of bird photos. The viewing screen on the back is much bigger, too. I did have to give up the viewfinder which really got very dusty and dirty. I am getting used to the larger size and I am glad that it still fits in my pocket.",

Of course it is understandable that all these wonderful photos and videos need a lot of power and because of this the battery life suffers. 150 photos for a full charge. If you mix it with HD videos, you get even less. Good thing spare batteries are cheap!",

    "title": "Canon PowerShot SD4500IS 10 MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD, Silver",
    "description": "Color:SilverFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nSignificant technology upgrades and a richly sophisticated design make the PowerShot SD4500 IS Digital ELPH camera so easy to say \"yes\" to. Your best shot is never too far away, thanks to a hugely powerful lens that boasts a 10x optical zoom. Your videos will have all the lifelike realism of Full HD (1920 x 1080)--and you'll share them instantly on your HDTV with a simple cable connection. You'll shoot what you want, when you want, and in every situation your images will be better than you ever imagined. \n\n\n\nCanon's HS System (10.0-megapixel back-illuminated CMOS sensor plus DIGIC 4 Image Processor) delivers gorgeous images in low light, while the advanced Smart AUTO intelligently manages an expanded, diverse array of shooting situations for stills and videos, so you can focus on composition and creativity. \n\nYou'll have easy, intuitive access to features that put your photography on the cutting edge, like Super Slow Motion Movie and High-Speed Burst. While this fresh, modern take on a style icon will certainly get your PowerShot SD4500 IS Digital ELPH camera noticed, you'll find just as much to notice in its ramped up power and performance. \n\nCanon PowerShot SD4500IS Highlights \n\n10x optical zoom in a slim, stylish camera body\nThe PowerShot SD4500 IS Digital ELPH camera is the first ELPH equipped with a 10x optical zoom--an amazing feat of engineering for a camera this slim and light. \n\nIf, like most people, you've been shooting with a standard-size zoom, you will be blown away when, with just a simple push of a button, you're taken right up to the shot you want. For natural candids of people, pets and wildlife there's no substitute, while stadium games, concerts and other big events come to life with a lens that puts you right in the middle of the action. \n\nBest of all? Even at the far end of the zoom your shots are clear and steady, thanks to Canon's highly effective Optical Image Stabilizer. \n\nCanon's HS System for improved low light performance and better image quality\nThe Canon HS System takes the frustration out of low light shooting. The system delivers clear, blur-free shots with all the ambiance intact, and frees you from the sometimes unwanted effects of using the flash. Beautiful low light shots are possible at both low and high ISO speeds, and the dynamic range is expanded to retain maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas. \n\nThe system is the result of two technologies brought together in a compact PowerShot. The first is the 10.0-megapixel CMOS sensor, which positions the light-receiving surface for optimal light reception. More light means clearer, blur-free images with plenty of detail and nuance, even in dark areas. Working together with the CMOS sensor to deliver the HS System is Canon's advanced DIGIC 4 Image Processor, which actively reduces noise and delivers high speed image processing. \n\nFull HD (1920 x 1080 pixels at 24 fps) video mode plus HDMI output for easy playback of videos and photos on your HDTV\nMost digital cameras record videos, but isn't it time you gave your memories the unparalleled quality of full high definition? \n\nThe PowerShot SD4500 IS Digital ELPH camera records videos in uncompromising Full HD (1920 x 1080 pixels at 24 fps) to give you the highest quality videos available--and all from a camera that fits in your pocket. Experience all the stunning realism of Full HD, with smooth action, amazingly natural color and texture you can almost feel. \n\nWatching your HD videos and sharing them with others is as easy as plugging your camera into your HDTV with a single cable. The camera's HDMI output ensures that your videos retain every pixel of resolution and quality. \n\nAdvanced Smart AUTO identifies 28 shooting scenes\nThe PowerShot SD4500 IS Digital ELPH camera takes the quality of your still images and videos to a whole new level--automatically. The camera's advanced Smart AUTO system detects a wealth of information about the scene you're shooting, then automatically selects the optimal settings for you. Now with an expanded range of 28 shooting scenarios, the camera handles virtually any situation you'll encounter beautifully--freeing you up to concentrate on composing your shot and capturing the moment you're looking for. From portraits to landscapes to action scenes, the SD4500 IS Digital ELPH camera has you covered whether you're shooting stills or videos. \n\nShoot slow motion video with the Super Slow Motion Movie function and playback at 30 fps\nGive your videos a whole new look with the Super Slow Motion Movie function. Whether you're going for a dreamy, creative slant when documenting family moments, or making a highlight film of your kids' greatest sports plays, you'll love the high quality capture of this all-new feature. The camera shoots your clips at high speed (approx. 240fps) and plays them back at 30fps for the inimitable super slow motion feeling you'll love. \n\nHigh-Speed Burst mode for capturing sports and action shots\nHigh-Speed Burst is exactly what you need when you're trying to capture the best possible shot within a moment of fast-moving action. In High-Speed Burst mode, the camera automatically shoots continuously at high speed (approx. 8.8fps)* while you simply hold down the shutter. The mode lets you shoot sporting events, kids in motion, wildlife and any situation with unpredictable movement, then simply choose the best shots captured. \n* Depending on the shooting conditions, camera settings and the zoom position, the shooting speed may slow down. As the number of images increases, the shooting interval may take longer. \n\nFeatures like Best Image Selection and Handheld Night Scene give you greater flexibility\nThe PowerShot SD4500 IS Digital ELPH camera has a number of cool new features to improve performance and image quality. \n\nBest Image Selection works in conjunction with the camera's continuous shooting function. The camera shoots 5 successive images, then analyzes movement and facial expressions to pick the best shot. By saving only the best shot, the feature preserves space on your memory card so you do not have to check through several similar images and erase. \n\nHandheld Night Scene helps you capture beautiful night shots without a tripod and without the blur and noise typical in nighttime shooting. The feature uses optical image stabilization combined with electronic image composition. Several shots are taken in succession and then combined into one shot, effectively reducing camera shake and producing beautifully clear, dramatic nighttime images. \n\nWhat's in the Box  * PowerShot SD4500 IS Digital ELPH Body \n * Lithium-ion Battery Pack NB-9L \n * Battery Charger CB-2LB \n * Wrist Strap WS-DC7 \n * AV Cable AVC-DC400ST \n * USB Interface Cable IFC-400PCU \n * Digital Camera Solution CD-ROM",
