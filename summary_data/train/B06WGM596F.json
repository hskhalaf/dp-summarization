    "description": "Help reduce the ever growing landfills by using this Durable, reusable Arctic Lava Stainless Steel Travel Mug at home, work or in the car. Carry it in your back pack while camping and enjoying the nature you are helping to protect. To remove the inner beige lid for cleaning, take the lid off the mug by unscrewing it. Open the lid, and push the tab on the beige lid, located by the hinge toward the spout. At the same time push down on the rim of the beige spout. It will drop out the bottom.
