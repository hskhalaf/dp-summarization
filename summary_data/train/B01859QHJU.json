In order to have a buttery smooth shave, you need to use the green letric shave (preshave). Before you use the shaver, make sure you put a warm cloth on your face to open your pours. Then, put the shaver under hot water for a few minutes to get the blades warm. Then, pour letric shave on your blades and your face with a cotton ball and shave. If you follow this process, you will have the best shave ever, with no ingrown hairs. Hope this helps.",

The Norelco is also very quiet and really easy to clean and it doesn't drop little bits of hair everywhere unlike the Braun. Since it cuts very close it is also pretty aggressive for sensitive skin but I'm adjusting well to it. I can't believe how much I paid for it.",

Returned it to Amazon and ordered a Braun and just received it and no coparison to the shave. Love those Brauns. Twice the price but worth it.",

There is also a standard blade on the back for trimming longer hair that pops out, even while the razor is on. Overall, great design. The best electric razor I have ever owned.
