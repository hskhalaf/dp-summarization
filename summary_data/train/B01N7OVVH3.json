There's a huge difference between a 6 month old and a one year old!! My chunkalicious baby (weighs 16 pounds) isn't quite 6 months but I wanted to get something she could wear for awhile...as you can see it fits perfectly which is great, but probably won't get as many months out of it as is hoped. Also glad I didn't get the 3-6 month size. Already had compliments on cuteness and will buy again in bigger sizes.",

      "text": "I bought this for my 1 year-old daughter. Usually, 24 month size clothes are slightly large on her, but fit comfortably. After reading some reviews on here, I decided to size up even from that, so I purchased a 2T. I'm glad I did because it fits perfectly! It is a super cute design and seems to be well made. The seams are strong, yet stretch well with all the running and playing she does. I really like that this has long sleeves as it will protect from the sun much better than her last one. The zipper on the back makes it really easy to get it off when its wet. So far, we love this!",

The arms are a little long but at least she\u2019ll continue to grow into it instead of out of it. Giving it 4 stars only due to the fit, otherwise it\u2019s a beautiful print for a swimsuit.

Super cute, didn\u2019t rub her thighs, great sun protection, and she looked soooooo cute! We\u2019ve gotten so many compliments! Aside from the quality and protection, my favorite part about this suit is the snaps at the bottom, made it so convenient to change her in a wet suit rather than taking it off! You definitely get your money\u2019s worth! I do recommend sizing up after reading the reviews and doing the same. She wears a 12-18 normally, but I decided to go with the 18-24, super happy I did!",

The picture doesn't do it justice, it's adorable! Update: These bathing suits wear out so fast! I think that they just aren\u2019t made for consistent use. My kids have swim lessons weekly in a pool plus swimming in between. They just faded and thinned out super quickly. They provided me with a hand wash routine which perhaps If I had followed it maybe they would last longer. But I wasn\u2019t looking for a delicate suit, so these just won\u2019t be for me in the future. Great customer service though.",

Yes it is pricy but worth it especially because it\u2019s long sleeve and has a zipper to adjust to head so that it continues to fit as she grows. Finally it has buttons on bottom so that she can easily go to restroom without me having to completely take it all off.",

Also, after washing just once the coloring fades so much that it looks like we\u2019ve had it for a couple years. I\u2019m overall disappointed about this bathing suit.",
