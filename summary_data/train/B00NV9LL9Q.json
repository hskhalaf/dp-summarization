Have printed screen shots and docs. Everything working great. An extra black ink was $14 right here on Amazon. Much quieter operation than our Epson all-in-one.",

      "text": "While I've always liked the Canon Pixma printers and have always given them 5* ratings, I am slightly disappointed with this one. The only reason being, is that as portable as this printer is, it's very difficult to use it when travelling using different WiFi networks. After 45 minutes with customer support, I learned you have to reinstall the driver every time you switch networks!!! It would be so much easier if it worked through Bluetooth. So, since I'm travelling 24/7/365 and using different WiFi networks every few days, the \"wireless\" capability is too bothersome to use! That being said, everything else is great and what I expected from a Canon printer.",

I didn't really follow steps, but just went with the gut feeling. IMPORTANT: This printer connects wirelessly. Like with ANY OTHER bluetooth/wireless device, to \"activate\" the pairing mode, you must press and HOLD blue-lighted button on the printer for 3-4 seconds. When blue lamp lights up with 2 rapid sequential lights, followed by a pause of no-lights, it means your printer is in \"pairing\" mode, it can be discovered on the network and it can be accessed by your Mac. That's the whole trick.",

Very disappointed, but hey, that's how businesses stay in business.",

I work in a lot of remote locations using public wi-fi. So, the wi-fi option is off the table and I need to run a cable to use the printer. It's not the end of the world, but it can be inconvenient when my computer is in front of me on a desk and the printer is in a back office or some such. The blue tooth was perfect for that.",
