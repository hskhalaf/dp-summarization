      "text": "I can't really review the product as I just recieved it. However, there is something that I found greatly deceptive. When I purchased the Honeywell HPA 300 foot extra large rooms I also purchased THREE hepa filters and FOUR pre filters. Except you use ONE pre filter when you change the filters and ALL THREE hepa filters in one change. The pre filters supposedly only last 2-3 months and the hepa filter lasts UP TO one year. Sorry Honeywell, you make the most money on replacement filters and rather than make ONE SINGLE Hepa filter, you make three separate ones to fool the consumer into buying the product and the replacement packs. To me, that spells a dishonest business transaction.",

I always knew my home accumulates a lot of dust which is the main reason I purchased the unit, but I'm amazed I didn't get asthma or emphysema years ago as it looked like a powder snowfall when I opened the cover to check filter. I keep the setting on General Clean which creates an ambient noise that is non-offensive, or even soothing. Only negative is that it's not attractive as a piece of furniture or accessory, but any lack of aesthetic is more than made up for in benefits from housekeeping to health.",

You want this particular model because it takes 3 HRF-R3 HEPA filters and a pre-filter that catches larger dust. I can't believe how much cheaper this is compared to other much more expensive HEPA filters that use proprietary filters. Don't do proprietary filters.

I'm a believer and now I want a big one for the frontroom/family room.",

I also have a cat that I am allergic to and this filter has helped with dander too. A good investment in healthier living. Need to get one for the family room too.",
