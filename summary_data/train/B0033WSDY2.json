Need to pay to ship back from MA to CA then also include a money order/check to cover return shipping/handling/insurance/packaging (ugh!) not the best 1-yr warranty. Before boxing, we plugged in again and guess what? it turned on. This is the 3rd time this has happened, frustrating. We are going to keep radio, next time it doesn't turn on we are going to give it a non-pleasant send off! Our new radio will not be this same kind again! which is sad because it's so cool looking.",

Even this one gets some static in certain positions but at least I can turn it until the static disappears. The tone is great. The reception is great.
