I currently have the giraffe, elephant, and the cute little fox. I think these towels will still be great even when my son is a toddler. You can't find these types of towels at another store for the same price. I would definitely recommend these to any other mom for their baby.",

I\u2019m very happy with it, thinking of getting another one. I recommend it if you\u2019re looking for a large towel like I was. Only thing, it did shrink noticeably After I washed and dried it before use.",
