The smaller wrenches don't even attempt to stay in their place. The smaller wrenches all arrived out of their place and bent to some degree. Case can be hard to open.",

Packaging was very durable, the cases on systems like this are usually broken as soon as you take them out for the first time. I have used a few sizes so far and they seem very durable, however, some of the sizing seems slightly inconsistant. Overall, because of the value I think I may order an additional set or two just to have as a back up, theyre very nice overall.",
