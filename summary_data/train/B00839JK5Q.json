Has a very nice look and feel, but assembly was a little tricky. Uses cam locks to assemble, and if you thread the dowels in like you think you normally should, the cams won't grab properly. So, plan ahead. Once together, nice and solid, but the shelf spacing is too small for a regular liquor bottle. Great for glasses though.",

Wasn't too challenging to put together but one side isn't completely flush (cam locks won't lock and the dowels are showing). The wine bottle section also wobbles a bit since the screws just stop screwing after a point. For the price I was expecting at least the color pictured and described but I'll just deal with it since it's already put together.",

Also, the shelves aren't very deep so you can't fit a ton of glasses.",
