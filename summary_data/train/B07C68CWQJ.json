PThey are also incredibly light in color, I\u2019ve never seen a football in the shade of tan before. If you were looking for Valentine\u2019s Day favors, etc., you\u2019d be better off going with oriental trading. I now have to order from them to get something that looks realistic and it has delayed my project timeline. Very disappointing!",
