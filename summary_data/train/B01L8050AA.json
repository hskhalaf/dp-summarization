Really enjoy making sushi with my kids (watch for the knife though...it's a professional sushi knife and it's very sharp!!). If you are trying to save a little money, like DIY stuff and love sushi, this is for you!",

The kit is dishwasher safe, however, water got trapped in one of the pieces and was tricky to clear out. We will probably wash it by hand in the future.
