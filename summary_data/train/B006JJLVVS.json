Make sure you have your posts and cross pieces in the correct place before you screw attach your pieces. Light enough that one man can lift the finished piece into position. I wanted to block the afternoon sun on my small patio and I think this will work very well. I am going to put jasmine on this trellis which grows quite thick. I love the trellis and the easy care vinyl fits in perfectly with out lifestyle.",

The packaging was a little rough and I had to re-order and return 2 of them because the top ornamental pieces broke in shipment. Amazon was exceptional (as always) with reshipping and their return policy! I am definitely happy with all 3 trellises. I have mine free standing so my husband poured a small amount of concrete at the base for added support. Definitely pleased with my purchase!",

A cordless driver is highly recommended, none of the screw holes are predrilled, but they are self taping screws, so not hard to install. I used some PVC pipe to make spacers to offset it off the wall and anchored it to the house. The more we look at this, the more we like it! Update: customer service emailed me on a Sunday night and is shipping the cap out! That's good service! Update: zero hassle, had the caps in 3 days! Wish all amazon sellers were this good!",

I put most of it together myself, but had to call a handyman to finish it because many of the formed holes were very tight to almost impossible to push the rails through. I used a dremel sanding cone to enlarge them and that helped. The big man with the mallet helped the most, though. A woman alone would have been able to build this trellis IF the holes had all been drilled better. That said I suggest two people, and a mallet.",

As your assembling one part, another part comes undone, so now you have to try and thread the rods back into place.

      "text": "The PVC parts are of high quality and machined well. It took me around 30 minutes to assemble, but would have been quicker with another set of hands. I do suggest that you follow the instructions and lay down sheets of cardboard or other material to protect the PVC from being scratched, and have at least a 4 x 8 foot work area. The only negative comment is the instructions saying to 'sleeve' a 2x4 into the vertical posts for a more secure ground installation. The width of a 2x4 is approximately 1/4 inch too wide to fit inside the posts, so you need to trim the section of the 2x4 to fit inside the vertical PVC posts.",
