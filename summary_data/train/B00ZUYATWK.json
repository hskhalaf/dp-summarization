The construction of the shoe provides enough cushioning and adequate support.

    "description": "The Hoka Constant 2 Running Shoes Another bold innovation from the Hoka design team that continues to reframe the way runners approach traditional notions of control and stability. The Constant is Hoka's widest fitting model yet, with a real focus on stable, comfortable ground contact when it's needed most. A smart combination of soft foams and highly springy foams shaped asymmetrically through the midsole to mirror the biomechanics of the foot and especially its moments of greatest need has resulted in one of the most incredibly comfortable and intuitive Hoka OneOne road models yet conceived. A breathable mesh upper allows for increased air flow in the shoe encouraging an environment that is cooler and more comfortable for the wearer. The seamless construction of the synthetic overlays deliver a more stable fit and shoe build while still allowing for freedom of movement and foot flex. The design of the Constant delivers a shoe that ensures a superior level of responsiveness despite the high level of cushioning gained through intelligent design. The midsole allows for the correct level of deformation to provide you with lightweight responsiveness and an enhanced feeling of stability. The mixed capabilities of the Hoka Constant Women's Running Shoes are designed to handle both the road and light trail, for when you feel the urge to go off the beaten path. The Hoka Constant Running Shoes utilises unique Oversize Technology to deliver the ultimate in performance, cushioning and comfort. OVERSIZE TECHNOLOGY Rolling Motion Meta-Rocker midsole geometry, specifically engineered with a low heel-toe differential and a sculpted outsole radius in the heel and toe, encourages a guided foot gait cycle. This supports a runner's natural form and encourages an efficient, continuous, positive rolling motion from heel strike to toe-off. Protection Engineered midsole volume is up to 2.5 times the volume of performance-specific material compared to standard running shoes. This provides",
