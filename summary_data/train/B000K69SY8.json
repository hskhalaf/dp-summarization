I can touch it, the grill surface . As a test run I put a poblano pepper on there. An hour, and it still isn't ready to be skinned.!!!!!!! And IDK if it's the mail place I have to get my mail from or what, but the package came open.. I am so disappointed. This is the 8 seving inside grill. When buying it you have to read through multiple reviews and instructions that are obviously from their higher end models. So mad right now",

It is large enough for 4 nice-sized steaks, but not so large as to be difficult to handle/store. The grills went right into the dishwasher, unrinsed, and came out clean as a whistle. When the weather is nice, we plug it in outside on the porch. Otherwise, I just use it on the kitchen counter. Just be a little bit patient, and you will get the hang of cooking times (as opposed to a regular outdoor grill).",
