No documentation available online to repair this is making it a nightmare. I have found multiple reviews and sources of users having this exact problem with no help being offered from Lenovo.

My only regret is not getting one with an i7 from lenovo instead of the i5, but at the time shipping was going to take like 2~3 months. If you're getting the base model, I recommend you get an SSD, with harddrive copy software (you might run into problems extracting OEM key for win10 or upgrading to 10 otherwise.) I haven't noticed any blatant color offsets that plagued the forums for this product when this came out. This can handle upcoming new game releases with ease on High.",

The backlighted keyboard is nice, and the screen, while a bit small for my liking, provides great resolution. The only real downsides are that it doesn't have a DVD-ROM drive, and that it comes with Windows 8 pre-installed. Other than that, I'd say its definitely worth the money.",
