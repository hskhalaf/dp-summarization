      "text": "I'm a classically trained musician. So when I decided to get a wind chime, I knew I should get one designed by Garry Kvistad. His creations include actual musical notes, perfectly tuned. For example, I bought one from Woodstock Chimes, with notes from Pachelbel's Canon (which I jokingly call Taco Bell's Cannon!). Kvistad's chime sounds like Philip Glass made a minimalist arrangement of this famous 18th century canon. And I mean that as a sincere compliment. A final \"note\"... Consider installing the chime where I did. I hung it under our patio umbrella. That way it's protected from the weather, but near us, so we can enjoy the Kvistad chime's incredible overtones.",

And when the chimes are left alone, they continue to 'ring' for another few seconds...good resonance. On the construction side, the supporting cords look to be reinforced for longer life. Most of my chimes have had the strings fail due to being outside in the weather. We are hoping for better string life with this quality piece. The chimes have isolators where the support string passes through (can't see that in the pictures) so there will be minimal wear at the most vulnerable spot. Nice....",

This chime isn't especially loud, but the sound dynamics of the tubes coupled with the bars is a BIG WIN.

Maybe I'm just an uncultured heathen, but it just sounds like a wind chime to me. As long as they're tuned so that none of the notes are sharp or flat from each other, I'd expect it to sound just fine.",

I\u2019m not a fan of the higher pitched chimes as they tend to give me more anxiety than peace. These chimes have a very soothing depth of sound that produces lower, fuller tones. I plan to buy a set for myself as well!",

Another cheaper wind chime I'd bought at the same time has one tube out of six still hanging. These chimes sound beautiful- they have a very pretty tone. I've had the chimes hanging on my front porch for 18 months, where they get a lot of wind, and no strings have fallen apart yet.",

The melody fills me with joy every day as I hear them outside my kitchen window with even a light breeze. Just don't hang them in a too protected area -- that's what I did initially and they didn't make a sound even during a furious wind storm! As someone else said, it like hearing music on a surround sound system. And such a deal, to boot! I would not hesitate to give as a gift. Amazon.com is the place to shop, for sure.",

    "title": "Woodstock Chimes PCC The Original Guaranteed Musically Tuned Chime Pachelbel Canon, Silver",
    "description": "Color:SilverGUARANTEED MUSICALLY TUNED PACHELBEL CANON CHIME \u2013 SILVER. This chime is tuned to the soft melody of Johann Pachelbel's celebrated Canon in D. With its graceful melody and stately tempo, it is a popular choice as a wedding processional, for within its measures we hear the sounds of hope, joy, love and promise. The clever design incorporates 4 small rods that harmonize beautifully with the 6 chime tubes. PRODUCT FEATURES. Measuring 32-inches in overall length (total hanging length is measured from top of gather ring to bottom of wind catcher), this chime features an ash wood top with a black finish that is weather-resistant, 6 high-polish silver aluminum tubes and 4 black aluminum rods that will not rust when exposed to the elements. EASY CUSTOMIZATION. The removable wind catcher can be taken to a trophy shop, printer or jeweler to be engraved or silk-screened. QUALITY THAT IS GUARANTEED. Woodstock stands behind every product they make with a one-year warranty and a lifetime tuning guarantee on their musically tuned chimes. WOODSTOCK THE ORIGINAL MUSICALLY TUNED CHIME. Tuned to beautiful melodies and scales from around the world and available in a wide range of styles, songs and sizes, you can choose the Woodstock Chime that speaks to your soul. HOW IT ALL BEGAN. More than 30-years ago, the first Woodstock Chime was created by Grammy award-winning musician Garry Krista from an aluminum lawn chair he found in a landfill. As a professional musician and instrument designer, he was fascinated by the Scales of Olympus, a 7th century pentatonic scale that can't be played on a modern piano. Garry had the idea to cut and tune the lawn chair chime tubes to the exact frequency of the ancient scale. The resulting Chimes of Olympus was the first Woodstock Chime and is still one of our bestselling wind chimes. Garry and his wife Diane founded Woodstock Percussion, Inc. in 1979 and it remains a family-owned business in New York's Hudson Valley.",
