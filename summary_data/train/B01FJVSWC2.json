But for occasianal smoking of brisket (need to cut it in half and use both grates), ribs, chicken, or pork but, you can\u2019t beat this for $40 from Prime Warehouse. Easy to get to temp, imparts great flavor, small enough to store conveniently when I\u2019m not using it. I did buy some heat proof moulding to seal the lid and fire hatch. Think that\u2019ll give me better temp control and smoke penetration. Would buy this again.",

I don't think it's possible to do brisket. Going to make some modifications based on what I've read on the internet.

The only thing about this product is that I wish I would have gotten the electric version so that I didn't have to sit and tend to the coals and wood all day long. It does as advertised though! works great!",

Maybe not a good choice I couldn't get this thing to get past 175 degrees no matter how much charcoal or wood I put in the thing. Will try again next weekend but this smoker doesn't seem like it's too great. Edit: after putting a grate and drilling some holes in the charcoal pan it heated up good and cook a nice juicy pork butt in about 8 hours. Still needed to babysit it and throw char coal in it but it at least got the job done!",

My dad is a true lover of all things smoked but is new to actually doing it himself. This is a nice basic one to get started on without being too expensive and it seems of good enough quality to last him until he's ready for an upgrade. He seems really happy with it.",
