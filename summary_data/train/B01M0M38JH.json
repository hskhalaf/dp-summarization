My old knife required a lot of pressure on the switch, and I had to really push hard to make the cut. I have some arthritis in my hands, and would have to rest my hand during slicing. This knife was a breeze to keep on, and it is small and maneuverable. It was also sharp enough to cut without a lot or pressure. I've used several electric knives over my lifetime, and this one is the best by far (at least in this price range).",

Next model up, CEK-41 is a piece of crap, and knife itself is too bulky. Blade is too weak to cut up meat, just chews it up. Every time I have had to contact Customer Service, been on hold for over 20 mins. Will not purchase anything from Cuisinart again.",

I personally like the stand for ready access but it would be easy to store away if you dislike clutter. I definitely speak from experience. When my wonderful 20+-year-old Presto electric knife finally died last year, I replaced it with a new and not so cheap Hamilton Beach. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!! It was USELESS on everything...breads and meats.",

Took the Amazon offer in early Dec., 2011 and since delivery, the Cuisinart has performed w/ excellent results after carving two turkeys, a tenderloin strip and a rack of roast beef. There's an on/off lock on the power trigger which is a solid safety feature. Blade release buttons are simple to use which makes cleaning easy. The storage case secures all components in a single area so when re-using, it doesn't become an exercise of re-locating each individual part. Motor provides enough torque to cut through bone joints and tendons. Am expecting that this kitchen tool will give many years of service.",
