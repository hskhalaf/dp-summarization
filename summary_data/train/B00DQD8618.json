The beads are a little cheap, but all strung together, they look fine. The tool is great, though I also used some needle nose pliers I have and don't think I would've been able to make this jewelry without them. I thought the directions were pretty good, better than I expected. I also watched a couple videos to help. The kit comes with a few extras which is nice in case you mess up!
