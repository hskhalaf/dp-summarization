      "verdict": "These kicks tick a lot of the boxes when it comes to good shoe characteristics. Jameson 2 Eco shoes are comfortable, stylish, eco-friendly, priced reasonably, and versatile. They perform well when used for different activities. They don\u2019t let water in easily but are breathable enough for the summer.The laces are prone to breaking, and the soles can be slippery for the first few uses. However, the traction becomes better the more the shoes are used. They also give a good board feel and provide awesome grip on bike pedals.",

        "The shoes\u2019 eco-friendliness earned praises from a lot of purchasers who were vegans/nature lovers",
        "The Etnies Jameson 2 Eco shoes are quality footwear according to several purchasers",
        "They commended the kicks for being reliable as everyday wear",
        "Some consumers reported that the low-tops are durable and have lasted them at least a year of use",
        "A small number of customers were delighted with the colorways available for these Etnies sneakers",
        "A handful of consumers stated that the value justifies the price of the Jameson 2 Eco",
        "A few persons noted that the low-top shoes breathe pretty well",
        "The casual sneakers don\u2019t let water in easily when it rains, users said",

      "text": "Great shoes. Used to replace some old Vans that had been kicking around for years. Soft but firm tongue, with the lace layout they can be comfortable tightened well. Strong grippy sole has stood up to liquid spills on polished concrete already...as expected from a skate shoe though. Slightly tighter fit than other manufacturers, but only very slightly: thinner socks must suffice. Practical enough to use for skating, or walking around town, but smart enough to wear on an evening out. Overall, five stars from me.",

I will update review in a month or so if they relax and feel more comfortable with wear. My first impression though is I should have ordered a 7.5",

Wouldn't be in a hurry to order again, even at a bigger size, and certainly not at the fifty plus price tag they RRP for.",

The insole and fit is very comfortable. I already have another pair of Etnies with the sti foot bed but they are not for skating so this was my first time using it on a board. The shoe provides a good mixture of board feel and protection. I like the feeling of the insole while on the board. I doubt they would be suitable for any massive drops but for a regular mix of skating they are great. The outsole has a nice grip that keeps you on your board.",

I usually have an issue with shoes as my foot is quite wide (5\") - no problem here. Moulded nicely into shape and were very comfy. Getting this new series feels very similar. Been wearing them for a few weeks and have nothing to complain about - yet! Will come back in a couple of month to re-assess and give an update.",

I bought a pair of these shoes at size UK 11 and the shoe feels like a 12, too much space for my toes and when I walk the back of the shoes slump and scrape against your ankles. If you're a size 11 in well fit running shoes then I'd advise getting size 10's as the shoe is comically larger than it states online.",
