The perfume scent that wafts from this product is so overwhelming, that it has literally caused me to sneeze non-stop since using it. It is nauseating to smell it, even if you're just opening it. I feel that it is so overly scented in an effort to mask the scent of urine; which by the way, it does not. You just end up with heavily urine scented perfume. I think I'm just better off going back to using baking soda, which seems to work better than this. What a waste!",

I DO NOT use it quite directed... I use a pellet litter, keeping it shallow (no more than two inches, and scoop several times a day...then sprinkle just a very light shake across the litter and that keeps any and all odors at bay....no need to overuse. Overuse might make it overpowering.. Definitely will buy again and encourage you to give it a try.",

The scent is not overpowering like some others I have used or smell like strong cleaning products. It's a nice light and clean scent and it blends into the litter nicely. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars -- the scent doesn't stay long enough, I do have to sprinkle it in almost every day in one of the cat boxes but that could be because that kitty pees like a million times a day. Overall a great product though and I will buy again.",
