I was sad to see that the old wind up timer has been replaced with a standard plastic hourglass timer! Not only does someone have to be watching it to know when time's up, but I miss the \"POP!\" of the old, windup timer (it always made everyone jump--and that was part of the fun!) But the lists are still solid--we'll probably just end up using our iPhones for an audible, more interesting timer.",

You role the dice to pick a letter and then have to pick 12 words from different categories that start with that letter in a reasonably small amount of time. Fun competition for the family if you have teens or young adult kids. All of our kids enjoyed this one with us. Definitely more challenging then we thought it would be after reading the very simple rules.",

The format is fine, I like that they give you a folder to put your card in and I don't even mind that the cards are small. What disappointed me is that there are only 4 folders and only 4 people (or 4 \"teams\") can play at a time. Teams are okay, but then, the small size of the cards is a little bit of a problem and it would really be better if there were at least 6 folders. You should get more for your money.",

But sadly, they have changed the configuration of the boards and no longer have clips to hold the card, pens, paper. It feels cheap and flimsy and makes the game a little more difficult when papers and cards are falling out constantly. I find we don't play as often as I thought we would because it's just annoying how it is set up now. Don't know why Hasbro changed it but it was NOT for the better. If you want this game, I might try looking elsewhere (Target perhaps?) for the original version.",

However, it is an easy fix to use your phone timer instead. Timer is the only reason it got dropped a star.",
