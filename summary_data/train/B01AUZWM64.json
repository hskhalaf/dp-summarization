Also, they are not wide enough to keep both joints of the toes separated evenly. This can cause you to develop hammer toe because the 2nd joint isn't held in place. Quality seems ok, and nice storage box.",

I have the problem in both feet where my second toe has turned over the first. And on my right foot the fourth toe has done that to the third. Then the nail cuts into the adjoining toe.They keep the toes spread in such a way that there is no friction from the neighbor. I tried the single toe spreaders I purchased in the pharmacy and they don't stay in place. These stay on when you put them on. Thanks for inventing these",

    "description": "The Seresto flea and tick collar for dogs provides continuous 8 month flea and tick protection. Unlike oral flea and tick prevention products that require a bite, the Seresto collar repels fleas and ticks and kills through contact; no biting required. Frontline flea and tick treatment does not repel (based on label claims). Seresto flea collar for dogs is water resistant and remains effective after shampooing, swimming or exposure to rain or sunlight. (Dogs must not be bathed more than once per month. For dogs that swim once a month or more, the control duration is reduced to five months for flea control, and reduced to seven months for tick control.) This vet recommended flea and tick collar for dogs is odorless, non greasy and easy to apply. It can be used alongside other identification or restraining collars without damaging them. Avoid the hassle of messy monthly treatments and get the effective protection of Seresto dog flea and tick collars. Also available: Seresto flea and tick prevention for cats.",
