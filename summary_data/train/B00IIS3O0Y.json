However, the sound quality is really excellent and probably has not been improved much in subsequent years. It is a very simply machine with almost no \"foo-foo\" and if you're looking for a single piece to fill a mid-sized room with a sound quality almost as good as a separate stereo setup, this is for you,",

I needed to bring it to an outdoor event, and I couldn't without first hooking it up to a generator. Other than that, this is a sound (ha ha) investment.",

Might sound good if you've never heard anything else, but really, a lousy, overpriced hunk of junk. There's a reason that the Bose display in most brick-and-mortar stores is separated from the rest of the other companies - Bose insists on that, so that people can't make an honest comparison with other products. They know that if people get to hear other systems, they'd never buy the Bose product. Bose represents the triumph of marketing over engineering and construction quality. Don't waste your money.

    "description": "Our best all-in-one music system is now even better. The Acoustic Wave music system ll offers more lifelike sound for larger spaces, with improved functionality and versatility, yet remains refreshingly simple to use. Acclaimed waveguide speaker technology still lies at the heart of this system's performance, so it rivals the sound of much larger, more complicated stereos. An all-new Bose digital platform fine tunes the sound for more accurate, consistent music reproduction\u2014even at louder volume levels. Vocals sound cleaner. Instruments ring truer. The result comes closer to music in a natural, live-performance setting. The Acoustic Wave music system ll plays your home-burned CDs as well as regular discs and AM/FM radio. You'll find a new headphone jack for private listening, auxiliary inputs and an updated informational display. A variety of accessories adds to your listening enjoyment at home or on the go. And you can add our optional 5-CD changer for even more continuous listening. The system hasn't changed in size or convenience. It still fits almost anywhere in your home, easily controlled from across the room by a credit card-sized remote. It accomodates your MP3 player, travels easily and goes portable with the optional power pack. The original Acoustic Wave music system changed opinions of what a quality stereo system could be. Now, the Acoustic Wave music system ll challenges our perceptions once again, with sound that comes even closer to the essence of live performance.",
