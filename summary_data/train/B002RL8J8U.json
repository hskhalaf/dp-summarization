Not sure what people are complaining about but this Gold filter is the perfect privacy solution. It actually looks red when viewed from a side angle. If you are looking directly into the screen, it will appear very slightly tinted grey and from a side angle appears like a very reflective gold redish tone. Very nice. It will not stop someone standing right behind you or only at a very slight angle but provides peace of mind for casual glances. Works better than expected.",

      "text": "Great screen protector! The multicolor sheen really shields viewers from seeing whats on the screen. My only qualm would be that I have to take the screen of daily, and now the adhesive no longer will stick to my computer, so it just lays against the scree. Not ideal because it falls off and doesn't completely cover the screen. Otherwise i recommend it!",

Works like a charm when you are not in front , barely can see whats going on.But too glossy for the person sitting in front to see the screen clearly and i dint see any matt effect on one side which is how usually all these screens are designed.. Drop gold , go for carbon ( or regular)",
