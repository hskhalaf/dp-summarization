I didn't tighten it much - just sort of tapped it and let it spin into place, but it is beyond stuck. I tried tapping it to loosen and even some WD40. Really disappointed. It looks like maybe a default in the threading on one of the handles... It happened mid-workout, too, so I was extra bummed. Hoping the seller might replace the handle, so I'll reach out to them shortly. Just be aware that this might happen.",

MAKE SURE you have those rubber, circular pieces on BOTH ends or else the weights will shift and you won't get a secure fit when using them. There is one where you put on the weights and another inside the circular screw. When you do a lot of removing of the weights, the one in the screw will come out a lot so be careful to check it every time it's removed. I plan on purchasing more plates but for now, these work great.",

Only issue is the screws that hold the plates in place come loose very easily so it's a bit scary doing curls and then randomly noticing one of the plates swirling about to fall down. Also the hard metal can KILL your fingers if you're not careful- when dealing with the loose plates watch that your fingers don't get pinched. Additionally, with these you NEED weight lifting gloves or you'll get blisters after the first lift.",

For example the grip section of the bar is metal instead of rubber like my current ones. The rubber will soon break apart and no longer protect your hands from the weights. The locking spindles also have a rubber ring to lock them better in place. The plating of the weights and bar look to be good quality to reduce rusting or chipping. You definitely don't want that stuff falling into your eyes while benching with them. Standard 1 inch bar will allow mix and match weights from other brands.",

      "text": "Others were writing about paint coming off of the free weights and about a strong odor. I did not experience a bad odor. There was a slight oily smell, but nothing like others were describing. I wiped the weights with a wet rag and some paint came off, but I have no paint transferring to my carpet. The quality of the dumbbells is very good. I especially like the rubber o-ring on the threaded sleeve that helps keep the weights from shifting - a problem I've had with other dumbbells of this type. I priced these out vs. Dick's Sporting Goods and, even with the shipping charges, they were cheaper than Dick's.",
