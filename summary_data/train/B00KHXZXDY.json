Lol, this phone requires a 2ah charger manufactured by samsung. Granted most 2ah chargers made by anyone else would work but the 800ma charger would bearly charge the phone to 90% overnight. Also the physical condition was not acceptable but that kind of rating is subjective. I would have returned it but it was pirchased for a friend who desparately needed a phone and is willing to accept it. As far as functionality it seems to be fully functional.",

When I first bought the phone, I was very happy with it, only issue was people said they couldn't hear me very clearly during calls, I didn't think it was big deal until recently the microphone failed all together, having tried countless software fixes I can only conclude that I bought a phone with a defective microphone. Future buyers please be wary of buying used products.",
