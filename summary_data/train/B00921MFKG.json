It says 6 to 12 hours so I set it up, tuck it in the fridge overnight and it's ready for me the next day. Super easy! I find this tastes better and is easier than any of the electric ice tea makers I've owned and with the cold brew method it's like when I used to make sun tea only more convenient. Instead of waiting through the day for the sun tea to brew I can have it brewing overnight while I sleep. I would highly recommend this to anyone!",

Bit annoying.... Also... The silicon handle Seems like it would be unnecessary if the handle had just been designed a bit thicker.

I\u2019ve made loose leaf teas for years, needed a pot to brew, then store the iced tea. Now I just use one container and it is great. I drink a quart a day, and take it to work with me. Someone mentioned about it hissing when brewing the tea. Do not close it tightly then, because the air will expand and need to escape. It is leak proof. The handle on mine just broke today, so I\u2019m ordering a new one.",

If you buy the sleeve you can flash chill your tea whoch is pretty cool. The colors are nice and do not fade (I have a green and blue one).",

It is perfect for rooibos loose leaf tea that I have struggled with before as other infusers had often left behind small tea leaves. Although it was fully leak proof at first, it did begin to slightly leak after frequent use and slightly warp the insulated plastic into more of an oval shape. With this being said, I will admit that it is not enough for me to stop using it, I would still highly recommend it!",

When this tea maker arrived I was so happy. I just put any loose leaf tea in the infuser and add boiling water then waiting for the appropriate time I add ice cubes to top. All the leaves stay inside the infuser and I take it outside and put it in the garden. Much easier than washing out my tea kettle and straining the tea. Love this product and the boiling water doesn't hurt it. Yay.",

This iced tea maker is awesome! You can flash chill with ice once you've brewed with boiling water or you can allow the tea to chill naturally in the fridge. I personally prefer the flash chill method, but if you don't have enough ice on hand, the other method works just fine. I also like that you can use loose tea! A really great value for a quality product!",

It is indeed airtight. And makes good tea. I have so many teas that I only wanted to make a quart at a time as to change up the flavors. If you like only regular tea I'd recommend the two quart for larger quantities at a time. I just found that flashing it didn't really do much and it didn't make it cold enough anyway. Its a great container though!",

Water/air tight lid makes this suitable for transport. Only way to make it better would be to make a glass version.",
