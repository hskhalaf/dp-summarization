I bought some hose clamps (33mm) and tightened them around the shafts with the idea that it would hold the pieces together and stable. One clamp didn't work, so I put two on each joint. Time will tell if this does the trick. Not worth the aggravation.",

I do like how it's strong enough to really get after stubborn 'piles' when needed... even good enough to 'swipe' a weed sticking up above the grass!

      "text": "The handle of the pan was difficult to extend and less than 4 months later I had to throw it out as the parts separated and it is impossible to get it back together. Too bad as the weld that held the handle to the pan was great. That has always been the cause of me throwing other units out. I was willing to pay more for what seemed like a better item, but sadly I was wrong.",
