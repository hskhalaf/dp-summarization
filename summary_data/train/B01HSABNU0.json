Easy to assemble, but the bottom left side of the monitor sagged and, no matter what I tried, it wasn't level. This was would have, over time, driven me insane. In the long run, I probably would have bought a better mount, but this accelerated it, so my total cost was the cost of the monitor plus $35.",

We haven\u2019t had any problems with it at all.. and it mounts nicely.",
