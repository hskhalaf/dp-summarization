I cooked close to 100 pancakes on it two days after it came. It comes pre-seasoned but I still shot a small amount of PAM. I had a friend with the 3 burner Camp Chef and grill/griddle cooking right next to me. He bought a hand held laser targeting infrared thermometer at Harbor Freight for less than $30 that can tell you when you are at 375 degrees which is perfect for pancakes.",

I read over the reviews of the Camp Chef griddle and made my purchase based on the many favorable reviews. I SHOULD have paid attention to the dimensions of this griddle. It is HUGE -and- VERY heavy....It -barely- fits in my Weber Genesis II grill with NO room to spare...and forget about using it on a small Coleman (etc) two burner stove. Otherwise, it appears to be a quality product and if you are looking for an industrial strength griddle, large enough to feed the entire deer camp - This is the one for you.",

Someone had fired a 50-caliber round into my kitchen at short range! Ok, no. It was just my new griddle. It had cracked right down the middle. Cast iron items must be \"tempered\" at the factory post-casting. This object probably was not. I can't recommend it, because the resulting crack lets cooking grease drip right over the burners.",

      "text": "We've had this for about a year, and use it almost daily. It covers the left 2 burners on our Wolf range, and we only have used the flat/griddle side. It's taken a lot of abuse, though we try to clean it carefully (when warm) and leave it oiled. It does still have hotter spots over the burners, but I suppose that's to be expected. If you use the proper amount of oil and don't scour off the \"seasoning\" it's pretty non-stick. Great for home-fried taters/onions/whatever, quesadillas, grilled sandwiches, etc.",
