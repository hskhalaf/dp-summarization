      "text": "These are amplified speakers and do require AC power. However, they produce exceptional bass response without the need for a third box (subwoofer) and more cabling connections. I really like the rigid stands, which I used to mount these speakers upside down and under a shelf above my desktop monitor. I routed the rear edge of the shelf to run the speaker wire, power cable and mini-plug cord to avoid having visible wires. If you don't want to have the speaker transformer always online, it's quite simple to disconnect the AC cord at the transformer to avoid having the speakers remain on standby.",

It's not that quick but sometimes you pause your music and forget to start it back up and then when you remember you have to turn them back on. Not a big deal but a minor annoyance. Love everything else about these speakers. I'd probably get the bluetooth version now but for what they are, they're good quality. Good highs, mids, and lows. Fills a room with sound better than I've experienced with other 2 speaker systems.",

You can decide for yourself if this feature would annoy you or not, if you don't think it would bother you, then these are great speakers for the price otherwise, I would definitely look for different speakers.",

High frequencies are crisp and clean, there is no shortcoming in the mid-range, and the bass is surprisingly rich...perfect for my application [PC speakers in a medium sized room]. I was nervous about the lack of bass/treble control, but Audyssey has these tuned PERFECTLY (In my experience most 2.0 speakers seem to be bass and treble dominant, but not these babies). They are replacing a set of Logitech 2.1 speakers I previously used and have surpassed those by leaps and bounds. I have only tried them with 1/8\" input, so I'm very excited to try them with SPDIF and realize their full potential!",

Also the power cable connection is very bad, the cable falls out constantly if you even breathe near it... happens ALL the time.
