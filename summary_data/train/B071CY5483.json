The full zipper is great, so that you can open as much as you want to get fresh or avoid nipple rubbing.",

After 2 rides--and following the washing instructions--the zipper is pretty much broken. Can I zip it all the way up? Yes, but no matter how carefully I do it, the jersey unzips from the bottom up. Pretty much ready for the bin.",

Other than that this is nicely designed shirt, material is ok, nothing special, polyester stretching material. Definitely more of a daily shirt then one to use for longer rides. I got 2 different design ones, and both have same quality and fit. Would recommend to anyone for daily use or something cheaper to try for beginners.",
