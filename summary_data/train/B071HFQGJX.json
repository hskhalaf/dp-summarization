The result is satisfied. This comb straigtened my hair just like after I used my ionic hair dryer with roller. It gives natural straight hair, unlike hair straigthener. If you look for a product which gives you real straight hair, this may not fit you. Sometimes I am lazy to comb and dry my hair after shower then go to bed right away. My hair frizz like hell next day morning, I need to wet my hair again for styling. Too much work. This product fits my laziness.",

I didn't feel like my hair was damaged or burnt during the process. It was left really shiny and with volume, compared to using a flat iron which leaves hair flat.

I don't even try to straighten my hair with a hair dryer after getting out of the shower any more. Now I just let it completely dry and then use this comb.

It is really nice tool for straightening hair and it is really same as describe, make sure to comb your hair well first so you got no tangle before using the hairbrush and make sure adjust the temperature accordingly to you preference.

I like the glove and the straightener works pretty well for very thick hair, but I would not give it the rave reviews it received on the internet. I will find a better brush straightener that is more functional and easier to use even if it means spending more money. It is not easy to clean either.",

I don't even need to use super high heat ( I use 340 degrees ) and the results are great, I will never use a straightener again. It only takes me about 40min. to straighten all my hair compared to two hours with a clamp straightener because I don't have to separate pieces.",

      "\u3010Hair Protection\u3011: The hair straightener brush releases rich negative ions which helps in eliminating frizz, knotting and split ends. This helps in improving the overall quality of the hair, resulting in a much smoother and healthier hair which is easy to manage anytime, anywhere.",
      "\u301030-40 Seconds Heat up\u3011: Most straight hair brush take a long time to heat up thus wasting the time of the user all the while increasing the electricity bill cost. GLAMFIELDS Hair straightening brush heats up within 30-40 seconds thus saving time and energy. This is possible because of its MCH technology which improves the overall user experience. Its wider structure and denser comb teeth help reduce the time for straightening considerably.",
      "\u3010Safety Controls\u3011: The GLAMFIELDS ceramic straightening brush is equipped with the auto shutdown and temperature lock features to ensure maximum security and optimum performance at all times. Temperature lock ensures that there is no abrupt rise in temperature that can harm the hair. The device auto shuts off if it is not used for continuously 30 minutes thereby preventing any energy wastage and prolonging the life of the machine as well.",
      "\u3010Easy To Use And Clean\u3011: The GLAMFIELDS hair straightening brush should not be washed with water under any circumstances and should only be cleaned with a brush stained with alcohol. As alcohol is highly volatile, it disappears quickly and does not cause damage to the instrument in any manner. However, one to keep in mind is that there is residual heat after using the device, so it is best to keep the GLAMFIELDS electric hair brush in the open for some time before storing it safely.",
