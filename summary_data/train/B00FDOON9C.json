The burner runs in a horseshoe ring around the grill and no matter how long you pre-heat the heat is always greater over the horseshoe. This means you have to move your food numerous times to have it cook evenly. We have cast iron griddles that we place on the grill that will compensate and spread the heat, but then you lose the char of a grill.

      "text": "I had recently purchased a big green egg and did not like it. Too much drama as i dont care about the \"experience\", I just wanted a small table top grill for my wife and I, I didnt want the usual home depot or lowes grill, made of thin sheet metal, and would last a couple of years. I bought the Q2200, cast aluminum, heats evenly, sturdy. If you have a screwdriver and know how to read its a snap to put together. I really like this grill, well worth the money. Typical good Amazon, ordered had it at my door in 2 days. BOOM!",

The only complaint I have, and someone else mentioned this as well, is the fact the gas valve doesn't have a positive stop in the off position. I too grabbed it out of my truck this weekend to find the gas valve in the on position. You'll also want to have a piece of tin foil on hand so that when you close the side tables they are not resting directly on whatever food remnants happen to be on the cooking grates. Other than that. great grill!",

    "description": "Color:GrayRestyled for 2014, the Weber Q 220 is now the Weber Q 2200. The grill has the same great performance and sleek styling, but adds new aesthetics that are both functional and fun, including larger grip handle and control knobs, ergonomic side handles, sturdy front and rear cradles, larger-sized fold-out side tables with greater rigidity plus the familiar Weber Q logo prominently branded in the lid. Split grates allow for a grate/griddle cooking combination: Just replace one of the grates with the Q 2000-series compatible griddle (sold separately) and experience an alternative way to prepare breakfast, lunch and dinner on your grill. The tall lid accommodates the grilling of small roasts and birds, while the large built-in thermometer allows you to monitor temperatures inside the grill. The Weber Q 2200 is ideal for use when camping and tailgating but, thanks to a design that offers both compact overall size and large grilling surface, can double as a stationary grill in your outdoor living space. The grill runs on disposable LP cylinders (not included), but an optional LP adapter hose for 20-lb. tanks is available as an accessory. A seamless stainless steel burner is your assurance of durability and long-lasting performance. The cast-aluminum lid and body are both lightweight and rugged. May be used with Weber Portable Cart model #6557 and Q Cart model #6525.Fuel type : Liquid Petroleum Gas (disposable cartridge sold separately)",
