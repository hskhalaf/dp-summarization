All of the little bits provided, helpsed me not only open my PlayStation, but my laptop, my computer and other small electronics. The variety of bits allowed me to get into lots of different shaped screws, which saved me the hassle of finding individual tools for them. The only thing missing from here that I had to purchase seperatly, was the T8 Security Screwdriver. Other than that, this thing was an awesome purchase and I will highly recommend it to anyone dealing with electronics.",

Anywho, this driver kit was everything (and more) I needed to work through all the screws in my machine, and the magnetic drivers are pretty good at keeping the screws from dropping in unwanted places.

Will these win an award for quality? No. Are these a good deal? Yes of course. Just know you\u2019re sacrificing a few things for that cheaper price.",

The magnet that attaches the bit to the screwdriver is nice and just about strong I didn't get to use the flexible bit extender So in the pictures you can see hwo the bits are nicely organized in plastic racks. Only improvement there would be if the racks were made of sturdier plastic for a more permanent means of storage. Pretty good deal, phillips are separated from japanese industry screws so that's helpful too",

Extension bar is handy for getting deep into boards obsured by chassis. Driver has swivel butt and soft rubber grips for easy turning. Cons: inner case liner is very thin, think cheap welded plastic retail packaging. Case latch opens easy but doesn\u2019t shut without having to fiddle with it. Extra bits don\u2019t have a home and are loose inside the top.",

      "text": "I read a few reviews for the bit on the macbook, cannot attest to that, but O have had 4 of these kits. I keep buying more because I lose the bits that I need, my bad. This kit is everything and more that I need it to be. I use it for work everyday on alarm system parts. I also have used it for working on my phone, laptop, small kids toys, my coffee maker. I will buy another I'm sure and I have recommended this product to anyone that sees it and asks. Thank you!",
