This means you won't be able to see 4K movies from Netflix or Amazon and won't be able to use Sony's 4K media player (or others to come). LG, to it's credit, is offering to upgrade these sets, but that involves a $500 hardware installation which is done in your home. LG is rolling this service out around the country, so it may take some time before you can get it. If I was buying now, I'd opt for the newer models and avoid the hassle.",

To their credit, LG sent out a service person. He replaced the motherboard (I only had the TV for a few weeks). He replaced the motherboard but the problem remains. Interestingly, we also bought an LG 42\" TV at the same time. It doesn't have this problem. All of the other wifi devices on the network (A/V receiver, Roku box, 2 Blu-Ray players, 2 wifi thermostats and my security system) never lose the network.",
