Now I understand that no flashdrive or external drive or internal drives comes with exactly what you see on the box and that it is an estimated storage. But almost an entire TB? That to me is ridiculous. It should at least be able to be rounded to the nearest number. Meaning if I buy an 8TB I should be able to expect 7.5 or 7.6 or so TB. 7.1 is ridiculous, just list this as a 7TB hardrive.",
