After opening the box, i was so impressed, but the brushes had a strong smell of chemicals so i decided to wash and three of the brushes just change texture. two of them had a dark bluish colour that couldn't stop washing out. Really disappointed. Please do not buy these brushes, Shany should upgrade their quality..",

I'm not a makeup artist or anything, I just wanted a nice complete set of clean brushes and that's exactly what I got. There is a plastic flap that holds the brushes in place and I suspect this is the cause of the smell I read about in some reviews. I left the set unrolled for a day and it went away. Overall this is a great value for the price of one brush at MAC or Makeup Forever. I noticed a difference in how my look came out after the first use!",

The only issue I found is the placement of brush f71 the xl fan brush. It is set in a fold of pouch, so it arrived with the bristles slightly bent. I have it lying out do hopefully itll straighten back out. But that's the only issue. The packaging is amazing as well, just and over al beautiful brush set!!",

Much better than my more expensive MAC brushes I purchased for triple this price.

      "text": "I was soo impressed with this brush set when I opened it; it comes with a blending brush which is personally what I was looking for and the brushes are so soft and they look professional. However, the 2 thick stippling brushes sheds ALOT and the dye from the black bristles is very thick and it always squeezes out every time I wash them. I soaked them overnight and the dye still wrings out of the brushes--and this is just from cleaning them. Plus I had to pull out a couple of shedded hairs from the buffed bronzer brush. I haven't had a problem with the other brushes yet, but those 2 stippling brushes are a bit of a problem.",

I use makeup brushes constantly but they've always left stray hairs on my face, broken, or are hard to clean. Shany's 24pc set is an absolute godsend, they are made well, don't shed, come with an adorable leatherette, easy to clean, provide detailed use instructions, and follow PETA's strict guidelines. I love love love them! Only com would be the slight smell when opening them for the first time but it goes away so quickly it really doesn't matter. I would certainly recommend!",

      "text": "This is the first real set of brushes I have purchased since owning a few odd ball brushes here and there. These brushes are pretty awesome for the price. I have watched a lot of YouTube videos on makeup and brushes and most of them recommend the expensive brands. Although they may be good I refuse to pay the price. These brushes are priced just right for what you get. The only thing I had a slight issue with is with the liquid foundation brush. The black pieces would sometimes fall off the brush and to my face. No big deal really, just picked it offm other than that these are a great set of brushes for the price.",

The set came with a very detailed instruction for each brush and I found it super helpful as I have never used that many different brushes for my make up before. Each brush is also printed with the name and that's really great for me to get familiarized with these brushes. The hair for all the brushes is super soft and seems to be with high quality. Overall I am super happy with the purchase and I am confident I can use this brush set for a long time.",

The price is also great so win win. Brushes in the past were rough and would hurt my eye lids when applying eye shadow, these do not. I have had these brushes for a week and still loving them.

There are better brushes on the market, however they are twice the price of this whole set for one brush. No shedding, soft (but firm enough to distribute product) and do the job. You will not find a set with anywhere near the quality and quantity of this set anywhere near the price point, you'd be looking into the hundreds. The leatherette set smells like nail polish remover when you get it, but it will air out in a couple hours. Absolutely recommend for my beauties on a budget.",
