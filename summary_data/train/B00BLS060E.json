They measure 34\" from the floor to the top of the cushion, which unfortunately makes them too high for their original intent. I liked them so much that I decided to find another use for them and have since purchased other stools to fit my table. I recommend these to anyone who can use a taller bar stool.",

      "text": "I may have already written a review, but I can't find it. I was going to correct it anyway. We bought two of these stools, because we have a very tall bar, and some wide people who want to be comfortable. Our original purchase had one stool that could not be correctly put together because of an engineering/mechanical fault. When I contacted the company, they worked with me, and continued to work with me until we had a replacement stool. We love the stools,and the customer service is A+.",
