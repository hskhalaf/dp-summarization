I had to spread in hands to apply by myself like old school cream form, I think it lost the point to buy spread. Also, it makes me look very oily after applying. Original idea I thought it\u2019s more expensive and I can simply put in purse and spread while I\u2019m outside and can\u2019t wash hands. Clearly it doesn\u2019t work. I end up still bought a balm to replace this spread.",
