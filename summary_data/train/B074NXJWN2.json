This TENS unit saved my life, actually it saved my back and legs and gave me much peace of mind as we waked several miles for 3 days during this show. I placed the larger pads on each side of my spine and let it do its job. It truly helped the pain in my lower back and down each leg that I experience when I've been on my feet for long periods of time.",

Product works but for this price is pathetic and shouldn't be in this range if the instructions don't even work. The instructions don't even tell you how to operate different modes. It just shows you what the thing comes with! Also I can't believe that the charger just comes with a cord and no wall brick. Including a wall brick doesn't even cost much considering how cheaply made the product already is.",

Battery is great (still haven't had to charge it yet out of the box). Very easy to apply pads & can use device while walking around, lying down or sitting. Great price, quality and size of unit.
