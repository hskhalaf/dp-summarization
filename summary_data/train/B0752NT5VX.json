Family Accessories cover is the best I've ever seen or used. This cover has endured a moderately close hurricane and the attendant thunderstorms like a soldier. Heavy canvas like material. Emblem on front so I know which way to put it on without fumbling. Sewn in air vents. Generous sizing so no tugging or struggling to make it fit. This is the best cover ever! Don't waste your money on the others.",

(I may store my old exercise ball under the cover to prevent the water buildup:) Perhaps putting elastic all the way around the bottom seam, instead of just on the front and rear, could tighten it up a bit.

I'll be shocked if this one doesn't last at least 5 years and, no, it wasn't anywhere near 5X more expensive.

The lawn mower is stored in a three sided open garden shed and although it isn't out in the weather the cover should help keep it clean.
