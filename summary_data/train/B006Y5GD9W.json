It's 36 pounds including kickstand and reflectors (which are pre-assembled on bike). Assembly was easy: Simply install the handlebars, front wheel, seat and pedals (which are clearly labeled left/right and show thread-direction) and inflate the tires. Everything else is pre-assembled and pre-adjusted (even the brakes and shifters, but I needed to tweak the brakes slightly). Has good instructions, but you will need tools.",

Mongoose is a reliable and solid brand. In terms of add-ons and changes, perhaps change the seat as per one's preference. Also, I would recommend getting mudguards and LED reflectors for front and rear. That's about it!",

I can do it just fine but she lacks sufficient grip strength to do it most of the time. The derailleurs could be better. Overall, however, it is a good value.",

Customer service was very helpful and replaced the chain with no issue. The bike is a bit much though, and the design is such that the frame is low enough that the seat has a long extension. Love the kick stand on this bike. The gears work, but with all the shocks, cables, and mechanisms to make this work is way to complex for a bike that a kid will use. I suspect long term, this can be a harder to maintain and more susceptible to trouble.",

If you are not able to tune your own bike it or don't want to deal with it, it may be better to purchase from a bike shop where they will often do free tune ups for as long as you own your bike. A similar bike to this is about $300 at a bike shop (though the bike may be slightly better quality). I purchased this bike for my daughter because I didn't want to spend extra money on a bike she would outgrow in a few years. We were able to do the adjustments ourselves and so far the bike is great.",
