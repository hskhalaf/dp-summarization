The retainer that holds the battery board broke and had to be repaired in the other. They are both still working but I wouldn't order the same one again considering we only got a year of use out of each.",

Saves me so much time when I have to head from my office to scan a bunch of barcodes. Actually works amazing for inventory, since I can head out - scan everything - come back, and upload it all at one time. Thank you Inateck, for making a good product. I appreciate it.

Also, these download the buffered values (from offline mode) WAYYYY faster than the Wasp scanners do. Overall, I'm so very impressed by these things.",

Seems to work great, and I rarely need to charge it!",

This unit was well built. I had to return this item because it does not support STX/ETX. There is no fix at the moment so just a heads up to anyone who might be looking for a similar solution. The company cares about their products, they will take good care to ensure you are satisfied with your purchase.",
