It all folds (stuffs) into a bag slightly larger than you're allowed to put in an overhead compartment on a plane.",

When your done with the screen let ALL the air come out of the screen before trying to pack it. If you don't it will be impossible to pack away. Overall it's a great screen for movie nights and a new fun thing to do with my kids",

I ended pulling one of from the bottom to reattach to the top. Then the top of the frame kept buckling down. We adjusted the straps in case they were too tight, pulled the stakes and tried to level the entire setup several times, but we still had a \u201cdented screen.\u201d Likely sending it back because it kills the entire movie experience.",

Then you can zip it back up and roll the fans to the mid. Makes take down pretty easy. About 10 mins to inflate and anchor, 15 to take down and put up. I hope this helps.",

      "text": "Huge screen to watch movies on. Screen reflects projector well. I use a view sonic PJD 5134 with it and am extremely happy with the combo. Running a LG NB3530A sound bar that is not very impressive. I really believe i have TV's with louder speakers than this sound bar(not recommended). But is a awesome set up the kids in the whole neighborhood enjoy it. Do watch out if u live in a windy area this thing is a huge sail. Tie down stakes that come with it are not that good but replacement stakes can be found just about anywhere that sells tents for a couple bucks.",

Can be setup by yourself, however, a friend makes it much easier. Fan is not noisy at all. Purchase a storage box twice the size you think you are going to need. Trying to get it back into the provided storage / transport bag is near impossible, and you will end up damaging the screen.",

Over all I wish I had purchased something free standing and sturdier, however we will make due. On the bright side the grandchildren loved it.",
