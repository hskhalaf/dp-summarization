I looked for a long time before deciding on these, and can honestly say they're great! I have tried all four, but my favorite is probably the veggie seasoning. Just cut up some veggies - I've cooked yellow squash, eggplant, sweet potatoes, and rutabaga - and sprinkle on as much or little as you like. I like a lot! Roast at 400 degrees for 40 minutes and you can't miss! Instant roasted veggies for eating or incorporating into your favorite recipes. Enjoy!",

Nothing major that caused a major Lupus flare or took my MG out of remission or anything- just a part of my trial and error lifes journey! My favorite is the beef seasoning.",
