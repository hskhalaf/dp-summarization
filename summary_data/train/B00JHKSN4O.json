Long lasting batteries come charged a little over half out the box ready to use. I use them for flashlights and Roku because they are my high drain devicec. I added a photo to my batteries with the box I use to store them. Great way to keep track of old and new batteries. Also the upside down means that they are not charged and right side up means that they are fully charged. Worth the buy",

Everything looked fine at first glace, but once i took the batteries out of the packaging and began putting them into my battery storage containers i realized i was missing 4 batteries! Did i misplace them? no? then i looked at the package.... in the top right corner is says AA 16, however, there were only 12 included. Deceptive packaging!! Now i'm really suspicious... so i get my Nitecore charger out to see if they are what they say they are. Nope. These batteries are suppose to be pre-charged with a minimum 1900 mAh but they aren't.

They promoted them appropriately as long shelf life and long life in general, and proved it by always being 1.31volts when purchased. However I bought these recently and also in 2017 in this same package size, from Amazon. and both of these sets were at 1.25volts when opened, AND do not charge past that, or settle quickly to 1.25 volts just sitting unused for a day or so. So, my conclusion is that these are OLD stock, very old. Others complaining of low power or short life also points in that direction: they are very OLD stock. I DO NOT recommend these.",

      "text": "I've bought many Enloop, EBL and Amazon Basics batteries (AA & AAA) in the past several years. All of them are working fine so far except for a couple that I killed by mistake (used an old charger that overcharged). You may see some differences in the numbers if you use one of those gauges, but I don't see any practical difference between the brands (I don't mix them up). At least not enough to justify the price gaps. I'm still a bit inclined to Enloop, but wouldn't mind buying EBL or AmazonBasics if I find a good deal.",

As your battery-powered devices run out of juice you will replace the batteries with these and eventually you will have an entirely rechargeable-battery-filled house. From there on out the process is simple: When a device runs out of batteries, take them out, put them on the charger immediately, and put some already-charged Eneloops from your stockpile in the device. When the old batteries are done charging, store them in your stockpile and you're good to go. These batteries last longer than any other rechargeables I've used. They are like gold in my house.",

      "text": "By far the best rechargeable cells I have bought. They have held their charges over months of non-use and seem to run longer than the alkaline primaries I have used in the past. No worries about alkaline discharging, leaking and ruining flashlights stowed in convenient places and no problems running out of cells either. I am using these in a mouse, flashlights, cameras, remotes, clocks and solar-charged garden lights outside. The first ones I bought in 2011 work like new after numerous charge/discharge cycles. This order was not meant as replacements, I just buy some more every year and have finally used up all the primaries and am running everything completely on Eneloops.",

Of course they have a finite life, and I expect that they will eventually reach EOL. Actual capacity varies, and I've measured some at 2100 mAh a few at 1800 mAh. Generally there around 1900-ish. Nothing to worry about since they are rechargeable, and I'm not running them in any critical application. For a general rechargeable battery, they seem to be reliable and excellent quality.",

Not enough to actually cause your device to fail, but just enough to slow response on your device. We notice this mostly on remote controls. Other rechargeable batteries will work, but the response and speed of the remote suffers as the battery loses charge. The Envelop batteries JUST WORK! Well worth the extra money you have to spend. I used to shop around for rechargeable batteries, but no longer - I only purchase Envelop.",

They work well in most kids toys, but due to the decreased voltage output, may not work well in some devices. Anything with a direct drive motor will have a decreased output. Also, things like remote controls will have a reduced output. Other than this one issue, they charge well and will save you money over the long run. Just make sure to buy enough to be able to swap out batteries during charging.",

This is the first type of rechargeable battery that has (mostly) made it possible to stop using alkaline AA and AAA batteries for good.",
