Keep them up even on a windy day as the sail doesn't block the wind much. This helped a lot to keep the temperature lower.",

Given the 3-year warranty and \"satisfaction guarantee\", I have reached out to the company to see if they will honor the warranty. UPDATE: Took a few weeks of back-and-forth with the seller, but the replacement shade sail arrived today. It takes a while to hear back from them, so be patient, but they do back up their warranty.",

I was able to get everything cleaned up and then it happened again and then again. The second issue is the D-rings. They are not stainless steel and have rusted significantly. I would have liked a stainless steel option even if it is a couple dollars more.",

      "text": "The quality is good--but just be aware of the size you're buying. We bought a 16 by 20 foot, but probably should have bought 14 by 18 size. When you hang it, it will sag a LOT. So, a smaller size would have been better. We hang it from the four corners, but use rope from corner to corner to keep it from sagging so much that it doesn't hit our heads when we walk under it.",

On the one we receive, one of the corners was longer than the others. The construction of the corners, grommet and edges is very good. If one overlooks the irregular shape, price-wise, this product is better that buying bulk sheeting at a DIY store and creating your own sail.",
