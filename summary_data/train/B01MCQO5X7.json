Apparently my sweating was too much for the volume/power in line housing on the wire which appears not to be water resistant. How can these be labeled as SPORT headphones? How about a true sport headphone without the inline control knob on the wire which collects sweat?

    "description": "Color:BlackThe secure fit of the disport Victory gives you 90% noise isolation. A higher level of noise isolation means you won\u2019t be distracted by noises around you, allowing you to focus all your attention on your personal goals. Everyone sweats while working out, and the salts and minerals in sweat can damage sensitive electronics like headphones. The Victory is fully sweat proof and has an IPX 5 rating. The earbuds and sport clips can be rinsed or wiped after use and are resistant to microbial build up. We understand that sometimes you won\u2019t use your sports headphones to train, so we\u2019ve included two sound profiles with the Victory \u2013 Normal and Turbo. Bass-driven music is known to be a motivator for lots of different exercise and training regimes, as well as a big component of faster music at the 130/140 bpm level that\u2019s known to be a perfect accompaniment to running or faster types of exercise. So Turbo mode kicks up the bass and retunes the midst and highs to give your music, and your motivation, more attack.
