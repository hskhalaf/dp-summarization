Extender worked longer than the store return period but not as long as the manufacturer warranty. Only gave it a one-star rating because I could not give it zero stars. Instead of an extender - If you need extended network access, I would highly recommend looking at YouTube videos to set up an old/used wireless router as a wireless access point (WAP). You get full router speed at an extended distance. Can be set up within 30 minutes. Much easier than I expected.",

      "text": "This a great wifi extender. I specifically bought it because my router does not cover well into the back of my apartment and my TIVO connection is always in and out making it impossible to watch anything sometimes. So I bought this extender to help my wifi reach and cover my back rooms. This did the job 100% and I'm very pleased with my purchase. The setup didn't take long, I just plugged it next to my router in the living room, turned it on and from my computer did the setup and then plugged in the extender in my back room and voila! I have connection!! no more interruptions! YAY!!",

Again this is an old antiquated way to connect your house with routers. For $400 there has to be a better way set up a network.",
