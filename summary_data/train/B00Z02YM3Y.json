Very soft on both sides, polyester for easy washing and lightweight enough that it will dry quickly. The design is very cute on the grey background., and I'll probably be buying another so all the boys can enjoy their own blankie.",

She uses it a lot, every day for most of the day. Easy to clean and is very soft. I only gave 4 stars because when we bought a 2nd one, it arrived with a rip at seem with edging so we returned the 2nd one right away. Based on the first one only, this is a 5 star product.",

Very soft and comfortable and attractive design as well. I love the edging around the blanket. The small one was good also, but small. I would not recommend it except for a toy dog or a cat. Otherwise, it was a very good choice for a pet Christmas gift! Very pleased with this purchase.",

We got this for the dog to get on our leather sofa and it does the job......but if the dog moves, so does the blanket very easily and is prone to sliding all around and off the couch. The dog loves the soft blanket and well use it for a pallet on the floor or for cushioning his crate. The blanket is absolutely perfect for that, just slick on the leather couch. Would definitely recommend and buy again.",

The Grey color is not a true grey, but more of a grey/tan, which I love, but you should know that when purchasing. I've washed them regularly, they wash beautifully and hold up great!

The one thing I don't like is that the washing instructions say not to put it in the dryer -- must hang dry. Really? I don't know why, but just in case drying it in the clothes dryer shortens the life of the blanket, I will be hanging it to dry like the instructions say.",

I purchased the blue and like the blanket very much. When we do start having cold weather which isn't often, he will be able to cuddle up to his blanket more. Hopefully it will last him a long time.

Overall it holds up pretty nicely though and washes well.",
