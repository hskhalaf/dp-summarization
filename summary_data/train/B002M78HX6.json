The footprint is a little large, but it has weight and feels like quality construction. I was a little intimidated when I started the set-up, but the instructions walk you through it step-by-step and I had no problems. I mostly dreaded trying to set up the wireless networking; they offer you more than one set-up option, but I followed the directions for copying the network settings from Windows Vista onto a USB drive and it worked like a charm! The printing is fast and quiet and I love the automatic duplex printing.",

This has a great scanner, great print quality, and prints faster, with a LITTLE less initial grinding and thinking than my last Canon printer, but, wow, it GUZZLES ink. We are LIGHT users, and it's drained all but one ink tank in 2 months! Despite Canon warnings, I'm planning on using compatible ink cartridges after the warranty period is over. I just can't afford $50 in ink every 2 months. Canon, take heed: this will be my last Canon printer unless you fix this problem!",

Photos print beautifully on it. My only disappointment was that I didn't read close enough and the Bluetooth printing feature requires an \"optional Canon Bluetooth Unit BU-30.\" It would be nice to print photos directly from my phone.",

I believe that has now been completed and the setup would just be installing the one file instead of the various that we had to do.

I found some non-OEM ink cheap luckily because the canon cartridges are about $12 a piece and I really don't understand why this printer needs ~$50 worth of ink a year when I print maybe a dozen pages during that time. If replacing ink doesn't bother you, then this is the printer of your dreams. Otherwise, you might want to keep shopping.",

However after the first use the speed issue went away - it now prints very quickly and the wireless factor is really cool. Set-up was as easy as setting up printers gets. It prints well & cleanly, though it seems to be drinking ink pretty quickly. It scans quickly and I bought it for the film/slide scanning capability which is great and not common. Overall a great buy at the price and I'm very pleased with it.",

Ink lasts about half as long as my old iP3000. It also uses chipped ink cartridges. Yay for anti-competitive business practices. The drivers/software look like they were built for Windows 3.1 The WiFi is flaky at best. You can only use the scanner with a USB connection. And last but not least - the heads on mine are 99% clogged, even though it got used daily and goes through that 10min cleaning cycle at startup. So basically I have a $300 printer that can produce barley legible (monochrome) text.",
