      "verdict": "If what hikers need in a sandal is high amounts of comfort, then they will not be let down by the remarkably stylish Yucatan from Ecco Sport. They will also be delighted to know that this superbly lightweight yet durable hiking gear has tons of arch support\u2014a quality many people so raved about in their reviews. All that said, the footgear misses the mark in a few areas, the most saddening of which would have to be its non-adjustable front strap. Overall, in spite of its shortcomings, the Ecco Yucatan sandal still packs robust enough features to help users perform well on the trail. Those who are a little bit on the scrawny side around the forefoot, however, might want to give this one a pass.",

        "Gear experts were super impressed with the hiker\u2019s outsole",
        "They were able to remain surefooted with enough grip on various kinds of surfaces",
        "Some of those who bought this hiking footgear felt like they purchased something a bit expensive but worth every penny",

        "They noticed that its build quality is no longer as excellent as the previous editions\u2019",
        "This hiking product from Ecco irked a couple of buyers for requiring too much time to dry"
