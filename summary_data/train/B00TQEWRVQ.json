This 7.5 Ah lasts pretty close to twice the continual run of the 4 Ah that came with both the weed eater and blower I purchased = Those last continually for right at 15 minutes. Of course this one takes much longer to charge. I fully charges it when received = ran it 29 min = it stopped = took 2 hr 40 min to fully recharge. THE 4 Ah weighs 3 lb 3 oz - THIS 7.5 weights exactly one lb more = weighting 4 lb 3 oz. That may be a noticeable difference in weight for some",

If it is lasting for less it is because of your use or you are on the Hi setting on the trimmer. I love how easy it is to see the level of charge by using the indicator on the rear. If you are a power user I recommend at least 3 batteries per tool so that you have plenty of batteries to last for your entire project as it takes about 1.5 hours to fully charge.",
