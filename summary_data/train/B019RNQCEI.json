      "title": "What a rack!",
      "text": "We bought this rack to hold our two new Pedego electric bikes and couldn't be happier. Each bike weighs about fifty pounds with the battery removed and this rack handles the weight without issue. Both bikes are wider than average road bikes but the rack fits them just fine. The rack appears to be constructed with very heavy-duty components and went together easily (especially after reading the directions...). As others have mentioned, the locking system to hold the rack to the hitch is fairly weak so I'll be drilling out the threads and using a hardened steel locking pin instead. Other than that minor hiccup, I high recommended this for any bike but especially heavier and/or electric bikes.",

I called the company and apparently, rust is not covered, nor did they have any advice other than to unmounted it when not in use. When I objected over the weight of it, they had no reply other than to say it's the elements. Do better please. My car does not rust in 6 months and neither should this! I am disappointed.",

My bikes are much more secure in this than any other bike rack that I have had.\" Easy to order, ships great and easy to put together and install.",

I highly recommend this bike rack. Assembly took about ten minutes and all tools were furnished with the kit except a flat screw driver, perfect. No more playing Tetris to jamb the bikes in the back of the rig with all the camping gear.",

I did have a couple of issues with the parts that came with rack as the box appeared to have been previously open and I was missing a tire strap one one of the bike platforms and the other platform strap was damaged. I called Thule up and they sent replacement parts out that day. Otherwise, no other issues with this rack. been using it for over a month now and love how secure the bike are on the rack.",

If you have a third party tow hitch (not Uhaul). I found that the way it sits is at a slight angle up. Meaning you can't put this rack on and throw it up. You have to turn the tire holder around backwards for it to sit correctly. Then turn it back around to what its suppose to be when mounting a bike. Other than that great bike rack!",
