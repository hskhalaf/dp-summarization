However, after less than an hour, the stitching that holds the strap to the frame came undone and the glasses fell off. Very disappointing.",

Nothing but compliments on the awesome style and look of these goggles. They seem pretty durable, hopefully they last many seasons for a fraction of the price of big name goggles.",

The only issue I've had is that the strap seems to loosen after a bit, but if you store these inside your helmet (rather than around) this shouldn't be an issue. A word of advice -- buy two sets of lenses, one dark and one light. I bought only the black lenses because I wanted to spend as little as possible, but the black tint makes overcast days interesting to say the least.",

Mine were perfect fit and totally functional with no hiccups! I highly recommend!!!!",
