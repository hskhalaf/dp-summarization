The power button is on the lower right hand side of the display - right where you grab the display to tilt the display. Oh yes, titling the display takes nerves of steel because the amount of pressure you have to exert feels like you're going to break something. The speakers are functional; however, don't expect Bose quality from them.",

I had to revert to VGA with an HDMI adapter (which of course I had to supply). Once I got the monitor to come on I discovered that the touchscreen function wouldn't work. I attempted to contact Acer customer support, but gave up when the only customer support numbers I could find were long distance to India. I sent this monitor back and will buy one from another company.",
