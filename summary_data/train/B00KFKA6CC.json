Loads of storage space- apprei the design feature of the HTC. I did use the remote feature initially and it was simple to set up, now I just find it's as easy to get the real remote. It was novel not necessary. The photo features are enjoyable with the easy of split screen and photo booth functions.",

Cannot take even a half decent photo in low light conditions, without the photo getting flooded with purple. The only fix is to take it to HTC so that they can replace a malfunctioning heat sink in the camera unit itself - there's no software fix. Of course this being an unlocked device, it doesn't have warranty, so good luck.",
