      "text": "Would get five stars for comfort. These are some of the most popular hiking trail \"slippers\" with AT and Pacific Crest Trail Through-hikers. Because they are absolutely comfortable. I did 100 miles without even a break in before on a 7 day backpack around Mt Rainier in WA. Rugged terrain. No chafing no blisters, and ran into others with this shoe. The only reason it's not 5 stars is you should know they wear and tear easily, which means you'll be buying them more often than a less comfortable shoe. It's worth it to me. I love to hike, and this is my 3rd pair in 3 years.",
