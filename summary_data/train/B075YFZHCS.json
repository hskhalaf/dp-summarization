I attempted to use it over about a 75 foot range, and it would not reach. I finally installed it in a less suitable position which is about 40 feet from the doorbell button. It does work at that point, but if you\u2019re looking for a long-range doorbell, look elsewhere.",

With the previous wireless doorbell if I was in my bedroom I wouldn\u2019t be able to hear when someone rang the doorbell. But not with Avantek, I don\u2019t miss anyone now at my door. Not to mention you can even set 52 different chimes, just in time for Christmas, so I have a melody that is Christmassy programmed. The only downfall is trying to pick just 1 chime to use, the selections are unbelievable. The Avantek doorbell is one of the best gadgets I have bought.",
