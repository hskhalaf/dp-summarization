Thankfully, Dayton Audio made a smaller version. My wife pulled into the garage and said she could hear them while she was still in her car! Plenty of volume, especially at this size and pricepoint. I was concerned my young daughter or dog might destroy these, but at this price, I won't be too upset if it happens. These are a great budget speaker and they still sound darn good.",

Larger than they might ideally be (esp. compared to Audioengine 2's), they are a great kitchen speaker when paired with the LP-2020A and my Amazon Echo Dot. Attaching them together bottom to bottom (like conjoined twins, sort of), attaching some sort of handle, and screwing the LP-2020A to the back is a little project I thought of which would make them more easily moved. Not sure how I'd attach them (sand and wood glue), nor what to use as a handle (decorative screws and scrap leather piece?)...",

    "title": "Dayton Audio B452 4-1/2\" 2-Way Bookshelf Speaker Pair",
    "description": "Don't judge a speaker by its size! The Dayton Audio B452 4-1/2\" bookshelf speaker is the smallest in the Dayton Audio family, but the sound is big. A newly-designed 4-1/2\" polypropylene cone woofer with 4-layer voice coil achieves excellent balance and listenability when combined with the 5/8\" Ferro fluid-cooled polycarbonate tweeter, for surprisingly rich, detailed sound from a small, affordable speaker. While cheap speakers use plastic enclosure parts to cut costs, the inexpensive B452 uses a sturdy wood-composite cabinet that minimizes resonance and enhances warmth without sacrificing clarity. The B452 bookshelf speaker fits into a space only 5.5\" wide and less than 6\" deep, making it the perfect choice for desktop listening, or compact surround speakers in a home theater surround-sound system. A built-in keyhole wall hanger bracket makes it a breeze to wall-mount the B452 in any desired location. For a room-filling listening experience with deeper bass that rivals larger full-sized speakers, the B452 speaker also pairs perfectly with any of the excellent Dayton Audio powered subwoofers. Anywhere you enjoy music, the balanced sound of the B452s add a new dimension of affordable enjoyment. Specifications: Woofer: 4-1/2\" polypropylene cone with 4-layer voice coil Tweeter: 5/8\" polycarbonate dome with Ferro fluid cooling Power handling: 30 watts RMS/60 watts max Impedance: 6 ohms Frequency response: 85-20,000 Hz Sensitivity: 84 dB 1W/1m Dimensions: 9.5\" H x 5.5\" W x 5.7\" D.",
