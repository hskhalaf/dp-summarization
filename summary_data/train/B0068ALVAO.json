Since then it has been nothing but problems, working intermittently, losing configuration, finally PAID for a technician to come in from my internet provider, they are seeing intermittent 100% packet loss when connected to the router, but NO loss when connected directly to the incoming signal. Total piece of crap and even worse likely something that was defective originally, returned to Amazon and resold as if new! How can a company get away with this!?!?!?",

I also noted that it had a USB connector on it and connected a spare hard drive to it. I thought that would allow me to access that hard drive that was connected to it. That being the main reason for purchasing this router. I can't fined out what else the USB connection could be used for.",

      "text": "If your networking needs are modest -- gigabit backbone, and wifi to a few electronic appliances and computers, this is a great product. I pluged it in replacing a DIR-657, and it recognized everything immediately. Subjective network performance went up immediately. However, while I'm very computer literate, I'm no \"networking guru\", and if you want to \"tweak\" its performance or security settings, the D-Link interface is still intimidating, a bit cumbersom, and generally not too helpful. Luckily, for me there were only a few things to tweak. Performance - A Plug'n'play - A User interface - B- Documentation - C RECOMMENDED",

The installation is a bit convoluted if you select \"replacing another router\". If you don't jump ahead and attempt to install it as most routers, by installing the DVD, and then plugging in the router, and follow each step as the software demands, it gets the job done. But like I said it is much more confusing than installing a Linksys Cisco devise, but the end results are definitely worth it.",

Second is due to the user interface, even when you make a simple change it requires a reboot although they do make it a little better by allowing you to save multiple changes before rebooting which has to be done in order to make changes final.",

With DLNA, the HD Media Router 3000 not only connects to any Ethernet-equipped device, but virtually any device, automatically. \n\nGIVE YOUR DIGITAL ENTERTAINMENT THE BANDWIDTH IT DESERVES. GIVE IT HD FUEL.\nWith HD Fuel to automatically manage traffic flow, the HD Media Router 3000 prioritizes your high-bandwidth traffic applications (Netflix, Vudu, XBox 360, VoIP) so that they get the speed they need. Imagine uninterrupted 1080p HD video streams, clear Skype calls, and lag-free online gaming--a clear step up from problems common to \"standard\" routers. \n\nD-Link HD Media Routers are the only routers that automatically prioritize bandwidth. With HD Fuel you can even manually prioritize bandwidth by both application and device. HD Fuel is the ultimate traffic management system and best way to stay in complete command of your digital entertainment. \n\nDUAL BAND = UNLIMITED CONNECTIVITY FOR ALL YOUR DEVICES\nDual-band wireless means you get two networks operating simultaneously (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz), with each network transferring up to 450 Mbps. Surf the Web and check email on the 2.4 GHz band, and run your high definition audio and video digital entertainment center and gaming systems on the clearer 5 GHz band. The 5 GHz band offers less interference from appliances, cordless phones and competing wireless devices.\n\nSee larger image.
