It\u2019s not easily adjustable when lowering the dryer arm. You have to constantly tighten the bolts are otherwise the dryer arm does not stay in place. Would not recommend this product.

The screws that holds it up constantly need to be tightened, otherwise it will keep falling down, ie: the nozzle points downwards. The \"C\" clips that keeps the hose and nozzle attachment in place are not quite tight enough. The concentrated nozzle on the hose attachment keeps getting blown off whenever the c-clips are gently knocked out of place. Overall, may be good for home grooming. Definitely not heavy duty enough for professional groomers.",

Even when the knob is as tight as I can get it, it will still suddenly drop on me. Buy another stand dryer. I wish I had been able to return it, but I was very sick and wasn't able to disassemble it and ship it back before the window closed.",
