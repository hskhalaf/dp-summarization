      "text": "I bought both the clock and the thermometer. Both are heavy weight and solid. Looks good and am glad I bought them. But, both are difficult to see because the raised letters are the same color as the background. Picture is misleading. I am not very artsy craftsy but I bought a Sharpie Metallic Gold Paint Marker (not the ink) and painted over the numbers. Because they are raised it is very easy and took less than 10 minutes for each one. Now they both look great (they actually look like the picture) and you can actually tell the time/temp.",

      "text": "Nice looking, but, as others have noted, the illustration is deceiving in that in the actual product, the numerals are barely visible because they are the same color as the background. I took the suggestion of others and applied a copper-colored nail polish to the hands, the numerals and to the tick marks closer to the center. Took only about 20 minutes to do, but made a world of difference. If you're willing to invest the time and effort to apply coloring, I highly recommend the clock. Otherwise, you'll be disappointed.",
