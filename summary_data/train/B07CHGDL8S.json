I've only worn it once, but when I rinsed it out after going to the river, the water turned the color of the suit immediately. I wonder how it's going to look at the end of the season? I wish the bottoms were more structured, but they fit well and cover everything I want covered. Not sure if this would be good for someone that's a really active swimmer. I'm more of a lounger, though, so for me it offers enough support.",

I did cross them b.c they looked odd straight and they would undo themselves. Definitely couldn't wear off the shoulder bc it was too tight and I didn't like that look anyway. They are removable in case you don't want them on at all. The top was very comfortable and I felt comfortable in the entire swimsuit. I felt sexy as well for being overweight.",

I have not gotten it wet yet so I can\u2019t share if it stretches out but it appears to be a durable material. I think it\u2019s super cute and I\u2019ll probably buy other colors. The ONE downfall is that it is that the bottoms are really high on me, but I think I have a short torso. In the back the top and bottom overlap and it appears to be a one piece. Maybe if I had a bigger butt that wouldn\u2019t happen.",
