I've seen others on here mention that they replaced the 3-inch pipe with a taller one and I will probably be doing the same sometime soon.",

The other tension screw attached to the main arm also did nothing. The arms are completely nonfunctional if you are unable to adjust the rotation in 2 dimensions. If you notice recent reviews, this seems to be a very common problem. Do yourself a favor and don't even consider these.

After I did some digging I realized that the tension adjustment is down the shaft of the upper arm and has to be accessed with a monitor detached using the long t-shaped allen wrench that's included. After a good bit of turning, the arm holds this heavy monitor up very steady and still adjusts position and angle fairly easily.",

You will only be able to push them out to the side, which looks strange as there will be a gap. To close the gap, bottom needs to extend back to allow for monitors to be pushed back and close together.",

While the management options are nice the swivel point means that the tension on the cables themselves can affect the monitors positioning.

It's hanging up my 2 27'' Viewsonics right now, i will admit..also make sure you got some room behind your computer desk because these arms are very big and will need some room because they'll bang up your walls. All in all great mount and the gas springs are just so great, the only downfall is the plastic lids for wire management, those suck.",
