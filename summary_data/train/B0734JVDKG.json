Bands have not broken (yet, hopefully never will)...it's kind of a pain dealing with the buttons on the front face of a Samsung Galaxy phone with it, but the Matone does everything it says it will do. Swivel on the pivot and take a picture?? No problemo. Tap buttons far more easily than through a nasty plastic cover that gets sweat and grime and dust inside it? You betcha. And seriously, SOOOOO much more convenient on your WRIST than on your BICEP. Not as easy to tap buttons and manipulate your phone there!!",

I have a Samsung Galaxy Note9, in a case, and it works great even with the case on. I have an average size forearm and it fits comfortably on it. If my forearm was much bigger, it may get a bit tight, even with the elastic. Still...I highly recommend it!",

It keeps me from having to dig into my pocket every time I want to check miles, altitude or direction. I would have given it 5 stars if the pivot was off-center just a bit. Being centered made it a little troublesome when using the camera feature on my phone because my arm covered the lower portion of the picture. Not a major problem, solvable with cropping, but a minor inconvenience non-the-less. Some of my hiking companions were impressed with it and wanted one for themselves.",

Well, at 5'3\", I am not able to bend with it anywhere near my waist. The only slight may be that it is heavy on my arm. I just have to get used to it because it does work and is secure.",
