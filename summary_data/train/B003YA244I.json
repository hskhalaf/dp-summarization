Only issue is seat hinge could be better otherwise zero maintenance in master bath. Love quiet flush, quiet seat close, easy clean and overall modern design. Easy to install if you take you time with marking new holes. Update: finally had to replace water valve and standard Korky silent valve was perfect fit for about ten bucks.",
