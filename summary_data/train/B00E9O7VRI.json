The pill size is significantly larger, the color is different and there\u2019s an odd odor as well. The date on the bottle is current so that\u2019s not the issue. At first I didn\u2019t think much of it until I started noticing a change in the way I felt and realized it coincided with the change in this iron supplement. I decided to purchase another bottle in case it was a bad batch but the new bottle was the same. Extremely disappointed. Something isn\u2019t right!",

For any allergy sufferers, one important thing to note is that the first inactive ingredient is Lactose, and the label does warn that dairy byproducts are included in this tablet. For me that is not an issue, but for some, it is. Take note if necessary. Otherwise, this is a great product, and I've suffered no side effects from it.",
