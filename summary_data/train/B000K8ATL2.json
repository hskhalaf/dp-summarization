Its Outstanding when it comes to getting anything up off the grill (YES, EVEN AN 18lb Brisket!!) Now most people wouldn't use a spatula to do something like that but I did in order to see if its as strong as it was reported to be. IT IS!!! And its a SNAP to clean as its GREAT STAINLESS STEEL!! Not Cheap Chinese Junk!!",

It's long enough to fit 2 1/3 pound burger patties at once and still have a little room. And really, for grilling all you need is one of these babies and a nice, heavy duty, long pair of tongs and you're ready to be Master of your grill.",

I only gave it four stars because the description says that it has a cutting edge, but there is no cutting edge. All of the edges of the spatula are of the same thickness, which I don't mind, but there is no edge that would clearly work well for cutting. Otherwise, though, this is a really high quality spatula for a really great price. Just don't expect to cut anything other than the softest of food with it.",
