The sound is spacious, crystal clear and hard hitting, even when it's streamed from my iPhone. Bass response is nothing short of remarkable. YAY! Happy bunny here...",

The battery lasts a long time, one charge, eight hours later and the battery has 3 out of 4 bars. The blue tooth range was excellent, still working 3 rooms away. It was charged fully in about an hour.",
