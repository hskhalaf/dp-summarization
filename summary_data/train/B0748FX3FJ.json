Bought them to work with my running watch (FR645), the low power of the watch has caused trouble with other Bluetooth ears, but thanks to this design with a Bluetooth hub, the connection has been stellar. Sound quality is great. The fit is good for sports but not the most comfortable I've had. As others have mentioned, the battery does not last 10hrs, I'm getting 4-5hrs. Especially given the separate hub that could host a bigger battery, this is disappointing. Easily resolved by charging more frequently...",
