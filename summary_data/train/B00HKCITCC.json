Play as the monster and wage a guerrilla war against 4 hunters or take on the role of a hunter and team up to take down a horrific abomination. 1 v 4 gameplay that still looks amazing even after all this time. The company may have shut down their servers and everyone may get a free 'upgrade' to Evolve: stage 2... but you can go back to playing the (mostly) functional game via Steam settings and selecting the option to not play the beta (Stage:2). Then it's just P2P gameplay or bots, but dang is it still fun.",

      "text": "Great game, a lot of fun both online and single player though I prefer to play against the bots. Supposedly more monsters and hunters coming out. However, it is heavily DLC based. I recommend waiting for the price to drop a lot and getting all of the DLC or waiting for a package to come out besides the Hunting Season pass or other option. Skins are not worth it unless you're a die hard fan but extra monsters and hunters adds replay value. Worth a shot if you're thinking about it.",

However there are a ton of achievements to keep you interested. I don't think I need to speak on the gameplay aspect a whole lot since there are literally thousands of others who have.

As for the extra skins, maybe a little over priced, but its just a skin, its not like it actually changes the game play or something.",
