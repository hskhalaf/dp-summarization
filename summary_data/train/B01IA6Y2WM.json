Unlike our Subaru Forester which has a 3 position adjustable head rest - the Tacoma has a set position. The neck pillow in the Travel Ease set is working wonderfully for me. I reversed the head rest and strapped the pillow at the base of my neck. Presto! comfort while still keeping the whiplash safety of a headrest. Great product - will recommend to others!",

I am 5'7\" so i would think average height people would have the same experience. The thickness of the foam in the lumbar area is too thick and pushes you too far forward in the seat. Then there is no support behind your shoulders at all. It helped with my lower back pain but caused me to have mid and upper back pain. Not a good fit for me at all.",

Both of us are not impressed with the neck support piece(2-3 stars). It doesn't seem to sit right so the support is awkward and a little uncomfortable. I really like the material they are made of. It is the perfect balance between soft comfort and support. I am happy I made the purchase, but I do wish the neck piece was designed differently.",

The foam filling is thick and dense. However, what i wanted and expected was firm lumbar support. This foam fits to your shape as you lean into the pillow, but the lower back support is not firm enough to hold a weak lower back in place on long drives. So, overall, you can get a lot of support from this set, but dont expect the strongest lumbar support.",

      "text": "the memory foam is relatively soft, so that it does not seem to provide a lot of support to my lower back, but it definitely helps. The neck support is too small to hardly reach my neck.. Would need to it be at least another inch thick. The products appear well made and durable and high quality. The fitting issues will be personal to each user. I am driving a 2013 honda odyssey and I am sick of the hard leather (\"luxury\") bucket seats that seem intent on destroying my body. Good luck navigating the jungle of products available on amazon. No doubt, confusion is good for sales, as there is no easy way to compare by size.",

The one thing I did not like about it is the crappy adjustment/attachment system. The straps really don't hold it on the seat very well and I could not get the straps to pull the back cushion up to where I needed it. I am tall and had to keep pushing it up on my back even with the straps adjusted as far up as possible.",

I wish that my head sunk a little bit more than it does. Actually if you want to use it how i do you really have to force your head back. The backrest part is perfect for the foam. I thought i had seen some straps on it in the picture though. It doesn't have straps to keep it in place so you have to adjust it after you move. I ordered some straps and I'm going to have my mom sew them on. Otherwise great product.",
