I literally got the phone 30 minutes ago which i appreciate was fast but the phone itself is being sold as new and a uk version (uk viable). Just to clarify all 4 corners of the phone are scratched with no plastic film on the front of the phone but on the back. The screen itself appears intact but i obviously do not feel comfortable with this phone now. I was really happy about getting this phone as well. 1 star until resolved",

I then have to disconnect my Wifi and reconnect it again... there were a number of Software Updates that tried to fix this problem, the last update I got didn't mention Wifi so I guess Samsung think it's fixed.",

Major downside is that the exit button at the bottom of the screen is too close to the space bar on the keyboard, making it very easy to exit inadvertently whilst typing, which is at best inconvenient and at worst means losing all your work! Find that the fingerprint sensor rarely works if I'm gardening and have traces of earth on my finger, which usually means entering the PIN if I need to access the phone at such times. Value for money is questionable, choice of purchase mainly down to familiarity with Samsung phones in the past and reluctance at my age to get my head round a different brand!",

After reaching out to the S10 subreddit, it seems to be affecting some Exynos models. It's a shame that the battery can only handle 1-2h screen on time, but oh well.
