I purchased the 3rd unit through Amazon & it went faulty under 30 days so I returned & replaced with the same unit & this 4th unit that I am returning went faulty under 30 days, the same as the replacement.

Still better than the all-in-one frothers I've used.

With this one, the ju and base are separate so clean-up is a breeze",

This one is by far the best we have ever experienced with ease of use, ease of cleaning, and operate. medium price compare to Naspresso. I also purchased 3 year appliance warranty from Amazon just in case. 4/27/2017, the last one last for 2.5 years with a 3 years protection plan, so we got full price refunded and we just purchased another one. still again the best we have experience, very happy about it, hope they sell the extra frother unit.",

I make espresso in a french press pot for hot drinks, or cool for later for cold drinks. Even better is when you can find a highly concentrated cold press coffee concentrate when making cold ones. You just add mild and push a button a snowflake for cold milk or a heat wave for hot milk. The froth stays longer than at the fancy coffee shops. The price of the machine will pay for itself in 1-2 months!! Easier than I thought. Quick Clean Up!",

The big fail is product quality. I've owned three of these and they all failed within a year or so of daily use. That's unacceptable. Buy it for occasional use and I suppose it'll be fine. Otherwise, you'll have to make do with a frother that does less and makes less froth.",

I was initially hesitant to purchase this item because it does not use the traditional steamed - milk method of frothing, but I now think this does a much better job of producing a thick froth.

Cons: base gets very hot (as does the pitcher).

Get my frother going, then turn my Kuerig on and brew my coffee--by the time coffee's ready my milk is frothed and ready to add to the coffee. Easy to use, easy to clean and works fabulously. Didn't find it too difficult to remove the frothing disk--it's a lot sturdier than it looks but you only need to remove it if you want to heat without frothing. Try adding a little sugar and even some vanilla to your milk before frothing--you'll have your own whipped topping for your coffee or hot chocolate--it's that good!",
