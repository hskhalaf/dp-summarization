I put this directly onto her skin in the places she itches the most. It did help but not as much as actually feeding the coconut oil to her did. So now I\u2019m adding it to her food daily and applying the coconut oil to her fur at night. I\u2019ve been doing this for a month now and her fur is getting super soft and she itches so much less. UPDATE: her fur finally grew back!! Still feed this to her daily.",

My previous jar was from Trader Joe's; has 1oz less than this jar claims to have, and it was filled completely to the top despite the container being about the same size. I can see the two containers aren't exactly the same in volume, but the actual displacement of oil seems too drastic; especially with Nutiva claiming to have one ounce MORE. Also I've learned I prefer the glass jars over this white plastic jar; makes it hard to see when it is leaking (and it is ALWAYS leaking) and whether the oil is liquid or solid.",

Fewer flare ups of skin yeast infections or itchy patches and her coat is softer. We added the coconut oil a little bit at a time so it didn't upset her tummy. It's done so well for her that we've started adding it to the food for our other dogs.",

I actually love the taste of this coconut oil and I find that I cannot live without it. I especially love to FRY my plantain chips in this coconut oil, it gives it such a sweet tropical taste!! I also add 1 teaspoon of coconut oil to my rice cooker as well. By the way, Kimberly Snyder (nutritionist to the stars) recommends this exact brand of coconut oil !",

Sure, I can scoop it out with a spoon, but then I have to put the excess back into the jar or find another container. Thank goodness there is another provider who provides their coconut oil in a wide mouth jar! Packaging is important.",
