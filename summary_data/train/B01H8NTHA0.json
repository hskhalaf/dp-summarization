      "title": "My 6th pair of Five Fingers",
      "text": "I have used Five Finger shoes for walking, road and trail running, and gym work for many years. The V-Runs were purchased to replace my original pair of Bikila Evos that eventually wore out after over 1000 miles of running. These shoes last for a long time compared to normal trainers and provide a near barefoot experience. They are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn and have reduced the number of injuries I used to get when running in other shoes.",

I broke my foot 6 months ago so do still need some support. However I walk and exercise in these - they are amazing for uneven surfaces and grass.",

      "text": "FYI I am a size 7 UK, so I went with 7/7.5 vs 6.5/7. Fits quite well. I've also had trouble finding good running shoes because I have wide feet, so too narrow shoes screws up my running posture and gives me pain. In the end, I decided to go with these and they did the trick! Will also caveat that one should read about barefoot running first before getting a pair or you may injure yourself. Safety first.",
