I needed a new drill to replace a Craftsman drill that had finally died after many years of unfailing service. I found this drill at an excellent price so I bought it. Thus far it's driven drywall screws through the drywall into kiln dried lumber, drilled holes into hardwood without hesitation, drilled holes using a hole saw attachment etc. Note of caution: although this is a variable speed drill it doesn't like low rpm's. With some patience you can feather the trigger to achieve a low rpm but really the drill is a beast!",

Immediately after receiving it, I put a 36-inch long, 3/8\" straight shank installer bit into the chuck and ran the drill at the lowest speed and the highest speed. There was minimal detectable bit wobble in the vertical orientation. Naturally, the sag in the long shank caused significant wobble in the horizontal position, but that's not the fault of the drill. Also, I had no problem achieving low enough speed for driving screws. This looks to be a good product if used with a modicum of common sense.",

It's not the bit---I can see the chuck wobbling, and I even put the bit into another drill to double-check (no wobble on the other drill).

Just used it to complete a workbench for the garage and it performed great. Great to pair with another battery drill that way you can switch between drilling and driving screws quickly.",
