A great book for anyone who wants to start bullet journaling. the pages are fairly thick, enough to keep most markers and pens from bleeding through and enough to do a lil watercolor painting if youre careful. The cover is nice, but i dont have the info to say whether it truly is cork or not. The few greivances i have are how the pages are off white (while i know that they are in fact recycled sheets) and the spaces between the dots could be bigger (and that part i blame my large handwriting on)",

That\u2019s perfectly fine but when getting towards the middle of the book the pages bend automatically and it makes it difficult to keep the page flat. No real complaints here, otherwise.

I looked at other dot graph notebooks in the same category and they were either significantly more expensive or came in a softbound cover with fewer pages. Very happy with this purchase. If I could improve upon one thing, I would make the dots on each page just a shade lighter as they are quite noticeable and if using pencil the markings do not stand out on the page among the dots themselves but this is just personal preference.",

The pictures that I have uploaded are sequential, so I\u2019ve written on both sides of the page. You can see the marker shows through a little bit where I have drawn a lot, but it\u2019s really not bad at all. It lays flat very well and the dots are nicely spaced. The cork is softer than I was expecting, and I\u2019m sure it will get even better over time. I highly recommend it as a bullet journal for beginners if you\u2019re looking for a place to start! -AB",

Details like perforated pages, pen holder, sticker markers to categorize the pages, pocket are thoughtful, but the elastic on the page marker arrived slightly frayed and it'd be nice if the pocket was large enough to accommodate the pages once removed. I do get some bleed through from the journal pens I purchased from the 'frequently purchased with' recommendations but its minor and not a huge issue for me. A few weeks in I would consider repurchasing for myself or as a gift for friends.",

Feels about the same in weight but with added features: little thicker and wider paper, perforations and a place to hold my pen. The cork material is also really unique and supposed to be more durable than the faux leather. Very happy with my purchase, will buy again!!!",
