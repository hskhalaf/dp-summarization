If your looking for a sharp looking, reliable, and easy on your wallet single speed I suggest this bicycle from Golden Cycles. :)",

Besides this, the bike itself is excellent for city/road use and is easy to maintain with the provided tools. Chain tightening and brake tightening should be done occasionally after assembly, but otherwise the bike runs well on its own. It is lightweight as expected, and can reach fairly high speeds, also as expected for a single speed. The main strength of this bike is its price. It is a good product for the price you pay, and will last you a good amount of time if you take care of it when you need to.",

Aesthetically the bike is very pleasing to the eye (I have the black with blue rims) and have gotten a lot of compliments on it already and I've only had it a few days! I received the bike much faster than anticipated, with no bends or breaks to any parts. 10/10 would buy again! (And probably will once my husband admits he wants one himself!)",
