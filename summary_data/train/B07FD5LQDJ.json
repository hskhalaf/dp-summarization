Too many boots these days (including my other Merrells) claim to be waterproof but are actually hydrophilic. I was on a rescue call miles off-road, so I was very happy to be warm and dry on the way home. Since that day, these boots have been completely comfortable and not too hot in the 80 degree days that followed. Living in the mountains, I wear boots every day and they get a lot of challenges. So far these are great. Note: Bought directly from Merrell, but used AmazonPay.",
