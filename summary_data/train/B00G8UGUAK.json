Only recommendation I have to the manufacturer is that replace the carabiner with a version that is not sharp or catchy.

Overall I would recommend this product as everything else about it is perfect.",

They are sturdy and stand up to my workout of 50 straight leg raises, followed by knee raises and side raises. After months of using them the stitching has held tight.",

There is a little bit of a learning curve, and getting stronger shoulders makes them easier to use for sure. I suggest looking at the workout plans they have in the box, and starting there. Basically, you hang these up, put your arms in them (engage your shoulders, you don't want to shlump), and then lift your legs using your abs. You can do bent knees to chest, bent knees lifted to either side, or even do these directions with straight legs which is more difficult. I can feel my abs and shoulders burning after a session with these straps!",
