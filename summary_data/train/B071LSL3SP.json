The way the handles join the pans, it is very easy to grab the hot metal, rather than the cool plastic. One of us got a second degree burn this way. The lip of the pans isn't level. It's higher opposite the handle to make flipping food more effective. This interferes with putting a lid on the pan and takes a bit of getting used to.

Not only are they adorable but they work SO incredibly well. Completely non stick and washes beautifully in the dishwasher as well as by hand. I did have the smallest sauce pan with a little bit of a loose handle and I reached out to Vremi and their customer service was amazing. I always cook with medium or medium/ low heat because these pans heat up very well. They are also not oven safe which is fine with us!",
