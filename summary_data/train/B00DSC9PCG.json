A stain thing came out of the motor and went to the shaft. It seems it was burned. A lot of steams came out when it was working and then it stopped working. How come I spent over a hundred dollar and only used it for 4 months? Can anyone help me? I added a photo here",

So I have to find a plate and lie the top part on it, and then pour out the milk and wash the machine. Because I'm not sure if letting the blades lie on the counter would hurt them, I put the top part on the plate with perfect size so that the blades wouldn't touch anything.",

I did not make anything else using this machine except milk. Love it, love it, love it.",

I know you can't submerge it but I tried to just tip the end into the sink to scoop up water but water still got into the machine. I mostly make rice milk in this. So I use the porridge setting. One day I did everything as normal and suddenly steam is billowing up out from under the lid. It had never done that before. I quickly unplugged it and let it dry out. The results of this machine are incredible but it is a finicky machine to use.",

The soy pulp is on the bottom of the pot or the container after pouring out. If you hate the pulp, just pouring the soy milk from the top. The soy pulp is smoother than I expected. Washing the unit is easier if the two pieces are washed right after. A brush is a must for washing. The whole process takes about 20 minutes for soaked soy beans, I have not tried other options yet, dry beans, soup, raw juice, etc. I\u2019m extremely pleased with the purchase.",
