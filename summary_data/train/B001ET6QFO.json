I do nature photography and frequently take 50+ photos in a day's time. The only thing missing was the printed manual. All functions operate flawlessly. Physically it looks like a new camera. This camera became the 4th Canon DSLR I own two of which are newer cameras in the Rebel line and all of which were purchased new. Thus far I have taken only a few photos using it but it may soon become my favorite.",

Other reviewers have written long, detailed, reviews, so I will make this one short and sweet. I am very pleased to have purchased the 50D. I especially like the following items: 1. High-resolution, LCD display on the back of the camera. 2. Custom menus and features. Also, the menus look so much better in color. 3. More mega-pixels, because I often crop. 4. Higher ISO. The \"Canon EOS 50D Digital Field Guide (Paperback)\", available at Amazon (, provides a lot of good information for the 50D. Bottom line: great camera that I am really enjoying.",

The points are all cross-type, as opposed to a single cross-type point in the center on my T3i. Write speeds on Compact flash cards are fast enough to keep up with the burst rate, which makes this a great sports camera.",

    "title": "Canon EOS 50D 15.1MP Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Standard Zoom Lens",
    "description": "Style:Body w/ 18-200mm IS Kit| Product Packaging:Standard PackagingFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n Canon\u2019s new EOS 50D bridges the gap between the novice and the seasoned pro with a perfect combination of high-speed and quality. It features an APS-C sized 15.1-megapixel CMOS sensor for tremendous images, new DIGIC 4 Image Processor for fine detail and superior color reproduction, and improved ISO capabilities up to 12800 for uncompromised shooting even in the dimmest situations. It features a refined 3.0-inch Clear View LCD (920,000 dots) monitor, supercharged Live View Function with Face Detection Live mode, plus a number of new automatic Image Correction settings and HDMI output for viewing images on an HDTV. Pick up the EOS 50D and you\u2019ll experience true digital inspiration! \n\nCanon EOS 50D Digital SLR Highlights \n\nNew 15.1-megapixel CMOS sensor with improved noise reduction\nThe EOS 50D features a newly-designed 15.1-megapixel APS-C sized CMOS sensor which is capable of recording up to 4752 x 3168 pixels with full 14-bit A/D conversion for extremely fine tonal gradation. Ready to capture images in an instant, the sensor is designed to work with Canon\u2019s EF and EF-S lenses with a conversion factor of 1.6x. It\u2019s capable of recording at sensitivities previously too noisy for shooting in low light or subjects in motion. With a maximum ISO rating of 12800 combined with a 4-level High ISO speed noise reduction function, images that would have been impossible without the use of a strobe or flash become simple to record. \n\n\n\nNext generation DIGIC 4 Image Processor for faster processing\nThe EOS 50D operates with such effortless speed that operation is nothing short of intuitive. With instant startup times, speedy autofocus and minimal shutter lag, the EOS 50D is one of the fastest cameras available today. It can shoot up to 6.3 fps, in bursts of up to 90 JPEGs (using an UDMA CF card), 60 JPEGs (using a CF card) consecutively or 16 RAW files, so you\u2019ll never, ever miss a shot. \n\nDIGIC 4 Image Processor\nThis next generation DIGIC 4 Image Processor offers finer details and even more natural color reproduction, compared with the previous DIGIC III Image Processor. Since Canon\u2019s DIGIC 4 chips use advanced signal processing technologies, they provide even faster operations, including write times to UDMA cards. It also enables Face Detection Live mode to detect and focus up to 35 face(s) to capture the best possible shot. Further, DIGIC 4 offers the improved Auto Lighting Optimizer that corrects brightness and contrast automatically, and Peripheral Illumination Correction for up to 40 EF lenses. DIGIC always maximizes performance between the capturing and recording stages of digital photography. \n\n3.0-inch Clear View LCD The EOS 50D features a bright, high resolution, 3.0-inch Clear View LCD monitor with 920,000 (dots/VGA) pixels and a broad viewing angle of 160 degrees horizontally and vertically. It offers a brighter and more detailed display than the EOS 40D, includes a new smudge-resistant coating, and is perfect for accessing camera settings like ISO, Metering modes AF Point selection and flash options. Plus, it\u2019s superb for reviewing, editing and deleting photos or composing new images in Live View Function. \n\nEnhanced Live View shooting includes Face Detection Live mode\nThe EOS 50D features Canon\u2019s most advanced Live View shooting thanks to the number of focusing modes available including Quick mode, Live mode and Face Detection Live mode. You can zoom in and navigate the composition 5x or 10x normal size, enabling critical focus. There\u2019s even 2 overlay grid options, perfect for lining up vertical and horizontal lines. In the studio, the camera can be controlled remotely with Live View Function when the camera is connected to a computer through a USB cable, or wirelessly if the optional Wireless File Transmitter WFT-E3A is used. \n\n9 cross-type high-precision sensors for accurate target subject acquisition\nThe EOS 50D has a high-precision 9-point wide area AF that uses cross-type points at f-stops of f/5.6 or faster, enabling the camera to focus faster, more accurately, and in difficult lighting situations. AF sensitivity is a stunning EV-0.5 to EV18. Adding to this AF performance, the EOS 50D incorporates a diagonally mounted cross-type sensor that is sensitive to both vertical and horizontal lines at f/2.8, perfect for enhanced operation in dim light. The EOS 50D has a number of focus modes, including One-Shot AF, AI Focus AF and AI Servo AF. \n\nNew Lens Peripheral Illumination Correction setting\nCanon\u2019s exclusive Lens Peripheral Illumination setting takes into account any light falloff in the corners of the frame and corrects it, making for a perfectly exposed image. Correction data are detected automatically on a number of Canon EF lenses and can be entered manually through included the Canon EOS Utility software. \n\nUpdated EOS Integrated Cleaning System\nThe EOS 50D\u2019s Self Cleaning Sensor Unit eliminates stray dust that enters the camera when changing a lens or when out in the field. The sensor\u2019s IR-cut/Low-pass filter cleans itself automatically with ultrasonic vibrations every time the camera is turned on or off and features a new flourine coating to minimize dust adhesion. Dust missed by the cleaning unit is captured by Canon\u2019s Dust Delete Data Detection software and can be erased from the image file. \n\nSelf Cleaning Sensor Unit\nA key element of minimizing dust is preventing it from clinging to the front surface of the imaging sensor. To combat this, the EOS 50D features a Canon-designed Self Cleaning Sensor Unit. The low-pass filter at the front of the sensor shakes off dust automatically with ultrasonic vibrations, removing dust from the sensor assembly. The EOS 50D also has a coating on the front surface of the low-pass filter, to increase its resistance to dust sticking to the sensor. \n\nDust Delete Data Detection\nDust that may still remain on the front of the sensor can also be erased with software included in Digital Photo Professional (DPP) Version 3.3 or later software. A simple test shot of a plain, white object can be taken, using a menu setting. This Dust Delete Data image is analyzed in-camera, and the location and size of any remaining dust is added to any subsequent pictures taken. This data is transmitted along with the image, whether JPEG or RAW, and can be either manually or automatically erased in Canon\u2019s DPP software. This added software option ensures the cleanest possible image, perfect for printing or archiving. \n\nCreative Auto goes a step beyond full auto with on screen setting display The EOS 50D has a new Creative Auto mode and a quick control screen that helps novice users narrow the gap between fully automatic and manual control. While the camera will remain by default in fully automatic mode, frequently changed settings like flash, exposure compensation, image quality and more are all accessible through one easy screen interface designed for intuitive, quick action. A provided shooting guide serves as a quick-reference for on-the-fly operation. \n\nHDMI output for displaying full high-resolution images on a HDTV The EOS 50D includes a new HDMI (High Definition Multimedia Interface) output device that enables High Definition display of your photographs on any HDTV with HDMI ports. It\u2019s remarkable to behold the details of your photographs in Full HD, and it\u2019s easy with the EOS 50D. Resolution is set automatically to match the TV to which you\u2019ve connected, and images are displayed in a full-frame 3:2 ratio with blacked out bars to the left and right of the image. \n\nCompatible with over 60 Canon EF/EF-S lenses and most EOS System accessories \n\nEF & EF-S Lenses\nThe EOS 50D is compatible with all Canon lenses in the EF and EF-S lineup, ranging from ultra-wide angle to super telephoto lenses. Canon lenses employ advanced optical expertise and micron-precision engineering to deliver unprecedented performance in all facets of the photographic process. Special optical technologies, such as Aspherical, ultra-low dispersion, or fluorite elements are featured in the universally acclaimed L-series lenses. And Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer technology is featured in select lenses to minimize the effect of camera shake. Through Canon lenses, photographers can truly maximize the quality and liberating performance of the EOS 50D. \n\nFlash Photography\nThe EOS 50D features the acclaimed E-TTL II flash metering system. With any of the flashes in the EX Speedlite line, E-TTL II provides reliable flash output whether shooting fill-in flash pictures in sunlight, or using flash in total darkness. With E-TTL II, the exact same 35-zone metering sensor used for measuring ambient light is also used for flash metering--giving even finer metering command of the image area. If you prefer a broader area for flash metering, there's a menu setting to change to \"Average\" flash metering--where the entire 35-zone area is measured evenly for flash exposure. \n\nSoftware \n\nCanon EOS Digital Solution Disk (Version 17.0)\nThe EOS 50D comes bundled with an updated Canon EOS Digital Solution Disk, which features powerful software programs designed to extend the EOS experience to the computer. These include Canon's EOS Utility (Version 2.5), Digital Photo Professional (Version 3.5), ZoomBrowser EX for Windows (Version 6.2), ImageBrowser for Macintosh OS X (Version 6.2), the Picture Style Editor (Version 1.4), PhotoStitch (version 3.2), WFT Utility (version 3.2). Each application is designed to perfect the captured images and streamline the digital workflow. \n\nEOS Utility (Version 2.5) for Macintosh or Windows handles the connection between the camera and computer, whenever they\u2019re connected via USB. It allows remote controlled shooting from the computer, handles downloading of images from the camera to the computer, and allows seamless linking to either Canon\u2019s ZoomBrowser/ImageBrowser or Digital Photo Professional software once images have been copied to the hard drive. Furthermore, it\u2019s used to upload settings back into a USB-connected camera. \n\nDigital Photo Professional (Version 3.5) is an image processing program that enables high-speed RAW image processing, high-speed previewing for real-time image adjustment and support for sRGB, Adobe RGB and Wide Gamut RGB color spaces. Because it\u2019s CMS (Color Management System) compatible, Digital Photo Professional allows for easy image layout and printing in Adobe RGB in conjunction with Easy-PhotoPrint and PictBridge printers. It also features the Dust Delete Data Detection tool for cleaner images. \n\nZoomBrowser EX (Version 6.2) for Windows and ImageBrowser (Version 6.2) for Mac OS X are the easy, user-friendly options for viewing and editing of JPEG and even RAW image files. Both allow viewing of numerous types of images including finished TIFF and BMP files. Both also have a variety of search options for finding images, allow re-naming of single images or batches of files, and offer a variety of options for printing without using a separate image-editing program. \n\nPicture Style Editor (Version 1.4)\nCanon\u2019s Picture Style Editor enables photographers to create custom Picture Style profiles that can be used to customize the appearance of JPEG and RAW images captured with EOS Digital SLR cameras. Picture Style files created with Picture Style Editor can be loaded into the EOS cameras that support Picture Style and may also be used when processing RAW images in Canon software applications Digital Photo Professional, ZoomBrowser EX (for Windows) and ImageBrowser (for Mac).\n\nREVIEW FROM DPREVIEW.COM\n\n\n \n\nLearn more about this camera\nat DPReview.com Canon EOS 50D Digital SLR: Highly Recommended (just) by dpreview.com \n\nAlmost exactly a year after the arrival of the EOS 40D, Canon has announced the 50D, which we're assured will be a sister-model, rather than a replacement. Recent history has seen Canon release new models every 18 months-or-so but it's been a busy year with newcomers such as the Nikon D300 getting a lot of attention in the 40D's keen-amateur/professional segment. The 50D is essentially a 40D body wrapped around a newly-developed 15 megapixel sensor that finally rectifies the situation in which Canon's XXD range trailed the company's entry-level line, in pixel terms. Canon is claiming that the new sensor's design (new manufacturing processes, redesigned photo diodes and micro lenses) mean that despite the higher resolution image noise has improved, something we'll be putting to the test later. \n\nThe other big change is the inclusion of a new, high-resolution LCD screen. 920,000 dots mean that it can convey 640 x 480 RGB pixels, making it effectively a VGA standard monitor. Three anti-reflection layers built into the screen do their best to keep it useable in bright conditions, too. \n\n>Read more at dpreview.com",
