Also cames with Android Oreo out of the box. The Huawei cloud services that they offer isn't available in the US, but no big deal when Google keeps everything on their cloud. I did use the help app to ask some questions about settings and got answers back within in a few hours from Huawei's help team. Overall, a great phone at a great price. BUY IT!",

People tell me at times they call me but I did not receive call, if it wasn't for that I would give 5 stars.",

The camera is great, fingerprint reader has been perfect, no issues with face unlock, the device is fantastic, yet will soon be utterly useless except as a toy.
