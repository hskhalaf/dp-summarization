Set the tent up at 8am every morning when it was fairly calm and left it up all day for 5 days. Had a few folks ask where I got them and I pointed them here. Bags were very sturdy and had a top and bottom strap and a loop you could have put around the leg. I didn't empty the bags as I plan on using them to hold the tent if ever I need to put it up on concrete.",

They have velcro straps to go around the legs of the gazebo/tent - I would have liked the straps to be slightly longer to fit the thicker poles but it still worked. We had a pretty big wind storm just last week and the gazebo did not move. They are a basic enough design that they do not take away from the aesthetics of the structure either. Good purchase!",

Its super build quality with two straps, gave solid stability to canopy. It did not move an inch in windy gust. Usually I do lot or research before I buy any product.

We used them at the beach for our tent and they were very easy to fill with sand for the week and empty afterwards making them easier to travel with regarding weight and space. Should be interesting when we don\u2019t have sand at the ballpark.",

I've only had them 3 days but the last 2 days have been very windy and the canopy has not moved. I would buy again.",

Two per chair seems to do the trick, although time will tell. The sandbags I used previously (which eventually disintegrated) held more sand than these do. But I'm very satisfied at this point with these. The velcro ties actually attach well to the base of this particular type of chair. The fabric seems quite sturdy.",
