      "verdict": "The Under Armour Charged 24/7 NM is a modern sneaker with a classic look that has earned many an owner a compliment. Its structured design hides highly functional features that include superior shock absorption, breathability, durability, and cushioning.The shoe\u2019s full-length non-marking sole provides great traction on many surfaces while the light padding on the insole makes the shoe perfect for all-day wear. The only complaints against the sneaker are that it is smaller than standard sizing and provides very little in the way of arch support.",

I ordered an 8 to try on and compare and then I will return one. I love these shoes. Super cute and very light weight and I love the color. Great shoe and I don't think there will need to be any \"break-in\" time because they are that comfortable! :-) My arches are not high, they are more on the lower side. This is my first pair of Under Armour and I am impressed!!",
