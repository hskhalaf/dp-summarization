Just what is needed for the SOHO environment. It replced my old NEC 870 printer which was a workhorse for 7.5 years before dying. I am so impressed by it that I am recommending it to all my friends.

The only problem with it is that it does not work with the 64-bit version of Windows 7. I just bought a new desktop and found to my dismay that I could not a driver for the MF3110 because of this issue. So buy it if you can find one - but check first to make sure your system is 32 bit.",

The copy function works quite well. I have not had occasion to use the scanner function much.

So if you are sure you will use old windows, and not upgrade to their latest poor product offering, then this printer is not too bad.",

    "description": "At home or at a small office, space is often a premium. Instead of getting a computer printer, a scanner, and a copier as three separate units, it might be wiser and more affordable to put all those functions together in one unit. That's the concept of a multifunction device. The Canon ImageClass MF3110 does all that and does it extremely well. With all the features you need for copying, printing and scanning, the imageCLASS MF3110 has the functions you need to keep pace in any busy office. Copy letter-size documents at a speed of 21 copies-per-minute and enjoy the same speed for your laser printing. Print resolutions run at 1200 x 600 dpi and copy resolutions runs at 600 x 600 dpi for sharp production. A color scanner with CCD technology ensures that scanned images are more true to the original using up to 1200 x 2400 dpi optical to 9600 x 9600 dpi interpolated resolutions at up to 48-bit color depth. Scanned documents can input directly to your computer (scan editing software is included). \n\n The printer itself is monochrome - printing grayshades. It uses a fast reliable laser print mechanism that's quiet and sharp. The included X25 cartridge has an up to 2500 page printing capacity, far greater than most ink cartridges. That means more prints at a lower cost. So for home biz or small biz, the Canon MF3110 is a high value product that you'll love to own and use. When space and productivity are significant issues, the MF3110 is truly a best buy in this class. Included software on CD - Canon driver for Windows, ScanSoft OmniPage SE (OCR), NewSoft Presto!
