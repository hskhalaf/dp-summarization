Resident Evil 0 was the first RE game I beat and I can't wait to play Resident Evil remastered for the first time! Ol' skool RE. It's one disc but each game installs separately on your hard drive. And it doesn't install like other games I have. So keep that in mind and you can play offline. I haven't played this origins collection yet but if it's remastered and if the disc work. This easily get 5 stars. Thank you, Capcom. I wish those Silent Hill people would remaster those games for present and future consoles. Just saying....",

My wife and kids got this new HD version for me for Father's Day and I love it! Its still creep and intelligent. I'm sure a lot of people like it for the \"killing zombies\" aspect but I always liked it most for the problem and puzzle solving aspects, and the storytelling. The first RE was a great game and this is made even better to enjoy of HD TVs. Nicely done! Applauds. LOL",
