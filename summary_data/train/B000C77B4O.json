For a few times I had to re-type the WEP, which was inconvenient and worried that I would have to do that all the time, but after awhile. it stopped and now just works very well. So, I'm very glad I bought it. Not only that the price is great!!!",

    "description": "Linksys Wireless-G Notebook Adapter with SRX 400 Wireless-G for your notebook with SRX technology provides up to 10 times faster wireless network throughput, reduces dead spots, and increases wireless range by up to 3 times. Also fully compatible with all public and private Wireless-G and Wireless-B networks. The Wireless-G Notebook Adapter with SRX400 is the simple way to add or upgrade wireless connectivity in your notebook computer. Just slide it into your notebook's PC Card slot and enjoy high-speed wireless network access while retaining true mobility. The Wireless-G Notebook Adapter with SRX400 combines smart antenna technology with standards-based Wireless-G (802.11g) networking. By overlaying the signals of two Wireless-G compatible radios, the \"Multiple In, Multiple Out\" (MIMO) technology effectively doubles the data rate. Unlike ordinary wireless networking technologies that are confused by signal reflections, MIMO actually uses these reflections to increase the range and reduce \"dead spots\" in the wireless coverage area. The robust signal travels farther, maintaining wireless connections up to 3 times farther than standard Wireless-G. With SRX, the farther away you are, the more speed advantage you get, and SRX400 works great with standard Wireless-G and -B equip\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe Wireless-G Notebook Adapter with SRX400 is the simple way to add or upgrade wireless connectivity in your notebook computer. Just slide it into your notebook's PC Card slot and enjoy high-speed wireless network access while retaining true mobility. \n\n The Wireless-G Notebook Adapter with SRX400 combines smart antenna technology with standards-based Wireless-G (802.11g) networking. By overlaying the signals of two Wireless-G compatible radios, the \"Multiple In, Multiple Out\" (MIMO) technology effectively doubles the data rate. Unlike ordinary wireless networking technologies that are confused by signal reflections, MIMO actually uses these reflections to increase the range and reduce \"dead spots\" in the wireless coverage area. The robust signal travels farther, maintaining wireless connections up to 3 times farther than standard Wireless-G. \n\n With SRX, the farther away you are, the more speed advantage you get, and SRX400 works great with standard Wireless-G and -B equipment, and other flavors of Linksys SRX. But when both ends of the wireless link are SRX400, the network can increase the throughput even more by using twice as much radio band, yielding speeds up to 10 times as fast as standard Wireless-G -- faster than 10/100 wired network speeds! But unlike other speed-enhanced technologies, SRX400 can dynamically enable this double-speed mode for SRX400 devices, while still connecting to non-SRX400 wireless devices at their respective fastest speeds. And SRX400 is a \"good neighbor\", always checking for other wireless devices in the area before gobbling up the radio band. \n\n Once you're connected, you can keep in touch with your e-mail, access the Internet, and share files and other resources such as printers and network storage with other computers on the network, wherever you wander. At home, you can surf the web or use instant messaging to chat with friends while sitting out on the patio. You'll also be able to connect with any of the growing number of public hotspots springing up in coffee shops, airport lounges, hotels and convention centers. Your wireless connection is protected by industrial-strength WPA encryption. The included Setup Wizard will walk you through configuring the adapter to your network's settings, step by step. \n\n Get your notebook connected to Wireless-B, Wireless-G, and SRX wireless networks with the Wireless-G Notebook Adapter with SRX400 from Linksys.\n\nSee more",
