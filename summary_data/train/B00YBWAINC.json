The ebike's voltage is 48v, but the batteries in the other buyer's also got.. isn't correct. 2 12v batteries are 24v. Weigh 26lbs and you need 48v. Buy a Toro battery at home depot for $129. Get a good compatible charger, save yourself the time. Order a rack for the controller and batteries, get a quick connect (plug) installed and you are set. Not thrilled about the lack of information on the trouble shoot page, and no way, to reach customer service, until you return the two lead batteries. Happy Trails",
