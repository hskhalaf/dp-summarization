They look really clean after I use and wash them. Some bowls just never get really clean looking. Maybe those ones are made from cheaper metal. These bowls are substantial enough to stay put even when I have to use some force to crush tomatoes or mix thick batters. Darn good bowls. All the caps fit well, too.",

I could also press on the bottom the bowl and hear and feel the metal popping in and out. Not great quality, so back it went for a refund. Dissapointing! If I could be assured that this was a fluke, I might consider re-ordering. I really liked the non-slip bottom, and the measure marks on the inside of the bowls. Nice features, poor quality.

With these bowls, they bounce back because of the rubber bottom, which makes them less likely to tip over. I love the measurements included on the inside of the bowls, which makes cooking prep a little easier. The matching lids included in the set make storage in the fridge very convenient. Also, the sellers send quirky thank you emails, which made buying these items an extra joy. Definitely would recommend.",

I put the bowls and the lids through the dishwasher on low heat (as per manufacturer's instructions). Bowls came through fine but the lids have warped and won't seal anymore. I recommend that the lids be handwashed only. I'm ordering another set and those lids won't be put in the dishwasher.",
