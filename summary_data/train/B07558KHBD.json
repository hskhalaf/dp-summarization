In the mean time I had to tape a Noctua to the outside of the unit for it to function.",

The best thing is that you can manage your brew from anywhere with your app, and it'll update you and let you know if there are any problems. Also, if you have more than one person that wants to brew you can have multiple people logged into the app. If you want to brew easily, GET THIS! Worth the money!",
