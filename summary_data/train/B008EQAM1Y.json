But when I used this, it evenly mixed the dressing on the veggies. I didn\u2019t even use too much dressing to ensure it\u2019s all covered. Anyway, bottom line .. great purchase!

I put the ball of yarn in the bowl. Loop the yarn down through the \"J\" channel and feed it up through the hole. Keeps my yarn in place while knitting and is a wonderful looking bowl.
