I wasn\u2019t sure if I should at first; there were a lot of comments saying how messy it was when it arrived, and how it wasn\u2019t packaged well which caused parts to break. Thankfully that was not the case for me at all! It shipped very quickly and when I opened it everything was wrapped in plastic- no flying pastels or messes anywhere! There were no broken parts, scratches, or missing pieces, just beautiful paints and tools. :) I still can\u2019t believe what a good price it was too, it comes with so much. I definitely would recommend this!",

The construction was either poorly done or did not allow for natural particle board absorption of moisture. Additionally, the otter case wood was cracked in two places. Not a quality item. Returning the replacement and will look elsewhere for our art supply needs.",

      "text": "This set has all the most common means of creating art objects such as oil paints, acrylics, charcoal, colored crayons, pencils, etc. I found the selection of materials to be excellent. There is one star missing, and that is because when the set was delivered, the wrapping was loose and some of the things were out of place. It's like somebody opened it, peeked in it and closed it up half-way really quick. The wrapping should be the next point of concentration for this company. Otherwise, I highly recommend this art set.",
