It IS NOT a direct fit in that application (nor does it claim to be), but it's the closest fitting model available. The hub size and the snap-ring are a perfect match, but the holes for the pull-pin to drop into on the trailer plate need to be enlarged in the direction of the hub. I used a grinding wheel on my dremel and greased everything thoroughly afterwards. Worked great! The quality of the wheel and jack itself is very good. I tried the Reese first ,and it was junk in comparison (and didn't line up as closely)",

Nice that the new one has zerk grease fittings and seems to be made of slightly better materials than the original (from 2001).",

At first I was not impressed, it seemed to not want to spin but once I shot it with grease it has been working fine. I greased both on the zirk fitting that comes on it and I opened the top and fed some grease in there too.",

It has a grease fitting and that's a nice feature but the fitting broke off the very first time I put a grease gun on it after install. Two pumps and it snapped off like it was made of glass. Funny how this simple, nice feature, spoiled my otherwise good product review. Other than the cheap grease fitting, it's a nice trailer jack for the money.",
