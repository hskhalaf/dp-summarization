This is genuinely unsafe and I could have gotten hurt. I'm returning these and getting Shimano pedals instead.",

Upon further inspection, we discovered that the crank threads had been stripped by the pedals. We looked more closely at the pedal itself and discovered that it had been poorly manufactured - off center hex key hole and undersized diameter post. We immediately took the bike back to the Trek store and they confirmed that the crack set was permanently damaged by the pedals and we had to replace the entire crank assembly. This repair cost $65.99. I sent several emails to RaceFace - and they simply ignored me.",

A casual passerby could mistake them for cheap plastic pedals. Functionality: The dimensions of the platforms are perfect and feel great underfoot. They are super grippy and almost feel like your feet are locked in. They\u2019re also pretty light, weighing significantly less than the metal ones they replaced.

      "text": "A tuber regularly suggests these pedals so I took the bait and replaced the stock pedals from my Cannondale Trail 4. No slips after putting approximately 30 miles on these pedals in rocky, muddy western pa trails. I'm a bigger guy and needed a wide platform that would hold up. So far so good. I've bashed rocks and stumps without damaging the nylon body. Great in dry or wet conditions. If my opinion changes, I'll update my review.",

However, between the pair, there were a handful of pegs where the embedded retention nut would spin freely when attempting to adjust the height of the pegs. I was barely able to use a set of pliers to grip enough of the exposed nut in order to make the desired adjustment. Not ideal. Would've otherwise been 5 stars.",

The best part is that they use a socket head cap screw as opposed to a set screw, so the part that wears down is the end of the thread and not the head where the hex wrench goes. This makes them easy to replace the grip screws. Also they stay black even after getting scratched unlike aluminum pedals which will show silver under the scratches.",

I've used these pedals for about 2 months now, wearing vans, converse, tennis shoes, and boots. My only complaint is that they sometimes do such a good job of sticking to my shoes that I can't easily adjust my feet while riding! We'll see how they wear over time but so far it's been great.",
