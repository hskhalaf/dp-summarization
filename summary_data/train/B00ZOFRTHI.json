It must have a no-slip sole & be comfy enough to wear from the moment I walk in until I go to bed at midnight. Yeah, found it. This is squishy, keeps my toes warm, and most importantly, has a waterproof sole so I can mop the floors in it. Granted, I\u2019ve only had them for a couple weeks, so I don\u2019t know how long they will last... but they seem durable. I promise you\u2019ll hear back if they don\u2019t make it past 6 months.

There is a decent amount of tread on the bottom, however, that doesn't mean they have great traction and even after only a couple of days they are showing signs of long term use already. But, you get what you pay for! These are a good value for how much they cost. Size runs about as expected.",

I have tile floors in my home and therefore I need something with a solid and supportive bottom. They were a bit stiff initially, but after wearing they move better.

My feet tend to be cold all the time so that\u2019s important. These are shown to be indoor or outdoor slippers but while the bottoms are thick and non-slippery, they are more of a foam than a rugged bottom to walk outdoors much. They are perfect for walking out to check the mail or grab something from your car, etc., though. I like them!",

Fits perfectly!!! So yes, size up if you purchase these. The bottom i originally thought was rubber is just hard plastic. Im not sure the right term for it but at least you can wear them outside if need be. I have no complaints.",
