      "text": "All the other kids at my son's daycare have the cute OliveKids sleep mats, so I wanted to get him one of those, but I felt one and they were super thin, almost just like a centimeter of thin fluff. So I got this instead. It's not super thick like a mattress topper, but feels much more comfy than the others and I'm glad I got this one. It washes in the machine really well (just remove the pillow foam, which is easy to put back in). It's been through several washes now and still looks like new. It's not super cute, very plain, but I'd much rather my kid sleep on something comfortable than something cute :)",

It is thin but still has good support and comfortable. It also rolls up easy with a blanket inside as well.",

My toddler is jealous, and I'm about to order another one for her to use too!",

The part of the pillow rest tore but we use this often and wash it constantly it might be from normal wear and tear. Use it for 7 months when I saw the tear. Still a great product. We still use a 1 in rubber mat for extra cushioning on the hard floors.",
