I tried to locate the sharp object and was stabbed multiple times. I found that when I pulled the sharp pieces they did not come out. I had to rip open the jacket to remove them only to find 5 sharp broken needles inside my sleeve armhole. I'm appalled that the craftsmanship is so poor to quality control and make sure that this item is safe for customers. DO NOT BUY! SHARP NEEDLES SEWN INTO GARMENT! WIll return and never buy from again.",

It may look, feel, and has features (pockets, etc), but the material quality is on the lower end.

This jacket was perfect for keeping me warm. Also, I was concerned that it would be a tight fit, but I usually wear a small and I ordered a small. It fits well. If you\u2019re someone who enjoys a bit more room to layer clothing or just doesn\u2019t like their clothes to fit tightly to their body, order a size up. Overall, this jacket is way better than expected from an Amazon purchase.",

Other than that this jacket is great. Has five pockets to store personal items like an I\u2019d badge for work, tissues, cell phone, keys, etc. Is pretty light weight for the size as well.

      "text": "I didn't want to spend an arm and a leg on a ski jacket, so I did some research on amazon and this one had the best reviews and best bang for my buck. so I purchased it and I couldn't be more impressed!!! I could've gone with a small easily but chose to buy one size up (Medium) so that I had plenty of room for layers underneath. I'm 5'4, 140lb, athletic build. I love all the pockets, the fur/warmth on the inside, and the waist band that tightens to prevent snow from making it's way up your back if you fall :) overall VERY happy with this jacket!!!! highly recommend!!",

The furry lining is super warm around the body and hood, and the smooth material lining the sleeves helps for sliding bulky clothing layers down the sleeves without having your other layers bunch up to your elbows as you thread your arms through. For reference, I am 5'5\" and ~160 lbs (muscular build/not fluffy) and the MEDIUM fit like a dream...even with thermals, shirt, and thin vest underneath.",

I'm also 5 ft 2 inches, 118 lbs; I tried on the jacket and found it to be uncomfortable in the same area. Perhaps it's a one-time defect. Also, the material is a little on the loud (crinkly) side, but it might soften up with wear or a washing. The jacket is very nice otherwise.",

It's very big in the middle, the sleeves are short and it's just plain ugly in real life. Maybe people's standards have gone down, but this coat is not worth it imo. And it's made in China, I don't like supporting China and I missed that. Very disappointed. Will be sending it back.",

Sleeve length is perfect for me, though, and all things considered, I'm pleased as I recognise being a woman who is 6'2\" and 155 lbs ensures no garment will fit me flawlessly unless I have it tailored.
