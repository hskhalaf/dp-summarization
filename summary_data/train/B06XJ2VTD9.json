They quality is not great...it seems not to be sturdy material, and the pre-drilled assembly holes are in the wrong place. We are outside of the return window, so if they won't make an exception to accept a return, we will have to reinforce the highchair and re-drill the assembly holes. Not impressed.",

It has fallen off several times when my baby is in it and we've only used it for a few weeks. There's no way to adjust the height.
