      "text": "Bluetooth DOES NOT WORK! I used these headphones not even 5 times and the Bluetooth will not even turn on, not to mention it no longer charges. $500 for this? I am without words... I expected so much more. I own the S3 speaker (which also do not work as the speaker cannot handle bass without vibrating off the surface which it sits on) and the A9 which also drops the Bluetooth connection constantly and needs constant resetting. I will be looking at purchasing audio equipment from another company moving forward. There is nothing to be said either for B&O customer service, since you cant even get a phone number for them. SO VERY SAD.",

I've read here a lot of other users are experiencing the same problem as me! Save your dollars and put it else where! Sadly, there has been no resolution for this issue anywhere online either!

I don't care if the noise cancelling removes some of the fidelity from the sound - on board an air plane I care more about removing background noise and crying babies. The entertainment systems don't really provide high fidelity sound anyway. No problems with blue-tooth works perfectly on my Linux laptop by the way. I'm 110% happy with this things - and then it looks stylish. Btw. the sound of these things when playing high fidelity sound is incredible .... the bass is rich and trebles are perfect.",
