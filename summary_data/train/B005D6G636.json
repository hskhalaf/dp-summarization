X 8 ft. heavy-ply pond liner is in pieces, and I'm totally trashed, but the shears aren't. They're still sharp. That's beyond bad*ss. I'm buying another pair right now, in case they ever stop making them.",

These are large, soft handled, fairly sharp scissors, with reasonably good leverage. However, if you use them to e.g. cut apart a chicken, they are a pain to clean since the blades do not come apart (gunk gets caught down where the blades attach to each other). Therefore, they are not ideal kitchen scissors. FYI, putting sharp blades (knives, scissors) in the dishwasher will dull them considerably. Therefore, while these are technically dishwasher safe, cleaning these (or any sharp blades) in the dishwasher is not a good idea.",
