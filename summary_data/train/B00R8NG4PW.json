    "description": "Hoka Conquest 2 CONQUER YOUR QUEST Known for its stability, the Conquest 2 features the right blend of technologies, implemented to improve balance and control. Lyrca ComfortFrame Upper. For 2016, the Conquest 2 receives an update upper, with a focus on lightweight comfort. Implementing a protective single mesh construction allows air to permeate the shoe, generating an environment that is both cool and dry. Consisting of a full Lyrca ComfortFrame utilising lycra fibres, enables the shoe to possess excellent stretch and recovery measures. This inclusion allows the shoes to conform to all aspects of the feet whilst maintaining shape once inactive. Hoka infuse seamless supportive overlays which provide necessary stabilisation around the midfoot from medial to lateral. A seamless interior environment to the Valor reduces irritation and blistering, as well as the number of potential weak points throughout the shoe that would otherwise be prone to tearing or breakage. A softer, lightly padded tongue merged onto the upper provides increased protection and comfort across the foot. Full Length CMEVA Midsole. The Conquest utilises two technologies within the midsole: full length CMEVA, provides industry leading cushioning for increased impact protection and stability. Add to that R-MAT and this technology works diligently to further increase cushioning, whilst remaining dully resilient. Specifically engineered with a low heel-toe differential and a sculpted outsole radius, the Conquest delivers a more responsive ride without sacrificing its well accustomed cushioning properties. Hoka shoes offer a unique rolling motion for the most natural, efficient and effortless stride. To achieve these results this has an extended profile; a logarithmic shape for a smooth progressive rolling motion. There is unsurpassed shock attenuation, a sense of weightlessness and an inherently stable ride which is designed to reduce the fatigue in your feet, legs and core. R-MAT Grip Outsole. The",
