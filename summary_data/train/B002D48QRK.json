I think it does a good job retexurising the skin, its softer and smoother. My dislike for it is that is way to greasey and sticky, it feels uncomfortable. I live in the Caribbean and use it only at night and the feel is just to heavy for my skin. I have used other glycolic creams and didnt have this problem If you live in a colder climate then go right ahead and give it a try.",
