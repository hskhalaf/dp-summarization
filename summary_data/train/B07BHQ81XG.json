Here it's about quantity and size. She carries her Big Surprise Ball from last year with some of her dolls inside and I'm sure we'll use this one the same way. I love the sparkly pink (and durable) plastic case; makes picking all the tiny pieces and storing them easier. All in all Well worth getting them something so thrilling to unwrap.",

She was disappointed with the outfits not fitting right..myself and her parents did not like the family sticker included in the top of case was what you find unwrapping, blew the surprise of the dolls. We also did not like the images portrayed from the clothing being short outfits covered in glitter...poor clothing choices even for dolls. Inappropriate!",

      "text": "My girls love these- so as far the toy itself- it was perfect\u2014 but for me- I think it\u2019s a ridiculous amount of plastic trash that is generated- they should switch to biodegradable papers or tissues to wrap it all\u2014 the entire thing generates 90% plastic waste while you save 10% of the tiny toys.. that\u2019s my only reservation. I\u2019m an era of parents and kids giving up plastic straws and other plastics- this toy is just a giant ball of plastic trash- mostly all nonuseable wrappings..",

Lots of pieces come with the set making it worth the money. Negative- each little piece inside is individually wrapped so that means lots of garbage. The container is also a little bulky but you don\u2019t necessarily have to keep it after purchase. Overall it\u2019s a great purchase for your LOL lover.",
