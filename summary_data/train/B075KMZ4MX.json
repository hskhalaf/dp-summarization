I love that keyboard but I found myself missing the feel of membrane keys. I decided to give this keyboard a shot and immediately fell in love with it. It has a soft feel and the key presses are very quiet compared to mechanical switches. This has a 1000hz polling rate too making it very responsive. I have been using this for a little while now and it has become my daily driver. Excellent membrane key based keyboard!",

If you like RGB keyboards, this is a great choice. If you want a keyboard that is good to type a lot on, look elsewhere. This keyboard is for gaming, and that's about it. For $40 I would recommend it for strictly gaming, but besides that, I find it hard to recommend for more than that or for more general applications.",

I am a software developer, data analyst, student, and author. So I type. A lot. This keyboard is very cool with the Razer Synapse software, in terms of the colors and effects. It is durable, and spill-resistant. But most importantly, it is very comfortable to type on. I love it, and the ability to change/customize macros and keys is very useful for me. Overall, I would give more than 5 stars if I could. Way to go, Razer. Very happy.",

Since every key is individually lit, it is very easy to set different keys for different colors if you have a preference.

      "text": "It's pretty much everything you'd want in an LED backlit keyboard at this price point. Only two issues, one is the software, it can be a little inconsistent and sometimes requires a restarting the program once or twice or redownloading the whole thing, but once it works, it works, at least until the next major update, but all in all this only effects the colors. The other thing is that you can, or at least I can, hear a faint high pitch hum from the keyboard itself when connected to my laptop. It doesn't seem to be present with my desktop so it could be a power supply issue, but still, it's odd.",

But for some unknown reason, contrary to every keyboard I have ever used (and contrary to what is shown in the picture of this product), keys that have multiple functions when used with shift are printed backwards. Example: The 1 is also the ! when shifted, but the 1 is on top of the key, rather than the ! All the symbols on the keys are like that. As I tend to look at the keys rather the screen (habit of a bad typist, I know), it confuses me sometimes. Totally happy with the performance, though, so I gave it 5 stars.",

I don't think much of the \"extra\" features, while some of them, like the audio visualizer, are fun, they all require installing some ridiculous Razer bloatware that always runs in the background. The ability to sync the backlights with the game's audio is underwhelming and only seems to work with a few recent games. Still, a decent and hopefully durable keyboard for the money.",
