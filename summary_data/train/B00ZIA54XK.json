On occasion I have invisible bugs whereby Razer Synapse won't register the device properly so I can't adjust sound.

Additionally, there is a faint static noise a few seconds after there is no sound playing, sometimes it would not go away after removing the USB; I switched USB slots but the problem continued. The headset is also unsuitable for those with big heads. The quality of the microphone is also relatively low. Since then I have replaced them with Sennheiser Game One and I could not be happier.",

Overall i think that the Razer Kraken 7.1 chroma's are Beautiful designed with outstanding sound and mic quality I will definitely rate this a 5/5.",

For the price it's a good bit of kit. The earpieces are comfortable if a little small, and it does not isolate external sound as effectively as some cheaper brands. The braided cable is like a ticking clock... Only annoying when you become aware of it. So when immersed in music or game it's not an issue.",
