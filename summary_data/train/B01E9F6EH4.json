This was actually $10 cheaper than the website (risky on amazon, I Know!) But within 2 days, 4 applications, I started to see a very noticeable difference. Healing and much reduction in irritation. feels great on my skin! I actually ordered the 3 piece travel set so I could try the other 2 products. My skin is irritated if I travel and use different water, so the fact that this worked quickly holds promise!",

I\u2019m also able to confidently leave the house with little to no makeup which I wouldn\u2019t have done a year ago! This product truly has changed my life.

I have been using this serum for less than a week and already see results -- the existing outbreak stopped, the scars are starting to clear up, and no new outbreaks out started yet. Definitely a fan!",

      "The Blemish Control Problem: The best acne treatments rely on high concentrations of ingredients like benzoyl peroxide to dry up pimples quickly.
