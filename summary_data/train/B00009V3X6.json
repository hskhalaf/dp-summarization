It didn't take long to realize that we wanted the exact same type that had been original in the motorhome. It microwaves wonderfully and bakes beautifully.",

I don\u2019t understood the other reviews that rate it lower. None of the units I have owned ever failed. I use a coach more than half a year for my business travel. All my cooking is done with it. Looking back at past 20 years of service the cost of ownership is 8 cents a day. I have zero complaints.",

It\u2019s sleek sharp look fits great into our modern RV and once you have a convection oven in a RV, you can\u2019t ever go back to just a microwave. We spent a little more for this unit but with the quality and warranty you just can\u2019t lose. We\u2019ve had other Sharp appliances and it\u2019s products just lasts not like the brands who\u2019s appliances are like buying disposable products that you have to replace every other year. After using this in our RV I had to have one in our home too! I highly recommend & give this oven 10 stars!!! Thank you!",

Really like the overall size of this oven as the compartment is large enough for cookie sheets, but it was shorter than other over-the-range microwaves, which allows for more room between the microwave and the range. So far, the microwave cooking has been a welcome improvement and the functions are easy to use (some auto functions, but easy manual operations as well). We are still learning about the convection oven, but it has been really nice not to have to use the full oven and heat the entire kitchen when we are crisping items like egg rolls or crispy chicken snacks.",
