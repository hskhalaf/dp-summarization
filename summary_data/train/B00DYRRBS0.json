      "text": "I needed a steamer pot to steam a larger amount of potatoes & veggies. I follow the Medical Medium diet plan which suggest cooked food be steamed to hold in the nutrients. First I bought a common folding steamer type basket. It just didn\u2019t hold enough. This Al Clad steamer was pricey but it\u2019s proved worth it. Well made & large, I can steam plenty of potatoes & veggies. It also holds plenty of water. Enough water to steam larger potatoes which take 40min. The lid is heavy & makes a nice seal. I\u2019ve had it for 3months & use it almost everyday.",

It is made in China. There is nowhere in the description that says so. The quality isn't there. I realize it's not as expensive as the made in USA cookware, but the reason why should be clear in the description. All-Clad should not wait for the customer to find out by wading through the reviews or by finding the small \"Made In China\" printed on the box, and the absence of \"Handcrafted in the USA\" on the bottom of the pan. I'm sending it back.",

Made in China. The bottom pot is only for boiling water and does not need to have a boat anchor glued to the bottom (probably needed to cheapen construction or perhaps as a counterweight to the top due to the nonfunctional curved shape). It looks nice when new, but daily use is unpleasant and metals are questionable. Better handles would be nice, if not essential.",
