It was in the open with plenty of ventilation and nothing touching it and has been treated correctly since day one. Had this happened over the holiday or at night it could have caught fire and burned the school down. I'll never purchase an RCA product again and RCA should be ashamed of themselves! I'm thankful someone caught it in time! DO NOT BUY!!",
