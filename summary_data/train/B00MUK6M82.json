If you are in doubt do it two or three times and take the highest number! It's super quick so the kids can sleep through it too.

It doesn't sound like a big deal but when your son has a fever of 104, you need to know every point is accurate. I'd be curious to know if anyone found an ear thermometer that was more accurate than this one.",
