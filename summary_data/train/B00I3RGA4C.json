      "verdict": "The turf version of the Diadora Capitano promises an optimal comfort as well as outstanding performance on the pitch. Featuring a natural leather upper which is comparable to the one used on the Adidas Copa Mundial FG, this soccer cleat guarantees excellent ball touch that helps players get ahead in the game. It also integrates the Diadora's shock absorbent system on its midsole. \u00a0It is designed to provide protection and heightened comfort. Though a less pricey cleat, this Diadora cleat does not compromise on features.",
      "pros": [
        "A good number of commenters praised the Diadora Capitano LT Turf for its high-quality leather upper",
        "Like the classic Adidas Copa Mundial, this cleat is another proof how users love leather materials",
        "Some users who tested the soccer cleat said that it showed excellent grip on the turf",
        "A few purchasers appreciated the beautiful design of the turf cleat",
        "Based on the observation of some players, these turf cleats break in quickly"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "Most female users found the Capitano LT Turf to run a bit too wide",
        "Some reviewers criticized the thin insole of the cleat, mentioning that it lacked support",
        "A few users reported getting toe blisters after trying out the cleat",
        "According to some observers, these soccer cleats have quite a stiff sole"

      "text": "Do not buy this shoe. I've played soccer for over 30 years and worn many different shoes over the years. This was easily one of the worst I've ever purchased. The fit was nearly a full size too big, which was annoying enough, but the far bigger problem was that the soles literally came apart and fell off after a single indoor session. I did not have high expectations given the price, but this was unacceptable. I reached out to Diadora to report the problem and got no response whatsoever. I expected more out of Diadora, which has been a solid soccer brand for decades. They certainly failed to deliver with this product. Do not buy.",
