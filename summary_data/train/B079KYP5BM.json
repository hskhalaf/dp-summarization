There was some dirty bandage on the side of my box, not the shipped box But it\u2019s actual box inside, and the opening of the box was ripped like someone had opened it previously impatiently! For the dirty microbes/viruses sent to my address, plus the used item I was generous enough to give it 4 stars!",

Some of the foam padding is separating a little, but doesn\u2019t impact the comfort or usability. If it gets worse, I\u2019ll update my review, but so far I\u2019m pleased with the quality.",
