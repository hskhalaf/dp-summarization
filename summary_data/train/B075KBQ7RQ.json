If you are used to lights that work via Wi-Fi or zigbee, these Sylvania lights may seem extremely slow to you. The range and response time of Bluetooth is not great. My Sylvania lights are in the same space as my Apple TV, and I still frequently experience unresponsiveness. It\u2019s really noticeable when I use the lights in automations. During automations, I often get errors in HomeKit because the Sylvania lights respond so slowly. If response time is important to you, definitely look at other lights that use Wi-Fi or zigbee.",

The have the most latency of all my Homekit devices. It's frustrating when I want to change the color and it takes 30 seconds to respond. Sylvania, please update the firmware or app! Also, the power supply and control box seem a little clunky. They could have made a much smaller, usb connected power supply. I have purchased three of these and extra led strips. I trust the strip quality more than competitor offerings.",

I get maybe 1 to 2 second response times if I havn't changed the light in a while, but after that it responds immediately. Overall I'm plenty satisfied with this light, especially since its half the price of most other lights. If they would fix the adhesive issue then I would gladly give it 5 starts!",

You can use Siri to activate and change colors although the color change Siri makes might not be accurate, so manual customization and saving your favorites is the way to go.

The 3M adhesive double tape is poor, but I knew that from the reviews. It is probably some fake 3M tape. The worst part is the three lights malfunctioned. They don't display all the colours, and stand out, for example, if the strip is programmed to pink, those three bulbs will be in blue. I just wish I could get my money back - I spent more money on adhesive and I still can't use these. My OCD kicks in and I can't have those 3 lights in a different colour!",
