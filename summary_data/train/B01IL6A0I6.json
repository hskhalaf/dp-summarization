So product is next to useless until I figure out a safe method to secure the band's to under or over the door.",

They barely fit the straps so you have to wrestle with hooking them up each time to get the handle attachment to fit in the carabiner. The metallic parts are also not smooth so I have cut myself on them. It's just stupid. They are made by people who don't frequently use these products or care about the user experience.",

These things don't provide anywhere near 80 lbs of resistance for typical use. Maybe that's their breaking point or something. Or maybe if you connect them to a wall 12 feet away and start your reps with them stretched to twice their length, they might provide the resistance they're rated at. Aside from that, I'd actually give this set a good rating. They're not bad overall. I just cannot give a good rating to a product that doesn't even come close to meeting expectations based on the product description.",

Pros: - They seem to be well made. - The door attachment actually fits in doors. It's great. Others tend to be too big. Cons: - Amazon lists each color by approximate resistance weight. The packaging doesn't mention those numbers anywhere. - The handgrips are awful. They are way too small which results in the rough side material rubbing on your hands at all times. The padding is thin and the grips starts to feel hard.",

      "text": "I got the tribe resistance band set rated at 150 lbs. it arrived on time and seems to be a sturdy set. the resistance is good and allows for most exercises I do at the gym on cable machines. pull downs and overhead pulling exercises are the exception since I am doing at home and do not have high rafters or some way to secure them overhead. most exercises can be secured to a closed door or underfoot and I am satisfied. I have just gotten these two days ago so I cannot comment on the long term durability but they seem to be built well at this point. I would recommend them based on my experience so far.",

You can perform pretty much any lift with these bands that you can with a dumbbell set for a fraction of the price. The resistance is easy to adjust, by attaching any combination of the bands together. Each band is labeled with its resistance weight, so they are easy to figure out. If you connect them all together, you will end up with some pretty decent resistance. I plan to order another set, so I will have even more options for training. I highly recommend these, for anyone looking for an affordable yet effective training option.",
