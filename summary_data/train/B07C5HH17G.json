TechnoMaster (the seller), nor Amazon will honor any warranty. Huawei is telling us the phone is an \"international\" Huawei phone, meaning it was not made by the USA division of Huawei and therefore, Huawei will not honor the 12 month warranty on their phone! In other words, we blew $300 on a phone that lasted four months. This is horrible business practice and we will NEVER purchase an unlocked phone from Amazon or any third party again. After 30 days you are are out of luck and money!",

I finally talked to Huawei and they told me that this phone is only supposed to be an international model not meant for the USA or Canada because it doesn't run on the same bandwidths so you're never going to have decent service. Yeah. Amazon doesn't say any of this in the listing. Bottom line: I returned the phone and got my money back.",

HOWEVER this phone will not work on anything but AT&T and T-Mobile towers so dont expect great coverage everywhere. ALSO the camera uses a 4:3 ratio and most apps use a 18:9 ratio so it crops the image on snapchat and zooms it in too much for my liking. If you can deal with these issues it is a great cheap phone.",
