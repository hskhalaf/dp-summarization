      "text": "Just received these today and I am already sending them back.I have had several pairs of Keens in the past but these are nowhere near the quality of my past Keens. Firstly the soles look like they were molded of the cheapest possible material and just have a shiny plastic like look. The top layer of material around the ankles is too small and I could tell they after a few hours of wear would irritate and eventually cause blisters. Finally the color...the description says Brown and in the picture they are clearly brown but in person they have a very green cast. Sadly I think I'm done with Keen.",

The tongue is made using two pieces of leather and this seems to be thicker on the same shoe in the same area. I have worn them for over a week and the shoes are broken in and still no change. I have a pair of Austin shoes that are made better than these and the fit is perfect. I have gone back to wearing them.",

The last pair of boots I had lasted me over 5 years and I only replaced them because the soles were flat at this point. I have purchased 5 or 6 pairs of Keen boots and sandals through the years, and this is the first time that I have had an issue like this with their products. I have submitted a warranty claim with the company and I hope they make good on the product. But until then, I will let you know that the quality is not good.",

I've purchased many keen shoes in the past, as it's my go-to brand, but these shoes have a very narrow tolerance for my wide feet, and my somehow high bridge. They were tight in all the wrong places.",

Keen refused to repair or replace them under warranty. I paid a lot of money for a shoe that didn't even last half a year.",
