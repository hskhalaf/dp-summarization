Then we had multiple leaks at night which never happened with the diapers purchased from the actual store because the tab would tear off in the night and the diaper would be half off in the morning. This may be more convenient, but the quality of these versus the ones you buy from like walmart is night and day and they cost the same so that's unfortunate.",

They are thinner front to back, and that has allowed for more airflow and relief for her little behind.",

My child is 28lbs and I was looking for a diaper that would wrap his entire waist so that he wouldn\u2019t leak from the side. Well, the waistline is tight for a 28 pounder child. I would definitely recommend upping the size and buying size 6 instead although it says size 6 is for 35lbs +.",
