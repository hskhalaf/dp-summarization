      "text": "*** Update **** After maybe 10 minutes of gentle use, some of the paint is buckling and peeling? Still handsome chairs but this isn't the distressed vintage look. This is paint that doesn't stick to the wood. I posted a photo. ----- Original review ---- As others are saying, these are very well-made and the color is beautiful. It's not the bright green that the product photo shows, a much nicre muted blue/green. They are very nicely and gently distressed to look vintage and I'm very impressed. Highly recommend. Not too hard to put together either. I bought an allen bit set for my power drill and now I don't need to use those tiny allen wrenches they always provide.",

The design is very sturdy, enough for my kids to stand and hop from one seat to the next on a daily basis despite the cautionary commentary from Mom and for some pretty big bottoms that tend to plop instead of sit gently. Great price, great product. I would recommend these and will probably be buying one more set.",

Seems like Ashley really dropped the ball when it comes to quality control. There is one place on the seat of one of my chairs that looks like a screw hole has been puttied over and not sanded down. You can see it thru the paint. I plan to use cushions so it won\u2019t be seen, but still... I\u2019m disappointed in Ashley for letting this one ship from the factory.

One bar stool is totally assembled, the other half assembled, and the box has been broken down and recycled. No other option was given. I use Amazon daily! This is very disappointing!",
