Fine for children, too small for adults. Owned a great double chair previously, but it split and ripped in two places after many many uses. Back to square one looking for a new double chair, probably have to give this one away, can't return it now, can't sit in it for more than 5 minutes without wanting to get out of it.",

I'd suggest you take an extra pillow to sit on, and perhaps this would be helpful over longer-term use (i.e. 2 hour outdoor concerts). Materials appear sturdy, and the carrying case is appropriate.
