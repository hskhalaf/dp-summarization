It is in a living room and the sub woofer kept making a popping sound so I sent it back for repair. Yamaha covered the repair, but I had to pay over $50 to ship it to them. I received it back after being \"refurbished\" and now the sub woofer will not pair with the sound bar, so essentially it doesn't work.",

After way too much research ordered the Yamaha. My opinion..... Bluetooth may or may not work, do not care. Listened to some music from Pandora and sound was good, sub woofer can vibrate the walls. But the real deal was the clarity which was much better than the $150 sound bar that was replaced. No longer had to increase the sound to catch dialogue. Very senior friendly. Remote easy to use. Has made listening much easier.",

They had me ship them some info and the cords ($14.93), and they say they will send a replacement. Huge pain! Update: The new unit they sent was also not getting sound out of the subwoofer, so I followed their \"horrible\" directions. This sub is also stuck on standby. Hoping when their support opens on Monday I can get a refund and send this thing to the dumpster. If you have to buy yamaha get the 107 with the sub that has a physical output connection.",

Yamaha makes excellent musical instruments so I was hoping to see the same type of quality with a piece of their sound equipment. So far so good. The bass can be a bit muddy at times and I've had to play with the sub-woofer here and there. This may be due to the audio signal at the input though. It looks good and was extremely easy to set up. No issues with the sub-woofer pairing to the soundbar either. The one improvement I would like to have seen is an on/off switch on the sub-woofer too. Overall though it's not a bad unit.",

The bar does sound good, has volume that will be acceptable to most people, and is affordable. The bar can not create sound spacing anything close to a real surround system with positioned speakers. It does create a slightly deeper field than just three speakers in front of you, but no where close to sounding like things are behind, beside, or above you. If you are limited on space or don't want to install multiple speakers it is a good compromise, especially for the price.",

Even for $500 or less, you're not going to find a better system, it blows my previous Samsung unit away. Take care.",

The sound bar produces a very clean sound with a lot of \"body\" for explosions and other loud sounds. While it may not be a true surround sound speaker system, the sound coming from the bar is very robust and feels like it is wrapping around you. I would highly recommend this setup for anyone with a smaller room or who doesn't want to run a bunch of speaker wire!",

It has detail, Spatiality and warmth with a good degree of adjustment potential for midrange. Originally, purchased this Yamaha YAS207 and used it for 3 days. Based on Yamaha experience. The bass is deep and powerful, but the sound bar seemed to project a thin, \"tin can\" like sound for all voices and background details. It took a while to really blend the voice and background sounds, with the bass, but it always sounded thin and cold with too much emphasis on voices. I'm bummed. Yamaha YAS207 wasn't for me. For $300 there are better options.",

It has great sound when working properly, unfortunately it seems to be random at which times it will work and when it won\u2019t.",

I would agree with those reviews. Easy set up, the wireless sub-woofer is even better than most wired ones i've heard before. Makes it much easier to hide. The sound bar, while using the 3-D sound, makes it sounds like you have a full set of surround sound speakers. I'm one to be skeptical of these sound \"enhancements\", but this is worth it.

Warranty only covers it for 1 year, and it's $75 plus shipping of old unit to get a refurbished one back. The setup in my opinion could be a bit more straightforward with better instructions, and the software update made a nice improvement to the sound quality. In general, the Yamaha Yas 207 sound system did a great job of providing quality sound in my living. I was however not impressed with how it interacted with my Amazon Fire Cube. My biggest annoyance is the sound bar going completely dead after just 1 year.",

I find the Realtek Audio Manager equalizer helps out a good deal in getting the sound to an acceptable quality, but there is definitely no problem with the volume levels. It can get quite loud.
