I want the really fine creamy texture & don't want to do much to increase the curd size. So back to cheesecloth. I did make a large batch of chicken stock and it strained beautifully - crystal clear stock. It also works well for sauces and custards. So although the yogurt was a bit disappointing, I'm still very pleased with this for all the other uses of a fine mesh strainer.",

To my disappointment I found it does not strain as fine as the Zimtal Nut Milk Bag I had been using. It has a bit larger capacity than the bag, but allows more of the yogurt to bleed through along with the whey, resulting in less of the finished product. The bag worked much better and I wish I hadn't wasted my money. In addition, it is a rarely used item that is a storage challenge. This purchase was an expensive lesson. I am going to buy a second nut milk bag and list the Matfer strainer for sale.",
