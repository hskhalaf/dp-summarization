Will not buy from Schwinn again, or rather Pacific Cycles. If you want a Stingray buy an original, it\u2019s what I plan to do. Those were built in Chicago and built to LAST. Lesson learned.",

Pedals are not the soft rubber. However, unless you are a 60 yo man Wanting your old bike, I think the riding and owning experience will be just fine and match that of yesteryear. Preassembly is substantial so you can quickly \u201cassemble\u201d but the bearings are not adjusted. If you want it smooth, adjust the locknuts and cones. Wheel quality is better than your average department store bike.",

The damage wasn\u2019t noticeable until it was completely removed from all packaging so it was obviously packaged this way by the manufacturer. For the cost of the bike, Schwinn should have much better quality control.

It was as if someone else received it and carelessly threw it back in the box. It had too many missing parts ie..dented nuts and bolts , it was also missing a foot pedal. QC was not an issue!!",
