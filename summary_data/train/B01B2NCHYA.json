And they are counter intuitive. Bottom line - donttask an engineer to design the user interface of anything. Ever.",

Dried it out, checked the seal, everything looked fine. 2 weeks after remounting it the time lapse footage stopped due to so much moisture inside the case. When I opened the case water dripped out. The battery compartment has battery acid every where now. It won't last outside. We lost a large amount of footage on this once in a lifetime construction project. I don't recommend using this on something outside that is important. Now looking for another solution, and quick! Every day we lose something special.",

What why I have tons of card readers but I will never have a windows computer again. So I sent it back due to there very old software!!! If I can\u2019t read my memory cards as I choose I will never buy your product again!!!",
