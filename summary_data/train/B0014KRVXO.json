This set along with your supply house thermostat screw driver are probably the tools you'll be grabbing the most. I thought I could replace both of these with that slide driver two in one tool, but these drivers can get into places that the other driver can't. So I removed the slide driver and put both of these in my Veto TP4 service pouch. They're Klein, that means quality, and these drivers don't disappoint. I've had zero issues with them and they perform flawlessly as expected.",

I was afraid of dropping things down into or under the washer and being unable to complete the repair on my own, but these tool were simply fantastic and held the tiny pieces securely until time to put them back after I replaced the valve.
