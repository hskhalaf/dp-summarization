If you baby has problems with constipation due to formula def give these a try. Our little girl is a totally different baby now!",

Our pedi prescribed a laxative immediately, but I wanted something natural that would help and only rely on the laxative when we really needed it. Unlike other reviewers my kid loves the taste (actually gets excited when he sees me pull out the bottle) - and it does seem to help if we are consistent. Our problems might require more help in the way of a probiotic, but this got us over the hump and made me feel much better vs pumping him full of a laxative.",
