Furthermore, its vibrant color and feminine style had buyers persuaded. On the flipside, many disliked its construction quality and the waterproof promise that didn\u2019t deliver. In a nutshell, this footwear is widely recommended to neophyte trailblazers who value comfort more than anything else. However, amidst the comfort, style and its diverse functionality, this shoe would not be the best wear for serious trails.",

I went with 2 stars because despite of this I've has a lot of comfortable, if slightly soggy, wear out of them and only stopped wearing them when it was very noticeable.",
