      "text": "The pros are that this shoe is super cute and fits decently (length and width). I did have to size down half a size (from 6.5 to 6). However it has so many cons. It is so uncomfortable! The tongue is so long at the top, and because the shoe is made of a stiff suede leather, it rubs the top of your feet! Obviously the heel is also stiff at first, but that's not a big deal (you can use heel inserts). The deal breaker was the long tongue rubbing constantly against the top of your feet. Most no show socks won't be able to cover your feet that far. Such a bummer :(",
