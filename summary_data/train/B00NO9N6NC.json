I use this at our deer camp and we fit 3 grown men with air mattresses plus all of our bags and gear very comfortably with plenty of room to spare. The addition of the Mr. Heater with the rain fly on kept us perfectly warm. Highly recommend this tent if your looking for something spacious and great quality. We also got rained on and the rainfly kept the tent completely dry. No need to look any further for another compatible tent. Get this one. Very happy.",

It's a very large tent and it's defiantly rain proof! We were considering the Arizona but for about $80 difference and the dimensions were almost the same we are very happy with the Laredo. Now the extra savings can be used for screen house. It seems very well made too. We bought it late in the season so can't wait to use it more next year, we love it.",

With the fly off, it\u2019s lovely. With it on in hot/humid conditions, you\u2019re fighting to get out. Regarding space, it\u2019s huge. Plenty of room to spread. 9 people is silly tho. I\u2019d probably cap it at 5-6 if comfort is a consideration. Great design tho. 4poles (color coded) mage it super easy. 1person build with no issue I do wish the door zipper was rethought. Constantly gets caught. My kids had a real hard time... but they\u2019re little (&9) and it\u2019s camping anyways.",

Today, i tore it down to take to a campground and 3 of the 4 corners of the rain cover are frayed through and broke. I took the top tarp part off and it was like tissue paper in my hand. Just tearing like kleenex. Ugh! The rest of the tent is in fine condition but the canopy is destroyed rendering the entire tent useless. I cant afford to but a $200 tent every season. Very sad.",

You can stand up in it. 2 queens fit with plenty of extra room. Just stop researching anything else and buy this.",

I used it for two adults and two kids, we both had full blow up mattresses and there was definitely room for another full size mattress. The tent is advertised for 8 to 9 people -- I think that would be tight, unless there were no sleeping pads or mattresses. My only complaint is that is hard to collapse back into the bag.

Just be careful when putting the tent poles in, they will definitely rip the fabric if you are not over-the-top cautious. I've put up a lot of tents in my life and never ripped the top piece where the tent poles go until I used this tent. If they could fix that I would say buy this thing without hesitations. Or just buy it anyway and put some gorilla tape on there if you do get a rip.",

On a humid stuffy night with a forecast of rain you would either have to put the rainfly on and suffer the heat or wait until it starts to rain and go out and put the fly on potentially getting yourself and everything in the tent wet in the process. Disappointed. It is easy to put up, perfect size, good quality.",
