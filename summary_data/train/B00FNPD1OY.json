      "text": "I purchased this Chromebook for my 17 year old daughter as a backup to her main HP laptop because it's lighter to carry around school. She\u2019s a dual enrollment student with a local college and this was perfect for her. I\u2019ve done some web searches and video streaming and noticed that it\u2019s really fast. It\u2019s much faster than her regular laptop. It also boots up extremely fast as well. The OS is very clean looking. This was our first experience with using the Google Chrome OS. I\u2019m overall very happy with this purchase and so is she!",

You can only print using Google Cloud print, and that will only work if you have another computer that is wirelessly connected to the printer with Windows. It simply is not possible to print without that setup, which makes this computer almost perfect.",

It is a shame they do not have better quality control and test batteries before they sell this junk. I give it 2 stars because it was such a cheap computer. Other than that, spend a few dollars more because you are going to have to replace the battery anyways, might as well get a better computer.....",

When I do that the sound works every time. This computer is very fast. It dose have good sound and plenty of volume.It plays Netflix movies very well and youtube.",

Unfortunately, it doesn't recognize the camera, though a work around is to insert the sd card directly into the chromebook. Our camcorder does jot have an sd card so that will present a problem. Overall compatibility continues to be a struggle mainly due to unrecognized file formats. I would rate this product 5 stars if Google can fix the compatibility issues.",

If you're looking for a Chromebook, I'd recommend either this machine or HP's latest 14-inch model.

Surprisingly, the Acer seems to be made better...it just seems more solid. Also, the 4GBs of ram make a huge difference. I think 4GBs should be the minimum standard for Chromebooks. The extra 2 GBs make a huge difference. I can open many tabs without any problems. I can watch video clips on multiple tabs with out any problems. As far as the Chorme OS, I love it. It does what most regular web surfers want it to do, at usually blazing-fast speeds. I am extremely happy with this Chromebook.",
