Their pair very quickly, you name them and off you go. Easy to access them through your favorite smart assistant and change the settings from colors to intensity or any other variety.

Tried in multiple homes, no matter what I did neither bulb will connect to WiFi, not even using HomeKit. Went to Home Depot to try to buy a third bulb there, only to see the only LIFX mini bulbs they had have all been RETURNED. This is nothing but junk. I\u2019ve spent 4+ hours trying to connect with no luck. Stay away. I will say the A19 bulbs work fine though. Disappointing.",
