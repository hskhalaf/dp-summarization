I bought it for my grandson and it is exactly like one that I got for my son 47 years ago, except that in 1971 I bought it fully assembled. The fact that you have to put this together yourself is the only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5. But once it's together, it is very sturdy and well made. The pedals can be adjusted as the child grows. My husband said it was a pain in the neck to put together, but he is 80 and a little grumpy.",

The younger boy, now 5 yo, still uses his pedal car frequently. I noted that the older boy is getting a bit big for his car (a different model). He said, \"Yes, but I'm NOT giving it up!\"",

So, Amazon and I settled on a discounted amount for the gift and everyone is happy. I would still buy another model for my little Legend's birthday in July. Still looking at all options. They are very sturdy and will last a lifetime and are great for handing down to future generations. That's my plan. (huge smiles)",

We were able to work with it some but it's a design flaw. Everything else is great for the money! I posted an image of our not quite 2 year old grandson in his car.

My brothers who hit 60yrs had these types of pedal cars when that age, so the quality is still fabulous. FYA---the color red fades the worst of all others-so what would you expect!!! It's worth getting repainted and detailed later. Very very pleased and have recommended this especially for gifts that have to be shipped out.",

My 3 year old grand daughter loves it!! item shipped quickly and all parts were present and in fine working order...we purchased white vinyl decals from some other dealers on Amazon and turned this little beauty into a girlie 49ers car....grandma and daddy love the 49ers! My grand daughter is 38 inches tall and after adjusting the pedals for her...she still has room to grow as we are not on the last adjustment. Some of the decals that come with the car are cute..but be aware that you can put whatever decals you want on the car as the decals are not prestuck to the car.",

There is a pretty strong smell to it that eventually wears off, but certainly noticeable to us. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because the ladders aren't very sturdy. I realize they aren't intended to be used functionally, however, they have come unglued from just taking them on and off the rack. It's an easy fix to put some wood or hot glue in there, but wish they were a bit more durable. Assembly overall was pretty smile, though it took almost an hour. It drives really well and the car itself is sturdy.",
