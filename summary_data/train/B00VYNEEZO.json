This is an updated design, the most noticeable difference is that the size changed a little. The distance from the chuck to the back of the motor portion is around 3/8-1/2\" shorter, the handle is portion longer by about the same amount. The older version also didn't have a belt hook, I'm not sure if I'll be using it. I have a number of Milwaukee M12 tools. They can do maybe 80-90% of the jobs that their M18 cousins can do but with less weight and resulting fatigue.",
