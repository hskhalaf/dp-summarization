Nonetheless, works like a charm, as everything there is always a learning curve. But once you work with it the hair styles are endless and super easy. The worst part of the airwrap is the price, but I think in the long run it pays for itselfs, just always having that salon blowout alone look is priceless.",

Don't try to make it difficult to use it... it will do ALL the work! If I want smooth hair with good body, I use one of the brushes. If I want just waves with body, I use the large barrel. If I want more curl & body, I use the small barrel. I love this!!!",
