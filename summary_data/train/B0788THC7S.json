The seller Outdoor Sports Equipment provided good service and delivery.

Otherwise an excellent diver, excellent value. Solid, masculine bracelet, knurled bezel and crown, drilled lugs, hacking, hand winding - hard to beat for the price I paid. Zero problems with alignments on mine. More accurate than I'd expected. Definitely would recommend this one.",

This samurai feels solid, setting the time feels substantial, the bezel is solid, the orange is much nicer in reality than pictures show, and the time reserve is great. The steel also resists scratches and gauges well and has a more upscale polish. In this price range there is no better substitute.",
