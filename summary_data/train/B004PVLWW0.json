It started at 46,multiple tests etc. When one goes their whole life with no shedding, no hair in brush it's kinda scary! Not that I don't have any hair but I'm hoping this product will stop the shedding and help with regrowth. I will post again in about a month. I started with 2 a day then will increase as to not upset the stomach",

I have PCOS and androgenic alopecia which has caused my hair to thin all over, especially in my crown and the sides. Here's some positives I've noticed so far: The packaging is really nice, the pills don't have a super weird smell which is a plus, and the customer service has been excellent so far. The product arrived on schedule and it has a lot of good information on the packaging about what ingredients are inside the bottle and how that helps regrow your hair. I'll update this review in a few months but so far so good!",
