However, it seems to occupy echo's Bluetooth channel so that as long as the clock is connected, the echo could not be used as a Bluetooth receiver any more. E.g. my echo is connected to a speaker and it acts as a Bluetooth soundbar for my TV. I also use this setting as a Bluetooth speaker and stream music from my phone. The introduction of this clock breaks everything else. I will attempt a bit more before I have to return it to Amazon. Would appreciate if Amazon could clarify if this behavior is by-design.",

It only does two things, show you the time and show you timers. So far it's doing both. Being able to set multiple timers is more convenient than I thought it would be while cooking.",

It only does one thing beyond a cheap ikea wall clock, show your timers. If you don't set a lot of timers with alexa, this won't do much for ya. My biggest issue is because it requires an echo nearby to work, it really limits placement. It says 30 ft, but my experience is about 15. If you have an open floor plan living space, this can be a problem.",
