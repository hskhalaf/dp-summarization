It may be dispensed with in the name of storage space. All put together, though, with the keel inflated, it honestly looks like it could easily take a 2hp motor! I may just buy that mount and give it a shot!",

One note, be sure to follow the directions for inflation as the seats, bottom beam and all have to go in order.",

They came apart a few times and I had to paddle (instead of row) to fetch them in the lake. So, as far as row boat... good luck.. as a paddle with one paddle right to left it worked very well. I will be buying the trolling motor for it when I return from my vacation because Amazon wont deliver to my campsite lol",

Though this boat doesn\u2019t have an internal bladder and doesn\u2019t self-bail, it\u2019s otherwise easy to confuse this boat with high end inflatable whitewater and motor boats. The material is super burly and it inflates to a perfect, unwrinkled, solid form. Functionally, the floor is perfect but extremely heavy (comparable to the weight of the boat). If the battens were made of a lighter plastic or carbon fiber it\u2019d be hard to find a flaw with the entire rig. Flies around for hours with agility with a Minnkota motor and accompanying battery. Buy it. Or the bigger one.",

This boat is sturdy and heavy, yet light enough that I can pick up the front end and leverage it into the cockpit. Just unscrew the valves then roll it up with floor in it, compact enough to fit through the companionway and stow it below.

This boat can be registered to your state as it has a Hull ID number on it and you can get the manufacturers certificate in Intex's web portal. I have a Minn Kota 30lb motor on it and it moves me at 5 MPH on nice sunny days. The oars are great and super light. I sometimes go with 2 of my buddies down the quebradilla river in puerto rico and row to go from point A to Point B with out the motor. Material is amazingly good and sturdy. My friends will be buying 1 for sure.",

Very well constructed and easy to inflate and get into the water. One note: Get a seperate duffle bag for the roll up floor, it's too heavy to put the boat and the floor in the included travel bag.",

It's a two person lift for sure. Very durable.",
