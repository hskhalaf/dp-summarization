I\u2019ve only used it a couple times and the first time the battery lasted at least 12 hours\u2014probably longer. The second time it lasted slightly less time but I may not have recharged it 100%.

A person passing in between interrupts the connectivity. When I connect it to my computer which is at the bottom of table, and I place the small stereo with the device connected, the sound quality sounds muffled. And that's only 2 feet apart with a table in between. I'm surprise this thing has high praises with almost 5 stars. Either its only my device or most consumer has low taste for good quality sound.",

With nearly all plugs, including the plug-to-plug adapter that comes with the unit, there is no right channel audio going out.
