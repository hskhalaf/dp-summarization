      "text": "I am very happy with this product. They seem to work in the sense that I feel energized. I have been on the cusp of getting sick during this fall season but seem to never get a full on cold. I am assuming that this is because I am taking these supplements along with other vitamins. I like the fact that they are liquid caps. I would imagine that the vitamins get into your system much faster that way. One cool side effect seems to be that if you take this vitamin at night, your dreams may become more vivid. When I take them at night I have full color, crazy, vivid dreams. This product is worth getting!!!",
