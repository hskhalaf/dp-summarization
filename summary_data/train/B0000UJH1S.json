I see reviews from people saying they added springs and other auto openers. I don\u2019t understand why that stuff was necessary. It\u2019s one handed as is. My wife uses it just fine. I use it just fine. My friends can use it just fine. There is no need to modify it at all. Hold the main handle between your thumb and palm, use your other four fingers to operate the mechanism. It\u2019s fairly simple. Just like operating pliers one handed.",

I would say that the little metal rod that connects the handle to the movable third arm is weak, seems like a likley point of failure. but for $15, who can complain. really happy with purchase.",

The handle feature is tricky and need some redesigning: locking should be made for grip not for ungrip.

Ideally, for a tight grip, one hand pushes down while the other pushes up (like scissors). In this case, both hands have the tendency to push upward to keep the grip as well as to keep the weight of the wood aloft. The squeeze lever here has little leverage.",

But you can't use your hands to get them open. So basically what you have here is an item that allows you to put 1 piece of wood on a fire. Worthless is what it is.",
