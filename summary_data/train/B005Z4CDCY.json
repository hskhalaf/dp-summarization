I ended up returning it and just using the credit to buy a heavier, less-blingy aluminum post. Race Face products get the job done and I'd rather have the peace of mind knowing that my saddle isn't going to pop off under me.",

      "text": "Ordered the post in December since it was well reviewed and a 'great' price. However, it only has ~15 rides and it's bent. For reference, I'm a fairly tall/large guy so the post was extended close to the 'minimum insertion' line (never over extended) and I'm riding full suspension on moderate/difficult single track trails. I recommend shopping for a more durable post if you ride technical trails. GOOD: - 31.6mm x 375mm fit frame, no issues with slippage as long as quick release was tight. - No issues with ordering/shipping, the product was received promptly. - The seat clamp did an excellent job of keeping the seat at the proper position/angle (applied blue loctite to keep the bolts in place).",

      "text": "At the end of the day it's a seat-post, but needlessly annoying to mount. The clamp nuts are not fully captive, so you have to hold them in place while turning your wrench until they're seated, and there's practically no clearance for a 1/4\" ratchet to turn the front bolt, so I taped a rag around the post to avoid scratching the finish. I'll survive, but I thought we had seat-post design nailed like 20 years ago.",

Race Face was apparently the cure! This post is silent, doesn't slip, hardly flexes, and fit the tube perfectly. If it were a bit lighter i'd give it 5/5, but for the price this is expected. The Race Face print isn't obnoxious or flashy but compliments my bike well. I personally enjoy the two bolt design and found this model very easy to adjust to that sweet spot. Good stuff..",

      "title": "Excellent replacement seat post",
      "text": "I just installed this on my 2000 Kona Fire Mountain bike with a 27.2mm seat post. I'm 6'1\" and had plenty of room to adjust the post. I was also able to set the angle of my seat properly. Durability seems good and parts were easy to install. I didn't scratch it at all. My old post got stuck so I had to use a plumbers wrench to get it off. I used a 31.8mm clamp with this.",
