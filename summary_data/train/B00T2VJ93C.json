Now I know why the bit kept falling out. It just was not tight enough. Also the bits I bought were just cheep junk. I like the drill and would recomend it.",

The cord is pretty standard and the bit holder on bottom of the handle hasn\u2019t stabbed me yet so I\u2019m very happy with my purchase.

A dangerous situation if you're using a wirebrush or cutting tool. The cheap price isn't worth a trip to the ER. I would recommend everyone avoid this model.",

They tell you that when you have a drilling bit inside, then you need to rotate the chuck counter-clockwise to loosen it up. However, when you receive the drill from Amazon, it's the opposite! There is no bit inside, so you need to put a drilling bit in, and tighten the chuck by rotating it clockwise. It's that easy!",
