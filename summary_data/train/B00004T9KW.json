      "text": "We switched one of our old Harbor Freight specials at the shop for this one. I was skeptical that it would be that much better, but this is a serious grinder. The wheels don't wobble, it's powerful as can be, and it's silent compared to all of our other grinders. The price is hefty, but will worth it if you are using it daily. We will be switching out all of our grinders for Jets in the coming months. Update 9/14 We ordered another a month ago and it is working perfectly in our shop. They\u2019re pricey, but we would happily pay double considering the time it\u2019s saved us compared to cheap models.",

After reading many reviews of lesser grinders, then visiting the three big box stores within 100 miles, all other choices were chintzy with wobbly wheels and lower power. It purrs like a kitten, running smooth and quiet, but grinds like a tiger with no bogging down when I lay metal to it. Wonderful tool that will outlive me. I am so glad I bumped the budget up to a Jet.",

There are a few things that could be better, the tool rests are a little a small and a work light is not standard equipment, but you can purchase a LED work light from Jet for about $60. I'll never buy another bench grinder with 6\" wheels after using this one which has 8\" wheels. The wheels produce an excellent surface finish on chisels, etc.",

I grabbed the nearest piece of steel I could find and it took entirely to much pressure to slow it down mind you I was trying to stop it completely. It slowed a bit as expected and kept right on grinding . I would definitely recommend this grinder to anyone looking for a great product at an affordable price .",
