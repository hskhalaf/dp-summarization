This was installed on a covered back patio. 6 months into use the fan was on a low setting and randomly came crashing down. The screws were bent like were not able to handle being on. luckily no one was under the fan but was very scary as we have small children who could have been crushed.",

One of the blades is clearly thinner than the others (my husband is a general contractor/finish carpenter) cannot get the glass to be properly tight due to the cage around it so this really adds to the wobbling and the noise it makes when it wobbles. I truly believe we got a faulty ceiling fan.",

Also be sure to screw the fan blades on BEFORE hanging the motor on the ceiling. It is almost impossible to get the screws into the holes and tighten. That was the second time I had to take the entire assembly down from the ceiling. I have had many other fans and this was the most expensive and the worst of them all to assemble.",

Be sure to use the best down rod size for your location. This helps to get the most from a fan. Overall this seems like a pretty good value...........Time will tell.
