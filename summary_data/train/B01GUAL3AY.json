With a trail-specific lug and tackier rubber in the outsole, it provides enough traction for less technical, rocky, or muddy trails.

It has superior comfort, good arch support, and a very breathable upper for those moderately fast or easy days on the trail.",

I normally wear narrow running shoes, so I thought these would be okay despite other complaints about this issue. My toe was hitting uncomfortably for running shoes, but I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning without being sure, and kept checking the shoes out inside with different socks, and now come back to the site seeking a different pair, only to find out the return window is closed. There's no reason why running shoes should be so unpredictable. Return window too narrow for a purchase like this.",
