Sometimes I am able to exert enough effort onto it to get it to spray, other times I just unscrew the top and use it as a regular lotion, (though granted, it's way too liquidy to use this way). Most of the time I just use something else. Such a bummer because it was so expensive.",

I also didn't notice any smell. It's easy to apply, even though it requires a little rubbing in after spraying. I found that one application lasted all day. I'll definitely be buying more.",

However, this leaves no white cast, which she says is a huge deal in and of itself, and that alone makes this product worth the money. She also mentioned that It doesn\u2019t feel greasy. She likes to follow the directions on the bottle and puts two layers on before going outside. Each bottle lasts her at least two months.",
