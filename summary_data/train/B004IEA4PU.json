I'm terrible at puzzles - I just can't visualise or think through how they work - so I did spend a lot of time on the Portal 2 wiki, however I never got bored because I HAD to know what happened next. The puzzles are challenging, the story is gripping, and the visuals of the game? Absolutely gorgeous. I recommend playing with an Xbox 360 PC controller for the best experience. Mouse and keyboard seemed to clunky for this.",

More of the same puzzle-solving in a freaky, fairly immersive environment with beautiful graphics (and not too taxing on my older hardware). My only tiny gripe is that due to a glitch of some sort I got stuck on a level (with a cube missing somehow) and after looking at videos on how to solve the level it seems I've missed nothing and my only option is to start over and work my way back to the level so I can take it on in its re-set form. An option to reset a level would make this slick perfection.",

The fantastic blend of addictive puzzle solving, immersive environments and hilarious dialogue takes the solid foundation of the original Portal and blows it out of the water. The new multiplayer element is a very different dynamic which takes a little while to get the hang of, but is brilliant in its own right, you really have to communicate with your \"partner in science\" to solve the puzzles, and it's really rewarding. Installs into Steam like other Valve games, but having the disk means you don't have to wait ages for it to download. Everyone should give this game a try. 10/10!",

I dont mean that is no enough, but I strongly believe that the game could have offered some extra levels with a greater difficulty. The graphics are better but it is the situations and scenarios where you will notice the difference. Funny, alternative, quick and easy ... just great",
