They are well packaged, clean and easy to fold up and put away, easy to clean and it comes with a nice bag to keep them in. all in all great product would buy again but their is no real point in doing so",

There is so much mid bass bleed into the mids that any sort of music sounds contested and undecipherable. Treble is way too relaxed which reveals not a lot of detail. The isolation/noise leakage is average. Comfort is not that great, the pads aren't the softest and makes your ears hurt. The only real good thing the Urbanites have going for them is their build quality. The way the cable slides into each ear cup when they are adjusted is unique and clever.",

Any slight movement of the head while listening, like virtual drumming, they fall off your head! Plus the cable could be slightly longer.",
