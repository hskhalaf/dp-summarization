The iPhone app works well and is useful to control the machine, especially when you need to pause it because you pulled a cramp or what not. But I think that's pretty much it. Don't expect to practice receiving fast balls and practice playing in a high-pace environment. This machine, at max speed, only feeds \"easy\" balls, and I'm really just beginning to play. Overall, I'm happy with it. May need to upgrade to something more beefy in a few years, something with more power.",
