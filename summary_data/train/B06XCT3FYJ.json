Although I did not expect them to last for years, I thought that they would at least last for a few months. I had initially heard great things about these cases, and I'm sure that they would have protected the phone if it was dropped face down, but, with that being said, after 2 months, they broke, so I will never know.",

I don't forsee me getting to keep this case on my phone for very long because of that. My phone is constantly in and out of my pockets so that we put some wear and tear on those spots. Overall I'm pretty pleased, but that issue should be addressed for future devices.",
