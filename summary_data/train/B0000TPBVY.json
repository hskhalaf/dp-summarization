The handle should be thicker given the force necessary to cut through root vegetables. The edge is excellent, a steep angle, and the blade is a good weight.",

    "description": "Twin signature knives are precision stamped from a single piece of German steel, resulting in lighter weight knives that do not compromise sharpness. The knives are made of proprietary special formula steel that has been perfected for over 280 years. Combined with zwilling's signature ice-hardening technique, these friodur blades are harder, sharper, they will not stain or chip and they retain their sharpness longer.to ensure an ideal cutting angle, the laser-controlled edge is incredibly sharp and is honed and hand-finished by the most skilled artisans. The three-rivet handle embedded with the ZWILLING J.A. Henckels logo provides optimum durability.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nWith their laser-controlled edges and durable blades, Henckels Twin Signature knives deliver quality and precision without maxing out the budget. Twin Signature knives feature high-carbon stainless-steel blades that have been stamped from a single piece of metal and put through the patented Friodur ice-hardening process to ensure their strength. The edges are laser-controlled for consistency and sharpness, and each one is hand-honed during the production process. The polymer handles are ergonomically designed and offer a comfortable fit for mid-size or smaller hands. Three stainless-steel rivets secure the handle to the blade, and the full-tang construction (the stamped steel piece that runs the full length of the knife) ensures better handling and durability. Perfect for chopping and dicing meat, fish, and vegetables, this 7-inch cleaver is especially useful for diagonal cuts and stir-fry, though it is not designed to break bones. Made in Germany, the knife is safe in the dishwasher, though Henckels recommends washing it by hand. --Emily Bedard",
