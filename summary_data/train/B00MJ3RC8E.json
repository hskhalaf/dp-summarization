They are also not as deep. Now my lenses do not fit properly, and move about far too much for adequate protection. This is at best a poor excuse, and shows little in the way of quality control. Why did they accept the products from the outsourcer, if they did not meet their specs. Too bad they ruined a good product.",

Each fit accordingly to any lens you have. I place both my 24mm & 40mm lenses in the small case, 18-55mm in the mid size case, and my 70-200mm lens in the large case. Well insulated, store your lenses safe from harm in your bag or by clipping just outside your gear bag. It has a belt lope so if you want to place it on your belt or on your shoulder strap, its good to go. Love these pouch kits!",

On these occasion, I would pack the medium sized pouch, and while I'm out and about shooting, I would keep one lens in the pouch and attach the pouch to the bottom of my backpack strap with its clip. This way, it actually provides a pretty quick access to the lens for me while providing good protection. The padding is thick, and the inner lining is soft. The pouches are just good quality, and if you need anything to protect your lenses while storing them or on the go, these will do a pretty good job.",

The smallest size could not even fit Sony FE 50mm 1.8, so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s its purpose. The next big one is too large for it. I think they need to rethink all the sizes.

Unfortunately, Amazon says I have let too much time pass before returning this badly constructed item, so I will need to replace it with something better. Buyer beware!

The entire set strikes me as an amazing bargain for barely over a dozen dollars. I'm glad I purchased them. I intend to replace my Nikon cases with these neoprene bags on all my lenses. These are for casual protection. They will protect from minor bangs and minor water exposure.

However, the Amagg bags are lighter and looser, if you want to save every bit of weight you can or have stubby lenses, and they are less expensive. Amagg and Altura are NOT the same product simply rebranded. They are definitely their own brands with their own characteristics. Pick whichever suits your needs better.",

I personally put the pouches back in my backpack. These pouches provide great protection to your lenses or other equipment you store in them. I was pleasantly surprised when opening up my package to find these of higher quality than I anticipated. A great buy and addition to anyone's camera equipment.",

      "text": "At first I was going to use these in place of an actual expensive camera bag but one day while shooting I realized what makes them so amazing. So when I took out my camera of the large bag (I have a Nikon D5600 and it is a bit of a squeeze), I was wondering what the clips on the side are used for and then it clicked. You can use them on the side of your bag so that you can make quick lens changes on the go! Literally the most useful thing I have purchased for my camera! BUY THIS. (P.S. They didn't pay me to say this)",

Really easy to use and pretty good quality. I currently hold a 24-70mm zoom in the big bag, A 55mm prime lens in the medium bag and a 28mm prime in the small bag. The 28mm is actually too small for the small bag but I still use it because it should be kept protected. Great buy!",

They also have a vaguely petrochemical smell to them, but not enough to be bothersome. To me, anyway. All of the neoprene bags will allow lens damage if the bag is dropped, or is struck against something hard while swinging from your waist or whatever. These bags are meant to protect against damage while in a camera bag or in a relatively benign environment. If you're looking for ultimate protection (like against drops), you'll need a different design, not a layer of stitched neoprene.",

The quality seemed okay, but I wouldn't trust high-end glass in it--would much rather go with one of the semi-rigid, padded cases that are floating around. The small case was also too way too big for a Zeiss 35mm prime lens that I tested and I didn't feel like it provided much more than scuff protection.",
