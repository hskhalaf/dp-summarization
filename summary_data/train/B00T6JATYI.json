I bought them to use on our back patio during the warmer seasons. I\u2019ve broken too many wine glasses now. Dropped, kicked over. Now the only possible loss is the drink itself! Maybe there should be silicone lids. Ha. Anyway, great product, doesn\u2019t smell, doesn\u2019t appear to stain with red wine. Haven\u2019t tried the dishwasher yet, I\u2019ve only washed by hand. A little awkward to drink out of at first with the feel, a thicker edge, etc., but you get used to it. Would recommend.",
