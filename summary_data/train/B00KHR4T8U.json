When I FINALLY got to MS Support, they said, \"we'll send you a replacement SP3.\" Great, that is great. The replacement would not hold a charge for even 10 hrs with almost no use and wouldn't even turn on 1/2 the time. The Customer Support rep had the guts to say, \"That is normal for the SP3.\" I vehemently disagreed. After 2 weeks of them \"trouble shooting\" and me NOT having a SP3 to use, they finally said they would send ANOTHER replacement. Let's hope this one actually works.",

I noticed weird pixel images on the touch screen that looked like bubbles. took it too the Microsoft store and it's an out-of-warranty hardware issue. cannot. be. fixed. it still works fine with the keyboard, but the touchscreen has to be disabled. pretty disappointing. it's basically a laptop now. oh well.

It's too bad such a rinky-dink retrofit is needed to make a new $80 power supply work, but it does the job. Also a minor software issue - it really does not like to log onto GOOGLE.COM from Internet Explorer. A little more net neutrality is needed there.",
