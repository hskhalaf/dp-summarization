      "text": "Good durable product. I lead intepretive hikes on trails through a volcanic landscape at a national monument. These casual boots have a good grip and are comfortable. All boots get torn up in this landscape, but I expect the Ariat Terrain boot to last two seasons. This type of terrain abuse will tear up any boot, but I can afford to replace these every 2 - 3 years. Great boot for the price.",
