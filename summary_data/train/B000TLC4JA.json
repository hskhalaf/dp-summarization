The tires are lumpy and the twins get super frustrated trying to pedal on lumpy tires. The seats are not steady. We were very, very disappointed. We took them to REI to try and get the tires fixed and they were dismayed at the quality and suggested that they must be knockoffs. They said they couldn't even fix them and we ended up replacing them on their next birthday.",

The students waited along time for new bikes and worked hard raising money to buy these! hope the company will do something about this and not disappoint many families.",

No significant accident so far. The low seat improves stability. Bucket seat seems comfortable. The rubber tires are nice. No punctures in 3.5 years. We store it indoors; however, it is exposed to wet grass. We have no issues with rust so far. Oiled it few times. No abnormal squeaks or squeals. Overall, it is well and fully operational after 3.5+ year of use.",

She is a tall and sturdy Little Angel, so we decided to get her this full size trike, instead of a smaller, plastic \"beginner model\". Besides the Schwinn name and excellent quality, we chose this because of the low seat design. The styling makes this choice a more safe, comfortable and steady ride for her as she learns to maneuver and propel it. This trike is a little big for her now, (she can barely reach the peddles when she turns), but by spring, we think it will be a perfect fit!

She is almost three now, the seat has been adjusted to as close to the pedals as possible. She still can't reach them. This tricyle was designed for much bigger children, by the time she is big enough to ride it she will have transitioned to a balance bike. I am so disappointed with this purchase and wish I could return it. I trusted the Schwinn name, and it was a mistake iIwill not repeat.",

She probably has 10-12 hours of run time on the trike and the rear wheels squeak terribly. It has become very difficult for her to keep the trike moving due to the high friction between the bushings. No amount of lube has solved the problem. Highly disappointed!!!",

As he grows he will be able to use it until it's time to step up to a two wheeler. He loves the trike. After reading some of the negative reviews, I was slightly concerned about quality. I had no problems assembling the tricycle. It's solid and sturdy and I expect it to last.",

Wheels roll on a metal axle with plastic bushing and they stop rolling after a couple turns despite making sure everything is in proper adjustment and plenty of silicone lubricant. It is also heavy at 21 pounds for toddlers, my mountain bike weighs in at about 26 lbs. I'm planning to get a light weight plastic one that will roll better.",

No big deal, got a rubber mallet and some rubber clamps and straightened it out. Then attempted to assemble, well... the last pieces #16 and #18 I believe, the bolt and nut holding the handlebars is missing. Went to the garage found a bolt and nut and thought that would work but no go. The handlebars just swivel around. Have to send it back unfortunately. It's a nice looking tricycle that looks sturdy but the aggravation of doing this again is not worth it.",

The bell that comes with the tricycle sure adds to the CUTENESS of this bike. ...I had the Radioflyer for a different child and that one is also cute...but the real air filled rubber tires that this tricycle comes with makes the ride more gentle.
