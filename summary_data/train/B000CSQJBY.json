Also if your weight is over 150 I would not think they would last long at all and may bend. If really need and on the light, short side and don\u2019t care about perfection then these will work.

      "text": "The crutches did not deserve even one star. Upon opening the box, one crutch was unusable due to a defect involving a pop-rivet that was supposed to attach one of the arms holding up the arm-pit on one side. The company issued a credit which was also totally unacceptable because the crutches were needed - not a defective product and the refund was also not acceptable because the requested part could not be furnished and no attempt was made to provide another set of crutches which would have been acceptable and we would gladly return the defective set .",

The pads do feel a little bit cheaper than the ones we have rented at the medical supply store, but that is easily fixed by ordering different ones. For the price, these are an excellent pair of crutches to have at home \"just in case\".",
