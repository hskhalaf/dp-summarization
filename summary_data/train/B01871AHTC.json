If in a small space it will heat quickly. The one complaint I have is the cables to hold the lights have slipped out of their crimp and dropped a light on to one of the plants. We replaced it with a thicker gauge of sturdy wire and haven't had issues since. I have and will continue to buy this brand. Out of the several different lights received, none have had manufacturing defects and all leds have worked.",

      "text": "Wow these lights are kickin ass !!! My girls love them . In 2 weeks time they've filled out and up way way better then what Ive seen from my MH in that amount of time ever. I'm running them with both veg an flower together and the plants are going crazy . The only issue is short power cords . I replaced mine with 20ft cords to get out of my 8\u00d712 room to my power source so I only have one complete cord per light. Two 2000w are perfect for my space . Like them so much I'm getting 2 more in the near future. XXX",
