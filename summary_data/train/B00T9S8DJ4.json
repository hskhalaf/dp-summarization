Our dog Boogie's girth is 26\" and the fit is perfect and doesn't shift or rub his coat. He always hated a collar but tolerates this ensemble wonderfully. Maybe he recognizes that he is dressed up in a snazzy uniform or that he gets more attention and respect. No matter, he enjoys it being put on every morning and sometimes resists it being removed at night.",

I like that it appears professional and solves problems before they start. I carry a few of the cards with me just in case, but haven't needed them yet. I am really thankful to have this harness as it allows me to take my service dog into areas I would probably not be able to without it.",

The dog LOVES IT!
