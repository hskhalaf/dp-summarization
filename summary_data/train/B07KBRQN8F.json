Very happy with these (I got two).",

It produces a great amount of mist for such a small machine, and I like how you can control the amount of mist that comes out. There is also a window on the side that shows how much water is left. Also, when there is no water left it shuts off automatically. Overall the humidifier is well designed and convenient. I highly recommend this humidifier for your home.",

I buy distilled water so there's no cleaning necessary. You can buy distilled water at any of your local grocery shops or invest in a water distiller, check out the ROVSUN Countertop Water Distiller Machine All Stainless Steel Interior with 4L BPA-Free Container, Home Distilled Water Purifier Filter, add the 5% coupon for extra savings.",

      "text": "Love how small this product is as well as how easy it is to use. I remember using a humidifier 10 years ago and them being noisy and using up water within a couple of hours! This small thing is amazing and will last what seems like forever (also depends on how high or low you have your humidifier set). It doesn't spill everywhere when you try to connect the water supply to the base, another beautiful thing I love about technology. Hated those humidifiers I used to use growing up but this one is absolutely amazing.",

It was so specific in the instructions of where to put it (off the ground, but not too high so you can refill it without moving it), so it took me a while to get it placed right. The only negative is when you flip it upside down to refill the tank, a disc falls out that is used to position where the steam goes in the room, so I have to be careful. I haven't cleaned mine yet, so I don't know how easy it is to do that, but I really like it so far after using it for about a month.",

We also use the humidifier pucks for tap water from Taotronics. They work great. It\u2019s a quiet humidifier. It drips when refilling from condensation so just have a towel at the ready. I recommend it.",

This humidifier works wonders... it starts working right away, doesn't make a sound and its easy to aim the mist in any direction. There's also a really great feature which is the attached handle which make for really easy use. This humidifier is simple and not expensive and does the job. Even if it broke down the road, I\u2019d buy it again.",

I fill it every night as part of my bedtime ritual but I could easily let it run all night at least two days in a row without refilling. It's perfectly quiet, too. The best part is waking up feeling normal again. Very happy purchaser here that will be looking into more products for other rooms.",
