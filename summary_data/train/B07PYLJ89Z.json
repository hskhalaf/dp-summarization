      "text": "These are simply stunning wireless earphones - not only do they look great, operate perfectly and have a brilliant design, they are made from sustainable materials. Very cool in many ways. They pair via bluetooth - I haven't had a single problem with this. They hold up to 9 hours charge - charge via the case, as with AirPods. They look so much better than AirPods though and fit much better and more comfortably too. I highly recommend these earphones ... easily the coolest on the market.",

We sent them back for a replacement pair, same issue. All the company will do is send us replacements until the warranty is up. Amazon won't refund the money since it's been more than a month since we bought them (they actually worked that first month). I'm going to buy my son the $30 pair I got myself that are still working fine two years later.",

It seems like you have to put it back in the case to get it to reconnect. For me its a pain because i dont carry the case close around me. The problems didnt start right away. So i didnt ask for a replacement. I have had them since April and it took a couple months for the problems to start.",
