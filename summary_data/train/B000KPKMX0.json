They didn't help my plantar fasciitis at all, in fact, I noticed I was in a bit more pain after using them, specifically after a workout. They also ran a bit big. I wear a size 10 in woman's shoes, and these were too big. They fit into my gym shoes, but it was a tight squeeze to put the inserts in (yes, after removing the inserts the shoes come with). The inserts didn't fit into any of my day-to-day shoes either - my flats, heels, casual shoes - nope. Disappointing.",

I only wish the metatarsal pd of this orthotic was a little thicker or had a little bit of padding to it as it is the thinnest part of the orthotic, and flat. Most casual shoe soles have a little squishiness to it. I put a metatarsal pad on it but it made it a little too thick to be comfortable.",

When I say slightly stiff, that is because some of those Dr. Sholls are too \"flimsy\" and they will move around a lot inside of your shoes. Like if you curl your toes in your shoes just to test it with a Dr Sholls brand, it curls with them. So you could imagine the sliding around while walking etc. These have plenty of cushion for comfort, yet the bottom layer is stiff so they don' slide around.
