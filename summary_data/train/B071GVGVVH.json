Just simply, \"Alexa, turn on the Fan\". Setup was simple, the instructions are great. It was easy to setup following the included setup guide. I can't wait to start integrating custom IR and RF devices. I am hoping to control my Roku TV and Garage Door with the Bond!",

March came and went and I contacted customer support and I was told it would definitely be ready by July 2018. Well here we are in December, nearly into 2019, I have yet to see HomeKit support or any information released regarding this feature. It works as advertised but outside the HomeKit ecosystem which is unacceptable for me. The prospect of it supporting HomeKit was the biggest and sole influence for me to purchase it...especially since staff reenforced this promise. Pretty frustrated with the company. Over promising and under delivering. Just communicate with us, Bond!",

My shade (from a popular outdoor awning company), supported both wifi and bluetooth, but with the former you had to buy their expensive bridge (included Alexa and Google integration) and the latter you had to use their app, no integration with Alexa or Google. So I assumed this was more like a general learning remote and didn't use any proprietary encryption. I was right, it worked perfectly!

Both my fans had remotes that allowed for three different fan speeds. Alexa seems to have some trouble with speed settings like 1, 2, 3. Alexa seems to want % instead of settings like 1, 2, 3.
