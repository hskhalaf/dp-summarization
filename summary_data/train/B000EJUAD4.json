I'm very glad I got this one, it's been a week or so and it's been perfect. It did come with a very slight dent, but it's a garbage can... I'd rather just keep it. Taking the buckets out is easy, and I like that I can continue to use normal tall kitchen bags with this. The step function is smooth, no issues or noises there (don't forget to take the packing foam out from beneath the buckets, that will make noise if you don't).",

They were packaged so well with molded styrofoam that I didn\u2019t have any issues with dents like other posters had. I\u2019m very happy with their performance. So far even with the open top, there is no offensive smells coming from them. I would definitely recommend",

No need to buy special bags, standard 13 gallon bags are not a perfect fit but work well enough if you hold them tight around the removable containers as you drop them in. Easy to clean. The lid closes flush/recessed with the trim so my dog can't get it open. The charcoal filter in the lid is a nice feature and seems to help with odor. I didn't use the filter on the recycling side, I saved it as a replacement for the trash side.",

The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is I don't like the idea that the deodorizers are very expensive to replace. Is this where the company makes its money. The can was around $80. You're supposed to change the two deodorizers taht snap into the lid, every few months and they're like $20 something for 3. It's proprietary to say the least because nothing else on line fits in the holders. I need to figure out another way to do this.",
