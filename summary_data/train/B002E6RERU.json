My daughter was in a lovers' spat with her 18 year old boyfriend and accidentally sprayed him in the face while intentionally threatening to spray him in the face with the pepper spray I just bought her to take to college. Long story short, said boyfriend not only vomited but sobbed in crippling pain. About 45 minutes later and after a shower, he returned to functionality. Needless to say, ill rest a little easier knowing she has this protection.",

Just don\u2019t even bother buying it if your plan is to throw it in the bottom of your purse and then ask your attacker to wait a sec while you dig through your make up and old receipts to find your defensive weapon.",

My only wish is that the red lock tab would somehow \"snap\" into place, because I find it too easily moves into the \"use\" position and I am a little nervous about it spraying accidentally.",

But when carried as designed, in hand, there is never any problem. Bought one for family member also. Safety is important.",

Note: best to use a series of short bursts from the pepper gel. We have these in all of our vehicles and all of our regular places of habitation (house, work, RV, etc). We especially like the velcro hand strap for running, exercise and hiking.",

Update a year later: still using this mace for myself and our older teens when they walk to and from work. It is so easy to hold in your hand. We have had some strange moments but never had to use it. It is nice knowing it is available if needed. We do check it in the grass from time to time. It is small and easy to conceal so not everyone knows you have it. Love that it is black to as not to draw attention. The strap is the winner here!",
