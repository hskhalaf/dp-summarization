It is big and takes up a big chunk of my stove top real estate. However, it is sized appropriately to cook evenly just using the center burner. I really liked the high sides on this pan which allowed me to cook a Paella dish that fed 8 people. It is easy to clean with its non-stick surface and the price point made it a no brainer to add to my collection of pans.",
