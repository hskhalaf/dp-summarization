The back pocket fits my 9MM Sig Sauer and it has a snap that allows for quick access. I am very pleased with my purchase...especially for the price I paid.",

He said that the bags are built very well. They're rugged and can handle a good beating. These are definitely a great buy. Also, I contacted the seller (several times) with questions prior to purchasing. They were very prompt in responding and very helpful. I would definitely buy from them again and look forward to purchasing more of their items in the future.",

      "text": "I have been using this for my work pack. I build roofing trusses. Didn\u2019t need a big bag just something to hold pens, tape measure, and other small tools. Outer built in straps were perfect as well for my hammer and framing square to hang on securely and not rattle around and fall off. Been using it for a few months. Greatly surprised by its durability and capacity. Perfect size when you don\u2019t need to carry a full size pack.",
