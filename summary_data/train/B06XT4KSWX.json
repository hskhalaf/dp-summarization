Protect your eyes with ElementsActive Fitover Blue Blocker computer glasses. \n\n\n\n Why is Blocking Blue Light So Important? Blue light doesn't focus on the retina which is the focusing screen of the eye whereas other colors focus close to the retina. When you \"block blue light\" you eliminate this problem. Objects appear clearer, sharper, and well defined. You get amazing clarity and the best protection with high-definition lenses.\n\n\n\n WEAR OVER STYLE - For fitting over existing prescription glasses wearers. The high-definition lenses block blue light, giving you a level of protection and clarity\n\n\n\n IS A REGULAR LENS WITH A SPECIAL COATING? No. it is made with a special blue-light blocking polymer that is directly incorporated into the lens materials. That means the blue- blocking technology won\u2019t chip or wear away. By absorbing blue light, this polymer prevents blue light from passing through the lens to your eye. \n\n\n\n HOW DOES BLUE LIGHT AFFECT THE EYES? Prolonged exposure to high-energy visible (HEV) blue light can cause eye strain and blurred vision. Studies have shown that it can also cause damage to the retinal cells which can lead to an increased risk of developing age-related macular degeneration. Macular degeneration leads to vision loss over time.block blue light and provide maximum UV coverage to protect your eyes.\n\n\n\nABOUT ElementsActive Brand: We specialize in over glasses eyewear for those who wear prescription glasses, and are frustrated with not being able to wear specialized eyewear such as these.",
