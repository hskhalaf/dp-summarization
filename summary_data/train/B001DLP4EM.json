Do NOT buy the vice version unless you have a butcher block/wood counter/table that is less than 1 1/2-2 inches think. I thought it would work better but with my quartz I had to improvise by using cardboard under it so it wouldn\u2019t scratch and that left it a little loose/wobbly. But that\u2019s my fault...I should have just bought the suction one and I still might. I would have given a 5 star, but the handle kept falling off. There should be a nut on the other side of 2 places to hold pieces in better.",

It will gouge, shred or entirely miss the apple leaving you with a mess to clean up and an apple that still requires peeling. Oh, did I mention the parts that rust? A good paring knife or peeler can do the work in half the time with no mess. This is a waste of money and time.",

The only complaint I have is that it's hard to get it clamped well enough that it doesn't slip and twist when I try to use it, so I end up having to hold it in place with one hand. Not a big deal but if I had to do it over again, I'd probably try the suction version.",
