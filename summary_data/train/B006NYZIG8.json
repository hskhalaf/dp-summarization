      "text": "Love this helmet! It's much nicer than the other helmets I have owned. There is extra padding and it laces at the back for a better/closer fit to the head. The strap is more comfortable than other straps on my other helmets. The strap is easier to adjust. The bill on the helmet is a bit longer too which gives a bit better sun protection. This helmet also has a better test crash rating which was important to me after I had an accident with a fairly severe concussion. I was wearing a helmet at the time but it did not protect the back of my head. This helmet comes down a bit further.",

I have an oval-ish head and the fit is perfect. However I will note that in some helmets I wear a 7 and for this one the 6 7/8 fits better. Nicely vented for the hot summers too.",
