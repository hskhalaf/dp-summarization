It doesn't turn on again without getting plugged into a charger. Not to mention the bad calibration of the screen. So if you have three choices to choose from,it only lets you choose the first or the last, never the middle one. And if you open the camera to take a photo on a charging less than 40% it turns off on its own. It's a terrible experience.",

It turned out to be simply an awful experience. I contacted the HTC Support Team to request an exchange for another HTC 10 or, even better and my absolute preference, an HTC U11 -I was willing to pay the difference for the upgrade. To make a long story short, I was only given the option of repairing the defective unit I got. Very wrong. HTC, know that you have lost a loyal customer. I have been disappointed by HTC.\ufeff",
