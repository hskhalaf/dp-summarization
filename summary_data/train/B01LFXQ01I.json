It had great connectivity and high speeds throughout my home. Suddenly about a couple of months ago I began experiencing buffering while watching movies on a TV in my basement. I did some speed tests with a laptop and found that my speeds were 32 times higher near the router than in the basement now. They were much closer when I installed it in January 2018.",
