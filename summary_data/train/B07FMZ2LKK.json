      "text": "This is my second pair of ASICS shoes. My first were some running shoes that were very light weight and breathable. I loved them, but they were getting worn out. The only problem with the old shoes was how soft the soles had become. I could feel rocks and other debris, and it was painful. These new shoes are just a breathable, and they feel just as light (technically they are a little heavier). These shoes have a more ridged sole with more rubber tread, and they provide superior lateral support. They have all the pros (and more) of my old shoes, and none of the cons. I would buy them again.",

The joint/knuckle of my big toe was just the right length in the shoe that when I went to push off my big toe to walk the shoe would \"bite back\" on my toe joint making it feel like it was going to pop out of the socket. I own 2 pairs of asics in 10.5, which this was, and those two pair fit perfectly. This definitely runs small. I cant say by how much because I returned these and will not be trying again.",

I would recommend this shoe for the buyer who is a serious trainer due to weight and not a ton of support. For casual day to day wear, just a very comfortable shoe. If one has a wide foot or needs a lot of structural shoe support for workouts, would recommend a shoe with more structure to it. If you are the running king or queen, and value lightweight comfort with minimal upper foot support, a great choice.",
