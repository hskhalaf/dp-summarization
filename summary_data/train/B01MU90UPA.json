You can do two NY steaks, one good size porterhouse, not cheap, but bought it on sale, I think. I use cheap take out chopsticks to clear the slots, so far so good.",

Grilled chicken breasts had grill marks and were juicy and full of that char grilled flavor. Hamburgers turned out great on it too. I like that it has the deep grill marks and a moat around the edge of the pan to catch drippings. With the spout on the spade, the long handle on one side and the loop handle on the other, it's easy to pour off the grease and to clean. I highly recommend!",

    "description": "Size:10.25\"| Color:BlackWith Le creuset grills you can cut the fat but retain the flavor. The deep ribs separate the fat from the food allowing for healthier cooking. The grills can go on the stove or under the broiler - a rainy day will never prevent you from enjoying your favorite barbeque foods. The ribbed base sears food evenly and gives the characteristic char lines. With Le creuset grills you can serve it with a sizzle. Whether frying, grilling, or sauteing, the satin black enamel interior on our grills can withstand the rigors of everyday use and offer great flexibility. Best of all, they require no seasoning and will not absorb odors or flavors. .",
