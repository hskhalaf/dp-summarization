The piece came from the gate that she clearly found and out in her mouth. Thank god I found her when I did and got it out of her mouth. I would not recommend this product. I would also return it but The return window has closed. I caution buying this product as there are small pieces that can come loose.",

My preschooler (5 years) is really into Legos, but that's obviously a nightmare with little brother around. So this provides a way for my offer son to be able to get in and out of his room (easy enough for him to open and close on his own) without little brother being able to sneak in and destroy his Lego sets. I also love that it doesn't automatically slam closed like some gates, so that we can keep it open at night for my preschooler to be able to easily go to the bathroom.",

Unfortunately, she learned to jump over it because I was also monitoring her on Nest cam and noticed she had escaped. There is a taller version of this gate that is 3 inches higher, but I'm afraid she will eventually learn to jump over that is well. If your dog doesn't have major separation anxiety to the point of jumping to escape, this is a pretty good gate and super easy to assemble. The only negative is that the gate only swings in one direction. However, once open, the door will stay where it is and not swing back closed.",

      "text": "I really do not know how we would survive without these baby gates. We purchased several when our child was an infant and still use them two years later. They allow us to put him in a safe place when there is a spill that we need to clean up or just run to the restroom. They also allow us to separate him from our dog (as he likes to pull on his ears pretty hard!). We have also tried some of the cheaper removable gates, but they are pain. We now have only these in our house. They attach easily to any door and have lasted for two years now and are still in great shape.",

      "text": "I needed this for a 33\" hallway. I needed to block both my baby and yorkie from going that way. The extension made it too tight. Therefore i had to unscrew the screws almost all the way making the gate much less study. With the screws all the way out, my dog can now walk right through the side of the gate... at least the baby is still blocked but the dog goes by whenever he pleases. I would also be afraid of my daughter trying to stand while holding this gate, again it is not very stable. Would definitely not get again.",
