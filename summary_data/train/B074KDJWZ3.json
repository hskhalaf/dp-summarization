Keeps me at ease knowing the temperature isn\u2019t too hot and lets me know when it\u2019s starting to get too cold. Keeps mom and dad from arguing about if it\u2019s too hot or too cold. It\u2019s nice and small enough ito fit into a baby bath tub without taking up too much room and has a fun design I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll love playing with soon! It\u2019s also small enough to travel with, I just stick it in out diaper bag when we go to grandmas so we can take baths there too with this worry saving tool.",

Not only did we need to make sure that the water was not too hot, but more importantly we needed to maintain a certain temp during bath time to make sure the water did not get too cold. This thermometer was PERFECT and we always throw it in the tub during bath time! Plus it's an extra toy for him to play with! You can see in the picture it tells us exactly when the water gets \"cold\" and it's time for him to come out. It will also give a warning when the temp is too hot.",

It came with a battery and worked right out of the box. I didn't have to push buttons or configure it or do any extra work. I literally unwrapped it and it registered the temperature of my hand. Amazing!! It reads temperatures very quickly. Almost instant, but does have about a 2 second lag. I give it 10 stars. This is an amazing product (and super cute!).",

It updates the temp every few seconds so it\u2019s not an instant read but as long as you keep an eye on it and adjust as you go it is awesome. I\u2019ve had mine now for a few months and it still works just as well as day 1. Love it. Would buy again.",
