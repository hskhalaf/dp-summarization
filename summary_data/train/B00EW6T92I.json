We saved money on the airline shipping and I didn't miss any of the clubs I left behind, I was able to take 9 of my favorites. The pocket in front is pretty small but I just attached my regular golf bag to the outside to carry balls etc. It was easy to carry and attach to the golf cart while playing. I'm very happy with it and will leave the big bag at home for future golf holidays.",

The petite size makes it sooooo much easier to transport clubs... in airports, trains, cars, you name it. Because of club length, we still have to check them, but trust me, if we could get away with carrying them on, we totally would. Only down side (and it's not a product flaw), is that the airlines charge for excess baggage, so we end up consolidating these two tiny bags into one larger bag. But we play on vacation much more frequently because we're not carrying around a massive set of clubs. Thanks K-Cliffs!!!",

My only complaint is that the zippered pocket really should have the zipper run in the opposite direction (top, down, not bottom, up) (or have a dual zipper that could be opened and closed from either perspective). When using the bag in the upright position you'd use to pull your clubs out, the zippered pocket opens from the bottom to the top, rendering it useless, as whatever is in the pocket falls out/down. I would recommend (with a caveat).",

It was kind of funny and scary in the same thought. Anyway I use it all the time at the range. I tried to use this playing Par 3 and Executive 9 Hole course but the lack of pockets make it fall short. Piel Leather Executive Golf Travel Bag Saddle seem to be what one might look for but it might be too expense.",
