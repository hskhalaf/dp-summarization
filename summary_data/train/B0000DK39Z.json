Seeing that so many people have had this same problem shows that Olympus makes poor quality equipment even in there more expensive cameras. Look elsewhere.",

I also had heard of some problems with the C5060 so I purchased an additional 2 yr warranty from Olympus for only $50. So far (over 1yr) I've not had any problems. The camera takes great pictures, with excellent color even in low light conditions. I've take outdoor, long range, indoor, macro closeups, etc and every picture looks good to me. I especially like the C5060's picture quality in no flash indoor pictures. Overall a very good camera with excellent results.",

As first, I thought it was the LCD problem but when I took a picture. The picture turned out all badly which than I realized it's the CCD problem.

In a word, it is unreliable. You're probably better off looking for a more reliable camera.",
