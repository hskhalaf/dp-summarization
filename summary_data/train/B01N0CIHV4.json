I'll probably replace it with a protector that has cut outs for the front camera. Other than that, great deal for the items provided!",

I didn't really get it for the screen protector, but the one I had on it at the moment was cracked so I switched it, so that's good too. There's a raised lip around the camera and the screen for protection. Love everything about this!",

So, when you put the back piece on the phone there is like a 1/16\u201d gap all the way around the phone which seems like nothing but a dirt trap.

I have tried to lift it off and put it on again, but I have not been able to get it to stick down in this one small corner. I will now contact the company for a replacement.

      "text": "Good case--dropped the phone twice from pretty high up and no breaks or cracks. The camera protector is great--took a bunch of pictures and there aren't any glares or weird effects from the sun. Tempered glass protector is nice too--responds to touch and protected the screen from cracking when I dropped it. The one criticism that I have is this: the tempered glass doesn't completely fill the body of the phone. There is about a 1/4 to 1/8 inch gap between the case and the tempered glass. I would've liked it better if the glass was larger on each of the sides so that there isn't a gap. Otherwise, works great.",
