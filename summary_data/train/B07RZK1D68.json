Users were especially impressed with the improvements in the shoe\u2019s structural elements, as well as the performance it delivers. Comfort, support, and fit were some of the winning points of the shoe. Fans of the previous edition of the shoe will love the Wave Rider 23, but maybe not if they expect a highly remarkable change.",

        "Another claimed that it offers just the right level of firmness to keep the shoe from feeling mushy",
        "Several wearers report that the Wave Rider 23 gives a secure and accurate fit, which meets their expectations",
        "Some testers report that the shoe promotes natural movements and allows a comfortable experience in both running and walking activities",

My advice is to choose the size based on cm rather than any other scale, my 28.5cm is an asics euro 45, while the same 28.5cm is a mizuno euro 44 size. Anyway, using the cm worked for me as the size I ordered fits perfectly. Great running shoe overall",
