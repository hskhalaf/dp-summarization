We used to have a similar product in a small child version, but these are much more beefy and bouncy. My boys fly all over the house in them. They've been bouncing nonstop, which is great. The noise may be a little annoying, but they are getting exercise which is especially great in the cold winter months when they are inside a lot. I highly recommend this product. It's a great old-school, type toy any kid would love and the price is great.",
