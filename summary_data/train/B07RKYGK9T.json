They shoe is lightweight and mostly comfortable. However, there is just too much room for the foot to move around in the front. This was most problematic during descents, when my foot was sliding around in the shoe. Lacing them tighter wasn't much help. I guess I recommend these if you have sasquatch feet; otherwise, find another shoe.",
