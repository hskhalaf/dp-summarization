      "text": "Excellent replacement pump at a great price! Installed quickly and is extremely quiet! Have only used for a month so hope the longevity is there. I did call company to confirm that full warranty only if professionally installed. Very dissatisfied that a simple install by a knowledgeable pool owner voids 2 year warranty. I believe I was told 60 days is self-installed. If installed properly and runs immediately then clearly the installation was done properly. Company should stand behind their products without buyer being ripped off by a professional installation which would at least double the cost!",

      "text": "Recently replaced an old 2hp 15 year old pump. This pentair 1hp is moving as much water as my old 2hp did at what feels like a higher pressure. The pump itself is incredibly quiet , so much so I need to walk over to make sure it's on. The install itself was relatively quick (even though ive never done one before). Electrical is super straight forward plug and play pretty much. I like the fact this pump came with the pipe adapters for 1 1/2 , which made install easier. I will update the review in a year to see where it's at. Fingers crossed it lasts as long as my original.",

Plumbing was a little more involved than I hoped, since the existing piping of my old unit didn't match the new configuration, but 2 runs to Home Depot solved that. I had trouble getting it to prime at first, but after a prayer, plus adding plumber's tape to and only hand-tightening the inlet and outlet screw-on adapters, dumping several gallons of water into the leaf basket, opening the bleeder valve, and turning my diverter valve half-way between skimmer & suction, it primed successfully. It runs strong and quiet, and will be a great replacement in lieu of a $1,200 price tag from the local Home Depot or Leslie's Pool Supply store!",

These specialty pool supply mega-stores WILL NOT install a pump that you purchase on your own and give you the lame excuse that they cannot back the warranty. BS.

This is my second 1hp superpump, and the second time I have redone the wiring and tried to change out the capacitor since I didn't twist the dial. Mind you, most people use 220 and if it came 115 and someone hooked it up to 220, that would fry the motor. For me, wiring 115 but having it set to 220, the motor makes a gentle hum but won't turn on. Switched to 115 and now it is powerful and quiet, as expected.",

Instead like so many other things you buy now, they suggest a professional to hook it up. It isn't rocket science folks but do what ever you think you are capable of. I did it myself, saving likely at least a C note.",
