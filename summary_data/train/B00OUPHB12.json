It leaks a little bit so I would reccomend a towel under machine while using. The machine is very fast. If you are making snow cones this machine would be great!",

As other reviewers have noted, it takes a bit of the first batch of ice to bring the machine down to temperature. This hasn't been a big concern for me. I would recommend making sure to use very hard, solidly frozen ice. I have a countertop ice maker that I was thinking would be perfect to accompany this. Using the ice from that produces a chunkier, less satisfying shaved ice. Using ice that's been hardened in the freezer produces perfect, fluffy shaved ice. Kids absolutely love this. Very cheap way to have fun all summer long! I am very, very glad I bought this.",

It\u2019s tougher to packed into and ice cream cone shape the fluffier it is, but we made it work, no problem. The only flaw is that I would like the bowl to go farther under the shaver piece.

This shaved ice machine produces almost snow like ice and is currently in my dad's restaurant as a backup in case his commercial machine breaks. Obviously it won't put out the quantity of ice the commercial machine does but the quality of the shaved ice is very close. Obviously not meant for commercial use but it will work in a pinch. VERY IMPRESSIVE for the price! I haven't had it long enough to speak about durability but based on first impressions I am very satisfied.",

No ice got stuck in the blades and there was basically no clean up. We did not use the ice tray. We just put cups directly under the machine to fill. In terms of safety, I turned it off when not immediately in use or when filling it with more ice.",
