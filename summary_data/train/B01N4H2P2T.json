      "text": "When I old my husband that I am buying this for our camping trips he was laughing at me and saying how \"we don't need it\". This little generator is so powerful and versatile We are not only using it when camping but we use it at home, while sitting on the deck. Charging our outdoor speaker, using to power our umbrella lights, charging our phone while sitting by the fire and don't have outlet handy. I love to have it on our road trips so I can charge my Cannon camera batteries, as well. My husband now loves this thing and admits that he was wrong and I was right. As usual. :-)",

It has a smaller footprint than the traditional power tank and fits easily on the accessory platform on my old Celestron Wedgepod. No more tripping on wiring harnesses for me! What's more, the Amp-hour rating on this little Lithium cell is vastly greater than any of the other power tanks I've used. I could actively run a Go-to scope all night on a single charge.",

You have to buy a solar panel to go with it. I tested it once, successfully to see that it would turn on and power things as expected. But when I really needed it, last month, it would not turn on. I left it charging for about 24 hours, and there was still no power. It was not there when I needed it most...",

I think its great to have as back up for power failures etc, great for travel. Very small and so much easier to carry around than the black & Decker charger I used to use. A little pricey but worth it for the small size. Would love to know about the solar attachment.",

Had it 18 months and usually I would unplug the AC charger ASAP when the unit hit full charge. As was sure to happen sooner or later I left it on the charger one time overnight and it was toast. At this price point no overcharge protection is inexcusable. Save your money and look elsewhere",

The unit came fully charged, but plugged in for about an hour and the reading was saying full charge.
