I have used other harnesses over the years that have fit better but many of them were the larger commercial style harnesses.",

I gave only 4 stars because it barely fit my height. I'm 6'2\" and 190lbs and it felt like it was a half size too small, like the height max was 5'10\". Even with the leg straps all the way out I was singing saprano every time I bent over which is just about all the time when you're working on a roof.
