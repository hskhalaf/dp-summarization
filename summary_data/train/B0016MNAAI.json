      "text": "I had an initially good impression of these headphones, however, the jack adaptor snapped at the base, and with it went the tip of the 3.5 jack so these are now useless. The break reveals the jacks are just plastic tubes wrapped in yellow metal. Extremely disappointing. UPDATE: Whilst it wasn't easy to find the information I needed, I was able to get in touch with Beyerdynamic and they arranged to repair them without any fuss. All I had to do was pack them up and mail them across. The repair was fast and hassle-free and I had them back within 3 days.",

      "text": "Best wired headphones I have owned so far. Love the clarity and response. they can handle themselves amped up too. very comfortable over long periods. I use them predominantly with my PS4 either gaming - including VR and they just clear the headband - perhaps a little too close though I am worried that repeated use with vr might result in damage to my phones (i'll just buy another pair), or watching movies with my amp plugged in for extra crunch. I love these. they are quite large and the wire is quite long too.",

Good comfort, and initially impressive sound, but the boost in the upper mids quickly becomes grating, and the sucked out lower mids (typical ploy to give the impression of a wide soundstage) doesn't impress an experienced listener. The age old problem of the white paint on the model id on the sides of the cups doesn't impress either. Ok. in hifi terms they are cheap and cheerful, but The almost hysterical praise bestowed upon them on line and in reviews is unwarranted. (From a headphone listener of 45 years of cans right across the spectrum.)",

My main reason for buying these over the DT880's or 990's (sound isolation when using these to monitor recording at home) seems to be delivered reasonably well",

All being said though, the sound is incredible for mixing and recording music as well as practising my digital piano. the sound is so good its almost better than hearing it through the speakers!!!",

So much lower I have returned them and ordered the 80 ohm version. It was a surprise to me so if you are using a Focusrite Scarlett interface then I'd suggest not getting the 250 ohm version. The headphones looked great quality and have a good reputation so I will do another review once I have the 80 ohm version in a few days",

Amazingly comfortable thanks to the velour ear pads, I can wear them for hours at work and at home. They were recommended by my friend, a DJ for Chorley FM and comparing them to the 250 ohm studio version he uses, there is very little difference other than volume when connected to a non-amplified source and a slightly bassier tone on my 80 ohms.

I purchased for added studio monitoring. They are really articulate and do pick faults with a bad mix down, so perfect for my intended use as a reference. As a side note, these headphones are loud within a studio environment, just plugged straight into a mixer. I have never needed to turn them over 50% on volume without hurting those delicate ears... Another added bonus, as with all the DT770 range is that you can get spares, which is brilliant for wear and tear, cups, headband, etc.",

I personally didn't like the leather pad so I swapped it for the 'Norman's beyer pad.

They do not have unbalanced sound in the lows or highs, the balance is perfect. Studio monitors mean they have a long wire, useful for dedicated home use when traversing your room. Does not require a DAC with modern devices but still worth getting one if you want the extra enhanced experience.",

      "text": "I already owned a pair of Beyerdynamic DT880's before purchasing the 770's. The 880's, although very clear and spacious, I always felt they were a bit light on bass for the type of music I tend to listen to (electronic mainly). The 770's (I have the 80 Ohm version with a Beresford Caiman DAC/headphone amp and Sonos Connect) fill in the gap with much more bottom end, without sacrificing the clarity of the mids and highs. Sound isolation is excellent to so you don't need to play them too loud to get the full effect. Well worth buying especially given the relatively low price.",

The sound of 770s is not as rich and transparent. Bass is kinda dry. Trebles are harsh and sibilant - could be annoying. All in all - dry sound. But they have some increased response on about 50-60Hz, so could punchy on some artificial heavy bass music. Sound stage is quite wide for closed headphones. Velour earpads are comfortable but leaks a lot of sound - not good choice for work in office. I hope that more warming up could help with the sound, and I want to try with another amp|dac.",

These headphones are incredible, but sadly, after just over a year of use, the right headphone on my pair have started buzzing and its become to off-putting that I can no longer use them anymore. They are great headphones, but if this happens in less than two years of use (I've had mine since the end of March, 2018), I can't really recommend. Hoping to resolve this issue with the seller soon.",

For a product costing almost 100 GBP, the sound quality is average. The pitch range is not what was advertised and I get crackling noises on some music pieces. Usually, I buy cheap in-ear buds (mostly Sony) for 10-15 GBP and the sound is not much worse. The base might be slightly better on the Beyerdynamic phones but at least my Sony's never crackle. To be frank, I don't see the point of spending 10 times more money on a product that is only about 3% better than my usual cheap alternative.",

They are relatively quiet due to their high ohm rating but you wont have to worry about them getting blown. You may want to consider less ohm rated in the same model if you want to listen at higher volumes. This will all depend on the equipment you are plugging them into. Using them straight out of the headphone Jack on your computer or mobile phone for example may leave you wanting more volume. Great honest sound, german made, recomend the range highly.",
