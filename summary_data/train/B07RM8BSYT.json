I switched to zero or minimal drop shoes about eighteen months ago, and all of my back pain has gone away! I don't think these shoes would work for me as a running shoe, but I wear them all day walking around New York City, and they were the only shoe I brought on a three week trip to Bangkok. I can walk all day in them with no complaints.",

But if you even occasionally need to go for wides. They look and feel well put together. The black and dark blue is understated, but not plain. As a minimal style, there's no arch support. The soles are more flexible than standard styles, but not as bendy as the other minimal styles I own. Very low profile and flat. Very happy with the quality versus the price, and for me they're a great fit.",

What I mean is that it has the material needed for foot containment/protection but it's minimal in the sense that there is no angle keeping your heel higher than your toes. It also has minimal sole. The result is that you're more connected to the ground when you lift weights or do other exercises. Not cushy at all, so know what you're getting into. But great construction and fit. Excellent workout shoe.",

I run a quarter mile to warm up, and that's about as long as I could handle. The base is too flat for a good run, but it's a great stable base for weight training. They do run narrow, so if you have wide-ish feet get the your size in wide. They also look great as a semi casual shoe with a good pair of dark jeans if that's your flavor. Definitely recommend!",
