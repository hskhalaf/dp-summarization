Mr. Schwinn would roll in his grave if he knew that his company moved its production to China and let the quality decrease to this point!",

The gears shift smoothly and the ride is comfortable especially with the extra padding on the seat. Quick release adjustment on the seat height, and a quick release for the front wheel if you need to put in in your trunk. The luggage rack has a spring clamp which makes carrying small items easy. The only issue I had so far was with the fenders. Plastic and seem to get just a little twisted if leaned up against, say a tree or a wall. Just pull them, unbend them, whatever and you're good to go.",

Luckily, a friend was able to take off the mudflap bolt and tie the piece that would attach to the bolt to the bolt whole and then there was enough room for the bike-trailer attachment.

Takes some time to assemble as the instructions are generic for many models and poorly written. Plan to ditch the seat if you like comfort. We also put on new seat posts as the ones that come with it slip a bit too much. We are very happy with these bikes.",

I have had many commuter bikes in my life and I think this one is the best. I like sitting in an upright position (easy on the back)and the seat is wide and comfy. I am 5 feet 7 inches tall and this bike fits like a dream. It looks good and I get lots of compliments as I zip around the bike trails. Go ahead and spend the money to take it to a bike shop for assembly. This is a transportation investment type of bike and it is well worth the money.",

Schwinn sent a new wheel, tire and innertube and paid the bike shop to install it. I do love the bike but it was frustrating (and expensive for the first 3 tire changes). It seems to be fine now.
