I included some pictures of what it looks like straight out of the box, with a water bottle next to it so you can get an idea of how tall it is. It is machine washable, but I would advise you to wash it on the most delicate cycle you possibly can in cold water. You wouldn't want its marble eyes to get scratched in the washing machine.",

The whole elephant appears poorly made and there are strings hanging off one of the arms. The ears on this one are smaller, the tail is shorter, the fur doesnt hide the seams and his eyes appear to be glued on in a hurry.",

She has about 500 other stuffed animals but, she never liked any of them as much as she loves this one. It is very cute and super soft. She is 12 and I'm pretty sure that this little gray elephant would bring anyone of any age lots of joy. I give Amazon two thumbs up for this one!!",
