      "text": "I love it and it's really easy to use. I had determined that my next point and shoot would record in HD and working at indoor soccer arena the results have been stunning. Uploading the videos of game to Youtube has produced videos that look sharp and the camera does well to keep up when auto focusing resulting in less blur. Generous viewfinder. Only drawbacks would be the microphone is located at the top of the camera which leads me to covering it a lot and the resulting muffled audio is disappointing. Also the battery is proprietary so either buy an extra or be sure to have it charged before going out.",

The videos will play on my camaera, but not my computer. I have researched that, but am unable to find a solution. Last week I purchased an IPhone 4s and am hoping to just get rid of my camera completely. I would stay away from this one.",

I take it with me when riding my motorcycle, which I probably wouldn't want to do with the pricier new one - I don't mind if it gets scratched sliding past the zipper of my jacket pockets",

I've already recommended it to friends who have also shown an interest in getting a new camera. I can also recommend 17th Street Camera as the seller.

I wanted a large view screen (3\" or larger), but this 2.7\" screen works fine, and my pictures that I have made so far have beautiful color and clarity with the AUTO setting.

More than 8x zoom would require a tripod for virtually any camera. Color is decent too. I recommend this camera based on my limited use so far.",

The stabilization works well with the zoom all the way out as well. Videos seem to work well too.

    "description": "Color:RedFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n Panasonic's Lumix DMC-ZR3 digital camera features powerful zoom within a remarkably slim and compact body. Newly added is an AVCHD Lite movie recording function to make the versatile camera even truly \"hybrid\". \n\nThe new image processing technology \"Intelligent Resolution\" is incorporated in the Venus Engine HD II for ZR3. By detecting the signals whether they are at edges of the subject, they compose detailed texture or just a soft gradation first and give appropriate enhancement to the edges and textured areas respectively. Unlike the uniform enhancement of sharpness, it is possible to perform the optimum signal processing to give a whole image outstandingly natural clearness with fine detail. \n\nThis technology is integrated in iA (Intelligent Auto) mode--a hallmark of Lumix cameras--working thoroughly while the camera is in the iA mode to enhance its potential in many aspects. The iA mode is also available in movie mode. It automatically selects the most suitable Scene mode and helps to correct handshake, focus and brightness problems--making the iA mode your one-stop solution to capture beautiful photos and movies. \n\n\n\nThe powerful 8x optical zoom lens makes it easy to pull in subjects from far away a step closer compared to the conventional stylish point-and-shoot cameras. For an added boost, zoom power can be increased to 10x with the Intelligent Zoom function taking advantage of the Intelligent Resolution technology maintaining the picture quality even combining a digital zoom. The 25mm ultra wide-angle feature is ideal for both broad landscapes and tight indoor shots, letting photographers capture a wider view. The 14.1-megapixel high resolution CCD reproduce the detailed images corner to corner and affordable with trimming or even more powerful Extra Optical Zoom by using the center part of it. \n\nNotably the Sonic Speed AF in the ZR3 features its speed at the industry's fastest level. Combined with a high-speed start-up, this gives the ZR3 an ultra fast response that helps to catch even the most fleeting photo opportunities. The 2.7-inch large Intelligent LCD offers dynamic and clear view out of its small body. The battery life is also as powerful as approx. 330 pictures shooting thanks to the highly energy efficient image processing LSI, the Venus Engine HD II. \n\nWith high-quality aluminum texture which resists fingerprints and soiling, the slim, compact, pocket-fitting size of ZR3 is packed with a host of functions for both photos and movies to be an ideal partner for traveling or for everyday snapshots. \n\nLumix DMC-ZR3 Highlights \n\n25mm Ultra Wide-angle Lens\nThe 25mm ultra wide-angle lens* has about twice the shooting area as a standard 35mm lens. This enhances all kinds of shooting situations, like when you're photographing a group of people at an indoor party or shooting a large structure or sweeping landscape while traveling.\n* Converted to standard 35mm camera equivalent, at the maximum wide position. \n\n10x Intelligent Zoom/16.9x Extra Optical Zoom\nThanks to the newly incorporated Intelligent Resolution technology, the Intelligent Zoom is available with the DMC-ZR3 which extends the zoom ratio by approx. 1.3x maintaining the picture quality even combining a digital zoom. This means the 8x optical can virtually extend to 10x equivalent. Furthermore, the Extra Optical Zoom function that extends zoom power to 16.9x* by using the center part of the large CCD to bring subjects even closer.\n*At 3-megapixel resolution or less. \n\n\nHD Movie in AVCHD Lite\nIn addition to Motion JPEG images, the DMC-ZR3 can record high-definition motion images in AVCHD Lite. It features almost double the recording time in HD quality compared with the conventional Motion JPEG format. \n\nPowerful 8x Optical Zoom\nThe DMC-ZR3 also lets you use zooming when taking motion pictures. Its powerful 8x optical zoom is ideal for capturing dynamic video clips of sports action or animals in nature. \n\n\nHigh Quality Sound\nThe DMC-ZR3 features Dolby Digital Creator to record high quality audio, so you can match the beautiful movies with outstanding sound. \n\nPOWER O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer) Shake Detection\nJust about everyone has had the experience of taking a photo at night and hoping to capture all the memories and beauty, only to be disappointed at the poor result. The POWER O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer)* nearly doubles the hand-shake correction power of conventional MEGA O.I.S. You get bright photos without blurring even from handheld shooting at slow shutter speeds. Panasonic's accumulated optical technologies, the MEGA O.I.S. has been incorporated into Lumix from the early stage of digital camera development. This helped show all digital camera users the absolute need for hand-shake compensation, and led to its prevalence throughout the industry. And now, Panasonic has worked on the low-frequency vibration hand-shake component, which is physically generated when pressing the shutter button or when shooting at night with a slow shutter speed.\n*The POWER O.I.S. is automatically turned on in the iA Mode and can be turned on or off in the Normal Picture Mode or some Scene Modes.",
