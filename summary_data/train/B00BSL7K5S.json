The open slats allow your sopping wet umbrella to air-dry thoroughly. Another fabulous feature is the metal base, which keeps the rain water from soiling your beautiful hardwood floor. I've been using a squatty flower pot to hold my wet umbrellas, but they always flopped over and got in my way. So now, I have this lovely conversation piece which performs an important function at the same time. We should all possess those 2 qualities, RIGHT?",
