The bag is under warranty but what good is the warranty if you never hear back from the company? These bags are also on the smaller side, and I wish there were more pockets. The lack of a shoulder strap makes carrying these bags a real pain, especially when you are using two of them--forget about carrying anything else. Overall, I wish I bought a different par of panniers!",

At first I thought I the bags would be too small, but after serval double pannier grocery rides, all can be carried. I did have to modify the bottom clip (I used an old clip from another bag) as the original clip didn\u2019t swivel into the right place for my bike rack. It was a minor modification. My only wish is for a longer handle strap that could be thrown over ones shoulder for easier transport. Support minor and not a deal breaker. Well made!",

You have to be very careful snapping the straps on making sure they line-up properly or you could easily break them. I didn't experience any problems but I was careful.",

      "text": "I wanted to like these panniers, they look good, and they were easy to take on and off the bike and held quite a bit for my 3 day trip. However they are not waterproof even with the rain covers. they may do ok for a sprinkle or tiny bit of rain but not a thunderstorm kind of rain. I should have put a trash bag within it to keep my stuff dry but wanted to see how they did. Not sure how they will do for durability but they did hold up for my 3 day trip except for getting everything wet!",
