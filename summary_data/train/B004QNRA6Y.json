Also, when the cold winter comes around I\u2019ve always fought peeling lips and this one keeps it to a bare minimum. Especially if I use fresh sugar\u2019s lip scrub.",

It glides on very easily and stays on quite awhile. The best part is the plastic dispenser - the cap twists one way to come off (rather than pulling straight up), and then the balm rises up by twisting the other way. This prevents it from coming apart in your purse, and making a mess! The size is just a bit larger than the usual drug store balms and it is well worth the price.",

This lip balm does not stay on for as long as it states, I have to continue to put it on just like any other lip balm I own and or have owned in the past. My concern is all the great reviews makes me question if they are actually legit. I am not saying that this lip balm totally doesn't do the job, but charging 24.00 is totally a rip off knowing it doesn't do anything more than regular lip balms. I feel like I got robbed.",
