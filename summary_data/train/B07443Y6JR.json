I was home when they were delivered, and the man clearly just dropped the package to the ground. I was so worried that his lack of care would have caused these to break. However, all 60 glasses were in perfect condition. The packaging was great; each row was lined with thin foam for protection. The subtle glitter on the gold set is a nice touch. Even my husband likes them (and he usually hates glitter). These are perfect for anyone seeking disposable but elegant champagne flutes.",

Bottom line: Be prepared to tell all users about this deficiency, and/or... Get some crazy glue and start gluing those pieces permanently.",

Usually with plastic flutes, they snap in and are secure, these however did not fit. We had to hot glue each bottom to the flute. Again not a huge deal but just a little disappointed with the product. They were cute and went well with our theme.",
