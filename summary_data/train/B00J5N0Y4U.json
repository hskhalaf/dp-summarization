My skin is healthier and hyperpigmentation is less visible after 3 months of using it. Also, my skin is acne prone, oily combination, but this product does not cause any breakout to my face.",

As I rubbed my face it felt like residue of some sort was balling up on my fingers; as if my face had not been cleaned. I continued using it, making sure may face was scrubbed prior, waiting longer to put on moisturizer. This lasted for 2 months and since I wasn't noticing any changes in my skin, other than losing a lot of product on my fingers, I tossed it.",

I was desperate! Very very happy waking up and saw my face. My skin doesn't feel dry, itchy, and tight. No rashes, redness, bumps nothing. My skin is verrrryyyy sensitive since July. This is the best thing!!! I'm not getting any free stuff from giving this review! Honest to goodness. Highly recommended!",
