The \"perfect Putt\" hole actually works, if you hit exactly the correct line and speed the ball gets stuck in the hole.",

Before this I used to hit 14 balls in several different drills (speed drills and putt at a quarter). With Puttout I use one ball and because it\u2019s coming back to me I get many more reps per time invested. This is so simple it\u2019s brilliant. Working to get the ball to stop in the hole increases concentration and promotes calm hands for solid contact in the sweet spot.",
