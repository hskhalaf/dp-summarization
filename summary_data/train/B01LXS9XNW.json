I know, I know, could ask for a refund, but a good friend of mine, wich happens to be a chemical industrial mechanic told me this pump can be fixed, that it is reliable, He said two things\" before it's first use ( break-in period), has to be primed with diesel or silicone lubricant abundantly, and before assembly of the spare parts, the rotor, inside housing and pump cover, all has to be polished\". The manufacturer doesn't tell you this in it's owner's manual. I did what he told me, and the pump is working with no hassle.",

You can switch the fitting on the tubes and just use the bottom section of it's too long as mine was. I couldn't find an adapter anywhere to fit the fine threads.",

Don't bother reading them! Just watch the assembly video they have posted for it down in the information section. Once you've watched the video it is very easy to assemble! Works great! I bought 2 of them, one for gas and one for diesel on the farm. So much better than a hand pump!",

There is s short somewhere, but it's not in the wiring which has bad insulation from that factory (broken inside of the switch housing), the switch or anywhere else obvious so it's probably a bad rotor. I'm not even sure how much time this is worth diagnosing, as everything I look at in more detail just leads to finding other poor quality and construction that is sure to make it stop working in the future. $250 and it pumped about 25 gallons. Because I bought it in November and don't need much fuel over the winter it's been too long to return it, so I guess that's a lesson learned.",

I had read some reviews that said the water-block filter bowl leaked, so I used just a dab of ky jelly on the gasket and didn\u2019t lose a drop. I did put a different suction tube because the one that came with it was too short for the oval-shaped tank. Keep the tube 2-3 inches off the bottom of the tank. The hose is nice and flexible, but you\u2019ll want to add a swivel between it and the pump so it doesn\u2019t kink at that point.",
