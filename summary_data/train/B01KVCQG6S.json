I called ninja to see what they could do but they offered for me to purchase a new jug. No coverage and just very insincere apology. I told the rep I\u2019d much prefer to purchase a brand new blender than to replace a jug that didn\u2019t even last 6 months. Terrible experience. Even worse customer service",

This one is amazing I have been using it for purees and smoothies and it works like a charm. It successfully blends harder foods into a nice smoothie consistency. I would say the only drawback is I find I have to run the smoothie setting twice for a nice consistency, but not enough of an issue to take a star from my rating. Great blender at an affordable price.",

It's so annoying that people who use this have to separate it or find another place for it other than on your Countertop. If it was just a half inch shorter it could fit. The base is a bit bulky too. It does a great job making smoothies!",
