Greg is very honest and upfront about what it takes to pass these brutal exams as well as a few strategic points which are not to be overlooked. The chapter on CFA vs. MBA will be quite useful to those thinking about a career in Finance and which option to choose or perhaps both. Having passed 2 of these exams and getting ready for Level 3 exam next June, I can tell you that many of his suggestions are right on point.",

Since I'm not in finance myself I have never actually known anyone who holds the CFA charter nor anyone who's actually taken one of the exams either, so his honesty and openness about his own struggles with the path to the charter were illuminating to me personally.. I also gained some very practical tips about timelines to preparation, etc. I think this book occupies a unique or niche space in this particular area. I'd encourage anyone involved with the CFA pursuit either past or present to read the book. Thanks for writing it Greg!!",
