      "text": "I am something of an audiophile, have worked in sound recording and reinforcement, and have built several speaker cabinets with great success. I have had good experience with Dayton Audio products in the past and thought at this price I would be good deal.. My first version of this review panned these speakers as heavy in upper midrange and deficient in bass. But once I did what the manufacturer suggests and placed them on the floor, things really improved. The tweeters are just a little below my ears, but the highs are fine. The bass is noticeably boosted and the harsh midrange is attenuated. They are good for the price. They look nice with the covers on or off.",

I use this system in my garage. These speakers pack more bass than I thought they would and can shake the walls. The AIR functionality is awesome as plenty of air flows from these speakers at louder volumes. The sound is pretty clean, and overall, I'm giving these a 4.5 out of 5 based off the value and quality combination. I'm happy with this purchase and will continue rocking out.",

They look and handle smaller than the size description states, and the sound easily fills up our living area (15\u2019x30\u2019). I bought these as the first stage of a new home stereo configuration, but I don\u2019t think I need any further sub or tweeters - these two speakers are enough. I read a couple reviews that suggested they sound weak, but I strongly disagree. For much less cheddar than a far worse Bluetooth monitor, I\u2019d go with these.",

Much better sound. I have a 10\u201d Cerwin Vega sub to do the bass. The combination sounds awesome! Without the sub thr is bass loss but you have to realize that if you want a lot of bass, any 6.5\u201d mid bass speakers will lack in that department.",
