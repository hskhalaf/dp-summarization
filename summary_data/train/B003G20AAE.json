Not bad at Sigma's price point. A constant aperture, or a 2.8, or a 1.4 at the same focal lengths would cost alot more. A good suggestion it to go to a brick and mortar store an put the lens in it's paces on your camera. Then you can get a feel for it's bokeh as well as how much light goes through the lens at F/5.6.",

Also, you will need photo editing software to correct the distortion when using this lens (tilting the camera/lens even slightly up or down will cause distortion). A77's auto correction fuction (for lens distortion) appears to work with only Sony lenses. The lens is pretty heavy and the build quality is really good (made in Japan). However, you will not be able to use filters on this lens due to the shape of the front element.",

The very center of the image is acceptable but the father from the center you look the worse it becomes until there is virtually no image left. Sigma examined the lens and said \"it's wonderful -the best\" but I suspect he had been hitting the bottle or smoking something! Don't buy it unless you like impressionist type of images.",
