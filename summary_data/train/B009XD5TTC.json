This item is made of very low quality materials. All mechanical parts of this bin are flimsy. The stainless steel shell is the only part that is quality material. 2 of the 3 lids opened only 1-2\" when I stepped on the foot pedals. The one that opened properly then wouldn't close unless I pushed it down with my hand. Save your money and avoid the headache.",
