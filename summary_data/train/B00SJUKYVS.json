Love the fact that I can connect external speakers to complement the internal ones. Very retro look. Neat remote controls; one for music, one for lights. Can operate lights and music independently. Some aspects of it could be modernized, but neat overall.",

For features available the device is on the pricey side, I would expect it to do more. Also, given the price tag I would expect less plastic and more metal/wood. Overall I am satisfied, it does what it's suppose to, has a great sound, and has an okay build quality. Time will tell how long it lasts.",
