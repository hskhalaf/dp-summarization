The other issue is with trying to remove this liner. It takes forever! Even with eye makeup remover, specifically designed for nothing more than the purpose of removing eye makeup, this liner is the worst with removal.",

It's not stiff enough, so it's easier to make mistakes. You don't have the same control as you do with a felt tip marker applicator. The product itself is good, but just wish the applicator brush was different. I think I won't buy it again.",

There's nowhere to hold on without getting eyeliner on your hands, so you are applying it at a very distant angle that makes accuracy/a straight line nearly impossible. Once it's on, it's on - which I guess would be a plus if it were possible to get it in the right spot. Also, once applied, it flaked little black specks all over all day long.",
