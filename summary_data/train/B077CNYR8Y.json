On a lesser card from the same manufacturer, the card crashed within 10-15 seconds. I'm not aware of a review anywhere for any other card that has zero crashes with maximum settings. Interestingly, this card was released by Amplin this month.\ufeff With all of the confusion regarding what cards work with the GH5, I just had to post my experience to try to help.",
