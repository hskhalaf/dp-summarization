I bought it because I almost choked to death on 2 different brands of uncoated zinc tablets that stick in the throat because they start dissolving before it can be swallowed. These are in gel capsules, although quite large they slide right down even taking 2 at a time. The capsules are clear & the ingredient looks like ground up dried food, which is what it is suppose to be. I take them an hour before bedtime to help me sleep & I think they help my immune system & promote clearer thinking, too.",

They\u2019re easy to swallow, no taste and obviously do their job as far as absorbency is concerned. I love the fact that they come in a dark glass bottle in order to preserve the product\u2019s quality. I would highly recommend this to be your brand of choice. Definitely a great value!!",
