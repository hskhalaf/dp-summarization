He would just sit there and shake, never seemed relaxed, and getting him to eat was a chore. As soon as I put this on him he stretched out on the floor and for the first time in months just relaxed (pictured). It is wonderful having his old self back. I used to work at a pet store that sold the Thundershirt and to be honest I like this wrap better. The material is stretchier and softer. My guy is around 60lbs but is on the thinner side and could have done with a medium, but the large will work fine.",

Also, it calms her nerves when we have parties with lots of guests and noise. She enjoys that now with the shirt. My ONLY complaint is that it does not seem to help with her fear of lightning for some reason. Over all- this shirt is a MIRACLE!",
