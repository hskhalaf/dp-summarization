You hold the set button until the numbers flash then you hit one of the other buttons to change them, like every other digital clock ever. Someone said it's made of plastic, no, it's made out of cheap aluminum which is exactly what you get for $26. Someone said it's small, and I can see that because I have little wimpy wrists. The indiglo works awesome, just like a new feature in 1992 should. I love this watch.",

      "text": "I purchased this watch in March. Two months later, the silver finish started coming off the plastic body of the watch. Today, (mid July), the expansion band broke, and the finish is almost entirely off the plastic housing. The warranty does not cover the body, the band or the battery. It does still keep time, so I guess I can remove the band and use it as a pocket watch!",

But wait, I still have my old watch from the 80's, not in great shape anymore, but the clasp-style band is in perfect condition. Because this is the \"same\" watch, I was able to swap the expansion band for the clasp style bracelet. In short, I give the watch 5 stars, but I deduct one for the awful stretch-expansion type band. I wish Timex would make this classic watch available with a clasp band, so that I wouldn't have had to do surgery.",

      "text": "I have owned a watch like this for at least 40 years. It is one of the best, most rugged time pieces that a man would ever want. Unfortunately I have to buy a new one every twenty to thirty years because I live in central Illinois which has very, very high heat and humidity and I will eventually sweat into the little buttons which makes them unworkable after many years of constant wear. Other than that, this is a great watch for all around activities.",

It took a whole lot of frustrating trial and error to figure out which button did what and, at 75 years old, I have obviously since forgotten the function of each of the buttons. The only redeeming factor is the low cost of the watch means I won't have any heartache about just throwing the damn thing in the trash instead of experiencing the frustrations of trying to set it again.",

I abuse these terribly and they just keep going. For the dollar these are perfect for me. Hope they keep on making them.",

Therefore, I'd recommend this watch to those with hairy arms, too. Cheap, smooth... worth the buy.",

I was under the impression that the entire watch was stainless steel or aluminum. It\u2019s a nice watch and I enjoy it but you get what you pay for. If you want a watch for a less practical purpose; IE: a dress watch, find another watch that won\u2019t start to peel within a week.",

Also, the watch band is sized for a small wrist. I find the directions for setting the time are confusing; you need to set the time immediately after passing the \"chrono\" setting, but don't look for a \"time\" label: there isn't one. It's not bad for an inexpensive watch, but doing it again, I would look for a larger display and larger buttons.",
