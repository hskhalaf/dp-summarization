So far I'm really liking not having to bend/kneel to remove weeds. The blade on this tool is very sharp and slices through the weeds pretty easily. It's very light (but not at the expense of feeling solid) so not hard to manage even for long periods of time in our 1100 sq ft vegetable garden. I like the fact that this product has such a good guarantee, that is unusual now. I hope I never have to use it!",

But I found the large head to be too large for getting in close, so I followed up with this one. The stiffness, mass, sharpness and shape of this make this a superior tool. I can work this in close enough to weed right up next to my garden plants. An added benefit is the superior wood handle. It is thick enough to chop with minimal energy wasting vibration. And it makes a good staff for leaning down to pick vegetables or to pull a stray weed if that is called for.",
