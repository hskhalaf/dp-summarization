It's the perfect size (for reference, I was able to fit my approach shoes, a water bottle, a guide book, some snacks, and a rope bag into it for a shorter multi the other day). I also have used it as my personal item while flying. Unfortunately it is just barely too small to fit my 17\" laptop (but mine is a bit larger than most to compensate for a nicer keyboard). But that's a very minor issue for me. Highly recommended.",

It easily fits a pair of shoes, harness, chalk bag (standard size), carabiner, deodorant, keys, wallet, phone, travel battery pack, and climbing tape. With room! Honestly, I needed a minimalist pack that could still get the job done. This pack did just what I needed - I was skeptical at first, to be honest, but when I got the pack...it's a little bigger than you expect and from what's pictured. Definitely worth the sub-$60 price.",

My only complaint was that I wish it had water bottle holders on the outside, and it had more padding on the back. other than that it was perfect!",
