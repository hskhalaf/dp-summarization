However, I just discovered that they contain sucralose which is just another harmful artificial sweetener. The only safe sweeteners are Stevia, Agave, and Raw Honey. I have stopped drinking/eating anything with harmful artificial sweeteners since they have been linked to many diseases, including dementia and the increase in Atzheimers disease patients.",

It's too heavy for me to return it so we just drained them and threw the bottles away. What I don't understand is that I always order this with no problems ever.

      "text": "I love the delivery from Amazon! I gave up drinking soda probably about 3 years ago (I cheat every now and then) but felt it was unhealthy for me. I started drinking the Sparkling Ice Peach Nectarine, I absolutely love them. The little sparkle and the flavor of Peach zero calories WONDERFUL!!! Everyone in Maryland must drink these things because they are so hard to find. As soon as I think I have found somewhere that stocks them on the regular they disappear. They never disappear with Amazon and to order, pay and get them at the door is great! Thanks Amazon for making life a little easier!",

Any added flavoring has been overpowered by chemicals and it leaves a terrible aftertaste. It actually made me thirsty. I'm not convinced that it contains pineapple either. Make your own with better ingredients; try a splash of lemon or lime juice in water over crushed ice; if you want sweetness, add some honey, or maybe agave nectar. You can even use carbonated mineral water. Or, just buy coconut water. Amazon sells it too!",
