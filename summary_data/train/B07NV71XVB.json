When I reversed off the step, it bent right back to flat with only minor damage. This is an extreme test because in the real world I would put dirt or sand underneath to support the track. Now I know I can trust it when I need it because the material is as advertised.",

The carry bag is a nice touch and I wish I would have received the additional bag. That aside, the product works as advertised and suffered no surface degradation or cracking, I conducted the tests in 34 degree temps in thick mud and rainy conditions.
