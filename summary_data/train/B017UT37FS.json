These boots, however, are a bit narrow, but what I noticed the most was how uncomfortable the footbed is. My feet were hurting after only an hour of wear. I bought two pair of shoe cushion inserts and use both pair at the same time in order to have some comfort while wearing these shoes. I think they look good, and they offer great ankle protection which I need.",

Depending on what socks you wear and how tight you tie the boots, there may be a little chaffing after a full day of hiking. I once wore the boots with ankle socks and by the end of the day they started to chaff. Wearing them with taller socks works well.",

      "text": "I have been buying Salomon boots for 15 years and I've always been extremely satisfied in the past. On these shoes, on of the rivet broke on my first hike. It was raining and my feet were soaking wet, so the goretex didn't work as it used to be in the past 5 pairs I bought from that brand. It's extremely disappointing. I'm sending them back for a refund hoping Amazon will do the right thing given they have been worn once. Maybe I received a defective pair, but it is still very upsetting.",
