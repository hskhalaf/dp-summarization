Going over 25 mph, the chain makes an awful noise and shredded what was my wheel well. My car has relatively small space here, so I\u2019m not too angry about this, but still shows bad design. 3) it BROKE. on my way back home (going 25 mph with hazards on), one of the chain links snapped and rendered the entire chain useless and unfixable.

Visually inspecting the cables while trying to put them on, it looks like the right size would fit the car an have enough clearance to safely drive it. If you buy these chains, look somewhere other than the Amazon sizing recommendations if you want to make sure you get chains that will actually fit your car.",

I do love the tensioner device much more that traditional chains and if I need chains in the future for another vehicle I will be purchasing these again. As far a drivability, these passed the test.

Also note that the 6mm cable width refers to the INNER cable width. the \"springs\" that wrap around the cables are actually about 12mm+. It might be a VERY tight fit on your car. Order spare tensioners, and you might want to keep an old pair of gloves with the chains.",

With the three point connection it is as easy as can be to install them without diving the car onto them. The rubber tensioners mean no driving a few mile and then stopping to readjust for looseness. I will say that my tires having less than a thousand miles made them a bit tight at first. This is actually good because it means as the tires wear from normal use (ie: get smaller) the chains will never be too big. The Z-design works very well with ABS brakes.",

Will re-review if they ever break. I had to use them about 5 times this year all over a 20 mile total commute. Best to run on them at 25 or slower speeds.",

I pulled over to the side of the road, amd noticed one wheel had no chains anymore! It just fell off. On the other wheel i noticed it was too loose, which would explain why the other feel off. Keep in mind, if you have low clearance in the bottom of your car, like a mini van, it will be difficult to take off.",

I was able to put them on after watching the instructional video .... too bad they did not fit.",

    "description": "Size:SZ143For more than a decade Z-Chain has been the winter traction product choice for police, fire, ambulance and other professional fleets throughout North America. Z-Chain\u2019s fast installation, aggressive traction performance and extreme durability simply out-class all other options.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nThe SCC Super Z6 SZ143 winter traction product offers superior performance for cars, pickups, and SUVs with very limited operating clearance around the drive tires. Be ready for winter driving with an innovative solution that is a step beyond traditional tire chains.\n\n New Design\nBased on the \"Z\" family of products, the Super Z6 is designed for vehicles with restricted clearance around the drive tires. The Super Z6 requires only 6.33 millimeters (.25 inches) of sidewall clearance to operate, less than half the space required by most cable and tire chains. \n\nA diagonal crossmember pattern provides better outstanding traction and durability than conventional chain systems. Easy to Install\nA split outside cable with two fastening positions allows for easy installation without moving the vehicle, so there's no need to stop and retighten. The traction coils are manufactured from alloy steel to increase the lifespan of the product. The Super Z6 is also designed to prevent scratching of alloy or high performance tire rims.\n\n Versatility\nThe Super Z6 is available to fit passenger cars, pickups, and SUV tire sizes. It offers a unique combination of performance and convenience features for every user, including a \"designed-in\" rubber tightener, better all-around traction performance than conventional tire chains or cables, and greater durability.\n\n Designed for High Performance\nThe Super Z6 has better compatibility with anti-lock brakes, traction control, all-wheel drive, and other electronically monitored control systems so as not to interfere with the normal handling characteristics of your vehicle. The unique design also offers a low potential for damage to vehicle body and mechanical components, even when abused.\n\n The Super Z6 SZ143 is designed for tires sized from approximately 215 to 285 millimeters. Check the manufacturer's website for the exact product to fit your tire size. Also check your owner's manual for clearance specifications before installing winter traction products.\n\n What's in the Box\nChains, plastic gloves, one pair of rubber tensioners, durable, re-usable nylon bag, and clear, illustrated step-by-step installation and removal instructions.",
