      "text": "This griddle is great! I was replacing an old teflon one, and this is a thousand times better. I've had it for 4 months, and used it about once a week or so. I love the ceramic coating. I've made pancakes, bacon, grilled cheese sandwiches, and quesadillas, and it worked well for all. It's so easy to clean too, because nothing sticks. The plugging in on either side is useful, and the grease tray is much larger than my old one, which is nice. I made 2 pounds of bacon and it still had a little room. It doesn't brown perfectly evenly, but nothing does, and this is closer to being even that any other griddle I've owned. Totally recommend.",

Major problem: Frame/cradle the griddle sits in cracked after the first use! It's really flimsy (the frame) and cracked right where the grease tray is. Already discarded box/packaging so don't know if Amazon will take it back or exchange it. If I have to go through warranty service with Hamilton Beach I'll let you know how it goes.",

It heats well and maintains a good temperature for a large batch of Papa's homemade buttermilk pancakes. I like the feature of reversing the plug. Cleanup was great too all parts except the power cord ( Duh ! ) is water immersible to soften up all those dripping from those mis-flipped fluffy vanilla flavored pancakes! I think I need to buy one for myself so I can make some delicious pancakes for the Grandkids when they spend the night at Papa's house!",

I was tempted to return it but needed one for our upcoming camping trip, so I thoroughly washed, and re-washed the griddle. I am glad that I did because it was perfect. We have made pancakes, bacon, sausage, eggs, etc... on it and am very pleased with the griddle. It works great and clean up is easy.",

Now after a month (and after the expiration of Amazon's return period), pancakes stick like glue. The griddle can still be used by adding using some butter or Pam cooking spray, but, that pretty much defeats the purpose of buying a quality non-stick surface. Cleaning has been gentle with no harsh chemicals. I definitely would not buy again and will not recommend to someone else.",
