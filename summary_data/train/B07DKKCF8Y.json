      "text": "The game is a great update to the 2016 reboot. The idea of refilling health with glory kills, armour with flame thrower and ammo via chainsaw then the sword and bfg makes you always thinking what bar to tend to plus which weapon to use as different enemies are easier to kill with different weapon. The last couple of boss fights are so basic though same old big bad that we saw before a million times but the over all game is so worth it.",

Your marine has a flying castle spaceship and the gameplay revolves around you having to complete 'Tomb Raider' jumping puzzles. Its shocking that this game is called Doom. I bought this hoping it would be as much fun as the last Doom (2016) but its a huge step back in every way, from the graphics to the gameplay. I had forgotten just how annoying a bad game can be. Save your money for a real FPS!",

Don't even doubt this game, just buy it.You wont be disappointed.",

Puzzles that should really be in a gibbon (monkey) game. I was hoping for the same feel as the previous one so this just feels like a let down. Can't believe people are saying it's good, presume they didn't play the previous one. I was so looking forward to this, but after playing a few hours it feels like a Lego version of the previous one.
