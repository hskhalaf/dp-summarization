Currently have 12 at workstations throughout the office. Price point is great for desktop use. We have a larger scanner in the copy room for the big jobs with hundreds of pages. Very reliable, with only occasional cleaning of glass plate and rollers needed to keep things rolling along. I've noticed if a staff member likes to use White-out to make corrections before scanning, it will sometimes get white flecks on glass plate, using a little windex, it comes right off.",

It is small and fast, so that's good. But not up to normal HP quality. The software is pathetic and the \"manual\" is worse.",
