Very easy to assemble, compact, sturdy with a definite feeling of quality in terms of its robustness. Compared to the high end professional stands that are far more expensive, this stand definitely shines and is a purchase made with no regrets.",

I've now used it for a 700 I've been rebuilding as well and it fits both bikes just fine. It's very stable, and has all the necessary adjustments for me. I like that the head rotates and swivels, and there is a bar to lock the handlbar in position.",

If you are leveling out the bow it works best if you have a good round stabilizer to clamp onto, then you can level all axis. Leveling while clamped on the grip works but takes more time to get level. Holds pretty steady for most work but it will wiggle a little if you are pushing on the bow to tighten screws etc. Yes a dedicated $150-$300 bench mounted bow vise will work better than this, but for under $50 I am very pleased with the stand.",

Also, ebikes tend have a lot more weight at the back (if rear motor with batteries on the back). The top clamp doesn't prevent the bike from swiveling around until it's vertical with the back wheel on the ground. For the price it's OK and probably fine for most non-ebikes.",

Other reviewers have come up with work-arounds for its flaws. It does hold a bike sturdy if it is perfectly balanced either right-side up or upside down. If you want the best, buy a Park stand.

      "text": "After looking for a decent stand for periodic bicycle repairs/upgrades, I decided on this one. It's easy to assemble out of the box, and has decent weight and stability for mounting even heavy bicycles to repair. The only issue is that none of the adjustment points, especially the arm that is supposed to hold the bicycle stable, are very strong, even when you tighten the handles as much as you can. This means if you need to do anything with some amount of force (such as tensioning your fixie chain) you must stabilize the bicycle and the stand in order to keep everything still. Altogether not a huge issue, but worth mentioning.",

The only thing I wish for is maybe they coat the product with a water proofing layer, after all this is used to was bikes too. Starting to see rust in places, but some lube should solve the situation, other than that great. I have a carbon fiber Roubaix and it doesn't scratch the frame and securely holds the bike in place without damage to my top tube.",

It still looks brand new. no corrosion or discoloration. plastics are still great. no bend in metal parts or plastic grips. Very satisfied Original review: I should buy it for years before.

Yeah it's not up to the quality of the Park Professional Repair Stand, but it's nowhere near the cost either.
