My wife found a used baby cart that was pretty scratched up and this gun did a perfect job of restoring it (Pictures attached). Next I'm going to use it on the scratch marks on the plastic door panels in my car. A little heat and the dings just melt away. Mine shipped very quickly and I am extremely happy with my new heat gun.",

I particularly like the 2 heat settings, as some finer areas require less intense heat. Also, the heat gun can rest on its rear end, i.e. with the heat nozzle pointing upward. The rear is sort of flat, and with the heat gun steadily rested, it allows both of my hands to handle the cable/wire and rotating them by the heat source. Very thoughtful design.",

It also comes with some attachments to intensify the disbursement of heat, but never really have a need to use them.

I bought to use on various art/foam projects and shrink tubing on electronics but I found the best use possible. For people who customize their headlights and need to bake them open and people freak out when you want to use the stove, this has worked perfectly so far.",
