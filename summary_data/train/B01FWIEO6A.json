Am an old fart so my eye sight while ok is far from perfect, when I viewed HD programs I could see a bit of improvements but didn't give me the WOW factor, however today I decided to watch some BLUE RAY movies ( Underworld series), well folks I just got my WOW factor maybe more LOL the picture quality and details are truly awesome, I am a very happy old fart camper! I highly recommend trying a 4K tv , SONY is my favorite brand! Beware once you try it you will end up buying one! LOL",

      "text": "The Sony XBR49X800D has greatly exceeded my expectations thus far. Easy setup, minimal tinkering with adjustments, high quality picture and even decent sound. Much higher quality compared with the 2 major brands that are highly rated but have given me nothing but trouble over the past 3 years. I would strongly recommend getting the Sony 800 series, or higher, and spending a bit extra if necessary. My only worry is long term reliability, and that cannot be determined for a few years. The other brands' mid-range sets I had lasted no more than 2.5 years. Not good enough for me. Buy Sony.",

The picture is good, it does a good job of up conversion and HD material looks good with rich colors. I have yet to see any 4K media on it but look for word to it. I am very happy with my purchase.",

I returned it",

On these aspect the tv excelled.",

It plays video stored on my portable hard drive with a single USB cable, again picture is the best I had. Have not yet tried any true 4k content but I am satisfied with the quality already.

With this pattern you get distracted no matter what you watch with this TV, what a pity. Bad luck for me, returning the unit.",

The new one had the exact same issue. I'm now waiting on TV #3 to see if the issue is resolved. Sony has denied this is a known issue for the 2016 model. Seems unlikely I would be unlucky enough to get 2 (probably soon to be 3) with the identical problem.",

It is infuriating when trying to change the channel, you have to look at the screen while entering the numbers to make sure it even registers the buttons you push on the remote. My old 2007 32 inch Samsung's remote control works 10 times better, at least. It's pretty pitiful that a company such as Sony is making a TV 10 years later that can not even compete with the functionality of a TV 10 years older.",
