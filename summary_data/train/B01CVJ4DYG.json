    "description": "Color:WalnutVersatile, stylish and always on trend, the George Nelson Platform Style Bench 5' is a true chameleon of furniture design. From anything to a seat or coffee table, all the way to an occasional piece, its simple construction allows it to blend seamlessly into even the busiest of spaces without outshining your current decor. One of the founders of the American Modernist movement, George Nelson's designs are considered to be some of the most iconic and significant in furniture history. Along with his associates, he worked with almost all of the major designers of the era. Sturdy and hard wearing, the frame is crafted birch with a rubber wood top and comes in a Natural or Walnut and black combo that's always in style.",
