      "text": "After about 1 year owning the camera, with rare use I started having issues with some of the rear buttons, especially the muti-selector dial which would not respond to certain directions. I had to send to repair shop to fix it. Then after another year I started having the issue again, fixing it with another repair. Eventually, after 4 years of light use those buttons are not working permanently and to fix it I would need to change camera main board. Not sure if my particular camera was defective because I haven't seen others reporting the same issues. Still I'm very disappointed with the purchase.",

I compared it to the G12, G15 and G1x and although many of those cameras offer better lens aperture or sensors none come close to the degree of control it allows to have over the pictures taken. PRO great manual controls, filters, effects, etc very nice pictures with good image quality price is very competitive against G15 and similar prosumer cameras CONTRA full manual needs to be downloaded, box only includes quick start guide sensor could offer slightly better resolution",

The only issue is the User Guide included with the camera. It is mostly a technical description and does not provide any skill building information. For this reason I also purchased a separate P7700 camera specific book by David Busch and recommend that as well.",

Few questions occurred. 1.Does anyone notice a very clear sound when we zoom-in or out as taking video? is that normal? the sound is so so clear! 2.The zoom in bottom on the camera that I have is not that sensitive, always take like 15 sec to really zoom-in or out, is that also normal? need comments on this!",

      "text": "I have had earlier models of this camera before. The main thing I like about it is the swing out screen. It has a lot of other good features. But this time they have ruined a good camera by giving it a detached lens cap which is not tied to the camera. Every time you go to take a picture you have to fiddle with this little lens cap in your hand. I've nearly lost it several times already.",

Paying less than $4 below MSRP and I get a gray market Nikon... WTF? I love Amamzon, but from now on all photography related purchases will be conducted through bhphoto.com (no I don't work there) who clearly labels gray market gear. Ridiculous Amazon.",

Create absolutely stunning photos and Full HD (1080p) videos with uncompromising speed. Take complete creative control with PSAM modes, or let one of 19 Scene Modes do the thinking for you. Rethink what's possible with a compact point-and-shoot camera.\n\n\nIMPRESS WITH EVERY SHOT\nENDLESS CREATIVITY AND SUPERB IMAGE QUALITY\nThe COOLPIX P7700 satisfies even the most passionate shooters. At its heart is a 1/1.7\" 12.2-megapixel CMOS sensor\u2014larger than the sensor in most compact cameras\u2014that delivers exceptional image quality and detail. Use that power to bring every shot to life in vivid clarity. A 7.1x Zoom-NIKKOR glass lens takes you from wide-angle (28mm) to telephoto (200mm) in an instant. Create an expansive landscape one shot, a stunning close-up the next. But as powerful as the COOLPIX P7700 is, you don't need to be a pro to excel with it. Whether you prefer letting Auto Mode do the work for you, using Scene Modes to match your shooting situation or taking complete control of your images with full manual control, you'll be proud of every photo and video you create.\n\nEXCEL IN LOW-LIGHT SITUATIONS\nBRIGHT F/2.0 LENS AND HIGHLY SENSITIVE CMOS SENSOR \nGreat low-light performance starts with the lens, and the COOLPIX P7700 has one of the best lenses we've ever put in a COOLPIX camera. With a maximum aperture that's wider than most compact cameras (f/2.0), the 7.1x Zoom-NIKKOR glass lens gathers maximum light so you can shoot with faster shutter speeds. Combine that with a highly sensitive CMOS image sensor and Nikon's renowned ISO performance, and you'll capture the shots you've been missing\u2014low-light indoor shots, evening group shots around a fire, nighttime cityscapes, fast-moving subjects and much more.\n\nCREATE WITH REMARKABLE SPEED\nFAST OPERATION AND CONTINUOUS SHOOTING\nLife moves fast, but the COOLPIX P7700 keeps up. In an instant, it powers up, zooms in, autofocuses and captures stunning shot after shot. Hold down the shutter button and fire a blazing-fast 8 fps (up to 6 shots) for some of the most impressive action-freezing sequences you've ever seen. Plus, every photo and video will be sharp and steady, even if your hands are not\u2014Nikon's VR image stabilization ensures a little camera shake won't ruin the shot.\n\nFIND EXCITING NEW PERSPECTIVES\nMOVEABLE 921,000-DOT VARI-ANGLE DISPLAY\nWhen you can swivel your camera's LCD display to just about any position, you're free to explore exciting new perspectives all around you. Hold the COOLPIX P7700 at ground level for a surprising new view of a common scene. In tight, cramped spaces, raise the camera overhead and get the shot or video you need. Every shot you frame, review or share is rendered in 921,000 dots of brilliant detail. When transporting the camera, protect the LCD by flipping it to the closed position.\n\nEXPLORE NEW POSSIBILITIES \nFULL HD (1080P) VIDEO WITH STEREO SOUND\nApply your creativity to videography. With the touch of a button, go from shooting stills to recording Full HD (1080p) videos that can easily be shared on your computer, social networking sites or an HDTV. The COOLPIX P7700 lets you use the optical zoom while recording, so you can frame exactly the shot you want. It also lets you maintain creative control; adjust the aperture and exposure settings, add creative filters, special effects and more. The built-in stereo microphone captures clear, natural audio (it even includes wind noise reduction), but for maximum sound fidelity, add the optional ME-1 stereo microphone.\n\nCOMFORTABLE, SMART DESIGN \nThe COOLPIX P7700 is designed to be used\u2014as often as possible. Its compact, ergonomic body lets you create comfortably. All the camera's settings are accessible through easy-to-navigate menus, and key features are at your fingertips.
