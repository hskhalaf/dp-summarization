Cost is high but it cuts and bends something that my 12in demo-saw doesn\u2019t do. AND there isn\u2019t a fear of sparks starting a fire. I was able to cut and bend 256 48\u201dx12\u201d #4 dowels in 2hrs using this tool. Ya it costs too much money but with the lack of available labor its worth it.",
