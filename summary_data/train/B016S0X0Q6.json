      "text": "Skip this camera. I purchased two of them back in April 2017. I sent one back to Amazon two weeks later when it stopped working. Amazon was great, send it back and we will replace it. Replacement camera went bad this week after 7 months. I went through the support nonsense and in the end I am sending it back to them for replacement. My reasons for buying were: Kodak is an American company trying to reinvent itself and the free 24 hour cloud storage. Amazon just announced a camera that works with your Echo Show. Probably the way I would go. I don't have a Show, but there is one in my future",
