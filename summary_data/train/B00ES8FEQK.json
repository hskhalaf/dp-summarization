Take my above comments as proof that even the best manufacturers will eventually produce a product that is so inferior to its earlier iterations that it seems fake. Dang...",

My Amazon credit card account never got the refund back, however, Amazon site posted as it's been settled.

For those not familiar with BIRKENSTOCK, make sure your size consideration is correct. They loosen up a little, but the quality prevents them from getting sloppy and loose over time.

New users will likely need a couple of tries to get the proper fit. The sandal can be re-soled, but even if the cork bed is restored when it breaks down, the support angle is often not the same. They are relatively expensive, but I recommend replacing the whole shoe when the soles are worn down. If you can find a shoe store where you can try them on and make your first purchase, I recommend you do so. Later, Amazon offers convent ordering and no tax, but the price is the same as retail, or nearly so.",

These shoes are made in Germany since 1774. No smoke, no mirrors, and no gizmos are needed. You walk, the shoe molds to your foot. The shape of the Original Birkenstock Footbed enables body weight to be distributed evenly over the whole foot, providing it with optimal support.",
