I have older Cuisinart stainless steel pans that, even after a decade or more of use, have not done that. I think the quality has taken a dive. Too bad as this use dto be a reliable brand and well priced for the quality..",

Glass lid is very reassuring so you don't second guess yourself and start to believe that you may have cooked something you did not intend to cook. Very comforting product.",

Perfect. The pot and steamer are medium-sized, providing powerful steam heat (contained by the lid). I'd recommend this for households with one to three people, given the size of the pot.
