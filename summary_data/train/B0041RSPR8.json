      "text": "This camera was somewhat of a disappointment. Canon quality traditionally has been very high, unfortunately this camera didn\u2019t meet those expectations. The lens was not as sharp as I expected, and it had color fringing. I found that much of my photography was inside where the sensor struggled to keep up the quality, i.e. it had artifacts. With these limits, the effective resolution of the camera was about half the stated resolution. If all I wanted to do is to have 4x6 prints or post pictures on the internet, even half the stated resolution is far more pixels than needed for these purposes.",

Overall a little disappointing, I expected better performance based on my experience with my small Canon S450 \"point and shoot\". Given the little difference in size I think I'm better off using my Canon Rebel with zoom!",

We bought ours just recently, so we are still trying to master all its useful functions....for its price and Canon expertise...this is really a lot of bang for the buck!!!!",

Purchasing the SX30is was a leap of faith as I really didn't believe the claims that I had read. But it was well worth the investment. It is faster when using the flash and I can take photos of distant objects or scenery that was impossible before. Also you can purchase extra batteries at a more than reasonable price. I strongly recommend this camera for anyone.",

It's only to know a little more on aperture and shutter speed settings to take more special ones. I have no complain so far, battery last more than average, flash is powerful.

Also, the auto focus and shutter speed is very slow. Many photos get out of focus so I have always have to take more than one photo before I get a good quality one. Other than that, for the price and for being a point and shoot camera, this is a pretty decent camera that can be used for a long time before an upgrade.",

    "title": "Canon SX30IS 14.1MP Digital Camera with 35x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7 Inch Wide LCD (OLD MODEL)",
    "description": "Canon's 4344B001 PowerShot SX30 IS 14.1MP Compact Digital Camera has got you prepared for your next extreme photo opportunity. This point-and-shoot digital camera comes with a massive 35x wide-angle (24-840mm) optical zoom lens - a first for any PowerShot. It also comes with a 2.7-inch Vari-angle LCD, 14.1 megapixels, Zoom Framing Assist and much more. Shoot superb 720p HD video with stereo sound and then view them with an HDMI output connector for easy playback on your HDTV.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nThe PowerShot SX30 IS has got you prepared for your next extreme photo opportunity. This point-and-shoot digital camera comes with a massive 35x Wide-Angle (24-840mm) Optical Zoom lens--a first for any PowerShot! It also comes with a 2.7-inch Vari-angle LCD, 14.1 Megapixels, High Dynamic Range, Zoom Framing Assist and much more. \n\n\n\n\nCanon PowerShot SX30 Highlights \n\n35x wide-angle optical zoom (24-840mm) with Optical Image Stabilizer\nThe PowerShot SX30 IS is equipped with a 35x Optical Zoom lens with a focal length of 4.3-150.5mm (35mm equivalent: 24-840mm) that allows you to shoot any scene from wide-angle to telephoto. The camera uses a VCM (Voice Coil Motor) for high-speed, quiet, energy-efficient lens movement with precise control. Focal length is conveniently indicated on the lens barrel. \n\nThe lens is optimized to fully exploit its zoom length and wide shooting angle in concert with the camera's high 14.1 Megapixel resolution. UD glass effectively suppresses chromatic aberration, while enhanced negative refractive power ensures that distortion at the wide-angle is also corrected. Further aberration is controlled with the inclusion of a double-sided aspherical glass-molded lens and ultra-high refraction index lens. \n\nThe SX30 IS is equipped with Canon's acclaimed Optical Image Stabilizer Technology that automatically detects and corrects camera shake--one of the leading causes of fuzzy or blurred shots. Even when zoomed in, you can get the steady, crisp, brilliant images you'll be proud to shoot and share. And Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer Technology is convenient to use. It functions perfectly with or without a flash. \n\nImprovements to Movie modes: Dynamic mode enables users to use the Optical Image Stabilizer while shooting video\nDynamic IS allows you to capture video with more precision and ease than ever before! Without having to make any additional camera adjustments, Dynamic IS automatically operates the moment you start recording video. This image stabilizer continuously readjusts throughout the camera's entire zoom range to correct a broad range of motion -- especially when shooting in the wide-angle end, so footage comes out steady and clear even while you're walking and recording at the same time! \n\n\nAnd with a powerful 35x Optical Zoom, you'll never be too far away from capturing your greatest memories! Best of all, the Optical Zoom can now be used while shooting video--a first for any of the Canon PowerShot SX digital cameras! So no matter the distance or environment, Canon lets you stay confident that you'll capture the footage you want. \n\nShoots superb 720p HD video with stereo sound; HDMI output\nThe PowerShot SX30 IS lets you record video in beautiful high definition (1280 x 720 pixels). The camera also makes it easy to enjoy HD videos (and still photos) on your HDTV with a mini-HDMI connector for direct connection to a high-definition TV monitor. You'll enjoy the HD experience with no degradation of image or audio in the signal, plus the ability to display up to 130 still images at once. \n\n\n\n\n\nNew Zoom Framing Assist button\nWith its 35x Optical Zoom lens, the SX30 IS can certainly capture subjects located at a very far distance; however, even with a powerful zoom lens it can often be tricky to track a moving subject while zoomed out to the maximum telephoto range and attempting to steady the camera. To counter this problem, Canon created the Zoom Framing Assist function. By simply pressing and holding the convenient Zoom Framing Assist function button, the camera will automatically zoom out to a wider focal point, allowing you to look for your elusive subject. Once found, releasing the button will cause the camera to return to its original position and intelligently keep the subject in focus, so you don't have to trouble yourself with any of the controls. Recording video and images has never been easier with a Canon PowerShot! \n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Smart AUTO intelligently selects the proper settings\nJust set the Canon PowerShot SX30 IS to Smart AUTO and you're ready for maximum enjoyment from your picture taking every time. It's a relaxing and satisfying way to shoot because you can completely concentrate on your subject knowing that the camera has the technical details covered. Advanced Canon technology intelligently analyzes your situation and shooting conditions. Then it automatically selects an appropriate setting from 28 specially defined settings. So whether you're photographing flowers, a captivating sunset, or your friends at the park, you can be confident that you're getting dramatic, memorable images. \n\nDIGIC 4 Image Processor and 14.1 megapixels\nThe PowerShot SX30 IS is equipped with many of the same features as a higher-end camera: an ultra-powerful zoom, eye-popping resolution and advanced picture-improving technology. 14.1 Megapixels of resolution gives your photography incomparable depth and ensures that any section of any shot can be enlarged and cropped with no loss in quality when you edit the image or even if you choose to print the image. It can create crisp, clear 13\" x 19\" posters. \n\nCanon's proprietary DIGIC Image Processors have long set its cameras apart from the competition, and the new DIGIC 4 sets the bar even higher. Faster, more accurate noise reduction delivers better image quality, even at high ISO speeds. \n\niSAPS Technology is an entirely original scene-recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos, iSAPS works with the advanced DIGIC 4 Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy, as well as exposure and white balance. \n\nLarge 2.7-inch Vari-angle LCD enables easy viewing\nThe camera's 2.7-inch PureColor System LCD screen gives you the big picture, whether you're shooting, reviewing or showing off your images. This high-resolution screen offers a crisp, clear picture to make shooting, playback and using the camera's menu functions especially convenient. The clear and bright LCD also features Night Display for easy viewing in low light. It also has an electronic viewfinder that provides sharp images when you shoot up close during Macro photography. \n\nLithium-ion rechargeable batteries, which makes powering up simple\nThe PowerShot SX30 IS now uses a rechargeable lithium-ion NB-7L battery. For ultimate convenience and simplicity, just charge the batteries and you're ready for your next photographic adventure! \n\nWhat's in the Box\n\n * PowerShot SX30 IS Camera body \n * Lithium-ion Battery Pack NB-7L \n * Battery Charger CB-2LZ \n * Neck Strap NS-DC11 \n * Lens Cap \n * Case for Hot Shoe Cap \n * AV Cable AVC-DC400ST \n * USB Interface Cable IFC-400PCU \n * Digital Camera Solution CD-ROM",
