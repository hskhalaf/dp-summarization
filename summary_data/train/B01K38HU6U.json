They easily topple at the slightest nudge. I will say they are adaptable I've used them in grass and on concrete , carpet and hardfloor. I love the height adjustment. The only reason I give 4/5 is because I often have to provide them stability when working with my dogs. My daughter who is 4 also really enjoys playing with them :)",

Well, during the second use, two of the hurdles broke when accidentally stepped on by my 4 year old and my 6 year old while they were running playing/exercising with my supervision. The hurdles did not breakaway, but just broke with yellow plastic pieces in the joint breaking off. Not good!!! I would not recommend this product. *Update* The company quickly responded with concern and promptly replaced it with a new set. Their concern shows their intent on providing a quality product.",
