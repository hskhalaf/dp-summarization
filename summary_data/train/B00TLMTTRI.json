The butterfly comes detached with no explanation on how to attach it, and the hanging chain is not only flimsy, but barely soldered on. I'm sure after being exposed to the elements for a short time the tiny circle soldered on to the main piece will not hold up, and will come crashing to the ground; so I'm removing it all together.",
