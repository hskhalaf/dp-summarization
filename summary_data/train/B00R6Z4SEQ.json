Anyway I hung up from Greenworks another time here in the months of service and each time I am completely exasperated at the horrendous service and invasive data mining of Greenworks. If one cannot find replacement parts or extra parts, the trimmer is useless.",

The blower and trimmer are both on the heavier side, as in your arms will grow to get used to it, but your arms may end up shaky after the first two lawn jobs. Overall, they are both well built, the battery system makes things easy, and I don't miss gasoline equivalents in the slightest.",

If you need high power for extended use I suggest using the 4ah or larger batteries. The 2ah will noticeably lose power in the last half of charge due to voltage sag. I've been using it for about 6 months nearly full time job (30-90minutes a day), it's been very reliable so far.",

Probably will get a 2.0 A-H additional battery because the 4.0 A-H battery at $250 is 2.3X the cost of 2.0 AH. Not the value and time effective proposition I thought it would be.
