I landed on me hip and the back of my head whipped back and hit side walk extremely hard.i walked away without even a concussion. Had a bit of head ache that night and that was all.

Co-Worker: That's really cool. I like it. Me (as I'm putting the helmet on): Thanks. Co-Worker (after seeing me with the helmet on): I retract what I just said about the helmet.

It's so high that I feel like my forehead and the sides of my head feel too exposed for comfort. I'm sure I'd have no problem surviving a brick being dropped from directly overhead, though. Overall, the comfort level is low. I'm not a big fan and will be seeking another helmet, even if at a higher price.",

I feel like for the price, this was a really fair product.",
