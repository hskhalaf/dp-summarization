These benefits, plus the effective waterproofing, grip and lightness, were highly appreciated. It was, however, lambasted for its price. All in all, if hikers are willing to shell out more money for a hiker, the Scarpa Mistral GTX is a high-cut hiking boot that can outperform the challenges of the unpredictable outdoor conditions.",

That's great if you are walking on uneven terrain or soft ground, a bit less if you happen to have to walk on a flat, hard surface, even for as little as 20-30 minutes - it does make my feet ache a little.",
