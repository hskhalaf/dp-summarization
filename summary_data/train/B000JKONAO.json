I appreciate that as I don't want a 7-piece trowel/hoe/rake/fork/spade/whatever/whatever/whatever set of tools when one will do the same job.",

I was amazed that with the Cobrahead I got to the bulb quickly and found so many more smaller bulbs just waiting to sprout.",

The best technique for me has been to insert the tool as close to the plant to be removed as possible. If the cobrahead doesn't pry it out, it loosens the dirt enough to pull the weed most times.",

When they're tiny, you can often scrape them out of the ground, single tap root and all. When they're bigger, a few whacks at the ground with the pointy end loosens the weed enough that it can pull right out. Will have one of these in my kit from now on.",

      "text": "Cobrahead, where have you been all my life? This great tool makes the job of getting the weed up with the root intact so much easier. I received it today and went to town on my wild violets and oxalis. Im able to get the root of the violet out every time on the first pass. It disturbes the surrounding soil just enough to get the root out, not more - you're not left with a big hole. It is a hand tool so if you have arthritis you still have to watch your body mechanics and not overdo. But this is the best gardening tolol I've ever bought.",

It will dig 3 inches deep without major effort. Really sturdy handle that can be used with one hand or two.
