For a reason I may never understand, my cat suddenly decide that she wanted to take them too. A mess! I bought this to use as a cover over the bottles so that I could see them but keep the cat out. I haven\u2019t had a problem since and it takes nothing away from the looks of my kitchen.",

I love how versatile this is and can't wait to use it for all of its multiple functions.",
