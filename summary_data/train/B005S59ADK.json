Cord reel fit perfectly, the box looks great. Even the owner of the welding shop where I had an additional support brace installed commented on how well built the box is. Only flaw is the doors don\u2019t quite align perfectly when closed, damn close but not high end kitchen cabinet close. Nothing to worry about. Only complaint is the logo was, as pictured, missing.",
