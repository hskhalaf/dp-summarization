        "The Koss Pro4S headphones have a closed-back design that attenuates outside noise while keeping sound leaks at bay, while the memory foam ear cups keep them comfortably seated on your head",

      "cons": [
        "Their naturally even register may weaken the \"edge\" of some artificially-produced songs",

      "text": "I love these headphones. Fantastic sound all across the range, from controlled, well-placed, yet powerful bass, to sparkling highs (without harshness). Listened with these andto classic rock, jazz, acoustic, post-rock, and some Daft Punk, and they excelled at all of them. Highly recommend, with or without a DAC. My only wish is that the soundstage was a bit wider, but with the sturdy build quality, lifetime warranty, detatchable cable, carrying case, good looks, and beautiful sound otherwise, I can overlook that.",

Just putting them on my head Would cause a short or a distortion and sound. If I move my head back-and-forth, same thing. I thought maybe it was the cord, but that was tight. My only guess is it was something internal. I really wanted to like these headphones. I own many Koss headphones, but I cannot add these to my collection. Had to return.",

I am happy to report that I did my research quite well because these have proven to be some excellent headphones. They are well built. They are light weight. They have an excellent fit design. They deliver excellent sound reproduction. For the small recording studio that I have setup for my bass guitar playing, these particular headphones fit my needs quite well. Highly recommended. They also come with a quality storage case and cable pass through. 5 stars on these so just stop looking, save some money and purchase these ones :)",

Besides, these are one of those headphones that are advertised as over the ear headphones but they actually sit on your ears and to make matters worse, it has a horrible clamping force which makes your jaw hurt. If you have a small head and small ears you will be fine, if you're a female or a child only then these will fit you. If you're a man, stay away from these. Even though they sound good, I was unable to enjoy them due to lack of comfort.",
