At first my boyfriend (Dan) made fun of me for purchasing this, but after seeing me traipsing around the house practically oozing Christmas magic, I know he's probably secretly jealous. This onesie has everything: feeties, dropseat, hood with drawstrings, and a fashionable wintery print. Honestly, what more could you ask for? P.S. As others have mentioned, it's big (I am 5'3\" and bought Xsmall - still huge), but I mean, who needs a form-fitting jumpsuit when you're busy shoveling Christmas cookies down your gullet?",

They fit with plenty of leg room if he hits another growth spurt. He rarely takes them off. He was tickled by the double zipper and opening in the back. 7/12/17: He has since outgrown this onesie. The length is still fine but his chest has gotten broader and his arms longer so the sleeves come above his wrists. I will be purchasing a M this year.",

Bold and bright. Only complaint is I somehow tore a seem in the leg just below my boys. Its not form fitting so I can get away with it. Even with this snafu, I would buy another in a heartbeat.",

I'm not sure I would recommend it if you are going for comfort or something to really wear around the house. The colors are ok but again not enough of a tie dye pattern.
