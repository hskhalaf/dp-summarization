Finally, it stopped staying on more than a couple minutes. I decided that was too dangerous for me so I stopped using it in my home office as I work. The buttons on top are touch buttons and they don't work very well either after a month of use.",

      "text": "I purchased this heater just shy of 2 years ago. Because I live in a warm climate, the heater is used intermittently some Winter days, at most 4 months out of the year. Yesterday, an audible change (click) was heard inside the heater while the unit was running. The smell of what appeared to be burning wires within the machine immediately alerted me , at which point I unplugged the unit. Thank goodness I was sitting 6 feet away when the malfunction occurred. The results could have been much worse.",

I\u2019m a 5\u20192 female with small hands so it would be even harder for larger hands.

I believe this one also contains ceramic plates. This small heater can easily warm up a bedroom on the low setting in about 20 mins. A large living area on the high setting probably around 45 mins..

I even keep it in my room on the highest setting when I'm sleeping and it does the job as well but l would imagine that if you have a room bigger than my 10x10 bedroom or plan on using this for somewhere other than a small office you should get a more powerful one. it is also pretty loud...",
