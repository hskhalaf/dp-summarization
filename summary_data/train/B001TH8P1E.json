The width of compartments can be adjusted with dividers and the top storage area is great for larger parts including breadboards and the Arduino itself.",

The only problem I had was that the drawer partition strips do not snap cleanly apart from each other (they come in a strip of several) and the excess plastic made them not sit correctly and in some cases inhibited lid closure. Easily solved with a razor blade utility knife, as the plastic is soft and easy to cut. But it did get a little annoying to have to shave excess bits of plastic off every single divider. Overall I am 99% happy with this item at this price point.",

The flexibility of adjusting the compartment sizes is great and upper compartment for tools works perfect. Only reason I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars is the handle system isn't very robust. Guessing this isn't made for relatively moderate weight. As its plastic with short-ish pins to hold in place and it does have a minor locking tab system when the handle is up, but with the containers < half full with screws so maybe 4-5lbs, I've had the handle detach a couple times. I'm not just more careful when picking up but wish it was a bit more robust.",

      "text": "Not noted anywhere (at least that registered with me) the insert \"channels\" in the drawers are fixed. You can adjust the length of the compartments you create but you can't change the width, which seriously reduces the usefulness of this product for me. I want to store tools in some of the drawers but can't since some won't fit. So, for me, this is a less than desirable design flaw. Otherwise, the product is exactly the size that I wanted.",

I haven't been in 20+ years and just bought a boat, so I'm just starting out again, and don't really see me needing anything bigger. Great price, came in on time, and does have the ability to lock the lid down, where I guess you can run a cable through it so no one could steal it if you leave it unattended at a dock or something... I like it very much. Great price.",

I use the top to hold drywall anchors. I could have used one more drawer but that isn't anything against this box, I just have way to many little pieces of hardware :D",

I think the only way I could beat this item is to go spend a lot of $ on a small Craftsman cabinet with roll out drawers. (I'm kinda of OCD about being organized.)",
