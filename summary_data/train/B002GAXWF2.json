Fortunately, I have a fond history with this style of headphones and thought these would replace another pair that was soon to die. I was mistaken. While these sound perfectly average, the clip is extremely tight and caused me physical pain after an hour or so of casual use. While these may serve as a back up pair for whatever I end up buying to replace them, they definitely won't be my primary 'walking around' headphones. Also, the plug is wider than most. It's the first pair of headphones I've ever had that couldn't fit through the alloted plug space in my phone's case.",

Maybe my head or my ears are shaped differently from other peoples\u2019. The other major problem is the audio quality.

      "text": "I love these headphones and re-ordered them recently as they are getting harder to find. I use them for travel and business - placing on headphones to play music. These are 'old style' headphones - they are not noise cancelling, but the sound is great given the size. I particularly love these as they clip gently onto your ear - I can't wear most in-ear phones as they don't fit well and other style of clips on hurt my ear. These are well designed. Don't discontinue making them!",

The pivoting clip makes putting on easy, but you must still be extra gentle. Though the cups sit on the ear with adequate width and low pressure and weight, the lightness indicates how small the magnet is to produce the mediocre sound.

The feel - They're pretty light and comfortable, but they feel a little flimsy/cheap. They give the impression that they'll break with a slight accidental tug. The sound - they're pretty horrible with bass response. They have a pretty hollow, tinny sound with the distinct lack of low end.

I have 2 sets that I've had for well over a year - basically one is for outdoor use & the other for indoor use & both pair are still working great! I use my 'outside' pair for when I'm exercising & working in the yard & when cleaning. I have even accidentally dropped them in water & they were fine. They stay in place, don't block out outside noises but still have a clear sound, I highly recommended them & would love for Panasonic to come out with the same kind of design with Bluetooth!",

It's that gap feeling were you lose the bass because it you press the headphones against your ears the bass sounds really good. The fit is a loose fit. You can workout with these on and they shouldn't fall off. They slide right on over your ears. The only bad thing is that they can't be adjusted. Great buy.",

I have been using a pair of Sennheiser fold up earphones at work and they work quite nicely. In comparison, these sound much more high pitched and almost tinny.
