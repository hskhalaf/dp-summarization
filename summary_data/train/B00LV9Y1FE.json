Everything seemed good. When trying to remove a bolt in the vertical position ( tool facing up) it would not work. Thought maybe it needs to break in ( hoping for the best). Well as a week goes by. It gets worse, then started loosing power in and position. Broken from day 1. It is under warranty, through an outside source ( as per IR) that I have to pay to ship it too and hope they can fix it .",

My new coworker had just purchased the Snap On one for like $500 plus or whatever astronomical price it was. It is deafeningly loud and not any stronger than this one that I got. This one is quiet and powerful and relatively cheap - it's a sleeper! The ergonomics could be a little better on the handle, but it doesn't lose any points for that from me. It's durable, too. It has fallen off of my tool cart a couple times with no problem.",

We particularly like the 4 torque settings. We can start out on the low setting and gradually work our way up to higher settings until the nut or bolts pops free.

Bolts were about about a foot long with a 36mm head, so massive by DIY mechanic standards. I have this paired with an old 4 gallon compressor and it runs just fine. I did upgrade the air lines though to the 3/8\u201d rubber lines with high flow 1/4 NPT fittings. Very durable tool, no regrets.",
