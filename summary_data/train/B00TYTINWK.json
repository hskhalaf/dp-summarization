      "text": "Although this dish rack is attractive and sized large enough to hold a lot of dinnerware, it has one HUGE DESIGN FLAW - the raised wires where you would put dishes are so low that dishes cannot stand upright! I don't know how the dishes in the picture are standing upright. I tried several styles and sizes of dishes, and all but the smallest dishes simply fall to the side. The manufacturer should surely take steps to correct this. I have not had it long enough to be able to comment on whether it rusts quickly or not.",

      "text": "I checked out many dish drainer designs and settled on this one. On the plus side the stainless steel wire rack itself is very nicely made and will last a very long time. On the negative side the plastic base was a bit warped when it arrived. I fixed that with some carefully applied hot water and some gentle persuasion. I also added tapered side rails to support the edge of the base so that water will drain properly off the base. Without that detail the water will just lay flat in the base pain. So with some modification this thing works very well.... just beware of those details if you decide to order one.",

The only little glitch is the silverware holder; small things tend to fall over and lay on the bottom, but this is minor. Overall, I love it!",

Not all over, but at the wire-to-wire welds, and on the bottom of the wires where the water drops hang. Also, the feet, which sit in water, have rusted. My guess is the metal is \"sorta stainless\" but not as high-quality as stainless used to be before it all came from China. I have an older dish rack, with US stainless, that hasn't a spot of rust in 20 years. It's an OK dish rack, but if you expect it to be rust-free, you'll be disappointed.",

The plastic drainage board that sits underneath doesn't necessarily drain on its own so sometimes it has to be manually tilted to drain out, but that's not a huge deal. The one thing I'd change is that I wish it were designed so that cups/glasses could be hooked onto the perimeter of the rack (like with most dish racks). There is not a great way to secure glasses. Overall though, I'm happy with this dish rack.",

Therefore, the plastic doesn\u2019t lay flat on the chrome and it too wobbles. Also parts of the the chrome are very sharp and someone could get cut. This product is definitely over priced, $30 for the inferior quality is absurd. I am giving it one star based solely on it\u2019s attractive appearance from a distance.",

Essentially it's warped in a way that doesn't allow water to drain out the spout. It ends up pooling to the sides where the rack feet are. I'm afraid this may lead to rust in the future, but maybe it won't. Either way, it leads to standing water on the drain board itself. The picture shows an upward curve, which makes water flow to the side instead of out of the drain board. Video shows how warped it is. Unfortunate, because I like the rack itself.",
