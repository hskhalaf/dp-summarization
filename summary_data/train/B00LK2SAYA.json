I contacted Amazon on Sat May 12th after I got home from traveling all week for work. THE ITEM IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN!!! Seriously... BEWARE if you purchase this as you cannot return it.

After a month, they emailed back and said that we had to order the parts and pay for them ourselves because it was not covered under the warranty. We have a $300 smoker that we can't use. We wish that we had read all the reviews as this seems to be an ongoing problem with this smoker.",

      "text": "This smoker has a lot of room in it, usually more than you need for all but the largest parties. Adding chips is a breeze, and the digital top controls work well. Results are great. The remote is another story--if you don't push the buttons in exactly the right order, or if you program using the digital top controls then try to alter the program with the remote, the heating element can turn on and then not shut off until the smoker overheats. I had this happen twice before I gave up on the remote and just shifted to using the controls on the top.",

For food safety reasons you would think the included probe and smoke chamber temperature sensors would be better. I got a smoke generator because the chip try is so tiny.

Be aware that like all smokers it emits smoke so it needs to be away from where you are socializing. Also the exterior gets hot so be careful with children. Works perfectly though and we have no regrets about purchasing it!",

I assume this also caused water to somehow get into the panel when it was not in use as the control panel will no longer function properly, nor will the remote control.
