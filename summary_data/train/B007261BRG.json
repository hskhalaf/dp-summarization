It became an instant paperweight, I had to buy another one",

It takes great pictures really quick so I snap and snap and snap like those paparazzi snapping pictures at whomever they were chasing. I've loaded some shots while on the road so you guys can see.

There are dozens of posts on dpreview from other owners who echo this problem; the battery only lasts 1-2 days, even after its firmware is updated. There is no need for me to go into details about the camera features, controls, picture quality or any other. It is unusable so none of these matter and I cannot recommend anyone purchase this product.",
