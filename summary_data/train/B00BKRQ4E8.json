      "text": "I think the first version of this scale I have is a little better than this one. I have had some inconsistent weights like 10-20 lbs off and when that happens re-seating the battery to power cycle the scale corrects it. The heart rate monitor has only given me a good heart rate a handful of times and most times it just fails to detect it. I was going to put scale in bedroom but my carpet wouldn't play nice with the weight readings even when using the carpet boots. I think the air quality test works ok but not entirely sure. Wifi connectivity still seems solid. Still a good product but needs some polishing of these extras.",

It seems like a small thing, but it's annoying as hell. Even more so for a $150 scale. You will see others complaining about it and the pat responses from Withings asking if 'anything is touching the bottom'. As though the button is inadvertently being pressed by something. It's not. For anyone that's worked in tech, you should recognize the repeated question as the Withings equivalent of Dev saying 'it works on my machine'. Rather, than an actual attempt to debug.",

The app and the Withings site makes it easy to see the how you are trending because it graphs your progress on a smooth curve over time. Both are easy to use. At least for me, the bodyfat calculation tracks fairly closely with much more expensive impedence sensors, such as the InBody. Not every measurement is accurate, but if you average them over a couple of weeks, you'll be in the ballpark.",
