I was so disappointed given all the great reviews so I washed them once on regular, once on hot, once with a ton of fabric softener....no change. They are terrible. Buyer beware.",

Normally I don't like to sleep under sheets and a comforter because it gets too hot but they are actually really fresh. Definitely buying some for my son, and recommend it for all :) P.s good time to buy now during Quarantine because you get to lay in bed all day lol",

And in the winter I can\u2019t use them because of the static they cause with every movement due to the polyester material. Even worse if one of my kids with fleece pj sleeps with us, every move causes a spark! They wash well and don\u2019t wrinkle and all that, but I would not recommend these.",
