      "text": "I don\u2019t know why mine are not a true white. I saw them at Nordstrom Rack and loved them but they didn\u2019t have my size. So I decided to buy them here but when I received them they were not like the ones I saw. This definitely have a cream-beige color and I\u2019m so disappointed since I was so excited to wear them",
