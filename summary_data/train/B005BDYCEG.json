It\u2019s designed for neutral runners who want to have a great shoe for their athletic activities, but it\u2019s also efficient when it comes to casual purposes.",
      "pros": [
        "The lightweight mesh material used in the upper of the Saucony Seeker is breathable and comfortable to the skin",
        "The overlay system has been hot-melted onto the upper, turning it into a single unit that\u2019s free from unnecessary layers, excess stitching and added weight",
        "Cushioning for the dimensions of the foot is given by the padded tongue and collar",
        "Runners welcomed the inclusion of a comfortable sock liner, which offers contoured support for the individual wearing the shoe",
        "Shock attenuation and responsible underfoot cushioning are given by the high-quality mid-sole foam units",
        "The XT-600 rubber is appreciated by many because it provided long lasting protection against wear and tear, as well as traction over the asphalt"

        "There were complaints that the Saucony Seeker looks somewhat bulky, which went in contrast to its lightweight nature"

In the picture, they look light grey and dark grey. IRL they look dark grey and black. I'm keeping them because they're so cushy and because they're pretty dang sharp -- although not quite what I expected.",
