      "text": "Saw these on Facebook and advertised everywhere so I decided to try one. It took some time getting used to getting it filled with air but once you know that it doesn't have to be completely full of air it is pretty easy to use. Once you get enough air in it, rolling the end will make it fuller. It is quite comfortable, depending on if you like it firm or not you can loosen it by unrolling the end. It has pockets on the side and comes with a stake if you want to keep it tied down. I would recommend this product. If you found this review helpful please click yes.",

It is essentially an inflatable coffin that you sink into a small slit between the inflated sides, while the pillow is high up. This is horrible for your back and neck and is not comfortable whatsoever. I spent nearly an hour trying to inflate this but within seconds it loses puff. I strongly regret buying this POS. The pictures are also very misleading for this product.",

Once you get the hang of the proper air-filling technique, it's actually pretty easy and even if it's not completely full of air you just keep rolling it to make it more firm. Pretty much fail proof. It's actually fairly comfortable and kind of hugs you. A little tricky with 2 people but where there's a will there's a way :). Comes with a carrying bag and stake so it can't fly away, definitely a mist have for festivals and park going in the future!",

But it turns out that the actual pressure is not dependent on how much air you get into it. The amount of air actually just determines the eventual length of the inflatable sofa. This is because you roll it up to the desired pressure. So it is as inflated as you want it to be. The more air you get in, the less you roll up the one end of it. So far durability looks good and I was even able to float on it in the water.",

We get so many questions and admiring comments when we use them. Easiest to inflate in windy weather, but doable without wind with a bit of effort. AND they float in water, which is an extra bonus.

So far this one I have had absolutely no problem with and very easy to fill up. Just takes a little practice. Don\u2019t get discouraged. My best advise is to have a taller person fill it for you. I\u2019m 5\u20191\u201d and it\u2019s fairly long and hard for me to get it in the air to fill but I can still make it happen if I don\u2019t have a tall person around.

If you get it just right, it's great! Keep in mind that the material WILL make you sweat if you're wearing a bathing suit and you're in the sun. Rolling it up isn't super hard, but I wouldn't say it's the easiest feat. Either way, I'm glad I have these and I'm looking forward to using them in the park soon!",

Nice fabric that repels sand, dries quick, and is comfortable not too synthetic feeling. Took 2-3 tries to properly catch air but the closure is folded closed and the latches keep it from unfolding and opening. Very happy!! Have used 10 times and it\u2019s comfortable and durable.",
