I do like using it to listen to FM and weather radio, but it does not alert. I had 6 different storm, flood and tornado alerts today and this radio just sat there. The power is working. It still charges. I have looked online for a fix and have read the owners manual several times. It is set to the correct channels. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this radio.",

An added feature is the fact that you also use the sun to power the solar cells to run the radio. You can also charge your smart phone with it. The radio can pick up NOAA weather channels, two short wave channels as well as AM & FM stations. The radio arrived as scheduled. I will definitely use this seller again,",

Yes, it can take awhile to charge using these methods, however the solar panel meets my expectations given it's size. The complaints about the hand crank also seem to me to be unreasonable.

Five minutes of cranking only gives you 5 to 20 mins of use. Radio signal goes out alot if your standing to close to it. Certain battery brands wont fit in back of radio.

      "text": "Radio is sturdy, and has five ways to charge it. Delivery was fast and well packaged. I recommend this radio for anyone in a hurricane prone area. When the power goes out and you can't even get tv or internet due to cable, it's a reliable source for news and entertainment. When the power goes out, you're bored, it's sweltering hot, everything is closed and there is the stench of rotting food, you really appreciate a self charging radio! Quality product.",

The radio is good, but there are lots of good choices out there, and if I was doing this again I would buy a radio that included the charger.",
