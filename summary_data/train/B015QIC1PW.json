I just realized, as the emergency alert sounded, that the reason it didn't sound was because the radio wasn't set to a NOAA station that received good reception. Continuing 5 star rating; however, make sure your radio is set to a channel that gets good reception or the alert will not sound.",

      "text": "I just received this radio today and was anxious to evaluate the performance. Thus far the radio does everything as advertised. A quick start guide is included as well as an owner's manual. For the most part the controls are quite intuitive and there is no real learning curve. AM and FM reception are both clear and strong. I am pleased to find the local weather channel is similarly clear and strong. The speaker quality is good considering the size, but for listening to music on the FM band I recommend headphones. The case seems to be very sturdy. I am pleased with the quality and performance of this unit.",

I found this radio to be so ideal, I purchased one for my daughter (in Florida) and one for myself. FYI, I also purchased three (3) ER-210's for other friends and relatives in Florida and Maryland. Th ER-310 is far better than a previous emergency radio system I had before. I would highly recommend both Midland models and the brand name Midland.",

I take this out with me when doing overnight astronomy shoots and can pick up stations in the middle of nowhere =D It can also be used to power my phone and with the built in hand crank it will never run out of power.",

Since the whole point of this thing is to be able to use it with a solar panel for charging, I contacted Amazon who is going to issue a credit upon the product's return. Overall it was fine for that emergency device, but be sure and check all modes of charging to ensure they all work.",

But by the time you lose power, the storm is upon you and there's little use for a weather report.",
