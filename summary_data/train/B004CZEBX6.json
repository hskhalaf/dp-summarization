Could we please get these pieces replaced? Thank you for your attention!",

It is obvious where different parts go since the assembly was only required for front tire, fenders, handlebars, pedals and seat. Pay attention that the handlebars are turned around, probably the only info we found that was extremely important to getting things in place. Make sure you have Allen Wrenches too. Would have given 5 stars all the way through except for the instructions. We did figure it all out in the end and absolutely love the bike.",

We added a wicker basket, because this is the kind of girl she is. She is more of a girly girl and not athletic, which is why we chose this bike. It fits her personality perfectly. She quickly learned to ride without training wheels.",

    "title": "Firmstrong Urban Girl Single Speed Beach Cruiser Bicycle",
    "description": "A great introduction to riding in style, the 20-inch single-speed Urban Girl cruiser bike from Firmstrong is ideal for both children just learning to ride as well as those who have graduated from training wheels. It features 20-inch wheels as well as front and rear fenders. The coaster brake stops by pedaling backwards, which is an easy and safe way for children to learn to ride. Sized for young riders from 3 feet, 2-inches to 4 feet, 4-inches tall, it's a great choice for many riding environments -- by the beach or anywhere else on a paved path. The Urban Girl is designed just like Firmstrong' s bikes for older riders with a classic, curvy cruiser design and a durable 13-inch steel frame. The 20-inch aluminum wheels feature 2.125-inch wide white-wall balloon tires that roll smooth and easy as well as cushion the bumps as you ride over them freely. The wide, oversized cruiser seat completes your comfort with dual springs that help make the ride soft and cushy. Both the seat and the handlebars can be adjusted for height and tilt to properly fit the rider. It also features a chain guard to protect pant cuffs from getting caught in the chain and wide cruiser bike handlebars with rubber grips. The bike is shipped 80 percent assembled. Firmstrong has been designing high quality, affordable bikes for over 10 years with a focus on blending style and functionality to create a fun, adventurous experience for riders -- not just a mode of transportation.",
