Four stars out of five because sometimes the edges roll when pants are pulled up over them, and have to be smoothed down to achieve that seamless look. They're super soft and comfortable for miles of running!",

They tend to roll a bit at the edges if you're pulling leggings up over them, but generally they stay in place and don't move around while exercising. So far they've washed and worn well, and I plan to get even more pairs.",

      "text": "This fabric color is cute as pictured and it is very light and soft fabric. However, after my 2 kids I have an ass. Size 4, 5'5\", 135 lbs and this pair was a wedgie nightmare. I work out HARD doing circuit training, weights, rowing, burpees, etc. I don't think I'll even wear these to work. I really hate them. My new theory is that most of these workout undies just don't stay put if you have a rear end. I don't think they would be completely seamless, but close, even though I don't care about that at all.",

They come in a fun range of fabrics too. To me they did seem to run a bit small, I ordered both sizes available and although I usually wear a small in other brands, I felt more comfortable in the M/L, but maybe I am just not used to wearing cheekster style. I highly recommend this panties and will probably be buying more in the future",
