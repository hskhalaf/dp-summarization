I\u2019m very disappointed about this. I would like to have a toilet to use in this bathroom. ... About the toilet, minus the porcelain finish, it really seems to flush exceptionally well. I understand that there are defects in items on occasion but truly, how long do you have to wait for a response?",

I also used a wax-less seal because I did not want to deal with wax. After 4 months, this toilet is doing great. it is an eco-friendly version and uses less water than the normal ones which is a plus. I am going to replace the other three in the house with the same model as this over the next 6 months.",
