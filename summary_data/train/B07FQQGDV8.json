They fit well, looked good, and were very comfortable. I was never in any sort of rain or mud so I can not speak to them being water resistant or water proof. Over all was very satisfied.",

I recommend Merrell shoes to anyone that has a high arch, I am a nurse and on my feet all day, Merrells seem to hug my feet and support my arch so that my legs and feet don't hurt when I get home.",

I live in the NW, and wear both shoes in the rain. I tried the heaver rain merrell boot and really disliked them, they were much heavier. I wear hiking boots or shoes everyday except high summer, then i switch to chaco sandals.",
