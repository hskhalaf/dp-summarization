      "text": "Just got my PDR Gliston Paintless Dent Repair Kit today. Years ago my 1983 Trans Am was parked under an acorn tree and as you can imagine, my car was hit in many places on the hood leaving lots of unsightly dings.I used this tool to remove those dings with ease and to my amazement they were all removed with no painting necessary. I love this tool and the ease of it's use, if I went to a bodyshop my wallet would have a huge hole in it, this saved me lots of money. Great product!",

They could be written better and more detailed. One example is to mention what the different colored glue sticks are for? I dd some research and have read people mentioning different outdoor temperatures.

Compared to other kits we have used, this was amazing, the actual puller tool is built solid, reusable and very simple. It has pads which prevents the tool from damaging the car. Comparing this tool to higher cost shop tools, it is amazing that you can save so much money. This tool really has saved us a lot of money by letting us simply pull out dents from our own garage, I would definitely recommend this tool to anyone looking for to fix dents easily on their own.",

After a lot of fiddling with different size bits, and many pulls, it has certainly made the dent smaller. I might try again when I have some more time. Key tips: 1. Clean the area well 2. Be patient. Make sure the glue gun has time to get hot; wait for the glue to harden on the metal too (it says 3-5 minutes; I left it 5 very time). 3. Don\u2019t expect a single pull to fix it!
