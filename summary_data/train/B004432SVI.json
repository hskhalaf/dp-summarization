The picture quality and low light performance is way above the pocket cameras. The manual adjustments and fine tuning is not as easy as multi dial SLRS but this one fits in my pocket. I get to travel a lot for business trips. On several occasion I came across great scenes and wished my camera was with me (which was practically impossible considering the size and weight of Nikon). Now I enjoy travelling light and getting excellent pictures in raw format. I highly recommend it to travellers.",

It also looks and feels great. It is incremental from the Dlux 4, but the refinements to the functions and improvements to video make a huge difference. The downside, you pay a numbing penalty for the Leica look and branding when the Panasonic would do just as well. The classic look is worth something, maybe not as much as the difference between the two cameras.",

This camera is the best one that allows me take fast and excellent pictures. Last week, I made many wonderful pictures in the Carnival in Olinda (Brazil). The camera was fantastic. The black body made me invisible among so many people. This is one of the top features of Leica cameras. I just do recommend. Paulo.",

UPDATE: After living with the D-Lux 5 for quite a while, and comparing its results with other cameras I own and use, I am less enthusiastic. I have found that the Lumix DL5 (almost identical in most respects) gives me better results for a lower price. I would now rate the Leica at 4 stars.",

With more than doubled price and its well-known brand, I had bigger expectation for its performance in low light situation than Nikon P300. It turned out to be a big disappointment for at least two reasons: 1. Lots of noise in low light condition with high ISO. Comparing with Cannon and Nikon, it is far from the standard in the digital world. 2. Very slow operation and low quality LCD display. My conclusion is that I would not recommend this camera to my friends and will look for another camera to replace this one.",
