      "title": "Shoes awesome, Amazon sucks",
      "text": "Ok shoes were awesome. Sizing not so much. I normally wear 10.5 EE and got 11EE after reading a bit about the sizing on New Balance. The sizing is off...way off. A full size larger is required. I could tell that these shoes would be comfortable if my toe wasn't James into the front of the shoe. Here's what really gets my goat. I think it's pretty chicken s*** of Amazon to charge $35 more for the next size up and it's not a prime shipment, so that's an extra 8 bucks. Same shoe from same place. Amazons not getting my money this time. So; 4 stars for shoes, 1 star for Amazon.",

Show Mother Nature who's boss in the 910v2, a multi-tasker offering the trail runner's triad of responsiveness, cushioning and protection. Enhanced flexibility, superior outsole traction and a lightweight REVlite midsole will help you stay on track. The upper of the MT910v2 delivers a durable construction that protects and supports the foot whilst retaining breathability via the durable mesh membrane. Allowing air to permeate within the shoe creating a cooler, direr more comfortable environment in which the foot rests. Protecting the toes and edges of the forefoot, the MT910v2 is designed with Toe ProtectTM which is a reinforcing rubber compound that protects against what nature throws at you. Sporting a REVlite midsole (An innovative foam compound providing the same responsiveness and durability of New Balance foams 30% heavier). REVlite offers a lightweight ride without minimizing construction or sacrificing underfoot cushioning or stability. One of the key features of the MT910v2 is the inclusion of ROCK STOP technology in the forefoot which helps to iron out sharp trail debris. The design operates around a flexible protective layer that helps protect feet from rocks and shock, and disperses shock energy. At the sole aggressive lugs find traction whilst a HHR rubber outsole (Hydro Hesion Rubber) stick to any surface offering enhanced traction when compared to a standard outsole compound.",
