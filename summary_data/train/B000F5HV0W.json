I ordered this bender and it was delivered the next day! It has the same radius as my other bender, so I finished a bend I had started with no problem. My only gripe is the bending surfaces are painted and will leave paint smudges on the work as they become worn. Polished bending surfaces are preferred though not reqired. They feel sturdy. Well worth the money. I wish I had bought this one for all my bending needs years ago instead of buying the other one first.",

If you want to bend any of the sizes this thing is designed for, it'll work great. You can use the 1/4 inch channel for 3/16ths but the tubing will have a tendency to slip. It'll work, but not nearly as well as a proper fit.",

I decided to go with OTC i was very impressed with this product, decent size and the long handles made the job of bending tubing a little better. Best of all i had the tool in my hand by the delivery date...it only took two days!!!",

I bought it to bend some brake line, then realized that the brake line metal was actually easily bendable and it was far easier to hand bend then to use this. However, those two bends I did with the tool were easy enough. If I have to use it again in the future I may edit my review, but for now I'll say it's solidly built and seems like it would work well on harder tubes.",

      "text": "This is a well made tool but the \"Heavy Duty\" nature of the tool makes it into a one-trick pony. I bought it for bending automotive brake lines, and it will bend them with ease. But, it only makes one fairly wide radius bend, and the 3/16\" tubing was really too small for the tool. Keeping the tubing centered in the tool and making an accurate bend requires three hands because the tool can't get a good grip on the tube until the bend is started. This tool is better suited to bending gas line, water lines, or other general larger tubing. For bending auto brake lines there are better choices out there.",
