      "text": "The leather case seems really nice but the back side or section where it covers the back of the screen is TOO heavy. When using laptop and i move it around it slips backward slowly. The hinges on mu surface laptop are really tight so that would not be the problem. Anyway. I will keep using it but will try not to move the laptop around as much, though that would prove to be impossible sometimes.",
