Also, the way the ear muffs fold up- the clip on the inside already came off and I had to clip it back. **Edit- I am tired of trying to fix these. Barely used and already had to throw them away.

The white fur will become soiled with makeup, etc. so I will try to soak in sink with dawn and squeeze out when the time comes. Cheap enough to just buy a new one every year.",

On her, they are just too big and they\u2019re not adjustable so I was pretty disappointed because they\u2019re super cute. The quality seems good except for the little ears, they were flimsy and easily ripped at the seam. I gave it 4 stars because they are cute but they shouldn\u2019t be marketed as toddler earmuffs. I wanted to use them for her 2 year pics but unfortunately I will be returning. Maybe I will buy a few years from now when she\u2019s older or if they make it adjustable.",
