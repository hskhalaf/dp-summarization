We ordered the round large Jumbler and we were very pleased it held up for more than a week and turned right around to order this football shaped. Unfortunately this didn't last an hour before I needed to pull it away from her. I cannot be sure if it is the balls shape blocks her snout from allowing her rear molars to break the handle apart or if this model is made with more plastic, but day and night between the two.",

It lasted a solid two months before I decided today to take it away as they were now managing to get little chunks out of it. Came to buy another, figuring at $20.50, it was a reasonable value for the money. Now, just over two months later, the price is $29.99! Is this one of those situations where Amazon knows you like the product, so they up the price of future purchases? I've read that that's a thing, but I haven't really paid attention before. Cannot afford a $30 chew toy, so as good as it is, I'll have to find something else.",

My reason for three stars is the durability. He chewed through the end of it within 30 minutes of getting it. We have to leave it up so he doesn't have access to it all the time. Yesterday he finally chewed clear through the middle. I think we've had it for maybe a month now. I'm actually ordering a replacement because he loves this toy so much. Just wish it held up better to the strong jaws of a bulldog.",

It looked promising when we received it-very sturdy plastic and a bright color that we could easily find in the yard. Plus it squeaks which my dog found surprising initially and then ended up really enjoying. Unfortunately Bo was able to tear the ball within a week of receiving it. This ball would probably work well for dogs with average to above average chewing tendencies but I wouldn't recommend it for dogs that are very strong chewers.",

We do not let him tug on it and he only gets to chew for a couple of seconds until I can make him \"give\". It's got one hole in it after a week but still works fine. It has a terrible animal dying sound I think he likes, but he liked it even when that sound quit for awhile.",

I can't believe the 1 or 2 or even 3 star reviews, that's why I just had to give this a review. Usually my dogs won't slow down on a toy until the squeaker stops squeaking usually in 15 or 20 minutes! This toy has been going strong for over a year and is their go to toy of choice! Most of the kong toys we have are the ones that last the longest!",

It's held up pretty considering the amount of attention it gets; it has a split seam, but that hasn't affected it; the inner ball is still inside, it still squeaks (yay?) and still holds up just fine to her constant attention. When it dies, we will definitely be purchasing another.",

But she LOVED IT! She still loves it even thought it's pretty dead. I was hoping after reading some reviews that this would be the toy that lasted the longest......sadly my search continues.",
