      "text": "Purchased for a baby shower. It was one of the cheaper pens i found so I thought the quality would be subpar. Boy was I wrong! Very high quality pens! Not flimsy or light. The black ink is actually very smooth to write with. It is ballpoint. It is also now my favorite pen because it writes so smoothly and dark. Everytime you click the pen a new message appears on the body of the pen. Very cute!",
