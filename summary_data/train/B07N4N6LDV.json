I bought it because I wanted my son to enjoy something as I did as a child however the handle broke right off when he was pushing it so i had my father look at it to see if he could fix it and he found that it was not properly put together in the first place and its not fixable.... I am so mad about this product because I figured for the price i paid it would have been a great product but its definitely not plus its small",

      "text": "My one-year-old grandson's current mission in life (he started walking a couple of months ago), is to push things through the house. This popper toy is just the ticket! From the moment he laid eyes on it, it has been his \"go-to\" toy. It keeps him busy off-and-on for hours during the day. It's fun to watch his intensity as he examines the wheels and the popping balls while pushing it through the house. The popper is colorful and joyfully noisy, but it's also durable, so when he drives it into cabinets, furniture or the wall, it stands up to the beating but also does no damage. Highly recommend!",
