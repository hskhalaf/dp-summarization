Definitely need this, especially when you're sick and using cough drops to treat that pesky sore throat. This value pack is honestly more than worth it. One for the home, one for travel, and an extra set for when you need to replace it!",

The Orabrush Tongue Cleaner are the surgical drone strikes that take our the terrorists hiding (in this wild analogy) in the crevasses of your tongue. I use both, and the whole thing takes 60 secs or less. Beautiful combo of products.",
