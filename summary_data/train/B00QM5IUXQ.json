The length fit was close to being perfect, but they were way to short on the sides, as they only cover half of the panels on each side, they did not even cover the steps on the tunnel and I do not have raised bars or a tall windshield either to keep it from fitting better on the sides, so I am very unimpressed, as I was looking for a good snowmobile cover that fit properly.",

Very few attachment points (good if you just want to keep the dust off in a garage, bad if you want to store it outside in the wind, and definitely bad if you want to use it to trailer your snowmobile). It has a 7 year guarantee. I will be very surprised if it lasts a year as we store our snowmobiles outside in Colorado. The UV destroys nylon. Last, as the ad for the cover shows, it is designed to fit newer snowmobiles with snub noses. Ours are the older type and though we can make it work, it doesn't fit well.",

      "text": "I bought this to cover my 2010 skidoo mxz TnT 600. The cover fit length-wise, but didnt come down far enough to cover the bottom panels of the sled. I do have bar risers so maybe thats why, but I was disappointed with this. The biggest disappointment though was the fact that the cover practically disintegrated on the trip home on the trailer. Two buckles broke and the back side of it tore a huge hole, making it useless. I guess I'll try to get my money back or a replacement with the 7 year warranty, which is partly why I bought this, and why I'm giving it a 2 star instead of 1.",

And the guy that I gave it to loaned it out and it ended up being a shredded mess on his trailer after an hour on the highway. They may have a great warranty but I have no interest in pursuing a replacement. Owning another ill fitting sled cover that not only looks bad but doesn't hold up does not interest me. At least it was cheap.",
