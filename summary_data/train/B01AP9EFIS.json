Amazon Warehouse simply filled a 5 Lb cereal bag, sealed it, labeled it from the warehouse with an expiration date, and shipped it. At least it was clear and I could see inside. -Value for Money: 5/5; Got this 5 Lb baby for $7.95...compared to prices that I can find in my local supermarket, I would've paid $40!",
