It has the triclad bottom, a weldless ball valve down low on the pot (that came with a hose barb), instructions for assembling, and the gallon markers inside going by one half to 9. Very pleased.",

Ive ordered several small brew kettles in this price range and this is by far the best. With its features i dont think you'll find a better value. Thick tri-ply bottom, deburred hole for valve, riveted handles, and etched measurements inside",

Added another port on top for recirculating beer thru my cooler. Probably will be adding a thermometer to it very soon also. It arrived in perfect shape and the packaging inside seemed to enough to protect it during normal shipping. I'd buy one again if i had to.",

It\u2019s a 10 gallon pot if it\u2019s full to the rim. Perfect for what I need. Nice a thick happy with it, but it can with a dent free of charge. The packaging was great.
