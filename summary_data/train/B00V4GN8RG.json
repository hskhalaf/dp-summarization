The one downside is because the ties sit in the case folded, they can have a bit of a crease when unpacking, especially if they are a Material other than silk. The case itself was slim and professional, and fit well into my luggage.",

Also, the snap broke on one of the bands the first time I tried it so very disappointed and will be returning it and replace with a different product",
