Even at full zoom and in a variety of lighting, it takes awesome photos. Haven't had a blurry or grainy one yet. Even without a tripod I was able to take an amazingly detailed photo of the full moon. And even with morning fog, the photos came out sharp! I continue to be impressed by this camera's ruggedness against the elements: most of my photography is at the beach (read: sand, salt, and saltwater spray), and it's held up so far and seems to be well built to endure.",

The FOCUS just doesn't work... and I've shared it with two Emmy winning videographers who both said the same thing. It struggles to focus, either in manual or automatic settings, unless one is zoomed way in. So, in other words, it's impossible to shoot wide shots. I really want to like this camera, but if it comes back from the repair center with the problem not fixed, I'm going on the warpath. This camera has already burned me on several important shoots for our Outdoor Idaho series this summer. Bruce Reichert",

I like the very fast (f/2.8) aperture setting available at the longest zoom--handy for acquiring images of faint celestial objects. Only drawback is the need to re-focus whenever the zoom is adjusted when in manual focus. Battery life is also a bit short (about 300 shots give or take) so have a couple of spares handy. When adjusted correctly it yields stunning images--my eclipse pics came out perfectly! Overall, next best thing to a full-frame camera and big bazooka lens costing thousands more...and a lot easier to carry into the wilderness.",

There are programmable buttons for frequently access functions. And it's got a touch screen. Once I figure out the menus I'll report back.",

That's especially important on safari when you are often taking photos at dawn and dusk. Also didn't need to lug around different lenses. The action happens so fast there wouldn't be time to change them anyway. I mostly just used autofocus and snapped away. Exceedingly happy with this camera.",

There are many features about this camera to learn, but the videos are very helpful as is the book by Graham Houghton. Controls are placed nicely. It has a good feel in my hands. The electronic screens in the flip-out monitor as well as in the eyepiece viewer as much nicer. I'm not sure I've found anything about it that I don't like.",
