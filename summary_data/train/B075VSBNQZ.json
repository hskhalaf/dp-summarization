It's a great value with parts cheaper than assembling it yourself. The build quality and cable management are great and the ease of having it just ship to your house assembled is great. It shipped in a sturdy box, with plenty of cushion. On startup, there was no bloatware or adware to harass you. This is a great option if you're looking for a price to value solution. Simply put, with the market as it is now, these prebuilt systems are an excellent way to buy a good computer without paying a premium price.",

Cons: The only one I can think of is that the mother board is the cheap ASRock z370 Pro4, which has worryingly small heat sinks if you're thinking of overclocking, and has a wonky BIOS. Would recommend this if the price drops for a holiday or something. Or if you don't want to overclock, as far as my limited knowledge can tell.",

      "text": "I am very satisfied with Cyber Power. The packaging was neat, the components were clean and well set, and overall, I experienced no surprises. As other reviewers have already explained, given the current demand for mid-to-high end graphics cards, it's more cost-effective to buy pre-built PCs (never thought I'd see the day), and after spending a few hours looking for both individual components and pre-builts, these guys offered the best product IMO. The process to set up this beast was easy: open box, remove protective foam, ensure cables were set, and plug-n-play! Now time for some benchmarks :)",

I couldn't be happier about the purchase. Highly recommend this PC to anyone looking to make a gaming PC but doesn't want to go through the hassle of buying individual parts and doing cable management.",

Another problem I faced was when using it for a long time it heated up my room alot, you can just use a fan to cool yourself down to counter that though.
