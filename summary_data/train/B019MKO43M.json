It's a big investment paying for a new router and still having spend for an extender. To be fair Asus make the same outlandish performance claims as every other manufacturer out there. Interestingly Asus don't even make a UK version WiFi extender that supports this model, I had to buy TP Link",

I have never had faster internet speed before, even over WiFi, I've reached speeds of almost 400Mbps. This product is definitely worth the \u00a3200 price tag. The software is easy to use and you can do everything you need to with it, it even comes with its own protection, which does have a slight performance impact on the 2.4GHz network, but not the 5GHz.

      "text": "Like the easy set up. Strong and fast WiFi signals. Several guest SSID\u2019s. Good user interface and VPN set up. The game fast thing...... only for certain games and it is a subscription service. Although it seems good and it may not be relevant for me personally. I suppose that\u2019s not a negative but be aware it is a subscription if you want the gamer fast thing. Overall I am very happy with it after a reluctant replacement for my Cisco router which was getting slower. The replacement ASUS has put the speed back up to where it should be and has a stronger signal. Bonus!",

Asus haven't released the Alexa channel in the UK. And any attempt to link with IFTTT fails; I've seen a variety of different error messages, and contacted Asus support, but with no success. Other than this, the router's fine, but nothing special. Speed is ok. Reception isn't great - it's in the middle of the house, but we still have black spots. Firmware is a bit buggy and can be rather overwhelming, but has been improved since I bought it.",

Unfortunately it seems whilst the feature set was there the build quality was not.",
