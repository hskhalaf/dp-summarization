Excellent customer service on their part! Very happy now. thank you!!! Former review- I love these and the concept but I\u2019m really upset the ones that are supposed to say \u201cfrom the new mr and mrs\u201d are off center so they actually say \u201cROM the new mr & mrs\u201d. The ones that don\u2019t say rom have the F almost cut off. So disappointing! I hope you make right about this.",
