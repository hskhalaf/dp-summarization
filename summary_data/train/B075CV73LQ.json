The company, however, reached out to me via email and was more than willing to replace the product. I think it certainly says a lot about a company's business mode when they are willing to reach out to dissatisfied consumers (I didn't reach out to them; they emailed me first). Long story short, I got my blender today and it works. The broken blender threw a huge wrench into an important VIP dinner, but mistakes happen, and I won't hold this boo boo against the company.",

This baby has a steel arm and blades. It's much heavier that the plastic one but in a good way. It's just as easy to hold but feels sturdier. It has absolutely no problem mixing thicker fluids such as honey and aloe Vera gel. This is truly the multi tasker stick blender.",

The motor housing is easy to hold in one hand and the buttons depress easily. The two speeds work well and it is easy to clean. I am giving 4 stars because sometimes the food gets stuck in the little openings around the edges of the dome around the blade. Overall very pleased with my purchase.",

      "text": "love this so much! I like to use cream cheese in a lot of my soups but getting them to be creamy and not chunky can be challenging but no problem with this hand blender. Its really powerful, easy to use attractive looking. The only thing is doesn't work that great for large frozen strawberries in a smoothie or large pieces of ice cubes.",

      "text": "The color is beautiful. I looked at some reviews for the best one, I think it rated 3rd or 4th, but the others had a lot of other things with them, were more expensive and didn't come in all the amazing colors. This is the best Immersion stick handmixer. I have tried a couple, but this one is the best I have used. The price was very reasonable for such a quality item. If you are looking to purchase one, I would 100% recommend this one. Plus you can put a little color in you kitchen because there is a lot of colors to choose from. You will be very happy you got it.",

When you try to re-screw it in, it works for a few seconds but then the blade pops out again. So I returned it and Amazon sent me another one just like it. It worked for several months but just yesterday, the same exact thing happened (all I was doing was whipping milk, nothing hard). I am so disappointed and will have to order a different brand this time.",
