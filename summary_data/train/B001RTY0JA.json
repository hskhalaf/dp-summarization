      "text": "This grill is cheaply made, which one should expect for the price tag. The worst part, in my opinion, is the grill grate itself. Its made out of stamped steel, meaning it is thin, and it is coated with porcelain. The porcelain coating easily flakes off, which is unacceptable, even for the price tag. Thinking that maybe I got a dud or abused my grill, I returned it and had the exact same thing happen on the second one within about 2 weeks. I would not recommend this grill.",

The latch mechanism does not connect or latch properly. But, for a $49 BBQ, I overlook the deficiencies. It does, however, BBQs well! I store it in a heavy duty recyclable Trader Joe\u2019s shopping bag. Perfect for tight storage.",

VERY even cooking, small and compact size, ideal for our camper, pretty efficient too. It cooks quickly, almost too quickly if you aren't paying attention, I assume because of it's rather shallow vertical dimensions. Thick burgers, steak or chicken breast are no problem. A bottle of propane lasts a long time. I'm quite impressed. I wish there were 4 1/2 stars.",

It is also a little tricky to seat the grill cover when taking it down. The tolerances are not there but all in all for the low prize it'll do.",

      "text": "I used it the day I got it. I live in an apartment and wanted something that I could bring inside and not have the smell of charcoal and this is great. It looks really sharp. Some reviews say it is made out of cheap metal but it is very strong metal. I was able to cook a decent size steak and also 6 average size burgers on it at the same time so it works out really good for a small family of four like we are but would be great for camping too. This is a great product.",
