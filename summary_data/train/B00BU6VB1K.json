I wasn't expecting much, but the foam is super soft and supportive. When it arrived, I sat on it and was surprised enough by the support that I called my husband over and sit on it too! The print on the fabric is bright and crisp- it's all around a quality cushion.",

I'll see if ican get used to it but i think the blue might have too much 'color' to work EDIT I'm keeping them! they and the chair work beautifully in another room. so pretty",
