Its a heavy lump though and whilst this provides a reassuring feeling of quality and substance, when added to a D7000 and a monopod, be prepared for a good workout when out in the field.

Second, the picture quality is amazing. I have not tested it fully for falloff etc, but shot some landscape and portraits which all turned out great. It can handle low light as well. Great all-round lens for the price.",

    "description": "Size Name:18-105 mmThe AF-S DX NIKKOR f/3.5\u20135.6G VR from Nikon has just become even more attractive to D-SLR enthusiasts. More compact and portable than its predecessor, this multi-purpose retractable lens is the easy way to capture the moment. The 3x zoom combined with advanced Nikon technology offers optical quality and versatility, delivering high-contrast photos and movies. Suited to everything from flattering portraits to action-packed events, this is the ideal lens to accompany you on your travels. Featuring Nikon\u2019s second-generation Vibration Reduction system (VR), this lightweight lens can provide images free of blur due to camera shake at all focal lengths. Designed to enable stable hand-held shooting, Nikon\u2019s VR technology allows you to use shutter speeds up to 4 stops slower than would otherwise be possible, resulting in sharp images, even in low light. Being an optical system, the viewfinder image is also stabilised, enabling more accurate autofocus acquisition and framing. So whether you are zooming in to capture faraway subjects or shooting wide-angle group portraits in low light, the AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR will deliver crisp, clear shots. The lens comprises eleven elements in eight groups, in a design including one aspherical lens element. For a soft rendering effect, the iris diaphragm has seven rounded blades, producing high-quality natural backgrounds. The aspherical lens element helps eliminate problems of distortion and other types of lens aberrations to ensure high-resolution, contrast and deliver required image quality.\n\nLEGAL DISCLAIMER\nMust be at least 18 & over to purchase\n\nMANUFACTURER'S DESCRIPTION\nDX-format, high-power 5.8x zoom lens with focal length ranging from 18 to 105mm.\n\nBroad picture angle range approximates the perspective of a 27-157.5mm lens on a 35mm-format film camera or Nikon FX-format digital SLR.\n\n Covers diverse shooting situations from wide-angle landscapes and interiors to portraiture and medium-range sports.\n\n Vibration Reduction assures sharper handheld pictures while shooting at shutter speeds up to three stops slower than would otherwise be possible.\n\nBuilt-in Silent Wave Motor delivers quiet, swift autofocus with superior accuracy. \n\nHigh-performance optical system featuring an ED glass element and an aspherical lens element realizes superior image reproduction capability.\n\n The rounded 7-blade diaphragm opening renders out-of-focus elements more naturally.\n\n Leather texture matches Nikon digital SLR\u2019s body high-quality exterior design.\n\nBOX CONTAINS\n\n\nAF-S DX NIKKOR 18-105mm f/3.5-5.6G ED VR lens 2x lens covers One year's manufacturer guarantee\n\nSee more",
