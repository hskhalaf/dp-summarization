      "verdict": "The Inov-8 Fastlift 335 helped a significant number of training enthusiasts feel more stable and confident when lifting. The platform was firm and grippy, and the elevated heel allowed for a more in-depth squat, even under heavier weight. On the downside, many wearers had difficulties in getting the right size and fit, and some complained about the frailty of the Velcro strap. But on the whole, the shoe was able to have a positive effect on the weightlifting and cross-training performance of its owners.",

All I can say is, I should have been using something like this for years now. Much more stability than my regular trainers and a more comfortable heel position than barefoot. I'm lifting heavier with more confidence and they look great! I'm normally a size 11 with a wide foot. I bought 10.5 (off the advice here), perfect fit.",

The slight elevation in the heel and solid flat sole make a tonne of difference. Squats and deads feel like I'm glued to the floor and you can really push through your heels with ease. They are very light and can be used for box jumps, skipping, etc. Highly recommended.",

Despite its features and very nice looking, where the shoe appearance is fantastic to be worn, I feel less confortable at the position of my toe, it is a little bit harder than I thought as for prorection. However, my size is 45 I do not think the shoes is really 45 because it does not fit completely on my foot. I suggest that the company has to revision the sizes to avoid such a problem. All in all, the shoe has amazing colour, modern, and stylish. But the size is really matter.",
