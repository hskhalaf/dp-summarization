I lost a lot of food into the \"gutter\" as I was trying to catch it from getting away. Usually ended up with a big mess (like hibachi) in the end and food that was either overcooked or undercooked. Very heavy to lift. Upkeep is more than I wanted to invest since it needs to be \"oiled\" after handwashing. Went back to using electric griddle.",

This isn't really the fault of the griddle, but a function of my burner placement. It is too hot directly over the burner and too cold in between. Perhaps if this were used on a grill with an even heat source underneath it would be great. I am going to buy an electric griddle instead.",

      "text": "Great for cooking on the grill or over gas. Cooked a whole pound of bacon on it and the drip catcher allowed it to hold all of the resulting grease comfortably. Gives tons of surface area to work with and holds its heat well. Doesn't work too well if you aren't cooking with gas, however (cold areas between burners on glass top stove), something to keep in mind. Handles make cleaning and general handing easy. As with cast iron in general, this thing is indestructible and will probably outlive you.",

      "text": "The pan itself is exactly what you expect it to be as far as durability and quality. It\u2019s Lodge, so you know it\u2019ll probably outlive you if you treat it right. My issue is that I paid extra for a pre-seasoned pan that was ready to cook on, and either that\u2019s not what I received, or the pre-seasoning job was inadequate. Everything that touched this pan stuck to it on first use, including a dry, halved English muffin. I ended up spending 20 minutes scraping and scrubbing to get everything off of it, and ultimately had to re-season it myself the way I do my other cast iron pans. Lesson learned. Save $10, buy un-seasoned and season it yourself.",

And it doesn't matter how much time I let it pre-heat. I would never buy one of these again and I'm currently shopping for a new hard-anodized griddle like my other griddle I also need to replace (which does a great job of cooking evenly despite being warped and using it over the largest and smallest burners).",

It has severe hotspots and takes close to 30 minutes to heat evenly enough to use effectively. This is probably a function of the grill grates on the coil side. A flat-flat griddle would likely work better.",

I use the flat side almost exclusively. Also use metal utensils on these. 5 stars because its a very heavy duty piece of cast iron. Its just a hunk of metal and a very high quality one at that.

The grill side works pretty good for chicken and stuff like that but I don't use it that often.",

It's a high-quality product. I love it and recommend it to everyone. If you are looking for something like this, search no more. This is the one.",

I have used the Lodge a half-dozen times on the same Jenn-Aire stove as the aluminum griddle, and have found--unlike the aluminum model--that the Lodge will not heat evenly, even after lots of experimentation. Pancakes are burned on one edge and uncooked on the other. This is a defective design, and the failed heat distribution pattern is surprising, given the heftiness of the griddle. I do not understand how this item remains on the market, much less why it gets good reviews.",

They said this happens during the seasoning process as the oil is sprayed on the item it drips off while being heated and sometimes leaves these \"seasoning bubbles\".

    "description": "Style Name:GriddleThe Lodge Reversible Pro Grid Iron Grill/Griddle provides excellent heat retention and distribution and fits over two stovetop burners. Two easy grip handles allow for easy lifting, flipping or hanging when not in use. You can use this grill to cook pancakes and eggs or grill chicken and steak.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nThe American-based company Lodge has been fine-tuning its construction of rugged, cast-iron cookware for more than a century. No other metal is as long-lasting and works as well for spreading and retaining heat evenly during cooking. Lodge's Logic line of cookware comes factory pre-seasoned with the company's vegetable oil formula, and is ready to use right out of the box. \n\n This professional-size cast-iron grill/griddle combo from the Lodge Logic series measures 20 by 10-1/2 inches (with an actual cooking surface of 19-1/4 by 8-1/2 inches), serious enough to straddle either a campfire or two burners on your stovetop. The reversible feature of this crowd-pleasing cooker means you can use the smooth side for cooking flapjacks, eggs, and grilled cheese sandwiches, and the ridged grill side for hamburgers, steaks, and sausages. A slight slope drains fat into a generous grease gutter, and the two loop-style handles provide safe transport. After the meal is done, simply scrub the cast iron with a stiff brush and hot water, no soap, and dry immediately. Lodge covers the sturdy griddle with a lifetime limited warranty against defects. This pan is guaranteed to pass down from one generation to the next. --Ann Bieri",
