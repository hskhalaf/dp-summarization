Only two complaints, out of the box the colors are terrible, but are easily fixed by tinkering with the display settings on the graphics card software. The speakers are also nearly useless. Everything sounds tinny and underwater. I wouldn't use this for music or movies without external speakers. I bought this for work, so it's not a big deal to me.",

The lid of the screen is visibly falling apart from the pics. This is separate from the HINGE issue that a lot of other users are facing. I've never seen any sort of malfunction like this and Dell certainly won't fix it for free, claiming it is a 'wear and tear' issue. Absolutely ridiculous, Dell used to have great laptop products.

Couple that with the HDMI and the actual laptop screen you can have three screens running simultaneously.",

The only downside to this Dell is the placement of the power button. It's right where you want to grab the device when you pick it up so I've inadvertently turned it off/on when I hadn't intended to. Given Dell's recent track record of snafus..I'll give them a pass since everything else is great.",
