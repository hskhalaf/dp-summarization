      "text": "Seems to be okay for its intended purpose and basic function, based on just one or two uses. However, the lower 3-star rating has to do with the unit's construction, assembly, etc. If you are not careful and tilt the screen too far back for the best view, the thing will just flip all the way over. In other words the top screen part is heavier than the bottom keypad so it is not balanced well. They need to either provide a better, more visible screen so it doesn't have to be adjusted so far past the 90 degree vertical or they need to add weight to the bottom keypad.",

The arrow button used to scan downward is sticking and not functioning properly. It sticks and is difficult to use. There is no contact when pushing the button. This button should have been made stronger since it used a lot. In this price range I expected a better quality product. I can not recommend this Seiko product. I would not buy this unit again. You should seriously consider a different dictionary since 6 months is too short a time for failure.",

For such a quality price/product - this failed result is unsupportable by a well-known corporation. I did re-order the same model because it provided excellent information.
