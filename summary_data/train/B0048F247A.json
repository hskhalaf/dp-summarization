Stamped sheet metal throughout, barely adequate manufacturing tolerances, and a rotation arrow that absurdly points in the wrong direction. The tool is marked \"KNIPEX 90 70 220 Germany\" and does an acceptable job of punching holes in .125\" leather. OK for occasional use but NOT a pro grade Knipex tool.",

    "description": "Made In Wuppertal-Cronenberg, Germany. In Addition To Quality, Innovation And Performance, Other Important Cornerstones Are Sustainable Actions And Value-Guided Orientation.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\nRevolving head with six interchangeable punches (view larger). Designed to punch out holes in leather, textiles, and plastic materials, this pair of revolving punch pliers from Knipex (model 90 70 220) includes six interchangeable punches \u2014 5/64-inch, 3/32-inch, 1/8-inch, 9/64-inch, 5/32-inch, and 13/64-inch diameters. The 8-3/4-inch pliers feature an opening spring and locking lever, red powder coated finish, and oil-hardened tool-grade steel.\n\nQUALITY IN EVERY DETAIL\nSometimes we give our pliers a really hard time. We try to destroy them to find out what makes them good and long lasting. Because we don't want to leave anything to chance, we take a long, careful look. \n\nThe steel Knipex uses is precisely hardened with a maximum of 0.8 percent carbon and defined parts of chromium and vanadium, guaranteeing optimum cutting performance and service life \u2014 even though it requires special production and costs a bit more. But our high product demands require this.\n\nThe rivet of our high-leverage diagonal cutter also has to stand up to a lot of stress. That's why we literally give it backup: we forge it straight onto the pliers. This means extra effort as we have to precision mill the rivet to a few hundredth millimeters. But satisfied users are worth this effort.\n\nKnipex also looks closely at the small details. The angles, the sharpness, the hardness, the toughness of the cutting edges. The precision and smooth movement of the joint. The handle design and the finish. We keep reviewing these subjects, we research, we test, and we improve our pliers.\n\nABOUT KNIPEX\nHeadquartered in Wuppertal, Germany, Knipex is an independently owned family enterprise steeped in tradition and specializing in the manufacturing of high-quality pliers. It all started back in 1882 when C. Gustav Putsch set up his own forge shop in Cronenberg (now a suburb of Wuppertal), and the company is now run by a fourth generation of that family. The world's leading brand in pliers today, Knipex is focused on the performance, service life, and ergonomics of its tools in order to meet the high expectations of professional users.\n\n90 70 220 REVOLVING PUNCH PLIERS\nAT A GLANCE\n * For punching out holes in leather, textiles, and plastic materials\n * Six interchangeable punches\n * Opening spring and locking lever\n * Red powder coated finish\n * Chrome vanadium heavy-duty steel, forged and oil-hardened",
