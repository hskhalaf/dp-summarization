Put in 300-500 hours over 3-6 months. if you think any book is going to replace that, you need to get over it and commit to doing the work. As a resource for the price, this is value add and I would recommend it, despite what naysayers have said. Just get past the fact that there are no true secrets but its a good resource nonetheless.",

I can get the concepts down but the stress of the MCAT is overwhelming. The content is good, my only critique content wise is that it would be very beneficial if the pictures and diagrams were in color. That was a big disappointment. and that some pages were way too content heavy. It was difficult to shuffle through some of the text on some subjects.",

Thumbs up, I am very fond of it. Thank you for your help!",

The practice tests are a great help too. Definitely loving this study guide. Thank you Momentrix you have saved my butt!!",
