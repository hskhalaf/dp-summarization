      "text": "Watch is okay, as long as you're not buying it for the water resistance. Industry designations for water resistance are very misleading: this watch is rated to 30 meters. Who knew that meant it was only intended for water exposure during light rain and occasional handwashing?! The \"reasonable person\" standard does not apply here (i.e., I'm not scuba diving to a depth of 30 meters, hence this should cover me), so buyer beware! If you're looking for a watch that can actually get wet, research well the industry's water resistance designations (even if you don't live under the sea!) so you can choose a product that will actually meet your needs and not be dissappointed.",

The brown/black version (with black face and silvery metallic hands) is incredibly hard to read, depending on where you are, what the light / sun situation is, what room you're in, or the angle of reflection. The silver hands reflect light back at you, like two thin mirrors. This is fine if you're outside. under broad daylight. But if you're inside, or in your car, or holding the watch angled toward you such that the sun doesn't hit it at the exact correct angle, it's like having a watch with black hands against a black dial.",

The Pros 1) press button backlight is bright 2) the dial is easy to read at a quick glance 3) the band is comfortable and has many levels of adjustment 4) I love the fact that it has military time as well The Cons 1) the button/adjustment dial came completely out when I tried to first adjust it. I was expecting it to pull out further. 2) I'd like it if the backlight also \"charged\" the numbers while illuminated at night so that after the button is let go, the numbers stay illuminated. Great watch and great price overall",

I wanted to get him the Timex easy reader but didn't like the band options, he doesn't need the heavy and bulky steel bracelet links and the leather would stay wet when he washed his hands, so this watch was the one I choose. The nylon band is lightweight and comfortable. The dial is large and numbers are easy to read for him. I wish it was offered without the military time but it's still very minimalistic.",
