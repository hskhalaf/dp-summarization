Thus, I had to find a saddle with more than a little padding to help keep my family jewels and backdoor intact and healthy. Other than that, the Mongoose Fat Tire bike is amazing for this fat guy! I am hoping to not be as fat, soon, as this Mongoose makes riding FUN!",

I have been working my way down by 2 lb. increments. It handles and turns great on trails and gives you confidence when going through the woods. There was a lot of talk about it being heavy and hard to pedal. I am 68 and have no problem. It is only .5 lb. heavier than my Raleigh Route 4 hybrid. Looking forward to riding it this winter in the snow and seeing how it handles there.",
