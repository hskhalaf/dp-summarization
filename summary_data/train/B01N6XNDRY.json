      "text": "Simply put I have big feet and use orthotics in my running shoes. I wear a 15 extra wide which I got these in. Usually with this size my feet have room to move and breathe and lace for perfect comfort. Not here. It was a squeeze to get my feet in and then the laces were way too short that I could not even double lace them. Very uncomfortable and in no way an option for my overpronation. I guess it is trial and error for personal preference with running shoes but these just did not work for me. I have worn the Brooks Beast in the past which fit much better.",

      "text": "Brooks has once again fumbled in the odd-numbered year of this shoe. Like the '15, the '17 tries to cradle the foot too much, which puts undue pressure on the whole foot, but especially on the outermost and innermost toes. While this effect is not quite as bad in the '17 as it was in the '15, Brooks added some stitched-on pieces in the front of the shoe, which further compress the toes. This type of thing is not acceptable in a long-distance running shoe. In the ONLY brand/model that still consistently carries a real EEEE shoe, it is unforgivable.",

      "text": "I've been a loyal Brooks wearer for a few years now, but this newer model is made of very cheap materials. The fit was fine, and the shoe comfortable, but the shoe's rubber and paint started peeling within the first week of use. My first pair I exchanged due to a manufacturing defect (a poor seam), and the second I simply returned because it was falling apart. It's a shame my local running store only stocks the latest model of each brand, because I feel the GTS 16s were a better shoe.",

Well they don't list the Heather/Anthracite/Primer Grey ones are a different material that is not as breathable (almost water resistant?) like the other color combo so it fit completely different. It was tight on my foot and of course they didn't do half sizes so back they went.",

      "text": "This is the second pair of Brooks GTS I've had, the first being the GTS 12. The latter are over 5 year old by now and, apart from the cushion worn out due to extensive use - the reason I purchased the GTS 17, they look like new. These GTS 17, however have ripped along the sides on both shoes after less than a year. The fabric quality feels inferior to the GTS12, making me suspect Brooks have tried to save money. I've looked at the GTS 18 as a replacement, but the material feels even more flimsy than the 17. So at the moment I'm looking at the Mitzuno Inspire or Asics Gel Kayano.",

I'm not a mega exercise person, but do a bit of walking each day and for the high price you would expect them to last at least 6 months or more (tread coming off and worn out). Will be going back to a different brand that lasted MUCH longer for about 30% less$$.",
