The app is nice to use when you're on the go so you don't have to lug your cards around.

For all the people that complain that this is a \"useless product\" they must only be using the flashcards to study for 7 1/2 hour exam. That by itself is unreasonable. These cards are perfect to review the information when you just need a little quick check. Registering through the online Kaplan course gives you the online version that you can check out on your phone, or iPad. The paper cards are great too if you are somewhere where there is no Wi-Fi. I highly highly highly recommend any One materials for MCAT prep!",
