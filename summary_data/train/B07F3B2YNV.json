All the others had broken pieces and could not be fully salvaged. This one had no broken pieces and plenty of icing and decorations. In this kit Wilton includes the most adorable candies shaped like Christmas lights that were the envy of all the other kids. All four little houses turned out exactly like their pictures - happily made by a six-year old with Mom helping to put the pieces together...",

They have lines baked into each house piece to break into side pieces. When I tried to help with the instruction for breaking apart, the pieces were so old and hard, they just crumbled. I think they were from last year. Terrible quality. Needless to say, we were both really disappointed. Don't waste your money. I thought for a Wilton product, they would be much better. Also, the icing was extremely messy.",
