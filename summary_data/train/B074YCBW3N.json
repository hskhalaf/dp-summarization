I've noticed lots of black burn-off from them. Next time I use them I plan to adjust the wick to a lower position so there is very little wick exposed to see if that helps. I also recommend blowing them out before replacing the top piece as it does get a bit black/charred if you use it to extinguish the flame.",

The only thing was that the flame was so intense and turning smoky and black a bit, that we had to take them off the table right away because the smoke & flame was way too intense and was immediately bothering everybody which was pretty disappointing. I guess maybe I\u2019ll have to pull the wicks down even further although i had already done this. Maybe for table top you really need a smaller thinner wick.",

The next time I went to use the rest, two of the three glass bottoms broke off at the neck. These two torches were sitting unmolested then suddenly just shattered off. I like the look but there must be something fawed in the design where they spontaneously break.",
