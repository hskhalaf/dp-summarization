      "text": "I like the style and weight of the silverware, but I was quite disappointed to see that 10 of the 65 pieces arrived with some sort of scratch, dent, or pitting. That's is a large percentage with issues, and this is a set from China. Everything is usable, but has lost some cosmetic appeal right out of the box. It makes me wonder if it will hold up for more than a few years.",

I had read through the other reviews before purchasing, and many spoke of the nice weight of each utensil is in your hand. I have to agree with them; the product feels great while holding it. The smooth design and shape of the handle have a lot to do with this as well. I have noticed that the spoons have gotten a little scratched, but it's nothing bad. I would HIGHLY recommended this product and seller to anyone!",

Another thing is that once you wash them you have to wipe them or you will have water spots. Other than that I think they are great and would definitely recommend them.",
