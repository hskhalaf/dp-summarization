      "text": "This blender exploded on my wife on only its third use. A piece of glass the size of a golf ball shot out of the pitcher approximately 10 feet away. The glass sliced her finger but could have done much worse if she was standing somewhere else or if anyone else had been in the room. The blender only contained yogurt, milk, a banana and five strawberries and was on a medium setting. After only five seconds, the blender exploded. Amazon was very helpful in promptly refunding. We will not buy any more Oster products and advise against buying any yourself.",

What I shame, as I said I loved it but not if it is going to break within 6 month of being purchased ;(  Since my last post I reached out to Amazon and they in turn reached out to the vendor ( my return window thu Amazaon had expired) they replace my blender within 2 days!! I am so happy! I really hope this one lasts more than 6 months. :) keeping my fingers crossed!!",

After careful inspection I can find nothing wrong with it other than it leaks. I didn't want one of the cheap $30 blenders because this always happens. I guess 70 bucks still isn't enough to buy a product that lasts more than 6 months. GREAT, I hate smoothies anyway and I didn't lose any weight. I'm going to angrily eat a whole meat lovers pizza washed down with a 12-pack of my favorite IPA. If I die of a heart attack it's this lousy, inferior blender's fault!!!",

First big test was large chunks of cooked chicken breast and this perfectly chopped them and the added ingredients for a well blended chicken salad. Next test was the salsa function which worked well to chop and blend the ingredients without grinding them to a paste. The parts (excluding base) all separate easily for safe cleaning in the dishwasher.",

It blends perfectly, is quieter than my previous blenders, and the additional food processor and smoothie cup make an awesome product even better. We use it all the time for a variety of foods and it doesn't disappoint. It is easy to clean and easy to use. I love it that the lid never warps and fits securely on the blender. Every blender I've ever had or seen previously has a flimsy lid that warps with washing and is difficult to get properly seated on the top of the blender. Not this one. I can't think of anything I would improve. I'm very satisfied.",

I\u2019m so angry because I thought I was investing in a well-known brand at a price that I could trust. Don\u2019t buy this there is no reason why that food processor unraveled and fell apart. The mechanisms just tore open! I didn\u2019t even actually get to process the food. Thus happened just 2 days after the \"return window\" expired. The blender still works, and works well, but I am so disappointed that I paid extra for the food processor aspect, and it doesn't work. I will stay away from Oster products in the future.",

      "text": "I needed to replace my blender and wanted one that could make a decent smoothie. THis one came with additional food processor. I'm happy with the performance of both. I'll give the blender function a 90% rating, because the blender base is a little narrow for thick smoothies. The food processor is 80%. It works good enough for most slicing, grating and grinding, though no flexibility on fineness. BUT, considering the price, it's very good value and meets most of my needs.",
