My previous ex moisturizer felt it disappears after 1 or 2 hours leaving my face either dry and needing more or my face would be oily from the day. This stays on, leaves my face soft, and more importantly light. Does not get oily nor do I have to reapply. Worth every penny. I've never been so utterly impressed with men's nor women's moisturizers than this one. I would give more stars if I could. This product truly shines with it's cost and worth ratio. Might even say it's a steal.",

This same effect can be accomplished by simply using a small amount of any lotion. For this reason I do not feel it is worth the money since I cannot liberally apply it without it becoming quite glossy.",
