Pros: - Arrived in perfect condition, no stuck or dead pixels - Looks amazing and has a very low response time - rich colors, looks fine from weird angles - inexpensive considering what it is Cons: - Not a standard mount, you have to buy an adapter to use with another mount - speaker quality is terrible, worse than my phone. Recommend headset or independent speakers.",

Sent it back and hoping the next one looks good (4th time's a charm?) Aside from the pixel the picture on this was pretty great. update: replacement unit was initially displaying nothing but colored vertical stripes. Swapped some cables and it displayed correctly so I'm not sure if it was just a matter of swapping the DP cable or if it figured itself out after warming up,but it STILL had a stuck pixel. Maybe 3rd time is a charm.",

So far, not a single glitch. G-sync compatibility seems to work perfectly well with this driver, no flickering or tearing at all. Guess buying a monitor that is listed as officially supported by NVidia pays off. Notes: in case anyone is wondering, in order to make g-sync work on this monitor, Displayport 1.2 must be used (no HDMI support as of this review).",

The only downside is that it doesn't work eloquently with sub-1080p resolutions, but neither do 99% of the flatscreens out there, and you really shouldn't be using those modes if you're getting a monitor like this anyway. The colors are fairly accurate and overall response times and image are very strong. One of the best gaming monitors currently on the market, especially for the price. The speakers are actually handy in a pinch, I've never minded the inclusion of weak speakers as they can be useful once in a while.",

The screen can be a bit wobbly on the stand as the neck only goes in about an inch into the bottom of the screen.

But it's been fixed every time by just turning the monitor on and off. Also, no VESA mount which makes me sad.",

The red frame isn't nearly as obnoxious in real life - it's a matted off-red that looks much better than the bright red in the pictures on Amazon. Going from 1080p at 60hz to this is night and day, and the screen is huge. Couldn't recommend this more.",

I don't like the stand itself though, it feels flimsy when connecting the monitor to the base. I don't mind the color of the bottom bar but it would've been better in pure black.",
