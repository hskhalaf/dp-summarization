They go through wood with no issues other than wood chips clogging on long drills. If you hit a nail, these are done. They are fragile and any nail hit ruins them. That being said, I usually get a good 5-10 resharpens with a small rat tail file before I retire them. Just file them equally in number of strokes so that the blades stay about the same length.",

I was skeptical of the auger set, but once I used it, it was amazing. Using an 18v impact driver, no strain and no pressure since the bit is self-feed. It took me 20 secs to go through a 2x4, and about 1 min to go through the PSL w/ 1-1/4 bit. Can't believe I worked without this before. My go to solution for boring holes now.",

I needed to drill a lot of holes in a beech wood (i.e. - very hard wood) timber frame barn and I was shocked at how quickly these pulled into the wood without having to apply much pressure. Backing the bits out takes more effort than usual and required that the impact driver be reversed, but well worth it to not have to apply a mountain of pressure. 60 plus big holes drilled with no bit burning or marked reduction in cutting efficiency.",

With these bits, it took less than ten seconds to get through the same joist, and the bit did all of the work. That's with a cordless drill, too! The case is a tad large and has a stiff latch, but the important part - the bits - are great!",
