I love the little heel, and find them comfortable to wear even on a 12-hour work day on my feet. Even in rain and mud my feet stay dry. Highly recommend!",

They are so comfortable and I\u2019ve received so many compliments. They aren\u2019t as rugged as the originals but that\u2019s what I like about them. They are a little bit more feminine but still utilitarian. Get them now!",
