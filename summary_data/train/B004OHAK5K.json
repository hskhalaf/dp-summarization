This is the weak point, and of course, the company will sell you a replacement, but only from their website, and it will cost you $20, YES $20 to get one little trap door shipped to you. It's cheaper to just buy another whole unit. My wife uses it so much that I will buy another one, but if it breaks again forget it. I would have given this thing 4 or 5 stars if the company sold replacement parts at a reasonable price (again outrageous shipping charge!).",

Last year we bought two for our terrible stink bug problem. It worked like a charm. The first one lasted several months before the hinges broke so we put a paper towel with a rubber band over the end and kept using it. Just this week we opened the new one and it lasted exactly one day. This little bug eater is perfect except that it's defective.

If you suck up small spiders or other smaller bugs they can easily crawl right back out. It ships with 2 different suction chambers. The other one was probably worse in that there is also a gap in the middle flaps. (I didn't get a pic of that one.)",

Depending on the bug's size...it's a 50/50 chance that this thing will work as advertised. And it doesn't help that you practically have to put the capture nozzle literally right to the insect to capture it (literally impossible for bugs that fly)",

With the bugzooka, we suck up the bugs, keep them in the chamber and flush down the toilet when we run out of space. Within a couple of days the stinkbug problem improved by 75%!",
