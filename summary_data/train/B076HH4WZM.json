The unit is powerful and useful, let\u2019s me do other things with my brain than stir. My one recommendation would be to sell attachments, such as some expansions for the stirrer so that it can do wider and taller pots. Other than that I\u2019m very impressed with this, very much worth my money, thank you",

Returned the product because it did not do what it said it would do. gave five stars because it is easy to set up one star because it failed.",

I had purchased the OmniXL Stainless Steel stirrer to replace the plastic that they had honestly admitted was not BPA-free. The stainless steel stirrer had a small piece that didn't fit properly. Dimitri immediately called me in response to my email and replaced the piece that day. The unit itself is easy to use, the charge holds a long time and it's fun! I highly recommend.",

Works well, with the stainless steel arm a skin does still form on the top of the milk at higher temps (above aprox 120deg F ). This is due to the stirring arms being so thin they do not break up the formations. Still much less skin than not stirring, and only at higher temps. Saves me hours standing over a pot of heating (and then cooling) milk - I'm very happy. Clamp is secure on side of pot. Operation is very simple. Charging is very simple and I love that it is rechargeable.",

When you have to get up every 15 minutes to stir the pot and keep the tomatoes from sticking to the bottom, you really can't do anything else with your life. We've had the stirrer running for two weeks now, and we love what it does. The sauce actually tastes better than when we stir the pot ourselves. Easier to clean the pot afterwards, too, since continuously stirring means nothing ever sticks. Also, from the husband-engineer point of view: this design is really clever. Kudos to whoever did it.",

Both dishes turned out far better than when I stir them myself. It is well worth the price and I can\u2019t imagine you\u2019d be disappointed. Update 10/4/19: I use this stirrer at least once per week, sometimes more. I LOVE it! I wish I\u2019d know about this years ago.",

I love cooking but always hated being tied to a pot slowly stirring away. With this running I can do other things making cooking time much more efficient. It also does a much better job of stirring than me. You will not be disappointed buying one.",
