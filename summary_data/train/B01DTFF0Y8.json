I reccomend this product if you love to host parties and/or if you just simply enjoy placing some cheese and crackers out to munch on.",

If it wasn't for the crack in the board, and it stayed in good condition, I'd have given this 5 stars. She loved the gift and was excited to use it when given the opportunity. Now it just looks cheap and not something we want to present to guests when they're over.",
