I've reviewed photos of the unit online, and having done so, it appears possible (likely?) that the gun is missing a piece that is used to lock the hose into the gun, but none was included. As a result, if I don't purchase a new gun and hose (because I can't locate the part and am not even certain that will fix the gun) the machine is completely unusable and is just taking up space in my garage.",
