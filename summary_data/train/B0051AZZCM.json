While none of my passengers have ever needed them, my husband did on a long drive home after a wedding where he got food poisoning. The bags work perfectly. They didn't leak, the drawstrings kept the bags closed after they were used (we didn't really test this to see if we could hold it upside down or anything because that was just asking for trouble), and, best of all, I couldn't smell it. I couldn't believe this little bag was able to do that. I would definitely recommend these to anyone to keep on hand just in case of an emergency!",
