We put it on one of those coiled elastic wrist lanyards and always have it on a walk...because you never know when you might need it. We have 4 of them...one at each door and one by each retractible leash. Accessible convenience a must.",

I took about 3 minutes training my dog (a very intelligent Border Collie/Weimaraner mix) with the whistle, by blowing the whistle and immediately giving her a treat. Then I used it to call her in from the backyard--I would blow the whistle, and she would come running. I had to use it for an emergency a few days ago, when she pulled her head out of her collar when I was trying to get her to get into the back of my car, and she took off running. Thankfully, I had the whistle; I blew it, and she came running back immediately. Worth every cent in my opinion.",
