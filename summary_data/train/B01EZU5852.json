He was very happy, and so am I that this magnifier lived up to it's billing...Thank You!",

This great tool will make her trips to change her glasses less frequent. The light is a bonus and she was delighted when she first picked it up and turned it on. One thing I would suggest is that you include the batteries. Your ability to buy them in volume would add very little to your cost and I am certain that a slight raise in price would not be a deal breaker.",

The second issue is that the lights do not give afull coverage of the viewed image.",
