And another thing about this candle is once you light it, the wick gets exposed and rather long wick which makes the flame a little bigger than I think it needs to be. This is probably what is contributing to it's quick burn effect. *** One more thing I noticed. The price seems to have gone up a dollar since I bought it a month ago. How is that possible?? Kind of annoying....",
