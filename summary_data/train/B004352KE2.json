      "text": "The only issue that I have is that once a *dry* stick has bypassed the guide, it just kind of skips around and clanks until something else pushes it through the blade. Dry sticks are difficult to chip, anything near the advertised capacity will just vibrate and more or less turn to saw dust at a snail pace. There are no issues with wet sticks, this thing grabs them and sucks them down hungrily. Tiny stuff like twigs from a globe willow often strip and shred lengthwise, but they are quite reduced in the process.",
