I didn\u2019t unpack the bistro set for three months and when I did I noticed a couple places with no paint and the color wasn\u2019t a true red. My husband had burned the packing materials and I figured it was too late to make a complaint. My original review told customers to examin the product when it is received. I still think that is good advise \u2014 for any product. The company contacted me, listened to my concerns and shipped me a new one. It\u2019s perfect.",

Even better is that they were packed beautifully and completely assembled....just lifted them out of the box for instant seating! I plan to spray the underside, folding areas, and screw assemblies with WD40 to help prevent rusting, but the powder coating looks very well done. It will be used on an uncovered patio.",

I was hoping it would be heavy enough to not be knocked over, but they are very heavy and sturdy. I don\u2019t think the wind will be an issue. The blue is a beautiful color! And they are super easy to set up. All you have to do is take them out of the plastic and unfold them. Very great quality!!",
