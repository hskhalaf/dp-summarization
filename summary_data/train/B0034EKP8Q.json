I can't believe it! And they're just as fun, addicting, and relaxing as they were when I was a kid. Twist it, bend it, make it in to a snake. The possibilities are endless, and so much fun.",

Three bright and fun color combinations to choose from. The pieces can be taken apart but this isn't so easy for a toddler to do, which is good (wouldn't want the parts to get lost, or worse, eaten). These are very easy for children to hold, yet small enough to throw in a purse for fidget/boredom emergencies. I need to get some for myself!",

They have helped to keep her hands busy when she is bored which helped divert her attention from picking her eyelashes. They are another tool in our tool box to help ease the stress that she can sometimes feel. I like how you can snap apart the pieces and make the Tangle smaller for little hands to grab easier. I would recommend this for anyone who suffers from anxiety and feels the need to constantly be doing something with their hands.",

This makes me really happy because sometimes she has trouble with her fingers. They're just plain fun to fidget around with and I love mine too. Makes a very good distraction toy from pain (I just had leg surgery.) Thank you for making them!",

      "text": "I teach preschool and have a lot of fidgety children. This is the age where you encourage them to keep their hands in their laps so their fingers aren't up their noses or in other unhealthy places. This toy is perfect for these kids to hold in their laps at group time to turn and twist. It's silent, small, and fulfills their need to wiggle! I keep one at home as I'm always fidgeting and it is an awesome thing to have laying around. They are also durable- the parts can pop apart and easily pop back together again. I just ordered a second set. Great value and great toy!",

Not mildly irritated, but somewhere between enraged and mega-panicky, depending on my mood at the moment. So I bought these little toys for my co-workers, who are supportive yet fidgety. I decided to go with these because I saw a review that specifically said that they are totally silent. They are not silent. They make clicking noises as the pieces touch each other. Plus, my co-workers say that they are not satisfying to fiddle with.",

While people say it's more of a bad thing that these things can get pulled apart, at least it can be a distracting challenge to piece them back together, then you forget you were ever mad or sad in the first place, at least for minor things from my experience.",

Got these and within minutes one is popping apart and now a second one is popping apart. For now they snap right back together, but we did not experience this with the others we had messed around with in the past and I expect the knobs will only handle the constant pressure for so long before breaking off.",
