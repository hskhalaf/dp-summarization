Keyboard is a little noisy but it seems to have some quirky functions that my old laptop doesn't have - hoping that with use the keys will settle in and get quieter. The easiest and by far the cheapest lap top that I have ever had.",

Boots really fast and no virus' to worry about, plus it won't slow down over time like a Windoze. Chromebook - HP built this one a bit plastic, but I'm used to Macbook Pros. Screen is good quality for the price.",

The screen is clear and the colours are fab. 5 stars - I am considering buying another one, as it lets me ready my Kindle books, and listen to my Amazon tunes as well. Fab.",

Screen was excellent, good size compared to the others at similar price. Was not that keen on the touchpad, preferred others I tried in shops.
