I've tried to convert them to a lot of other dried/moist foods that are supposedly more nutritionally sound than Purina Complete, including other Nutro offerings, with NO success, until now. This is the first dried food they actually seem to like -- and have continued to like a month in -- at least as much as their Purina Complete. Food arrived punctually. Food was ordered in 12/2018, and the expiration date of food received was 8/2019, which was around the same date as the food on the store shelves.",

She LOVED the food, BUT it was way to smelly to have in the house, and her litter box reeked, eventually smelling up the whole room despite our daily cleaning. The other problem was that the kibbles were too big, so she would crunch them into pieces, sending the pieces flying from her food maze, and then would never touch the broken pieces again, so there was a lot of mess and waste. Her coat got rough too. I am skeptical of \"grain-free\" food that contains other vegetable ingredients that a cat would never eat in the wild.",

The closing EVO web page recommended Wild Frontier by Nutro. My cat prefers this to both the remaining EVO and the Science Diet. Wild Frontier has 40% protein, and first ingredient is Salmon.
