The weight of the balls weighs down the fabric and you can't easily get the balls out of the row underneath because the balls in the row above are touching the tops of the balls underneath. Spend a little more and get the metal ball rack.",

I\u2019m going to keep it and try and see up the two ripped corners myself but I will not be buying other items from this line.",
