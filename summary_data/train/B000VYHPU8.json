I'm impressed by the quality of this case. Its a very smooth finish with a slight sheen that doesn't look cheap at all. Inside is a nice smooth black velour type material. The case was shipped/packed very very well! Acrylic was covered on both sides, secured by dense foam on the corners, in a box, with celophane, bubble wrap, and thick plastic. I would highly recommend this case and would buy another.",

The bracket that cradles the rod that the jersey hangs on is mounted off center, as well as being unlevel. The jersey obviously hangs off center but by adjusting it slightly that can be compensated for but it very obviously hangs crooked. I'm going to try to put something inside the bracket that will compensate because shipping it back would be a huge hassle. this wasn't inexpensive, disappointed in the quality.",
