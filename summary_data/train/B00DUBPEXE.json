      "text": "I'm giving the Nexus 7 four stars because for the most part it did meet my expectations. However, I feel that the speakers and the camera were misrepresented. The sound quality is good but the volume could be better. The camera takes decent pics but you have to be close to the subject. Had those two things not been specifically mentioned as above average, I would have no complaints. Screen display is excellent. That said, I'm pleased with the product. I'm partial to android so I like being able to have the same apps on my tablet that I love on my S5.",

You can update it to Marshmallow out of the box, it's 1080p (Slightly higher), outperforms most tablets today (even though it's from 2013!) and... Just buy it. It's the living embodiment of bang for your buck. This review comes straight from an android veteran and this Nexus 7.",

I just wish ASUS would make an upgraded model, it is an old model and I'd like some day to get one with more RAM, more processing power, but the same perfect 7\" size.",
