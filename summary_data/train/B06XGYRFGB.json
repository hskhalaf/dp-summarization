Fortunately, you can find replacement pad for a reasonable price and do come on sale or add on for as low as $6. This way you can keep the cot frame and re use it again, have done this 3 time on one and 2 times on another. My dog 85-95#, is very happy with this outside or inside bed, especially in the heat because of ventilated material in the middle. He sometime uses it as a trampoline as he runs through the yard, he leaps on in and springs of.",

I wanted something that would get him off the ground for good air circulation on hot days this looked like just the ticket, plus the bolsters looked good to rest his head on. Boy, what a great buy! He didn\u2019t quite know what to think about it at first, I think because of the canopy, but he got over it really quickly and loves snoozing in his little bed. I think it\u2019s pretty ergonomic for the little guy and he\u2019s always assured a cool shaded little spot just for him... if the cat isn\u2019t in it, that is!",

The larger dog is 45-lbs, a basset/pit bull/Boston terrier, German Shorthaired Pointer mix and she fits comfortably on it. I do add a small blanket for extra comfort but it's not necessary. The suspension design is great.",

This is a small trampoline and Bryon is the size of a standard dachshund for reference. It\u2019s much easier to wash a blanket instead of a bed but the bolster makes it similar to a bed and they love to rest their heads on it.

      "text": "I kept hearing how these type of dog beds were favored by most dogs. So I got one for my American Bully puppy. It was super easy to put together. It was also very light but was still durable. The bolster was also easy to get on and off. I did like how the fabric was easy to clean, I just wish it came in other colors. My puppy used it maybe once and never looked at it again. It might be because she is spoiled and use to things that are soft and plush. All in all an ok dog bed just not for my dog.",
