However, in my breakfast nook, it's a perfect decorative asset that the teens love to sit in-fight to sit in first. However the oldest normally carries the day. I have two teens, two attitudes and two people like sitting in a chair but not cleaning up their dishes or doing chores. Life... PS: 3 minutes to set up. Unlike Ikea products where I have lost years off my life figuring out their stuff. This is a winner",

The only problem with it was the little plastic handle on the lift bar broke off-- but the plastic part is really unnecessary for its operation anyway. We suspect it got cracked during delivery.",
