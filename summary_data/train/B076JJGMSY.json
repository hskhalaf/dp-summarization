      "text": "I have always been skeptical of the comfort of inflatable pillows, and for backpacking trips, have relied on heavier travel pillows or just rolling up clothing to serve as a pillow. This pillow, however, has changed my mind. The shape of the inflated pillow makes for a comfortable sleep, and it's fairly easy to inflate/deflate. I'd say the one complaint is folding it back into its compartment effectively (much like backpacking sleeping bags, which seem impossible to fold). However, I think I will buy this product again for a few friends. I actually slept well with this pillow, which I was not expecting!",

A few inches larger on either side would have increased my comfort a lot. The pillow material is also a bit slick and tends to slide around on a sleeping bag, making it hard to position the pillow for a good night sleep, and possibly disturbing your sleeping companions. I still would recommend this pillow overall but it's just not *quite* perfect.",

The Rikki Tikki camping pillow supports all sleeping types by not having an \"indentation\" in the middle of the pillow for head support (which only supports back sleepers appropriately). The cloth outside makes it comfortable and it is very easy to inflate and deflate. The last bonus is that it comes with its own compression sack which is attached to the pillow itself and compresses the pillow down to the sizes of your hand. Excellent design, affordability, and comfort.",

Then, the cover on it has tension in such a way as it cradles your head, and puts some space between your head and the actual pillow! It's great, I'm buying a second one for my partner. I haven't yet used it on a trip, but the unboxing was so satisfying that I had to review it right away.",

      "text": "UPDATE: Manufacturer sent me a replacement (thanks). I have learned to be exceedingly careful when opening the valve on this pillow. It nearly wants to break! Other than the valve, this pillow is awesome. Its really comfortable, packs small, and fits right into the top of my sleeping bag. It really makes for a better backpacking night sleep. Just mind the valve! Comfortable and good size pillow but the valve was faulty and the plastic seal ripped after just 2 uses. Really disappointed.",
