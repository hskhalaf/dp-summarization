So now I have a drive with files that are unusable. Looks good, but I would not recommend purchasing. Back to Sandisk I go!",

The cord connection is faulty, causing it to come off with little movement of the drive or computer. New cords haven't fixed the issue as it is the build of the actual port. Once it disconnects due to the faulty cord port, it takes over 10 minutes to reconnect, sometimes up to 30 minutes, leaving you waiting to get back to the task you were trying to accomplish when it disconnected. In addition to the faulty cord port, it is a very slow drive. Will not support the company in the future.",
