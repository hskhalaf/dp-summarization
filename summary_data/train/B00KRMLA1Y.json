You have to be holding the bills just the right way and lower them just the right way or the machine will jam. Once you get the hang of it, it works fine. But if you're looking for a counter where you can just set the bills in and let the machine count them for you, this is NOT the machine for you.",

It should have been preset in such a way to give you 100, 50, 20, 5 and 0. Secondly the \"add\" key function strangely. If you hit add key, it automatically deletes currently count, resetting count to zero. I have no idea how to do addition when the machine set the existing count to zero.",
