We used metal trusses to secure the line. 3 kids went on the line (one at a time) all under 100 lbs. when the 4th kid (approx 130 lbs) attempted the line, the line completely ripped in half! The line is rated for 250 lbs but broke under a 150 lb kid! Very disappointed. Concerned my line was dry rotted or defective.",

Line bows too much in the middle for heavier guys. Next time I put it up I will shorten it so it stays more level and doesn\u2019t bow. Durable? Erected it, then didn\u2019t for 3 weeks. Sat in the under tension. When we used it we noticed the top of the web sheds fibers when the sliding rings are used. It appears to be from UV weakening the web + ring Friction. This would probably be great if erected in shade. But in the sun?... TBD.",

For the 65' version, there should definitely be more obstacles provided. 5. The tree protector rings ought to be longer. 5. The rope ladder could be better made; it's too hinky. But anyway, it's cool and fun! I definitely recommend it.",
