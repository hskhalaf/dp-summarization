When I got the scanner, I worked at home for four days scanning and clearing bar code programs. I contacted woneNICE and received a reply that night. They sent the correct bar codes for me to scan to get the wand to work! I couldn't be happier. I have a wand that works and I paid a fraction of what I would have paid for one that was programmed for Destiny! I highly recommend this lightweight, wireless, bar code scanner.",

You'd have to be using it all day long constantly I think, before you might have to charge it once during the day or maybe not. I basically go and go and use it each day and don't think about it. I've misplaced mine during summer break and if I can't find it, I'm going to order another one. An excellent value for the features and how well it works!",
