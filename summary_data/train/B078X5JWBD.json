      "text": "The only difference between the 615 and 615A per a call with the Chef's Choice, today, is that the 615A is made by a different supplier. To distinguish between the two, the serial number label has a date code on it. This code next to the serial number starts with a Letter. The first one I ordered was A18, which indicates January 2018 and would not be the 615A model. The 615A model should have a date code of D18 or greater. D meaning April and 18 meaning 2018. I sent the first one back and awaiting the second one. Chef's Choice Customer Service and Amazon representatives were fantastic in sorting this out.",

The sliding carriage which holds the meat has an approximate dimension of about 6\" x 6\".x 6\" Therefore, cut large pieces of meat to fit safely on the carriage.

I've done continuous slicing for about 15-20 minutes without problems. The motor has ventilation fan so that probably helps. (there is a fuse that will protect the motor if it does overheat -- and they give you an extra fuse) The design is lightweight and compact but it's metal in the right places. The guide plate is rigid so it can do consistent paper-thin slices (you need to buy the thin blade for this). And maybe most importantly, it's been designed for relatively fast cleaning. Removing the blade requires a coin.",

The reason for the 1 star rating is that the unit's fuse blew out on the fifth use, and the replacement fuse that came with the unit was bad and did not work. Up until then, the machine worked as advertised. Great for slicing meats and cheese. I like how thin I can slice my roasts, turkey, chicken breasts and various cheeses. The problem is that when ordering replacement fuses, the Chef's Choice site failed to send them. It has been three weeks and nothing. I had to find them from another source and it was just frustrating. Machine great; Customer service terrible.",

However, when opened, the meat slicer was in perfect condition with all packing components in place and the slicer, with its extra parts, all appear to be new. It works as advertised, so I'm a satisfied customer. If something unexpected occurs, I will deal with the supplier then and report the experience, if necessary, at that time.",

I sent mine back for a stainless steel replacement only to get one painted seafoam green. both units were shipped this way. machine slices well but is a little difficult to clean compared to others. If you want a better description see Williams Sonoma website",
