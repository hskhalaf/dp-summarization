That's happened several times already. No matter how careful I am, if I make the slightest turn or am not super careful going up and down stairs with it, it's going to tip over.

There were parts included that had no relation to the bag. We did not open the box until we got to Mexico, so we were not aware of the problem until we tried to use it. Now we awkwardly bungi cord the contraption, which doesn't really work. We are sorry we purchased this cart!",
