If you have experiences in the martial arts and have a decent punch or kick this will NOT work for you. You will find your body absorbing most of the punch or kick! The next day you will be sore from all the tension you used up prepping for the blow. When using a heavy glove or pad you will notice that the glove or pad absorb the blow. I hope this helps!",

I paid the $25.99 and when they arrived, the stitching was perfect, material seemed strong and when I compared them to the Everlast Mantis pads at a local store for about $37, I would say these are equal or better. They were also very light and cushioned. I will definitely keep Sanabul in mind when shopping for boxing equipment in future and will pass along to friends. Thanks!",

Happily, they were actually really comfortable, and my hands and wrists were perfectly fine afterwards. The cushioning on these works great. I actually said \"That's it?!\" out loud when he punched them the first time. I was seriously not expecting this to be as easy to use as they were.

There is a slight ball like grip that helps the mitt holder to keep the mitts on for enthusiastic punchers.

We got the black/green, very cool looking. Seems very well put together. Order delivered ahead of schedule with prime. Very pleased.",

I train my roommate at home and these are great for teaching anyone basic to advanced combos. they are super light but at the same time absorb impact really well. my roommate is 250lbs and im 150lbs and I take his hard jabs and crosses with ease. these are easy to get on and off and won't feel like they're gunna slip off mid session. these mitts don't smell either, I have hour long sessions and after a year of using them they still don't smell bad. highly recommend them and all of sanubuls products.",
