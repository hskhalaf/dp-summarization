So if you\u2019re wondering if you\u2019re doing something wrong, you\u2019re not. Don\u2019t question it. Just get another screw. You\u2019ll also need a ratchet set to tighten like 8 bolts.

I had first tried the Zwift running pod, but found the speeds it recorded were not accurate. I highly recommend this treadmill for indoor running, especially for pairing with the Zwift platform.",

      "text": "For this price, I'm not sure you could get something much better. Has a good range of speed up to 10mph which is plenty for my purposes. Also, you DO NOT need to subscribe to iFit to use this. Once plugged in and turned on, simply press and hold the iFit button until the screen comes on and it's ready for use. Maybe ~20-30 seconds. Feels very sturdy and the cup holders are large enough to put a 32oz water bottle. Overall a great purchase, especially with payment installment options.",

The treadmill was delivered on January 15, 2020 and was finally repaired on April 24, 2020. The extended warranty cost $96.57 and that should have covered necessary replacement of the \"pulse bar\".",

I upgraded from a 6 year old Horizon T101 that I had some major problems with over the years that included an expensive control board replacement and ultimately the motor quit. Huge pluses for the Nordic Track are the quality of construction, the options for various programs and the 25 year motor warranty. Another design feature I noticed is the tread is trimmed less wide so it won't fray along the edges. This was a problem with my old treadmill that caused dust and lint balls. So, very happy about the Nordic Track quality and design. And, assembly was easy. Highly recommend.",

To get the treadmill to move it leaves marks from the front end all over my flooring. I've tried those mover cups underneath the front but to no avail.

Also, the instructions claim that the treadmill is \"locked\" and must be \"registered\" and when you go to register it, they'll insist that you sign up for a monthly subscription program with various workouts, etc, for an additional monthly cost. I didn't want this, so I contacted them and learned that if you turn on the treadmill and hold down on the ifit button for 20 seconds, it'll unlock your treadmill and you can use freely. Enjoy!",
