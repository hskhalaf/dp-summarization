Even the package is different. They are styled similar but with subtle differences. Which makes me think they came from different manufactures. It would be okay but gels in both orders are absolutely different. They even smell differently and have different viscosity. I don't think this product is a knockoff but it's not worth $20+ (may be $5 is the right price). At least I couldn't see any positive result after using it. And I am really afraid of buying it again since I don't know what to expect to arrive next time.",

      "text": "I've only been using this product for a short time, but there are several things about Baebody Eye Gel I really like. First of all, I like that it's more natural than many of the eye and face products on the market. Also, I love that it can be used all over the face, is a gel rather than a cream which often leave my face feeling greasy and is very reasonably priced. I'm 67 yrs. old so I don't expect any miracles, but it seems to have made some improvement in puffiness around my eyes and my skin feels a little firmer.",
