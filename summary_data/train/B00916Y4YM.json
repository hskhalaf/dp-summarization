I HATE THIS MACHINE. i'd return it 100% get anything else... seriously. get a 150$ machine and enjoy your life.",

The bobbins that came as a free gift did not work with my HD3000. I tried three different bobbins from the free set of bobbins that claim to fit all but 1600p machines. The bobbins where a tad smaller and had a slightly different shape. I wasted 3 full bobbins of guterman tera thread, they all would wind way to loose. The ones that came with the machine seem to be working no problem.",

As a middle school/ high school art teacher, we used a very similar model in my art classroom for several years. Our Janomes were strong, simple to operate, versatile, and very intuitive on fabrics of all weights as well as layers of paper and vinyl. The boys especially loved this since a) it was a power tool, and b) it had an \"accelerator\".",

The only feature I didn't like was the reverse button which doesn't engage continuously but has to be held down which means that I can guide the fabric with only one hand. Next time I'm going to insert some rubber tubing in the reverse button so it will be continuously engaged.",
