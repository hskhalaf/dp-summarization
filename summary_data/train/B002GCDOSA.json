The tread only runs down one side of the bottom so it turns my feet, ankles and knees inward causing pain. They caused blisters right above my achilles tendons and actual blisters between my toes. I usually only buy Nike's but this is a horrible example of the Nike brand. The only good thing I can say is that they are certainly a great looking shoe. But what is the point?",

She has plenty of other shoes and sneakers but these seem to be her go-to ones for any occasion. She even found a bookbag somewhere that coordinates nicely with them.

As soon as I started wearing them outside I noticed there was something wrong with one shoe. It's unfortunate because I have such a hard time finding a good shoe. I have ankle issues and plantar fasciitis and flat feet. Now I am out of the return window. I didn't think I could return them once I went outside anyway.",
