How many electronic devices from the end of the Jimmy Carter era have a life span of 40 year (with internal refreshes of course). 12Cs never seem to break, virtually never run out of batteries, I've bought these over the years not to replace broken units, but because I lose them or pack them away when I change jobs. I currently have 2, somehow I left both in the office when March 2020 lockdown happened, hence this order!",

In simple english if you are used to using a desktop type adding machine it may take some getting used to pressing the add/subtract button after the entered number. I say this because I was fortunate enough to learn on the HP12C and it took some brain power to untrain myself when a job required the use of a desktop adding machine.",

      "text": "This product is great in the sense that it is accepted by the CFP board and American College. However the 12C is nowhere near as good as my HP 50G. My 50G is more accurate, doesn't round \"N\" in TVM calculations, etc. So if you don't have to have this calculator due to regulations, buy the HP50G for $15 more. This calculator has a long battery life and comes in a nice leather case with a spot for a business card. It does have equations printed on the back that have to be \"covered up\" for the designation tests above. I wish they wouldn't print them on the back. It's annoying to have to tape the back and looks ghetto.",

I find the keys and the display are easier to read, as well. Depending on your financial situation, you may not want to buy it if you have a functional 12C, but if you are choosing between the two, definitely spend the few extra dollars and get the Platinum.",
