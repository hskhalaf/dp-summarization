Every time you should disable it if you are using your camera. - also to disable to auto-focus completely, install windows7 drivers from Microsoft website for your windows8.1 operating system.  everything works for me now",

I don't know how they say it's HD, but I can definitely see my picture pixelated. I'm not much of a heavy webcam user. I just use it couple of times a month to chat with family.
