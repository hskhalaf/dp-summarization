THE tool to have if you are removing the Jesus nut on axles/hubs/wheel bearings/etc. 15 year old nuts torqued to 250lbft at the factory are loosened with hardly any effort. No heat. No PB Blaster. Just some good ole' T=r x F. I wish there were more excuses to use it. Perhaps if you are a heavy equipment mechanic but not for a lowly DIYer. Other possible uses include: - Reloading civil war reenactment cannons - Billiards cue",

It only broke because I used a metal tube over the breaker lol). I send an email explaining what happened. A week later my replacement arrived. I definitely recommend this product. If you don't like this product, then I recommend Tekton's costumer support. If you don't like the costumer support, please visit your local psychiatrist",

Before buying this breaker bar, I was concerned that I would need to use an impact wrench and air compressor to remove the nuts. However, with this long breaker bar, the nuts came off easily! I know that the nuts were factory tight because cotter pins are used to keep the nuts from backing out. Actually, removing the cotter pins between the nuts and the long bolts were the toughest part of this task. So removing factory tight bolts without and impact wrench? This bar is great!",

The old one (#1695) has a shiny head made from Chrome Vanadium, where this one has a black head made from Chrome Moly. Generally speaking Cr-Mo is better than Cr-V. It is stronger and less brittle, and usually seen on more expensive tools. So it is a slight upgrade from the older model. Anyway the tolerances seem a bit loose on this breaker bar, but it has worked well for me so far. I have always found Tekton tools to be a pretty good value for your money. The good thing about buying cheap tools: use them twice and you already feel like you have got your money's worth.",

I generally loosen them with the breaker bar for ease, use my cheap Dewalt drill to unscrew (and screw) then use TEKTON 24335 torque wrench to finish the job. It's a solid piece of metal. No flex and gets the job done. I guess if anything I'll probably wrap the handle with some tennis racket grip (which I've done with my pedal bike) for some grip.",

Even with this thing I had to pull hard (trying it with no cheater) but the bolt came off. This thing is weighty and massive. As a 6'3'' man I could use it as a golf club. I am impressed by the quality. I am sure it will come in handy for other projects with a reducer socket. Highly recommended.",

It looks a lot bigger in person than it does online, and provides plenty of leverage.",
