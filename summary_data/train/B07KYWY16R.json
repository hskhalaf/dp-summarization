I use these brushes every morning upon waking and several times a day before each rebounding session. They work great. Having three sizes comes in handy. Over time you will develop which brush you prefer to use for what specific part of your body. BTW: The long handled brush will stay together just fine if you strongly push the handle into the groove on the brush. Anyone who says otherwise needs to do more exercise.",
