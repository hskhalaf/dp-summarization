It\u2019s supposed to be a cuddly soft shark for a toddler, but it feels almost too tough to almost hug. The best part was supposed to be the song, WHICH IT DOESNT EVEN SING COMPLETELY. It stops singing right after daddy shark which is a huge disappointment since my child keeps singing to granny shark but stops when he realizes the shark isn\u2019t singing anymore. To add to it, the button is difficult for a toddler to possibly find or even press.",

I liked that a second push of the button stops the song, you don't have to listen to the whole song every time. Velcro on back makes it easy to access speaker to change batteries (or just remove them, depends on the parent!). Can't wait to gift this to my 2 yr old niece!",
