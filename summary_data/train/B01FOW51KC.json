These were easy, their system has kept them in place all year and you get a selection of sounds so it is easy to tell which door someone is at. It's also very helpful to be able to easily install the button anywhere on the porch as the wireless communication leaves plenty of room to work with. Now I can put the button where they can reach it without opening the gate at the rear entry. Delivery people avoid becoming food for the dogs.",

      "text": "We needed a wireless doorbell chime with two receivers since we have a two story house. I am glad that this product is expandable, if we decide to put a receiver out in the backyard, we will be able to purchase an additional one. This product was so easy to install and we had a wireless doorbell within 3 minutes!!!! If you had a locked gate and needed a wireless doorbell, this would be perfect! I would highly recommend this product.",

The transmitter is mounted outside on vinyl siding near a metal storm door. Of the two receivers one is mounted about 15ft away and the other is about 60 feet. The house is 100 years old and has a lot of wood sheathing on it under the vinyl siding we put on it. I have no qualms recommending this product at this time.",

It arrived quickly and I went to my \"Youtube library\" and found a short video to learn how to set it up, which was quite simple! Happy I purchased it.",
