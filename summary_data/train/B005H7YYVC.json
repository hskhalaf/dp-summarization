I believe the main pieces are rubberwood, or a similar species of real wood. Much heavier, sturdier feel than particle board. Assembly wasn't too difficult, but these pieces are heavy; I'd consider it a 2 person job. The color is my only--big--disappointment. This \"White\" is not white. It's not even \"off white.\" It's a dingy cream that looks closer to a matte beige than to white. If you're looking to harmonize with white woodwork or a white kitchen, look elsewhere. Otherwise, nice product.",

I shouldn't have spent the amount of money on it that I did because it was all cheap particle board. Also the way the pieces connect are by a tiny camscrew screwed into particleboard. Doesnt seem like it will last more than a few months. Walmart quality with Hobby Lobby prices.",

Each piece was carefully packaged, no parts damaged or lost.
