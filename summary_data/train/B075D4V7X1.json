      "text": "We purchased this for our 12 year old daughter who is currently on a competitive gymnastics team. She wanted an option for practice/working out at home as well as to have a fun gym mat to use on the lake. She has been very happy with the mat; however, I would recommend the 20' vs. 16' for children 12+ who are a little taller (5'1\"). The mat comes with a cary bag (think hiking backpack for size) as well as an electric pump for quick and easy of inflation and deflation. Works like a charm! We've used the pump for other inflatable items we own as well!! Overall, very happy with the purchase.",

The handles started leaking air and the side seams, large amounts of air quickly. Very poor , I would not recommend .",
