I live in Michigan where u-pick sweet cherries are plentiful, however most orchards will only pit pie cherries because sweet cherries are too big for their equipment.

This thing just powered through 2 pounds of cherries in 5 minutes. The occasional cherry will get stuck in the hopper, but it\u2019s easy to pop out. Easy to clean. Worth every penny.",

For smaller canning cherries it would miss maybe 1 in 50, but you can feel a difference when it misses a pit. The catch basin is huge, so you can keep going without stopping. For the price point it is an absolutely fantastic option",
