Everything turned out ok in the end but you may want to be aware of these problems.",

Becoming an installation pro, so now don't seem to find these an issue to put together as I did in the beginning. Noticed they even put in some humorous comments in the instructions - I think just to see if we are looking! Good for Sauder's though... brought a smile to an otherwise boring task. Once assembled I was happy with the look and seemed solid enough for the kids.",

I like the drawer spot for the keyboard and mouse so that it can be slid in and hidden when closed. My only concern with that part would be someone putting too much weight on it by leaning on and breaking it. The color was also perfect for me and it has nice drawer hardware. I have had many compliments on it and am very satisfied with it - time will tell!",

The assembly was intuitive as well, you start with the top and work your way down to a very sturdy desk. The fasteners were also very nice, these desks won't be coming apart any time soon!",
