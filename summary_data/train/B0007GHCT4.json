I've now been to 3 jewelry stores & they won't do it, said they used to but the bands have changed making it difficult so they stopped doing it. I now have a very pretty Timex that I can't wear.",

This might (again) be because I'm near sighted, but that's a deal-breaker for me. The band is perfect for my medium-to-small wrist; the first watch in years that I wouldn't have to get the jeweler to remove links. However, if you have a large or athletic wrist, this will possibly be too tight.",

This watch is simple yet elegant looking - if I forgot to change to one of my dressier watches, I doubt it would matter. It is very comfortable - my wrist is on the smaller size so I'm not sure if someone with a larger wrist would find it as well fitting. I typically have to remove a link or two but not with this one.

The only drawback is that this watch is a little bit bigger in size than I was expecting. I thought the face would be a little bit smaller than what it turned out to be, but I cannot complain. This is a beautiful watch that will fit easily into my daily wardrobe. It can be dressed up or down and it will still look nice! Wonderful purchase!",

I hit a home run! She loves it! It is the perfect style, fit, size and easy to read. What a tremendous relief. I would definitely recommend this watch to any one, especially those with a hard to please mother.",
