      "text": "The phone itself is pretty good, but it sometimes alternates between having 5-bars and no signal until i reboot the phone, or activate and deactivate plane mode. This makes making a call very frustrating sometimes, and an annoyance when it interrupts a call in progress. There are also instances when after rebooting the phone shows a message saying the SIM comes from an unknown or incompatible source, but then it works again after a bit. This would've been a 4 or 5-star review if it were not for those issues because it's a great phone overall.",
