      "text": "Saw works as advertised and is easy to assemble and it would probably be 5 stars. My issues with this saw relates to the oiler. It leaked all over my bench overnight and to finally stop it I had to find an o-ring to fit the cap. Overall I think the oiling system is a mess. It's in a relatively awkward place and you can't easily fill it without a funnel and the mess that goes with that. Fiddling with a messy chain oiler was one reason for getting away from gas saws. For the $250 I paid it should be designed better.",

If you have used a cheap electric, you know how it works, only this one is clearly more reliable in torque and quality. Biggest problem others have suggested is that not fueling makes one forget to fill the oil too... gotta remember somehow... hey Makita, at this price you could build in a little reminder LED based on power-up time. The grab guard could be engineered a little better too. BTW, I used this with the Honda 2000 inverter and it's been no problem whatsoever.",

Only problem I had was really from my fault in letting chain oil tank run empty, the chain tightened up stopped. Exercise due caution though. Do not let bar tip contact anything.

Spend a little extra and get a quality tool that will last forever. Only one small problem which I'm adjusting to: The chain tightening mechanism isn't as effective as I'd like but this is a problem inherent in every chainsaw I've ever owned.",

I am truly impressed by the power of this saw. The fit and finish are up to the quality you would expect from Makita.

      "text": "It is still pretty new, but so far, it's fantastic. Plenty of power to do around-the-yard cutting (we have 70 year-old pine and elm trees). Reliable, clean, and the need for a power cord has not been a limitation or an irritant to date. Our last gas chainsaw was a complete pita, and this has been the opposite of that so far.",

Doesn't cut big logs, is a lot slower than my gas powered chainsaw and the chain will wear out much faster than the gas chainsaw chain because it is working harder, but it does the job! It is quiet and doesn't have the vibration my gas chainsaw has so it is my choice of saws to use when cutting medium to small logs.",
