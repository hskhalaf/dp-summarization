I had no problem getting the P-208 to be recognized as a twain device on Mac running an older revision of OSX. The lack of twain drivers isn't a problem if you don't mind being stuck using Canon's no-frills software to scan documents. I also experienced problems with documents getting scanned in crooked more often than not. The tiny plastic arms used to hold the documents aren't helping matters. On the upside, scanning and processing documents at 300dpi seemed relatively fast.",
