Yes, it goes on white, but it fades to clear in a few minutes. I found it best for me to put some in my hands and \"warm it up\" a bit before putting it on my body.

Spend a little more money and get something better! This takes way too much effort to rub into skin. Imagine trying to 4 kids and 2 adults ready to go into the sun. It\u2019s already a process, but imagine it takes 10 minutes to sunscreen each individual person. And the best you can do at rubbing it in is a sheer white film all over your body. Making you look like a grey ghost. Awful.",
