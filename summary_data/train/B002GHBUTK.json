My classmate had the same issue. I changed the battery. The lights are on, the red pointer works, but it won't change slides. I tried this on 3 devices. I contacted Logitech and they wouldn't replace/refund the product. I'm disappointed. You \"know\" they make millions off of their products. Their product support sucks.",

This simple product has given us such a competitive advantage against other groups, of whom we were graded against. Every professor comments on our professionalism with the clicker. I works perfectly and doesn't require any downloads. It's as easy as plugging it in and clicking away. The only thing I would be weary about is when you use Google Slides. If you don't maximize the presentation screen, sometimes the clicker won't work. It's an easy fix that doesn't make me vote any less than 5 stars on this product",

It also comes with a padded carrying case and the receiver slips into the remote itself for storage which is nice. The only ding I have on the product is that it doesn't work with the Logitech Unifying receivers. So the same Logitech receiver I have for my mouse and other devices, I have to remove and insert this receiver instead (my laptop has only a single USB slot). So that's a little disappointing. If this worked with the Unifying receiver it would be 5 stars all the way.",

I did a professional presentation in an integrated media classroom where I loaded my presentation onto their console and also plugged in the USB receiver of this clicker, and it worked perfectly.

The only thing I don't like about it is that it has a manual on/of switch. My last one was auto on/off, so I'm continually forgetting to turn this one off when I use it. I'll definitely keep this one until it stops working, but the next time I buy one I'll make sure it comes with the auto off feature.",

This allows the presenter to get everyone's attention off the screen and back to what he is saying. Others have commented that there are limited functions. I say \"GREAT\", it has only what I need.

Basically, you get a timer that reminds you by vibration and a green, more power laser. For me, this one is perfectly fine. One thing I don't like is the receiver. I won't expect a uni-receiver, but a smaller one would be nice. Anyways, you will only use it once in a while, the big receiver isn't a big hassle.",
