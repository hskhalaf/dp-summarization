Honestly the only downside is you can't chose the color you want which I dont care that much but it would have been nice. Overall would most certainly recommend!!!",

I have black backyard chickens who were really looking like they were suffering, so I bought this mister for use in the chicken pen to cool the area for them. It has worked like a charm! They chickens are now up and about, scratching and digging and clucking, and they are obviously more comfortable. I've noticed a tremendous difference in the temperature. I bought two of these, and I am glad I did. I use one for the chickens and the other one I use for myself. They work great, sort of like a swamp cooler. I wish I had bought them years ago. Yeah, it makes that much difference!",

It\u2019s a very stiff material, so it is not very easy. 2- You must screw this product onto your hose INSANELY tight for it not to leak, which makes taking it off at the end of each use, VERY difficult. Had to use a heavy duty wrench. 3- there\u2019s no on/off switch or valve like a spray nozzle, so every time you want to use it, you have to turn On/off the water from the source. We ended up returning it",

One of the heads is still working well, but for $15, being plastic, being in the AZ sun, it is holding up well and I think it will last through at least another season with minor replacements of the little heads.",

My previous ones cracked due to improper storage for the winter, so be sure to drain it completely and keep in a garage, shed or house before the freezing temps hit.

My 11 year old daughter took it and bent it around the ladder herself. It sprays broad enough that there\u2019s no puddle yet, but it\u2019s keeping them and the trampoline cool and wet! Probably going to buy at least one more and would definitely recommend",

We now use a different, heavier hose end mister which throws this item put of balance, forcing me to have to work much harder to keep it in balance and stay standing. If the original mister head had continued to work, this would be a five star review as everything would be easier.",

With our extremely hard water these only last through the summer but will probably last longer with softer water.",
