(even though most people can't seem to figure out what it is) the outside can stain as others have said, but I have managed to avoid any major issues except for a curry mishap. One suggestion - use the darker colored one for foods that may have staining issues (usually lunch for me) and then the white one for foods that won't cause as much of a problem (breakfast) overall I would definitely recommend this product.",

It takes a little creativity to fit large fruits or sandwiches in here, but the lids hold well, so you can cram a lot in.",

Keeps you thinking about how much you are bringing. It has room enough for somewhat more than I generally take. The box itself seems well made and is aesthetically pleasing as well. That, of course, is part of the appeal of the Bento Box. A meal should be more than packing in the calories. Feed the soul as well as the body!",
