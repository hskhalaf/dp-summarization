      "text": "Smells delectable! While much more gentle an exfoliator than other sugar based lip scrubs as it\u2019s made up of natural honey crystals, it definitely does the job to smoothen and condition your lips. I wouldn\u2019t recommend for significantly chapped lips, or if you like rough textured grains like sugar in your lip exfoliator. The reason I rate this product five stars is due to the silky smooth finish and incredibly delicious natural honey-sweet scent it leaves behind on the lips. It is so much more natural feeling and smelling than other lip scrubs I\u2019ve tried. Well worth trying!",

I do not recommend this device unless you're obsessed with frequent application...but ideally you should be asleep because it's overnight.",
