They didn't even get 500 hours. The \"good\" news is they sent replacements immediately. The bad news is that these replacement bulbs only lasted 8 months (less than 200 hours). The worst news is that when I inquired about these bulbs failing, I was told they fall under the original bulbs' warranty and were no longer covered.
