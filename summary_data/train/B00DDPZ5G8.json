The most important function these headphones offer is the around the ear hook. They reduce so much frustration on those sweaty runs by not slipping out of my ears. And, for the price you can't beat it. I'm getting about 2 years' use out of a pair.",

The connection is intermittent - one channel comes and goes - but it's only a matter of time until it snaps. The earlier models also had the same problem.

Had to turn the volume up on the iPod to almost full just to be able to hear the music over the external noise in the gym. Horrible product. Incredibly over priced. The $12 headphones I bought at WalMart work 10x better than these. Even if they only last half as long, I'm still ahead of the game. Save your money and look elsewhere for headphones.",

I swear my kids are hiding kittens just to set them on my ear buds the moment I turn away. We'll see how long they last but so far so good.",

Funny thing is, I saw some complaints about these and saw that the customers were told to email customer service, so after my first pair gave out, I sent an email to that same address that those people were recommended to use, and I never received a reply. Apparently, they only care if you are publicly complaining.",

I spent 20 minutes trying to use my phone's equalizer to find some level of bass on my workout songs. Waste of time. I gave them two stars, since the armband is okay and the ear wires were easy to adjust. They also fit quite well and don't come out of my ears. Too bad they sound so horrible.",
