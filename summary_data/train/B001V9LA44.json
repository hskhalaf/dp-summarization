The Panasonic control signaling between the units works fine. I like the fact you can set up the home screen with the Network Applications you use most frequently. It is very easy to view your Netflix queue and choose a movie to stream. I have a wired ethernet connection. This player makes it as easy to stream a movie as it is to play a disc. The price/performance of the BD-65 is excellent.",

The streaming quality is excellent especially for the titles in HD (note I have it wired up with Cat5 and Verizon FIOS service to the home, your mileage may vary) The other functions like Blu-ray and Pandora are just icing on the cake. The only caveat is my FIOS service cant seem to handle streaming Netflix and Halo being played online simultaneusly, so the Netflix service starts getting interrupted. In that situation Netflix trys to lower the video quality/bit-rate, but it doesnt seem to work so well.",

It plays Blurays just fine, the upscaling of DVDs is alright, not as good as my previous Samsung Bluray player, but good enough. The Netflix HD works fine and looks pretty good. The only thing that wasn't completely up to my expectations was that you only see the Netflix Instant Queue. You can not currently browse/search Netflix like you can on the Roku box. My favorite feature is the lack of a power LED. Overall I am happy with my purchase.",

Range of audio outputs is excellent and was the main reason behind my choice of this unit. It was a close call but I chose this unit over a Sony BDP-S550 after careful reviews due to the better audio output support. CON's: Had the player about 2 months now and not found one 'CON'. I guess if I was being picky, I'd like the start-up time to be even quicker (from power-on to playing a DB disk).",

Bought the Panasonic DMP-BD55K and could not be happier.The best picture and sound of all them. Bonus is putting a sd card in from my wifes camera and doing a slide show with crystal clear pictures on a 52 inch LCD. No problems with BD-Live.Best value for the money out there.",

The DMP-BD55K was a breeze to integrate into my system (Samsung Plasma 50\", & Onkyo 7.1 Channel Entertainment System). The images displayed were increadibly sharp and life-like when playing Blu-ray disc's, and even the standard DVD's looked great. I'd purchased this player on the recommendation of Consumers Report, and after having owned one myself, I'd recommend it too.",

Picture quality is quite good, I still think HD DVD looked better. Video scaling is on-par with other players in this category. Haven't played around with the VieraCast feature much but nice to know its there. Sound quality is excellent, DTS and DD material on the movies we've played so far have been very good. My one nag with this unit is slow response/load times, but I've heard this is fairly standard for bd discs.",

The difference in all of our Blu-rays and regular dvd's is positively stunning. The colors are intensely gorgeous and I can tell you, the clarity is light years better than on the Sony.

Blu rays look killer, dvd upconverts very well. The only sacrifice is that discs load slower than the fastest players, but I can live with that to save $$$. If you want great picture quality for an honorable price... Highly reccomended.",

You do have to learn how to pause and start again a few times I ended up having to go to pick a scene to get back where I was because I hit play after pauseing instead of pause again to resume playing. Does that sentence make sense? A real nice feature is the \"open-close\" button is right on top so its easy to find. Anyway it is a very nice player, at this price I'm thrilled.",

I put in new Blu-ray discs and they wouldn't play. Why - because the firmware verson was 1.5 and not the 2.5 required for the new Blu-ray discs. Shame on you, Amazon.

I noticed some freezing on some old DVDs that we played; it may well be they were dusty, but I will keep my eye on that.

    "title": "Panasonic DMP-BD60 Blu-ray Disc Player (Black)",
    "description": "Style:DMP-BD60The DMP-BD60 is a Blu-ray Disc player that has a wealth of features, combined with good performance. Blu-ray discs are played at 1080p via HDMI output. This player is compatible with standard DVDs, most recordable DVD formats, CDs. Standard DVDs are upscaled up to 1080p via the HDMI output. Onboard decoding or undecoded bitstream output of Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD is provided via HDMI. The DMP-BD60 adheres to Blu-ray Profile 2.0 specifications, and as an added bonus, the Viera Cast feature allows direct access to online\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe Panasonic DMP-BD60 Blu-ray Disc Player combines high quality images with enhanced networking functions. Continuing its commitment to producing products that stress ease of use, the 2009 line of Blu-ray Disc players continue to incorporate VIERA Link, allowing the consumer to operate their audio/video components, via HDMI, with one remote. And, in keeping with Panasonic\u2019s pledge to reduce the planet\u2019s carbon footprint, the new Blu-ray players have been designed to reduce power consumption.\n\n \n\nBD Live and BonusView so you can connect directly to the Internet to access bonus features, games and movie studio extras.\n\nSD memory card and USB slot so you can enjoy precious memories in HD Click to enlarge.\n\n\n\nExperience Movies Like Never Before\nThe DMP-BD60 employs the PHL Reference Chroma Processor Plus. Developed in collaboration with Panasonic Hollywood Laboratory, this high image processing technology reproduces clear, vivid colors that are faithful to the original film. Recognizing that audio is important to the overall entertainment experience, this Blu-ray Disc player features a high definition audio decoder (Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby TrueHD, DTS-HD Master Audio Essential) to take advantage of the exceptionally high quality 7.1 channel surround sound now integrated in Blu-ray Discs.\n\nExperience Movies Like Never Before\nThe DMP-BD60 includes an SD Memory card slot and USB slot, making it easy for the consumer to view and share both digital still images and HD video recorded with an HD camcorder in the AVCHD format.\n\nIn order to produce the ultimate picture quality, the Panasonic\u2019s DMP-BD60 Blu-ray players employs high precision 4:4:4 signal technology, which working in tandem with PHL Reference Chroma Processor Plus processes each pixel of the Blu-ray Disc video signal in the horizontal direction, to compliment vertical direction processing. P4HD (Pixel Precision Progressive Processing for HD) is another technology that contributes to the superior picture quality of the Blu-ray players. P4HD processes more than 15 billion pixels per second and applies the optimal processing to every pixel.\n\nPanasonic\u2019s Blu-ray players further utilize 16-level motion detection to categorize the image motion of each pixel into one of 16 levels; diagonal processing to detect diagonals and correct the pixels accordingly; 1080p up-conversion to up-convert content recorded in the 480i/p or 720p format to 1080p. The Blu-ray players also provide 1080/24p output, thereby reproducing cinema images from a Blu-ray Disc and DVD in their original 24p form with no need for conversion. This allows the user to enjoy cinema images in the same format used in cinema with a 1080/24p compatible TV.\n\nComplimenting the HD audio codecs this Blu-ray player features 96kHz surround re-master, a function that enhances the sound quality of CDs and other sources, and even improves the quality of the multi-channel audio data on Blu-ray Discs and DVDs.\n\nENERGY STAR Rated\nIn order to obtain a reduction in power consumption the Panasonic DMP-BD60 uses Auto Power Stand-By, a function that automatically turns off the player when you return to TV operation using the VIERA Link menu. In addition, the Stand-by Power Save automatically turns off the player\u2019s Quick Start function. When VIERA is turned on, Quick Start also turns on. In addition, the development of the UniPhier single chip LSI makes it possible to pack an entire video signal processing circuit onto a single chip. This helps lower power consumption, reduces the number of parts needed and allows for a more compact design. In fact, the DMP-BD60 consumes 16% less power in standby mode than last year\u2019s model, the DMP-BD35.\n\nKey Features Include\nPHL Reference Chroma Processor Plus for faithful and sharp color reproduction BD Live and BonusView so you can connect directly to the Internet to access bonus features, games and movie studio extras SD memory card and USB slot so you can enjoy precious memories in HD High precision 4:4:4 24p cinema mode 7.1ch lossless audio decode and bit-stream output VIERA Link ENERGY STAR rated consumes 10 percent less power than DMP-BD35 What's in the box\nPanasonic DMP-BD60 Blu-ray Disc Player, remote control, instruction manual",
