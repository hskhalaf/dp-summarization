      "text": "Great product. I've purchased these before. These are not thin cheap pads. The pads are large; providing cover from shoulder to knee; thick 5-6\"; high quality construction. Stitching is very strong. I use for 5th / 6th grade football but could be used for high school as well. A design modification suggestion: rather than two strap handles on backside that you have to hold with two hands; I'd prefer a forearm option; one strap around forearm and grasping the second strap with hand.",
