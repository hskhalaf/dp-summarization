Last nite I considered the possiblilty that my 12v lighter in my car was not producing enough volts so I took the Vac to my 18-wheeler (which has 4 Trump batteries), cranked up the rig, plugged in the compressor and it worked great. So, in conclusion, I figure some autos don't have enough juice to power this thing.",

Cons: There's a variation of 0.5 psi but that shouldn't matter much. The cord should also be tucked into the compressor like my old slime compressor. I like the way it pumps 0.5 psi more than the set pressure to account for the pressure loss during the removal of nozzle. I always rely on my ANSI certified pressure guage to check the tire pressure and I was surprised that this guage is well within 0.5psi error which shouldn't affect the tire much as it's better to inflate 1 psi more than the factory recommended.",

Prior to this I had an air compressor I had to turn on to let it fill with air, which probably took a process of 20-30 minutes to fill all tires. Also, super loud device. But then I found this VacLife product and I would like to say its 100x better! Super quiet and really takes less than a minute to get about 6 PSI. Very convenient to have in the car for emergency situations. The cord length is super long, so I don't see any issues about that for any car, unless you have a super lengthy car, like a limo",

Looking at all of the available 12v pumps, the VacLife compressor looked neat and offered nice features - the automatic shutoff being one. So, I purchased it and went to refill her tires...but being a newer car, the challenge became finding the 12v socket. Once that was done, the pump performed exactly as promised...what a delight.

Not bad for completely deflated tire. I love that you can set the exact PSI you desire (there are also other measurements you can select).

      "text": "There's a bunch of similar tire inflators on Amazon that get great reviews but I haven't found another one with such a fantastic warranty! Works so well and is so easy to use that I immediately bought one for my daughter too! So much easier than dragging out my compressor, or having to pay to use the air at a gas station AND you can keep it in your truck to use anywhere. My trucks tires also seem to go low in the middle of winter and it will be so much better to plug this in and go inside where it's warm while this thing fills up my tires",

This tire inflator makes the job so much faster. The power cord is long enough to reach front and back of the vehicle. The compressor automatically stops once it gets to your desired psi. The digital gauge is pretty accurate compares to my handheld gauge. Great product overall all.",

With this air compressor you could change the unit from psi to Pascals and set the required pressure and it will stop when the pressure is achieved.
