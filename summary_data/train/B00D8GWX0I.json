The needles from the tree can cover the driveway and this works great at sweeping out the needles. For the pine cones I do need to use the power boost occasionally. I also use this on the walkway, porch, and garage. It is light and somewhat quiet. I was a bit hesitant after reading the negative reviews but I do not need to blow leaves from my grass only sweep dry hard surfaces. If that is all you need to do then this should work well for you.",

I love that they interchange the battery with the weed wacker. One battery will last about 15 minutes of blowing the leaves on the patio, driveway, steps and to clean up the mulch. Because I have the B&D weed wacker i have 5 batteries, so I am never without power. But to weedwack and blow the front yard I only need 3 total batteries. So worth getting an extra battery or two charged and ready to go. I can't say enough good things about this product.",

It is especially useful in keeping the debris movement under control as you would using a broom. Lightweight and handy for quick clean ups. I have purchased many for family and friends as gifts. Highly recommend this as a primary tool for anyone who regularly sweeps outdoor areas.",
