Deep tones along with nice highs. The construction seems to be very good. The rubber feet provide a very stable hold while playing. The overall finish is quite good - better than I expected. In my opinion, it's as good if not better than many other Cajon drums priced higher than this one. While I haven't done so, its weight and size should make it easy to transport.",

I have no idea why after playing it because it is a very nice sounding drum. Thanks Pyle!!",

It was easy and enjoyable to sit on top of the instrument and play with my hands. It has a nice finish, seems solid but lightweight and has adjustable snares (two sets of guitar strings).

It is well constructed and I like the fact that the guitar strings are full length verses some of the other models. Not sure if that actually effects sound but I would guess it does. overall, we are happy with it.",
