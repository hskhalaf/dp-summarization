I also needed something to accommodate both of my children because...I can never relax somewhere without the two of them. This hammock is PERFECT. I don't have hulk strength so I had to wait for my husbands help to finish set up but that just goes to show how strong and sturdy it is. The built in pillows are so comfortable and my favorite part is the tilting canopy. If the sun is in my eyes I can pull the canopy down and get the perfect amount of shade. This is probably my favorite purchase of the year so far. Bring on the book binging!",

We even called our neighbors up to help and even with more strength, we could not get the bottom bar (where your feet go) that is holding the hammock to latch into side bars. I'm very disappointed.

There's only one time of day that the shade doesn't block the sun for us, but it's easy to maneuver, so we just turn it. It took my husband and I about 30 minutes to put it together.
