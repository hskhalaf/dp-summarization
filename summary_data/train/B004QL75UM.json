If you are buying these to repurpose the filter media/fabric (for a DIY face mask, etc.) the metal mesh and cardboard structure are well adhered with glue which makes disassembly pretty much impossible.

    "description": "Style:MERV 12| Size:6 PackNordic Pure MERV 12 Pleated AC Furnace Air Filters provide exceptional filtration for both home and commercial environments. Each time air passes through a Nordic Pure pleated furnace air filter, lint, dust, pollen, bacteria, pet dander, dust mites, mold spores, smoke particles, virus carriers, allergens and other contaminants are removed. MERV 12 furnace filters are comparable to HVAC filters with the rating of MPR 1500-1900 or FPR 9. While different companies use different scales to measure the air filter\u2019s efficiency, Nordic Pure chose to follow the industry standard, MERV, as developed by ASHRAE (the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioner Engineers). No matter the name of the rating, the efficiency of all air filters is rated according to the same criteria as set forth by ASHRAE. Nordic Pure furnace air conditioner filters are manufactured using a heavy duty, moisture resistant beverage board frame. As with all Nordic Pure furnace air conditioner filters, the material is electrostatically charged to attract unwanted particles. The media used will not promote the growth of bacteria or mold on the air filter and is better at trapping airborne particles than fiberglass filters. Our attention to the smallest of details results in a healthier living space. For fresh, clean air in your home and office, it is important to regularly change your AC filter, especially during home improvements. We recommend changing your HVAC furnace filter every 1-3 months, depending on your unique home or office environment. People with pets or those who suffer from allergies should change their A/C air filters more often. Replacing your air filter regularly not only improves indoor air quality, it helps your HVAC unit perform more efficiently. Important Note: Almost all air condition filters have a different Actual Size (the exact dimensions) than Nominal Size (the name) printed on the air conditioning filter. It is best to measure the exact size of your A/C filter and compare it to our Actual Size to be sure your HVAC replacement filter fits!\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nNordic Pure 16x25x1 MERV 12 Pleated AC Furnace Air Filters: Actual Size: 15-1/2-Inch by 24-1/2-Inch by 3/4-Inch. Changing your air filter is the first step in insuring your HVAC system runs at its optimal level this season. Generally, you should change your 4-Inch air filters every 3 to 6 months. Particles in indoor air are measured in microns, which are 1/1000 of a millimeter. A human hair is about 100 microns wide. A MERV 12 Nordic Pure air filter captures airborne particles as small as 0.3 microns! Nordic Pure air filters do not kill germs, however, the filter media does not permit the growth of bacteria or mold. As a result, it is not necessary to add any potentially irritating chemicals to the air filter to kill germs. Nordic Pure air filters are made out of an electro statically-charged synthetic material that draws airborne particulates to it like a magnet. Electrostatic filters help trap airborne particles to protect your family from allergy causing pollen, fine dust, smoke particles, airborne plant spores, bacteria, and some viruses.",
