And speaking of packaging, it was excellent in that my Twin Critters Cat Cave came with it's own, cotton drawstring bag. But back to the Cat Cave, it looks just like the picture and while you could collapse the Cat Cave if you and your cat wanted a cushy surface to lay on, it totally stays erect (and in the shape sown in the picture) all on it's own. My kitties and I highly recommend!",

It sheds Ultimately my cats were too scared to go inside after it regularly caved in and one day I came home to find they had peed on it, so it went down the garbage chute.",

There haven't been any outright slap-fights over who sleeps in/on the pod (at least, none that I've witnessed), but I'm going to order another one of these just in case. Highly recommended for cats who like to burrow under bed linens or find hiding spots for a snooze.",
