The Braava line is often compared to the Roomba, iRobot's line of more advanced robotic vacuums. Generally, the Roomba is preferable to the Braava, as the Roomba can clean hard floors and vacuum carpets, while the Braava is limited to hard floors. However, the Roomba vacuums are more expensive, and the Braava can clean hard floors better, so I would recommend the Roomba if you only want your hard floors cleaned or if you're concerned with price (but if you're in the market for a robotic cleaning machine, price probably isn't your biggest problem).",

    "title": "iRobot Braava 380t Advanced Robot Mop- Wet Mopping and Dry Sweeping Cleaning Modes, Large Spaces",
    "description": "Style Name:Braava MopDesigned to mop floors quickly and efficiently, the new iRobot Braava Floor Mopping Robot systematically covers your entire floor in a single pass. Braava uses disposable or microfiber cleaning cloths to pick up dirt, hair and dust from all your hardsurface floors including tile, vinyl, hardwood and laminate. Just attach a cloth, set Braava down, press a button and off it goes, using advanced robotic technology to track where it's been and where it needs to go. It's whisper quiet too, so you can go about your daily activities without disruption. The included Turbo Charge Cradle is a convenient, one stop charging and storage space, charging Braava 380t in as fast as two hours. Braava uses either disposable cleaning cloths, including Swiffer brand, or reusable microfiber cloths to remove dirt, dust and hair from your floors so you don't have to. Braava has two cleaning modes to choose from depending on the job you need done. In sweep mode, Braava dry mops your floors moving in straight lines using dry cleaning cloths. In mop mode, Braava uses a special back and forth mopping action and damp cleaning cloths to lift surface dirt and grime off your floors. With the Pro Clean System included in Braava 380t, a special Reservoir Cleaning Pad dispenses liquid throughout the cleaning cycle to keep the cloth damp. Cleaning cloths are easy to attach and remove with Braava's removable magnetic multi purpose cleaning pad. The NorthStar Navigation System 2 works like an indoor GPS that helps Braava keep track of where it has been and where it needs to go. The NorthStar Navigation Cube projects a signal that Braava uses to determine its location. Additional NorthStar Navigation Cubes can be purchased for the Braava 380t to expand the robot's dry mopping capabilities for bigger homes. Note: Trouble shooting steps available in pages 24 26.",
