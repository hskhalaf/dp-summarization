I finally just caved and used some pliers to crimp the perimeter of the shaft to decrease its diameter to get it started and then used a rubber mallet to force it the rest of the way into the vent. The fan doesn't seem to pull much air, even on high. Cosmetically, it looks good.",

I managed to make it fit as it was designed, but I should have ordered the ventless hood that has the horizontal vent openings for the fan on the front of the unit. Nevertheless, both units look very similar and are a very practical choice, as they fulfill the need for which the are intended and they do so at a very reasonable and economical price. I am very satisfied.",
