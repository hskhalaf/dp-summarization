Once you've got the system set up and the tank cycled, it works great.",

    "description": "Color:Black\n\nIt's not magic - it's nature! Aquaponics employs the same principles as the natural world. Imagine having a living ecosystem to grow, learn and discover with-all in your own home. The AquaSprouts Garden includes everything you need to turn any standard 10-gallon aquarium ( approximately 20\" x 10\" x 12\") into a self-sustaining ecosystem using the beauty of aquaponics. \n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s in the box? \u2022AquaSprouts Garden: Comes in a modern and black matte design, which is perfect for accommodating and matching with any decor, and is assembled easily with no tools required.\n\n\u2022Light Bar:A removable light bar to which you can affix any standard indoor grow light of your choice- ideal for places with insufficient natural light sources. You can simply adjust the light according to your plants' necessities. \n\n\u2022Pump & Timer: The kit includes a submersible 9.5 Watts / 120 V 160 gallons per hour pump. Along with a 24 hour timer that can be set for 15 minute intervals. Both the pump and timer include a 1-year warranty. \n\n\u2022Grow Media: Our special clay grow media replaces soil from traditional gardening and serves as the support for your plants in the grow-bed. They also provide a surface area for the bacteria to grow and convert the fish waste into nutrients for your plants. The grow media traps fish waste and uneaten fish food-- making the grow-bed a mechanical filter. (Grow media does not degrade) \n\n\u2022Resources & Support: Each kit comes with a detailed and step-by-step guide to setting up and maintaining your Garden. As well as that, our dedicated support team is just one email or phone call away if you have any questions or need assistance. We also provide live chat on our website. \n\nNatural Aquarium The Garden\u2019s design is simple, freestanding, and virtually maintenance-free, making indoor gardening and a beautiful aquarium accessible to anyone regardless of experience with fish or plants. It eliminates the need for traditional fertilizers using the same principles that recycle wastes in natural ecosystems, making upkeep as simple as feeding your fish. We built the Garden to fit over any standard 10-gallon aquarium, including existing tanks, making it the perfect way to grow fresh herbs and vegetables or beautiful ornamentals anywhere.\n\n\n\n\nAquaponics involves breaking down toxic ammonia and turning it into nutritious plant food called nitrates using two types of nitrifying bacteria \u2013 nitrosomas and nitrospiras. When fish produce ammonia it attracts a type of bacteria called nitrosomas. \n\nThese guys and gals convert the ammonia into nitrites \u2013 a compound even more toxic than ammonia. Thankfully, however, nitrites attract another type of bacteria called nitrospiras who then convert the nitrites into nitrates \u2013 excellent food for plants, and mostly harmless to fish.\n\nOnce this has happened the aquaponic cycle is complete and, once stabilized, will ensure ammonia levels are kept at a minimum while providing maximum nutrition for the plants. \n\n\n\n\nTransform Your Aquarium The AquaSprouts Garden is designed to fit any standard 10-gallon aquarium - one of the most common and widely available aquariums - and provides a platform to grow a wide variety of plants. Its sleek, modern design also makes it a great conversation piece for any home\u2019s d\u00e9cor.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Startup Describe your product in 3 words.\n\nEducational, Natural, Beautiful\n\nHow did you come up with the idea for this product?\n\nEveryone on our team are makers, thinkers, hobbyists, and learners. We are personally dedicated to promoting aquaponics in a way that\u2019s simple, hands-on, and aesthetic. We want AquaSprouts to be more than just a product; we want to provide a platform for you to explore aquaponics and see how its synthesis of natural science and technology can change the world.\n\nWhat makes your product special?\n\nWe designed the AquaSprouts Garden to bring the revolutionary principles of aquaponic farming into the home, office, and classroom, because we believe aquaponics offers something to benefit everyone. By combining fishkeeping and hydroponic gardening, aquaponics does things that neither can do alone, dramatically reducing waste and maintenance. By circulating the water from your aquarium through the Garden\u2019s bed, the AquaSprouts Garden recycles fish waste to provide vital nutrients for growing plants, leaving the water clean and clear without the need for additional filters or frequent water changes.\n\nWhat has been the best part of your startup experience?\n\nSpreading our passions for aquaponics! Our goal with the AquaSprouts Garden is not to feed you and your neighbors directly, but to feed minds and fuel curiosity. The Garden is a miniaturized, living lesson in sustainability in a world where the concept becomes more important every day. This belief in a better future is one reason we place an emphasis on bringing aquaponics and curriculum kits to classrooms around the globe.",
