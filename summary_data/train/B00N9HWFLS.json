I do not hand wash them, even though I know that if I want a longer life from them I should, but so far, after months of use, they're just as perfect as the day I bought them.",

They are actually extremely sharp, and in fact, I cut part of the top of my thumb off, as the blade of the smallest knife went right through the nail and flesh of my finger. I love these knives, and after a couple of cuts, I am very careful when using and cleaning them. Definitely recommend, as I am gifting some for Christmas. Be VERY careful with these and keep the blade guards on whenever not in use.",

They slice through everything very easily including streak, watermelon, bread, etc and are great for chopping herbs. They haven\u2019t dulled at all. We do hand wash them and dry them completely before putting them back in the sheaths. My dad used the red one to clean fish twice recently and he won\u2019t stop talking about these knives. We\u2019re going to get him a set as a gift. We\u2019re also going to buy another set for our home as well.",

The variety of knives hits all that I need.. in addition to some nicer knives I already had. The blades are incredibly sharp, and each knife comes with its own blade sheath. The ceramic coating is holding up very well, except on the small pairing knife.. which the color wore off the tip. Oddly the larger knives that I use the most, show no sign of the ceramic coating wearing off. I wanted a pop of color in my kitchen and these are perfect. I would buy them again!",
