      "text": "Dragon dictate was easy enough to install and set up. I went through the script required to get the software used to my way of speaking. In practical use it fell down in not recognising words and phrases, substituting totally wrong ones. Even spelling out, or being more deliberate and clear in pronunciation, what it came up with was still incorrect. This happened too often to be considered acceptable. Trying to re-educate Dragon made no difference. Correcting this was time consuming, and dealing with punctuation made it even more frustrating. I returned the product.",

But when I tried to start the program from the shortcut or from the library on C:\\ drive, it would not respond and ended with no error message. I bought NS 11 and NS 12 and was hoping to benefit from NS 13. It is possible that the antivirus I use is to blame (I recently changed it -- it's a 1 year subscription) but I can't realistically uninstall the antivirus which needs to be there all the time. This situation is frustrating because there is no effective alternative to NS for either windows or linux.",

So, the Dragon is essential and I must master it and enter into a deep and harmonious relatioinship with it. There is no other way into the future for me - and the Dragon!",
