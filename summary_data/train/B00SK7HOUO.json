You could fit several parakeets in there, a few cockateils, even small conures or a Quaker or two... it is not a small cage. I just wanted my 2 loves to have lots of room. The perches are awesome as well as the dishes. They come with guards to keep the seeds in and the birds out of the water. I can put several swings in the cage, and toys... it is just an awesome cage. It is well made and not overly heavy. I even hung it from a hook in the ceiling in my living room.",

We had her in a round hanging one but I felt bad because it was very small - this is very spacious, looks very nice and the price is great! The only thing I would say is, although it is supposed to be able to be hung by the handle that's on top, I think the cage is too heavy to have it hang from it, so I bought some chain and some carabiner clips so that I could hang it from all 4 corners of the top.",

The description says 14 inches but in reality that includes the outside edge of the base, so inside the cage you actually have only 13 inches front to back. It just seemed to be a tight space to me. For parakeets or other small birds that's probably fine. I have two parakeets and a cockatiel and I would not put the cockatiel in this cage. I did end up sending it back and getting something deeper that I'm much happier with.",

This cage is for the Cockatiel. The birds have their own bedroom and fly freely so I didn't really need a flight cage but it was time to replace his old one and size-wise it was a big upgrade.

We bought a cage at the pet store, but after assembling it, the cage seemed too small for more than one bird. That cage was returned and I bought the Prevue Hendryx Flight Cage. This is VERY roomy, easily three times the size of the previous cage and assembly wasn't too difficult. Best yet, I have purchased a by far superior cage for only $18 dollars more than the one I got at the pet store. I would have bought this cage at twice the price. You certainly won't regret this purchase.",

The taller size makes it easy to swap out toys in different areas, keeping the cage lively. The one complaint I'd have is that it is a bit difficult to fully clean without fully dismantling. The poop-catcher tray at the bottom does not line up too well with the actual base of the cage, so a lot of crud falls between the cracks and isn't caught. Not a major complaint, but something to keep in mind before buying.",

A very nice blue and white cage that my birdies seem like they love. One bad thing is, it's hard to clean but, that's because of it's shape. I suggest cleaning it in a shower or bathtub or outside if you can and NOT a kitchen or bathroom sink. Otherwise! Good product.",

It was extremely easy to assemble, the wires are closer together, and even though it is tall, it is still sturdy. His bird has much more room.

It could easily house a second parakeet with no problem.",
