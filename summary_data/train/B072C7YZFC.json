Will have to return if it doesn't start working again in a day or two... UPDATE 2: Never worked again and it's too late to return to Amazon. Will be contacting the manufacturer. Shame.",

The biggest issue with the universal remote was that it took a few seconds to \"wake up\" after a few minutes of inactivity. This new remote doesn't do that, it's almost instant. The size is really nice and it controls your blu-rays and your apps perfectly (Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Prime, and others) My only complaint is that if your PS4 is off any button on the remote will turn it on so you have to be careful not to accidentally bump it. Other than that, very nice remote.",

Also, it eats up battery power at an alarming rate. I had to change the aaa batteries at least once every 3 weeks. It\u2019s too bad, I would love a good remote for my ps4. The game controller is too sensitive to the touch for ps vue and dvd replay... a credit to Sony. The game controller rocks... for games.",

It's easy to hit the wrong button. They should have spaced them a little further apart. Otherwise this is a great little remote.",

      "text": "Useful and it works great for the most part. But every now and then it won't work. It does have a battery saver, that allows it to turn off after a certain time. It's then supposed to work if you push any button, at any time after it turns off. While off, it's supposed to do whatever function you pressed as soon as it turns back on. However i noticed when it's not working, it will work as long as I turn on one dual shock control. I wish it would work all the time! For this reason I'm giving 3 star, this issue takes away from fully enjoying it. Overall still nice to have.",

It shows up as a connected device on the PlayStation device list and shows the current battery level too which is a nice feature. I wish the play control buttons were better supported because they work in some apps but not others. The battery life on two AAA batteries is not great, they last 1-2 months depending on usage which is high for a remote control but understandable because it\u2019s Bluetooth. At least they included batteries in the package. Price seemed a bit high, but totally worth it if you use your PS4 as your main media player.",
