The stem is a little shorter than I'd prefer for my high cervix placement, but the soft (referring to firmness of the silicone) is so comfortable and easy to wear and remove either way. Some menstrual cups have a tendency to put pressure on the bladder, giving the sensation of having to use the bathroom. But I LOVE that this one does not make me feel that pressure at all! And I of course can't forget to mention the outstanding price.",

I promise you I keep it clean and this isn\u2019t my first rodeo with cups. I\u2019ve used them for years. This one just is not the one ladies. Recommend diva cup all the way!",

Another plus is that the little handle nub is not too long, so it doesn't protrude and become bothersome like the last one I was using. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to be environmentally conscious and/or save a lot of money. It pays for itself in the first month and then you never have to buy tampons again!",

I used this for ~4 months and I ended up going back to the Diva Cup.. 3 stars from me.",

You can get colors..ahhheemm when you use a cup for a couple months...clear is not good. I bought dark grey, no discoloring so far. 3. The price can't be beat.
