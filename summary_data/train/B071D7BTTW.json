Finding coconut milk that is just water and coconut for ingredients was expensive and difficult. The soup function took the process from several hours of simmering and then using a crappy \"normal blender\" and hoping for the best to a 1 hour soak in the water then flip a switch and walk away. 6 minutes later the coconut milk is done blending and too hot to squeeze through a nut milk bag. The coconut is shredded so fine that it works as flour after straining with the bag and getting a bit of drying time.",

In addition, I was unable to submit my proof of purchase to get the additional year warranty, as their email system kicked my submission back stating it was identified as spam. To top it off, when making an attempt to contact customer support during their stated business hours, I was connected to the voicemail that states the business hours and asking called to call back during business hours. Erm... -- update: was able to arrange exchange, was sent new unit. So far new unit performs as advertised. Quiet and powerful. Was also able to submit receipt to get additional year of extended warranty.",
