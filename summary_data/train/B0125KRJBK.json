The tiny embellishments stay fine but the rails, slide and side view mirrors do not stay on. The holes you are supposed to put them in are too shallow so they don't stay. The same is for the slit for the slide to stick in. It doesn't really work.",

I am really disappointed. I bought it for my daughter for her birthday and she absolutely loves it but I'm very disappointed that it so cheaply made. I'm gonna try to fix it with glue today. Luckily she loves it regardless but I feel bad that I gave her a toy that is such a piece of crap And she was so excited to get it because she loves the littlest pet shop toys.",

The slide, top rail, megaphone & globe all come off which drives me crazy because I like everything assembled, but the kids like taking them apart so no big deal. It's better they take it apart and play with it then it sit in a toy box. Overall happy with the product and feel it was a fair price.",

The slide at the back fits in place well but with a slight touch it falls off the same goes for the side mirrors they are very hard to get to stay in place. Overall though the bus is a nice toy because you do not really need more than the body of the bus to have fun with it. It holds about 4 larger pets and 4 smaller ones. The wheels are real wheels so the bus rolls really well.",

It might get frustrating to some kids that the slide falls off quite a bit. Also the bars up top seem to fall off as well. It comes with everything as described. It looks just like the picture. I guess for the price it is a cute accessory my daughter does play with it daily.",
