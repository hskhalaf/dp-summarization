I've used all sorts of allergy medicines and nothing helps completely but since Ive had this in my bedroom my suffering has ended. For the first week I kept thinking why did I take so long getting this. Oh well better late than never. Don't hesitate getting this lamp, it works and its worth it.",

I was happy to see that it wasn't! Beautiful size and shape. Some other negative reviews said the salt lamps melted or started to mold? I would look into your home conditions if so.... because i've had no issues or signs of melting or color change. Very happy with this product!",

I have blackout curtains, so this gives me the illusion of a nightlight even during the daytime hours. I also love the natural cut of the salt and they are true to the weight depicted.

      "text": "The lamp is beautiful when it works. The trouble is that it is very hard to get it to turn on. I have to stand there tapping the touch switch again and again over 30 seconds to a minute before it finally turns on. Sometimes it flashes on briefly then winks out again. I suspect some kind of short in the switch, which seems very badly designed. It is so hard to turn on, and getting worse each day, that it will discourage me from even trying eventually. So I have an orange rock paperweight with no light in it. Stay away from this product.",

It came beautifully packaged but the first thing I noticed was the weight. 8-11lbs is a nice size. The glow is stunning. From a night light to eliminating the room. Too soon to rate the Heath benefits but it makes me happy just looking at it. Planning on purchasing another for my bedroom as this one now sits in the living room.",

One was just fine like other order, but second lamp was small and thinner, and color was almost white / clear. To lazy to return, so I've learned,no deal comes without a reason for giving the deal.

The dimmer is very nice, because the max setting was a little too bright. Overall Levoit seems high quality. If I were going to give advice to a friend though, I would say pay more attention to the size you are getting, and try to comparison shop with other sales outlets if possible.",

I never noticed any benefits but I loved the ambience. I didn\u2019t receive extra bulbs like others mention. I tried a plug in one too and that died even quicker.",

I love the configuration and don't think I could have done any better based on the number of lamps I looked at. It is an excellent value. It is a larger piece and when the light is on, the glow is beautiful. It is everything I hoped for.....the glow is mesmerizing. What more can I say other than I would put one in every room of the house if I could.",
