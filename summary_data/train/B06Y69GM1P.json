She absolutely loves it and the fact she can get her photos instantly and watch them develop is great too. I would certainly recommend this product to anyone who has a similar aged child who is showing signs of interest in this creative hobby.

Yes, the film is expensive, but the novelty of watching pictures develop in front of you never wears off. Great for selfies - single or group.

The colours are gorgeous and she found it very easy to use and especially appreciated the little selfie mirror bit on the front. We have taken it on trips together and also used it as a guest book for a party too. The film is a bit pricey and honestly that is the only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because the expense of the film puts her off using it more. The pictures come out nicely with that vintage feel to them and process quickly and the overall build quality of the camera is really impressive.",
