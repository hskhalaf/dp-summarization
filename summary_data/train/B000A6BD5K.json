Both of these issues cause unwanted friction when our dog pulls. I think these issues are really negligent, given the nature of the product. Additionally, the pictures in the instructions on the package are very different. 1 of the pictures show the thin nylon to be sewn through each collar end and don\u2019t utilize the lobster clasp. See pics for clarification. So disappointed and returning.",

Best two mile walk we've ever had and the collar didn't bother him in a negative way. So glad I found this collar after trying two different no pull harnesses that didn't work for my dog.",

She pulled so hard she was short of breath & sounded like a squeaky toy. This collar's sharp points didn't phase her at all! We since tried the gentle lead & have found it to work much better. This star mark collar might work better on different breeds, but I wouldn't recommend for labs.",

It's probably ok for lighter dogs that don't pull too hard but for a 60-70 pound puppy it didn't hold up.

She was somewhat leash trained but walking her and a toddler in a stroller by myself has always been a power struggle! She pulls to be the lead and set the pace for our little pack. Today I walked her with this collar and it was like walking a completely different dog! She went at our pace, calmly along side the stroller. No excessive force put in to drag us along. She pulled twice to sniff some bushes, quickly realized and corrected her behavior! God send! I would have paid three times the price for this result!",

I also like the martingale feature of this collar and it comes with a \"slip\" collar for added protection should something happen to prong collar while using it.",

She is actually getting the hang of walking next to me, instead of in front of me. It's easy to take the extra links out and size it for your dog. I recommend it!",

It simply acts as a \u201ctap\u201d to get their attention, in a sense. You should only have to tug quickly and let go, not letting your dog continually pull. Works great and stays up unlike many other training collars. I guess if your dog is continually pulling hard then it might not last long (and then you should contact a trainer for help)",
