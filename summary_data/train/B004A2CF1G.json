I used this for a brake job on a 2003 Dodge Grand Caravan and I had no difficulty using it to remove lug nuts, to remove the calipers, and honestly I love how much of an easier time I had compared to a normal tire iron. The only thing to watch out for is to not over-tighten your lug nuts as this can make a normal strength individual easily capable of over-tightening. On a side note, you also feel safer when using it as it would also double well as a self-defense item.",

Even better, it is long enough to reach outside the wheel well to allow for an additional pipe without sacrificing precious angles for consistent torque on even the most stubborn axle nut.",
