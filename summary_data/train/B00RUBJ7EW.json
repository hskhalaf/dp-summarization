All the menu changes are easily available, at a a touch. The wifi was not easy to set up and I opted for a different app to get it to work. My GPS (opteka) works with the D5500 as does the additional battery pack holder (Model DSTE, not recommended). I bought this as a refurbished model and saved a large amount of money. It came in a plain white box with no manual and no post processing discs. These were downloaded on line, but I still like having a book. A highly recommended camera.",

It is an outstanding camera with a beautiful 'articulating touch-screen LCD display' that allows you to view your subject/shot from any angle and displays controls for every element of the exposure. The only shortcoming is the microphone in movie mode. But a $20 external mike attached to the hot-shoe makes a huge difference. Love this camera! The D5600 has Bluetooth and can use Snapbridge for better connectivity but you give up other advantages like weight.",

Study all this up and you will really start to understand how to take some great pics.

A pleasant surprise was a noticeable improvement in low light conditions. I take a lot of candid indoor photos and being able to extend the ability to take them without a flash was a pleasant surprise. I still don't remember to use the touch screen capability all the time - changing habits takes some time. One final attribute that was noticeable is faster cycle time between shots. I haven't actually measured side by side with my D3100, but I clearly notice it as I take photos in rapid succession",

The D5500, made from carbon fiber plastic, is much lighter, and it uses my existing DX lenses. I haven't learned to love the touch screen, but it may just be a matter of getting used to it. It won't do everything the D300 could do, and I probably won't ever use the \"effects\" feature, but it is a powerful, lightweight, high resolution DSLR.",

I also wish there were a way to limit the upper auto ISO, as it goes very high in moderate light conditions, which may effect the quality of a large print.",

Night time photography is great despite the smaller sensor and aperture w/ the 18-55mm lens. Light, small, well constructed, well designed body. Could not ask for more from a mid-pro level camera. Would recommend to any amateur photographer in search of something more. Came w/ ~200 shutter actuations in brand new appearance.",
