      "verdict": "The North Face captures the attention of outdoor lovers through their very own Storm III Waterproof. This watertight hiking shoe received excellent reviews, mainly thanks to its incredible comfort. Its great performance on trails can also be attributed to its grippy outsole, durable build, and breathable structure, to name a few. It fell short on the width department though. To summarize, even though it does not seem to be the best choice for hikers with a wide foot, its characteristics make it hard to ignore.",
