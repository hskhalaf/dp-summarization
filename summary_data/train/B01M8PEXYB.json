We spent 8 hours through 16 miles on the course, it provides enough water for me, and I have enough space to store my gel/snacks. Beast requires headlamp and glow sticks, and this pack can hold them without problem. It is on the other hand not so bulky with all the storage. Went though barbed wires with them on my back, not once they got stuck with the wires. They fit very well, not feeling any boucing/shaking while I ran. No chaffing of any kind. Love it.",

The cap for the mouthpiece broke off yesterday, so the plastic / connection quality could use improvement, and the mouthpiece is leaky, but otherwise everything works as intended.

The horizontal spacing of the stitching is too wide, and the vertical spacing is inconsistent. It works for the attachments I need, but won't work with everything. * Trying to find replacement parts for the bladder and hose will be impossible since it's unbranded.

I checked and at first glanced, it appeared to work. But when the day of the ride came. The second I actually connected the straw, the bag started leaking. I must admit the actual bag looks pretty cool. I\u2019m just disappointed this didn\u2019t work as advertised. In the picture you can actually see a bubble forming from where the water is coming out.",

The molle straps on the back would allow even more storage with the addition of a small molle pack. It's comfortable to wear. The d rings on the front would be a good place to clip on a gps. The quality overall looks good. This a major upgrade over the one the Army issued me back in 2008. I hope this one holds up as longs as the last one did.",

The one and only thing I've noticed is that the dust cap on the hydration mouthpiece isn't very snug and falls open fairly easily but I'm sure I can find a fix for that. It is an excellent product and I appreciate the little touches like the whistle on the chest strap and the on/off valve that keeps the mouthpiece from leaking. Would definitely buy again.",

Edit: April 4, 2018 My pack severed at the lower hip joint. I simply emailed customer support, and I received a replacement pack free of charge. These guys stand behind their product and I couldn't recommend it enough. Why would you spent $120 on a camelbak when this guy does it all for 1/3 the price?",
