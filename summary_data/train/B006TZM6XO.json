It's easy to set up, signal strength is good, and it has a cool security feature where you can ban all devices from connecting unless they have the right MAC address, for a little extra protection. Instead of replacing my old wireless DSL modem/router combo I plugged this into it and then disabled the wifi on the DSL modem. Now I have newer, more secure wifi hanging off the old modem. It's pretty small and doesn't get terribly hot either. Been working fine for a few weeks now with no issues relating to bandwidth or reliability.",

She, patiently provided step-by-step instructions to reconnect my router and change the channel. Her clearly understood directions, conveyed in a professional, knowledgeable way, completely lowered my previously frustrated mind and just reaffirmed my high opinion of the D-Link company, its products and most importantly--its highly trained employees!

The wireless connections now come up in a few seconds instead of minutes and the port forwarding we needed to setup was easily done. The only problem in setting things up had to do with the AVG fire wall and had nothing to do with the Dlink. a side benefit is that the Dlink only uses about 4 watts while the Verizon was about 15 watts. As these things run 24 hour, that is about a $10/year difference.",

Hitting my head on a brick wall would have been more help. So, I threw the Netgear away (a wasteful shame) and went to Amazon to find a replacement. This D-Link was a great price and arrived very fast - easy to set up, no problems at all. The range is much broader also, so I am happy with this D-Link router!",
