I started with their travel size of the \"DevaCurl Kit for All Curl Kind\" It includes 3oz bottles of No-Poo Original, One Condition Original, Styling Cream, Light Defining Gel. I was really shocked at how well this line of products worked on my hair. I buy all of them in the large bottles now. Individually they are good products but together they have changed my curls. I am not kidding at all! My curls are curlier, not crunch, not as frizzy and overall more beautiful than before I used DevaCurl.",

My hair would end up straight, wavy and curly and look a mess. This product line has given me consistent curly hair with very little straight and wavy spots. Do not brush your hair between washings! You must remoisten a little in the am and twist it a little to refresh curl. Then spray the stray hair. Again do not brush, comb or pick it.",

(Which is why I don't think it can be the be-all/end-all of hair care.) But it does lead to a pretty successful proportion of good hair days. My hair especially likes it when I add a little bit in as a leave-in conditioner after I get out of the shower.",
