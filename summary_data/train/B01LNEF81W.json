I didn't look too close when I first used one on aluminum. Set up in my lathe and started cutting and was having trouble getting a smooth finish....... then realized I didn't have an insert installed, Ha Ha!! The bar was still rigid enough to make a cut. Worked perfect with an insert. Try them, you will like them.",

      "text": "I like the fact you can get good to great bore surfaces with these alone. Aluminum gets the best raw finish but cast iron needs some honing to get the best finish. The bars are very stiff so they run true. Just keep your cutting depths shallow to start with and add a little more depth when you feel the bar can handle it. Overall these are a great set of bars and inserts. Happy I bought thsee for my HF 9x20 lathe. These will also work on the HF 7\" lathe.",
