And with a 7mm exit pupil 7x50 is pretty much ideal for low light. However the glass/coatings are far from great... tons of spherical aberration on the outer 1/4 of the image (fuzziness around the edges of the image). Overall not bad for the price, but I only get a very clear image in the inner 1/2 of the total image.",

Cometron is clearer and easier to handle due to the weight and size and the field is fantastic. And one you consider the price difference it's the cherry on top. For comparison the skymaster has a great deal of zoom but the collimation just took all the fun out. And it doesn't take in as much light so the image isn't crisp. The size makes it difficult to hold steady but then again I'm a shaker but even my partner has issues and he's as still as a rock.",

In other words, these Celestions are great general purpose binoculars with an ace up their sleeves when it comes to using them for what they were designed for.

Really helps brighten stuff up in the shadows or dim areas. Just the right magnification to be able to hold them steady without a tripod. Easily scan the stars like you're flying out there. Really brings out star colors well. Higher magnifications makes it difficult not to get a jittery image unless you have a tripod. This is the perfect size & magnification for normal hand-held use.",

      "text": "Purchased two - one for my dad and one for my son. They both love it. Pulls in enough light to see stars in town that you can't see with the naked eye. Magnification is just right - any more and you'd be looking at shakes and streaks the entire time. Now we keep it by the back door so I we can use them whenever we step into the back yard. Not a replacement for a telescope, but its a good starting device and really convenient (taking out one of my scopes, setting, up etc. takes time).",

I like it's medium size build, not too bulky or heavy to carry along.",

But those are my only complaints -- they provide a fine image, and the 7x magnification is just right for hand-holding. My hands shake a little, but at 7x the view still looks good.
