I have worn them only on gravel roads so far, but anticipate they will serve me well on day hikes in the mountains. I got a C/D width because I have a bunion, so am especially pleased with the comfort. I am giving four stars only because I cannot rate their durability, since they are new. In a few years, they might be five star. After number of months, I give this five stars. They continue to be comfortable. I wear them to teach classes when the weather is bad, I wore them to snowshoe a 5K fundraiser. I have changed the rating from 4 to 5 stars.",

Boots fit perfectly since day 1, no need to break them in, no blisters, no tight fit despite me having wide feet. I've used these for over a year now, virtually every day. I work with kids outdoors, which means I need to have comfortable hiking footwear that can handle all types of weather. Love these boots, absolutely worth the cost.",

With these, I've tried wearing thicker socks, have tried several pieces of advice on how to better tie the laces, and have given them a substantial grace period for \"breaking in.\" It's been several hikes now, and I'm really disappointed to say that I can't justify wearing these ever again.",
