      "text": "I wish I can give it negative 100. After working for less than two years suddenly it stopped working. Could smell nasty electronic components burning. Upon inspection, it seemed that plastic back cover of the unit which was installed outside the fan housing started melting. Took the unit apart and looks like 2 of large diodes or capacitors and some other electronic components exploded and started melting the plastic cover (see attached picture). If you have a same brand of the Harbor Breeze Ceiling Fan & Lite Remote, STOP USING IT IMMEDIATELY. I intend to contact the vendor as well as federal and state agencies regarding this issue.",
