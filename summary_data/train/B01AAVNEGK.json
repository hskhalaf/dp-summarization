This is the 3rd pair of Skechers with memory foam that I've purchased. I have one for home and this pair for work which replaced the last pair that I wore out. The grey is a nice light shade that looks great with most colors (I wear a variety of solid colored scrubs). The pink is a bright, kind of neon shade. Great value for the price.",

I did return these however, because when I walked in them the material above the toes would kind of 'fold in' and press onto my toes and became painful.",

Three weeks later, the tread at the toe on the same shoe came loose, which I also superglued. One week after that the original tread came loose again - 3 strikes your out. Shoes were returned for a refund.",
