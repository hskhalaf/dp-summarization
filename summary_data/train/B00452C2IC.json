A few negatives: -Ingress/egress is a little tough for taller people -Gear loft is lame and improperly sewn Several people complained that it won\u2019t fit back into the sack. Make some mental notes when taking the tent out for the first time. If you fold the tent similar to how it came out it\u2019ll go back in the storage sack just fine. I wouldn\u2019t buy this tent at full MSRP because there are better options for $180. Wait for the price to drop to about $100 and then jump on it.",

The best part about it is how easily it sets up and packs. There's no need to fold it as it stuffs easily in the bag. And the clip on (high quality aluminum) exterior poles are the only way to go for ease of set up after a long day of backpacking! We'd buy this one again in a heartbeat. (If it ever wears out!)",

If you are a motorcycle camper don't hesitate to pick one of these up.",

After I got this my friends liked it so much two of them ended up getting the same one. Functional, reliable, well constructed, and you definitely can't beat the price. The only thing I did was to replace the stakes with sturdier ones but the ones it comes with are still pretty decent.",

      "text": "Bought this tent for a hunt in northern Alaska. We were out for a week in rain and some very heavy winds. I was very impressed with how tight the rain fly stretched out and the overall quality. The tent was very roomy for the two of us. It's the first tent I've owned with side entrances, and I can't say that I will ever own another without, they were great. Ventilation worked well in below freezing temps, very minimal condensation build up.",

Enjoyed the stash pockets you can attach to the inside of the roof. Only rained very lightly overnight so can't really speak for the waterproofing. Some people have mentioned the pegs seem cheap, had no problem with them even on tough soil and in any case, they're so cheap to replace. My partner and I fit in fine with reasonably large packs at the end. Thoroughly recommended for 2/3 max night hikes.",

Typically, it always seems to rain when I go out camping with this. It holds up to rain quite well.The weight of the tent is not bad at all either. I would highly recommend this tent to anyone.",

It poured all night, and it stayed perfectly dry inside. We got rain a few times on that trip and it was never a problem. It is easy to set up, easy to take down, light, keeps us dry.

I was a little disappointed that it didn't pack down smaller, but given what I paid for it, and that it is light, I can manage the bulk of it. I also probably need to perfect my tent folding/packing skills. Overall, I'm super happy with this tent.",

And there was extra space inside after both our sleeping bags were rolled out. It was very warm when we used it, and the vents came in handy. The gear loft and other pockets were super nice to have since we could hang our lights and things in easy reach spots. I highly recommend for anyone who wants a spacious, lightweight tent for backpacking.",
