When she got hers she said they were \"heavenly\". I am very happy with this product. After I bought these I saw a similar product at Bed Bath and Beyond, they were more expensive and thinner. I'm still happy with my purchase.",

I am much more comfortable cooking now. I am very pleased with this matt and can recommend it without hesitation.

They love to lay on it and it's a pain to get them to move elsewhere. 100 bucks in sheepskin crate-liners and all she wants to lay on my mat instead.

I ordered this new mat and it arrived within a day or so. Great improvement! I've used it for a little over a week and my arches feel fantastic. The mat is also more durable than other products I've tried in the past. It easily withstood a spilled coffee and cat scratches. I'd purchase again.",

I'm not upset with it but it doesn't help as much as whatever the other brand is, but I'm not disappointed enough to deal with returning it. Fine product it arrived fine and in fine condition. I'll see how long it lasts. Its better than bare floor or my carpet so I consider it an improvement.",
