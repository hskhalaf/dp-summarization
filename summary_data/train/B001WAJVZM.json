Little toes can get bent in the holes used to hold the support. See pic. When my son was kicking around he managed to catch a pinky toe in that spot. Thankfully he didn't bend it too much. It takes forever to drain. I dry it well after each use and it still smells. I do not recommend this tub. At least the cat likes it so it looks like she has a new bed.",

Not only did it absolutely NOT fit on my faucet, but the strap used to adjust it isnt anchored in any way- so as you attempt to adjust it to fit the strap just silides out from one side or the other rather than being able to tighten. It was such a poor fit on our faucet and the strap so useless that we couldn't even BALANCE it on our faucet. It was also a brittle plastic and not a maleable silicone like I thought it would be. Not a fan and can't recommend.",

The strap (directly inside of the whale) is just over 2-3/4\". I don't believe a spigot measuring in excess of 7-3/4\" (total circumference) will accommodate this whale. I hope this helps to prevent anyone from making the same mistake that I did!",

Figured out though that if I tilt her head back and lean her body backwards the water will not get in her eyes. I'm sure if I used a regular bucket this would work as well. The grooves are a good feature in that it helps to spread out the water somewhat evenly as I pour it over her head. Wasn't too impressed. But I found a way to make it work so will be keeping it.",

It\u2019s so awful Such a waste of money It also does not provide any support for the baby and it very difficult to use. Don\u2019t waste your money",
