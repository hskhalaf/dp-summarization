Friends of mine, who have now gone through a few of this type, have all advised me to completely avoid running these dry. Doing so will almost certainly cause irreparable damage, quickly, eventually causing a full seize, abruptly, if used without proper lubrication.",

These gears require precise spacing to work properly and when things move around the pinion gear jumped out out of alignment and chewed up the circular gear rendering the saw inoperable. Just a poor design. The saw may be okay for a few uses but not for anything beyond that........but then again it's inexpensive so you get what you pay for.",

I have ordered, received, and purchased a warranty for other tools through Asurion and I do not know which policy goes to what, as the listing says it (not what) is insured.

      "text": "this saw is probably one of the best yard tools I\u2019ve bought, especially for that price. So far, it has saved me about 1k worth of work, compared to hiring a contractor to do the same job. Easy to use, great reach and with the right extension cord you can get anywhere in the yard. A bit too heavy so may need a couple breaks or your arms get tired from holding it. I trimmed a whole bunch of overgrown honeysuckles, some maples with lower branches and a shade tree above my pond. It is actually capable of cutting branches that 6-8 inches thick, just takes a little longer and you have reangle the cut a couple times. Great saw!",

Got a quart of Chainsaw oil at HD, and use a big flat head screwdriver on the tension screw. Like any good tool, you need to keep it maintained for long life.",
