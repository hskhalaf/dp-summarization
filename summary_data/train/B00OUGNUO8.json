Second problem is that the handlebar is too short so my last two fingers would automatically hang off rhe edge. I made a longer bar to fit my normal shoulder width because no alternatives were available. Thirdly, the rollers under the seat can easily be impeded by small particles that get on the rail if you roll over them. \"You Must Clean The Rail Every Time Before Using!!!\"",

There is a lot of misinformation out there, so read the manual that comes with the machine on how to best use it. Bottom line: If you're in the market for a rowing machine then buy this one.

In this price range you simply cannot do any better. It was well packaged and arrived safely. Simple to assemble and move around. Make sure to also get the 102\" Supermat to protect your floor. I use on a berber and it works just fine. Look no further.",

I've had other exercise equipment for which the electronics have failed and not been easily reparable. The mechanical resistance on this machine should make it more durable than that. The only electronics are those battery operated in the small display box that provides data on the workout. I should add that rowing on this machine provides a full body workout-- legs, arms, torso. I find that much better than the elliptical and treadmill I've used before, that provides little upper body exercise.",

As a couple in their early 60's who have always worked out we felt that the introduction of consistent rowing would be beneficial without the wear and tear on our joints that running on the treadmill can cause over time. The Concept2 filled the bill perfectly. We've gotten in some excellent work outs. Highly Recommend.",
