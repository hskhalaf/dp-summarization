      "text": "I spit of everything I liked about this shoe, the light weight, the stability, the minimalist styling, I was forced to return it because of an issue with the tongue and the lacing creating pressure points on the tops of my feet when they are flexed. The combination of a too thin tongue and a thin round lace vs. say, a flat lace profile and more padding, means that when these are tightened sufficient to hold my foot securely, tension is not delivered evenly enough to provide workable comfort. Unfortunately another example of Arc\u2019teryx self defeating spartanesc super light models.",

I'm a 10 regular and they fit perfectly, not too narrow. After an hour or two of wearing in the house, they felt perfectly comfortable. Went hiking the next day and they performed admirably. The trouble is, they're so sleek and good looking you don't want to get them dirty. They seem like they'd be good travel shoes. If we ever get to travel again...",
