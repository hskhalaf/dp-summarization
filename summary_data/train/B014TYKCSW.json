It's very hard to find shoes that accommodate the brace, fit my other foot, and are comfortable to walk in throughout the day. With this shoe having a removable sole/insert, I feel that this shoe is nearly customized for my brace. This shoe is stylish; thus, it's great for work or casual/fun wear. After years & years of trying on different types of shoes, what a wonderful find this was!!! Even if I didn't have MS, I would find this shoe very appealing!!!",
