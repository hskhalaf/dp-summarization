The scars are literally gone. Instead of using it once a week as instructed, I used it every other day and saw amazing results. I wish I had progress pictures, but I was so hopeless that I didn't want to bother taking a picture. If you need something to help with indented scars or acne scars overall, BUY THIS.

I've been able to break up clusters of whiteheads in a matter of weeks! Additionally, it seems to be helping my hyperpigmentation. I've noticed those spots are lighter and easier to cover!

I will say I use this every 2 or 3 days and with this needle length the benefit is your moisturizer goes deeper. Don\u2019t use chemical laden products. I use coconut oil or castor oil after my treatment and do it before bed. You shouldn\u2019t use makeup for several hours because the makeup will clog your pores.

      "text": "I LOVE this Derma Roller. I purchased it a month or so ago and use it twice a week. After I use the roller, I follow with a hyaluronic mask for 20 minutes, then spread on Vitamin C, hyaluronic acid, and retinol serums. Wow, what a difference ...in just a month's time my skin looks fantastic. The fine lines on my face have been reduced and my skin looks and feels smooth and bright. And I' ve received a ton of compliments on how great my skin looks. This is definitely a keeper!",

I clean it before using it with alcohol for sterilisation and use them on my arms and face and I can't complain. They've helped improve my overall skin texture after a couple months of using it.
