I've had Adidas socks before and never had a problem. How they came up with such a long foot section and such a skinny leg section is beyond me.

These have been washed a dozen times at least and they still have good color. They haven't started to get fuzzy either. Great product for a good price. I recommend and I will be buying again.",
