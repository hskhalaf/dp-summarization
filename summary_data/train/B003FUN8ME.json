Bought bedding from Brooklinen and they recommended using this product with their products. Decided to give it a try. I\u2019ve come back for more. From cleaning the floors to doing laundry, small amounts of this product do extraordinary things. No noxious odors, discolored clothes/fabrics, etc. A tiny amount has saved me a ton on white undershirts. Undershirts that are 5+ years old and ready for dish cloth status came out white as white can be. Brilliant product.",

First, it doesn't bleach your sheets if it gets stuck in a crack! It works so well brightening your fabrics that I've been buying it regularly. Also their detergent. I bought expensive sheets and I didn't want to use regular products on them. Also, it is scented but it doesn't bother me, and I have issues with fragrances. I really recommend this if you have clothes or sheets you cherish!!!",

One other issue - the granules are so dense that they sometimes fail to leave the detergent dispenser of my LG front loading washer. Clearly, this product needs work.",

    "description": "We love to give our laundry and home an extra boost of clean. This nontoxic, biodegradable, and fragrance-free alternative to chlorine bleach works wonders to safely remove dirt, stains, and odors. Add to the wash cycle to whiten and brighten clothes\u2014it\u2019s safe for colors and most fabrics except silk and wool. You can also use this single product to clean your entire home\u2014floors, tiles, sinks, and surfaces. Highly concentrated\u2014up to 32 washes, 64 soaks, and 128 stains. All-Purpose Bleach Alternative is our gentle, color-safe, chlorine-free oxygen bleaching system ideal for whitening and brightening both laundry items and the home. Note that any kind of chlorine alternative or oxygenated bleaching system will not work in cold water, as these products are heat activated. We don\u2019t recommend using chlorine bleach on stains or odors, ever. Not only does chlorine bleach deteriorate, degrade, and weaken fibers, it\u2019s not color-safe. In fact, it can cause whites to yellow and make certain stains (such as rust stains) even worse. Sprinkle All-Purpose Bleach Alternative on items with odors (such as pet accidents or spills). Then launder, steam, or vacuum. This product can also be used as a cleaning solution for the entire home by dissolving in hot water. Safe to combine with all our Laundry & Home Cleaning Products",
