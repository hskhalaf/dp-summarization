Onions can be chopped with only 3-4 short pulses. This is a lot better than watery-eyed chopping with a knife that could just as easily chop your fingers off, if you aren't concentrating on what you are doing. I chopped ham in it and it did marvelously. No need to worry. I know you will love this chopper, as I do.",

It does a great job chopping herbs especially, and it's great for onions, carrots, celery, etc. I haven't tried it with cooked meat (i.e., chicken). Couple drawbacks: There are grooves in the hopper that catch food -- not a big deal, but somewhat inconvenient. The cord is a little awkward to store. Doesn't work great with quite small amounts. But overall, I think this is a time saver and a fun, cool-looking little machine. Also overall quite easy to clean, despite the comment abobe about the grooves. Recommended.",

According to my friend, the chopper works great and is very easy to use. It's also very easy to clean up, and it takes very little storage space (which was important for her.) We both feel it deserves recommendation. This is a relatively simple device... not a fancy tool for multiple uses. It's designed to chop and was specifically purchased to mince onions, and it does that well.",

The cord connects to the knob, and the blade pulses when you press the bottom on the top of the knob. It's also a great size for me.

Yes it could chop soft foods just fine, but pre-cut 1\" chunks of cheese?--Forget it. After jamming in the cheese just a couple of times, the excessively loud motor failed to engage the cutter head. It is going into the trash today since it is beyond the return period. I'm amazed this cheap product is still on the market. My previous smaller Oster chopper lasted more than 20 years of regular use--mostly for cutting blocks of cheese! Obviously Oster no longer the quality brand it used to be. I'll be spending more and hopefully find something of quality--with a cheese-tested certification.",

The blade comes out so you don't have to scoop your chopped stuff out around a hole liike alot of choppers.Small footprint takes up little counter space.Just the right size for the amt of things i cho. My mini chopper was to small for 2 onions,my food processor too big. This is just right and what a great price.",

You just need to learn how to use it properly. For instance I have yet to use it by holding the activator button down for any amount of time because it WILL work too good if you do. I just use the pulse mode of tapping it several times to get just the right amount of chopping done. Always remember 'less is more!'",
