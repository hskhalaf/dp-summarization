So if you are going to be using the left ear sometimes, the battery will wear out faster than the right ear. It will be nice if they can both be connected individually so you can use any ear if you want. But using them together, they are good.",

      "text": "Had my Airpods since launch in 2016 and love them, super comfortable, great sound and never, ever fall out. Eventually though battery life is diminished after 4 years down to 1 hour. I had a look at alternatives and these came highly rated. Have to say super disappointed. Very uncomfortable to wear and although sound good sitting still I get a mechanical clicking noise I guess from seal opening and closing every step when walking. I would say the sound is good but no better than Airpods. Thank goodness Amazon have such an excellent customer service and returns policy.",

      "text": "The Sony WF-SP800N ear buds fit well into the ear, with all the range of provided accessories, although fitting both the Silicone Rubber Earbuds, and especially the Arc Supporters to the WF-SP800N was exceptionally difficult and very fiddly. The ear buds reproduce sound very well, especially the clear base notes! The Noise Cancelling function of the Sony WF-SP800N is very poor and almost non existent, even in a quiet area with only a few distant voices?? The Sony Headphone App, is a bit clunky, and not too intuitive to use!",

      "text": "Out of the box they were incredibly simple to setup. I had a bit of trial and error with getting the right combination of wing and earbud sizes as they would be fine whilst walking but would feel loose whilst running so I was adjusting constantly. After finding the right combination this is no longer an issue and I have a perfect fit now. The battery life is great and they charge quickly too. I went out for a run in the stormy British weather a few weeks back and they held up to the claim of being waterproof.",

During set-up they have a 360 degree sound function which while playing a comparison music sample improved the sound quality greatly however that's only available with Deezer (and 2 or 3 other streaming apps) but not Spotify which I use. Noise cancelling - I could still hear noise from other gym equipment especially air resistance bikes. Quality - as you'd expect from Sony a beautifully made product shame about the performance. The sound from my standard cabled iphone earphones is better!",

Not had them that long but have done 2.5 hour workouts without a bud dropping out. This is the first bud of any kind that has stayed the course. Am not a music buff so they may not be the best but using them for music and talking books they are perfect for me. They are not cheap but am VERY happy with my spend on this occasion.",

And they stay on your ears, which is a lot more that can be said for their predecessors. These are some solid headphones, wonderful bass with minimal distortion at the high volumes. Excellent mid levels too. You could spend much more and get a lot less than what these WF-SP800N have to offer.",
