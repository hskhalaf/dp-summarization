So I just threw the rest away. I LOVE my dogs and I'm sure if you're reading this you feel the same way about your dogs...so I recommend NOT buying this brand.

Choosing the largest ones from the bag, I tried them with my dogs. They loved the flavor, but didn't fully chew them up so these bites have made them throw up. Be sure it's bites you want if you order this product.",

These Best Bully sticks in the smaller bit size version are the ONLY ones she will eat. If we buy the sticks, we have to cut them into pieces with a band saw. This brand is odorless, and high quality and she chews two to three pieces per day. They last a few weeks. I highly recommend them especially for Bully breeds and chewers.",
