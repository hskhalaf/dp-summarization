      "text": "I just took 20 minutes to customize my new floor mats to my 2011 Hyundai Sonata and couldn't be happier. I spent over $100 on Weather Techs for my last car which was supposed to be laser fitted and wasn't. I can tell you I got a better fit with my box cutter and a pair of scissors for $33.00. Where I park for work is a wet, gravely parking lot, and my carpeted floor matts were getting really beat up. Now with my new matts, I have no worries about getting into my car with wet boots anymore. Highly recommended. Not very thick, but just what I needed to preserve my original floor matts.",

At least once every other trip in my vehicle I have to adjust the floor mat. So If you get this set you might want to get something to help it stay.
