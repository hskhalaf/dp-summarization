Great for movies which is what I truly bought it for while traveling. 2 small cons: wish the volume could be louder (white noise ear buds help) and the screen not reflect as much. Low stars for seller. The item was not shrink wrapped and you can't return electronics to amazon if they aren't. Would have been mad if I found this item cheaper elsewhere while waiting for it to arrive.",

Hopefully it will be taken care of with no issues. Other than that... it got here very quickly.",
