      "verdict": "The Ecco Cage Pro brings a lot to the table that delights the majority of its owners. It manages to meet the high expectations of consumers in terms of comfort, quality, and water protection. The spikeless outsole continues to astound many golfers because it provides an equally grippy attribute that is comparable to cleated trainers. The tongue and the removable insoles do not necessarily appeal to some reviewers. But, overall, this item is highly recommended.",
      "pros": [
        "Comfort is a typical adjective that many have used in describing the Cage Pro",
        "Stability is one of the stellar features of this golf shoe, according to plenty of testers",
        "It improves the weight shift on one's swing",
        "This spikeless shoe surprises a significant number of users as it delivers traction on different turf conditions",
        "The wide toe room benefits numerous consumers, including those wearing orthotics",
        "Several satisfied buyers promise that this is not the last Ecco golf shoe that they'll buy",
        "Moreover, those that switched brands have not had any regrets in doing so",
        "A lot of purchasers highlight the water protection feature as it is incredibly useful on the course",
        "Plenty of commenters have praised the brand for using quality materials on the Ecco Cage Pro",
        "Though it is quite expensive, many golf fans claim that it is value for money"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "One of the testers complains about the tongue sticking into the front of the ankle, which causes blisters",
        "Removing the insole may give a wide fit, but it also removes the cushioning that is needed to play rounds, a consumer said"

      "text": "These golf shoes are so well made. Sturdy but flexible, made using superb premium leather. They instantly feel as comfortable as your favourite slippers. Well stitched tongue adds to the waterproof performance. They are apparently discontinued (2017 vintage) but if you can find a pair I recommend you grab them while you can. Just a tip. I clicked on size 11 (UK), and noticed at check out that this had become 11.5 (Euro 46, US 12.5). I took a gamble and was very pleased I did. Despite being 11.5 on the label they are a very comfortable UK 11 - with a medium width.",

The cage design therefore sounded perfect and ECCO has a reputation for comfortable shoes. Unfortunately both my heels blistered badly and deeply - something which has not happened to me for decades and that includes doing a lot of running and long-distance hill-walking. As others have said, try before you buy and take additional precautions around the heel area e.g. heel shields/ grips. Otherwise the shoes appear as described.",
