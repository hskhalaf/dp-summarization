This option allows us to relocate the dryer to any bathroom without calling a electrician for assistance. Currently, it's installed in the guess bathroom so no one has to touch our decorative towels. Yes, I would recommend to anyone who are constantly purchasing paper towels for their bathroom. It's more cost effective to hand this machine. Most definitely recommend this product.",
