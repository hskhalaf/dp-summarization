      "text": "This stabilizer works exactly as advertised. It's very well priced for what it does. I bought this as an alternative to the Seadicam camera stabilizer and I couldn't be happier. I needed this for a video project and it does take a while to dial in but once it's set, it has no lingering pitch and straighten perfectly. The build is great and I can tell that it's machined under high quality. The base can be a little long and the counterweight spread at the base could be a little annoying, but I noticed that you can rotate it 90 degrees and then it's not a problem at all. Highly recommended. It's a great product.",

So definitely get this one unless you plan on sticking to the same camera/lens combo at all times. My only complaint is that it can be a bit hard to adjust the rod length over and over again\u2013the knob could be a bit wider so you have more leverage. But who cares, the thing works great.",

I did a video tutorial on how to balance a 7D in 15 minutes on this little guy so if anyone is interested just search YouTube for \"How To Balance A Glidecam HD-2000 & Canon 7D In 15 Minutes Or Less\".

I am using a Sony NEX-7, which is relatively lightweight. The only thing I might recommend to the vendor is making attaching weights to the top plate a little easier. I had to source nut/bolt/washer myself, but once I had added a single weight to the top, the drop time slowed down considerably and it held its position nicely. Now all I have to do is find a gear bag for it.",

Very smooth recording, a little heavy setup, not a Glidecam. Very well build, I considered to build myself, but save long trail of frustration and just buy this well engineered device. Not sure why would any DSLR owner need 4000 model, extra weight and size... 2000 does a great job!",

Compared to most steadycam rigs on which you would have to loosen the entire quick release just to balance, The glidecam cam has fine tuning dials that make it so much quicker. I had near perfect balance on this setup in around just around 10 minutes out of the box. As far as i'm concerned, it's worth every penny just because of how much time it saves you on set.",

I'm 5' 10\", average build, average strength, etc. I used this HD-2000 with my Canon 5D mark ii and a 24-105 lens and could only hold it for a few seconds before my arm and wrist started to ache. I tried smaller lenses to no avail. It's simply way to heavy to use without some kind of additional support.",

Just use stabilizer options in Adobe (and probably FCP) and you will get a result that is almost as good if not better and you will still have $500.",
