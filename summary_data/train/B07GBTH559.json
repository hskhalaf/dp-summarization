The picture quality has spoiled me. ( and I had a top of the line Sony Bravia LED before this ) Negatives: the 'smart' features and the Android OS is very poor. I use it as a dumb monitor, unconnected to the internet. I play all my content through connected Blu-ray players or Apple TV. Did I mention that the picture is spectacular?",
