Its interesting to find inner leg gathers in a cloth - like adult brief. The tabs hold snug but are easily refasten able for making for a more snug fit if it loosens. not sure how it deals with bowel episodes as I didn't have one at the time I am writing this. Also not a problem but is interesting that the inner leg gathers stick together. I found the bag marked down at good will, definitely worth their asking price.",
