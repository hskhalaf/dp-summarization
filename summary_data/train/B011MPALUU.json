We had hit a few of the Total Control Balls at the house with it, but he dented it the very first time he hit in the batting cage with it. Obviously being coach pitch, it's not like the coach was pitching very hard either. This bat just wasn't durable at all. See attached pic. The dent is on the left side and is considerably worse than I was able to capture with my camera. No umpire would allow this in a game.",
