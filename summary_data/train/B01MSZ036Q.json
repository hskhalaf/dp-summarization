Vacuum has VERY WEAK suction, all hoses are clear and unclogged and still the suction is not even enough to pick up bread crumbs from the ground. I'm very disappointed in this \"suppose to be\" high quality vacuum. I empty the canister regularly after each use, charge it after every use but still it doesn't work as should be, I always have to go over with my big Shark vacuum. It's a waste of time using it. I'll post a video shortly how weak the suction is. Not worth it, don't spend all this money for this vacuum.",

Well one- the motorized bottom portion (spinning wheel) tends to get stuck on thicker carpet- and I\u2019m talking not that thick- nothing crazy. It just seems cheaply made for the price. Also the touchless dispenser is great, but you have to really slam it down to close the latch, unless you want to touch it (defeating its purpose).",

But if you\u2019re like me and have minimal animal traffick and tight on storage and have a smaller hardwood floor it\u2019s perfect!!! I love it!!! I find myself using it to vacuum in hard to reach spots that I could never clean before. You find new ways to use it within hours of having it. 20 minute of my house cleaning was cut due to its easy waste deposite lightness of it and ready to use charging station. But wish it came in different color schemes.",

The IPhone is one of them and the Dyson vacuum is on that same elite list. Light weight. Cordless. Amazing suction. This vacuum is truly revolutionary. The only critique I would add is 30 minutes of operating time between charges is too little. The reason being, you will literally not want to stop vacuuming once you start. You will become a vacuuming addict. It's that good. It's pricey but worth every penny.",

She just loves it. It is as powerful as our old Dyson and maybe even more powerful. It mounted easily in our pantry and stays charged. It removes a surprising amount of cat hair from rugs and furniture. Dyson, you done good!",

I definitely recommend this sweeper! Another plus was I got it a lot cheaper through Amazon warehouse and they said there were imperfections but I didn't see any :) I never thought I'd think a sweeper was pretty but this one definitely is lol",
