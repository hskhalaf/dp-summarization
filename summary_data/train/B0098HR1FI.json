They said we could exchange it but wouldn\u2019t get set up and we had to take the current one (that we didn\u2019t set up) apart on our own. We just returned it and went elsewhere to purchase this same grill. We love the grill and we love that we got it at a store that helped us in person make sure it worked.",

I think it looks sharper than the open format they now have on the new model. Grilled steaks on it and came out excellent. The even-ness of the heat is what makes Weber the best value in this price-range. The only thing I would change on this model is to have the handrail be made from steel-it is now plastic. It probably is better for heat, but it is cheap looking and feeling. Other than that, rock-solid.",

I needed a smaller grill and went with this Spirit E-310. The temperature always is way to much no matter where or how I have them set. Constant flareups even with the center off. The quality is definitively cheaper materials. Came with scratched and dented parts the front knobs fall off when you use them. The price should be much lower for this quality. If you are just going to cook Hot Dogs this is the grill for you.",

Temperatures measured with a laser thermometer show extremely even coverage, and the grill was pretty easy to assemble and seems sturdy enough to hopefully hold up over time. The only thing I would change I might have gone with the slightly larger 3-burner unit from Weber (but that also would have set me back another few hundred dollars), but its been fine if I'm cooking for no more than about 5-6 people.",

Well... except the price. Even so if you think you will use grill for 8 years(this could easily last 10 with a cover) the price per year is so worth it compared to the low end market. bon appetit!",

It took my husband a couple hours to put it together. It took time to understand some of the directions. And it took another hour to cut up all the heavy cardboard it came packed in.

      "text": "I assembled this grill in about 2 hours. All the parts where simple to identify and the instructions where very clear and easy to follow. The front door was dented and warped somewhat, I called Weber be for assembling and was told that they would replace the damaged part, which arrived 4 or 5 days later. It's been very cold lately and I've only used it 3 times and so far it's been great. The first time I used it it was 38 deg outside and the grill heated up to over 400 deg within 15 minutes. The Rib Eye steaks came out fantastic. Great grill marks. I look forward to many years of great service from this grill.",

THAT having been said this was easy to put together and set up. Use was a breeze! clean up was easier too.",

My old grill that this replaced was a $199 box store model so I was pleasantly surprised to see I could actually grill meat on the porcelain coated grill and not have to put aluminum foil down first. The heat was even across the 3 burners. Cooks beautifully. What a great product!!!",
