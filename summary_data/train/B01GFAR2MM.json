Check out my entire line of Torino Pro Wave Brushes. To visit the Torino Pro store, click on the Torino Pro link above, right next to the title of this listing. \n\n Why Buy Your Wave Brushes from Brush King? \n\n Simple. \n\n You will be buying your wave brushes from a Master Wave Brush Designer and the maker of Royalty Wave Brushes. 99% of wave brush companies just slap their logo on an already existing hair brush, with no hand in the design process. I am the only one in the industry who designs his own wave brushes from start to finish, with Wavers like you in mind. \n\n While other companies settle for putting out mediocre products, the Brush King has made it a priority to give you, the customer, a different wave brush for ALL stages of waving. \n\n Have you ever felt like your old, cheap wave brush has lost its pull and you're no longer progressing? LOOK NO FURTHER! Brush King has many different offerings, from extra soft to extra hard, to give you more options; any firmness of bristle you need, Brush King has available! \n\n I have different levels of soft, different levels of medium and different levels of hard so that you get exactly what you need at ANY point in your wave journey. \n\n Buy now though! Because Brush King Wave Brushes sell fast! They might not be available tomorrow due to high demand and limited supply.",
