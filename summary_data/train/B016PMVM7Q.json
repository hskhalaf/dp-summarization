It has two legs in the back that can be pulled out to elevate your laptop, and two arms in front that are high enough to stop it from sliding, and unless dropped I can't see how either could break, and most importantly, it keeps my laptop cool while I play my games. A simple design that makes sense.",

Been running this thing on high 24/7 for almost 3 months with zero complaints. Worth the buy to save your laptop some of its life. Heat is the #1 killer of electronics.",

Within the first hour of owning it, one of the front clips that keeps it from sliding had snapped off, a day later the other side snapped off as well. There is also some type of debris in the fan area on the back fans, so when you run the back set of fans, you get a horrible noise. You can not disassemble (without breaking) this thing to retrieve whatever it is. Planning on returning this item today.",

Nothing you can do when everyone is buying from the cheapest-cost manufacturer. (I don't expect any cooling pad that costs less than $ 50 dollars to have quality fans, or to last very long.) They just won't. So this one is par for the course in that sense. As long as three of the four fans work, I will keep using this product.",

It is dim and not overpowering. That's good but it's purely for aesthetics I'm sure but it has no benefit to the overall unit. (Does look kinda cool!) And if your laptop is like mine, (Dell Insprion 15\") then it covers the entire surface anyway so most of the light cant be seen! Other than that, it's whisper quiet. Just a little fan noise can be heard when there is no other sound. Does the intended job. Just wish there was a switch to cut off the light!",

It also has a neat little stand to keep the laptop elevated... which also helps the laptop to maintain a cooler temperature.

When the fans are on, the LEDs will be on & can't be turned off. Why not? I almost gave this cooling pad 3 star because the fans are pretty decent, but poor design & materials just don't cut it for me.",

With the cooler there was NO difference at all. With the cooler, the idle temp was 1 degree cooler for a few seconds, but it was probably just a coincidence. Very disappointing. For me that\u2019s where it ends. It doesn\u2019t matter what it looks like, how many lights, or how many USB ports it has. If it can\u2019t do the job it was created to, then it\u2019s useless and I don\u2019t want it.",
