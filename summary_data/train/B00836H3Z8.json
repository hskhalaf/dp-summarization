      "text": "I used this to photograph a friend's wedding. I am very happy that I bought it. The photos came out great and the zoom range (18-135) was perfect. Not too skimpy, not too large. Just right. The lens is substantial. Does not have that \"cheap\" feeling that some other lenses (including some SONY models) have. To top it off, it was MADE in JAPAN - Bravo! I think Japanese optics are the best. I don't know if all copies of this model are made in the same factory, but mine was made in Japan. I recommend getting a 62mm UV filter to protect the front of this valuable investment.",

Will stick with the Sigma as the IQ is as good as the sony 18-135, it has more range and the auto focus is much better,faster and pretty quiet. But the 18-135 is a good lens if you don't have any thing other than a OEM 18-55",

    "description": "A-mount DT 18-135mm F3.5-5.6 SAM\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n\nDT 18-135MM F3.5-5.6 SAM ZOOM LENS\nThis lightweight lens offers the dual advantages of a very useful 18-135mm zoom range and easy portability. Featuring an outstanding optical design that includes aspheric lenses and ED glass for stellar resolution, plus an in-lens motor that maximizes autofocus performance for high-speed continuous still shooting as well as movies. Manual focus is smooth and easy as well.\n\nTECHNOLOGY\nED (EXTRA-LOW DISPERSION) GLASS\nAs focal lengths get longer, lenses built with conventional optical glass have difficulties with chromatic aberration, and as a result images suffer from lower contrast, lower color quality, and lower resolution. ED glass dramatically reduces chromatic aberration at telephoto ranges, and provides superior contrast across the entire image, even at large aperture settings. Super ED glass provides enhanced compensation for chromatic aberration.\n\nASPHERICAL LENS ELEMENTS\nAspherical lens design dramatically reduces spherical aberration while also reducing lens size and weight. Spherical aberration is a slight misalignment of the light rays projected on the image plane. This is caused by differences in refraction at different points on conventional spherical lenses which degrade image quality in large-aperture lenses. Specially shaped \u201caspherical\u201d elements near the diaphragm restore alignment of light rays at the image plane, maintaining high sharpness and contrast even at maximum aperture and can also be used at other points in the optical path to reduce distortion. Well-designed aspherical elements can reduce the total number of elements required in the lens, thus reducing overall size and weight. Advanced Aspherical (AA) elements are an evolved variant, featuring an extremely high thickness ratio between the center and periphery. AA elements are exceedingly difficult to produce, relying on the most advanced molding technology to consistently and precisely achieve the required shape and surface accuracy, resulting in significantly improved image accuracy and quality.\n\nDISTANCE ENCODER\nThe distance encoder plays an integral part in ADI flash metering, which delivers high precision flash metering that is unaffected by the reflectance of subjects or backgrounds. The distance encoder is a lens component that directly detects the position of the focusing mechanism, and sends a signal to the CPU in order to measure distance to the subject. During flash photography, this data is very useful in calculating how much flash output is appropriate to the scene.\n\nSAM (SMOOTH AUTOFOCUS MOTOR)\nRather than using the focus drive motor in the camera body, SAM lenses feature an autofocus motor built into to the lens itself that directly drives the focusing element group. Since the built-in motor directly rotates the focus mechanism, operation is significantly smoother and quieter than conventional coupled autofocus drive systems.\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\nINTERNAL FOCUSING\nOnly the middle groups of the optical system move to achieve focus, so the overall length of the lens does not change. Other important benefits include fast autofocusing and a short minimum focusing distance. Also, the filter thread at the front of the lens does not rotate, which is convenient if you\u2019re using a polarizing filter.\n\n\n2012 Sony Electronics, Inc. All rights reserved.
