I am going to contact Logitech support to see if there are some settings that I need to change, but my current mouse (though worn down) works perfectly so it is not my computer or usb hub that's the problem.

The problem with the 525 mouse it that many sections of it are made of shinny plastic...VERY difficult to see in the illustrations for this product on Amazon. My previous mouse had a mat finish and felt good in the hand. The shinny plastic on this mouse shows every fingerprint and smudge on top and bottom. Sometimes it sticks to your skin when your hand sweats caused by the slick surface. I'm going to try it one more day or two but will probably return it for something with a matte surface.",

This mouse is not comfortable enough in the compact category as it is a little too tall for that. And, as other reviewers mentioned the mouse wheel is free flowing so the mouse is useless for gaming. I am in the market for a true compact mouse with a lower profile, so I swapped this with my office mouse, which is infinitely more effective for gaming. I wouldn't purchase this again, and I will probably buy another mouse better suited to my needs.",

Plus moving it is more silent than other mice I've used (I don't use a mouse pad). Only problem is with the click, it's satisfying for awhile but is too noticeable in a quiet room.

It only uses one at a time so when the first one is depleted the second one kicks in and you don't have to change batteries for a very long time.

I've owned other models of Logitech wireless mouse that didn't have this issue, so I may just have one that seems more perceptible to me, due to my medical issues, but it's something that I take note of every time I use it.

I liked the size and features, however, so I went with the same model from Logitech. I wanted to take advantage of the universal USB receiver for both the mouse and keyboard so I didn't use another USB slot, and the pairing of the new mouse was easy once I installed the \"Logitech Unifying Software\".",

What I didn't realize was that the shape of the mouse has either been changed or they don't sell that model anymore. The shape of this mouse is very uncomfortable and the buttons are stiff even after clicking them for a while, they haven't loosen up much at all.",

But my favorite? the receiver (the part that plugs into your computer) actually has a spot to store w/in this mouse. So when I am not traveling, I put the receiver back in this mouse, store in my suitcase until the next time. It's really very clever. And the battery life is terrific. So I highly recommend this! (And b/c I travel w/ it, it's been through being dropped, hit, etc. It travels great!!)",
