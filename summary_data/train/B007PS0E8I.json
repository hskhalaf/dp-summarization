      "text": "We bought this to add some storage to our front porch, with the idea that we can use it as needed indoors. I assembled it solo (strong enough mid-size, 30-something woman) without much bother. Took about 15 minutes, but that was just because I put the wrong wheels on two legs first (my mistake). The deep sides mean that it can store some rolling items (like my kid\u2019s play items - soccer balls, digging tools, etc.), while it also displays party drinks in a stylish manner. It has some small imperfections \u2014 like a commercial-type item, so people who needs items to shine forever may take issue with that. For my family, it works perfectly.",
