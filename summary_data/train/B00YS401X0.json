If you are in the market for a standard use bench vise, this thing is fantastic. Pull the trigger and buy immediately.",

In less than a minute this is an awesome light duty vice.",

I needed a cheap vise for rare / occasional use and settled on this rather quickly as it was fully 1/2 the price of what I was gonna buy at Tractor Supply. I expected for the price that the design and ergonomics would be flawed upside down and backwards but ... NO. It works well, is easy enough to use, is functional, and thus far durable. There are a couple of design changes I'd make but ... if you're shopping for a vise at this price level, you really shouldn't care. A little less girth than others in this size range but, again, at this price who cares?",
