It is a huge advantage as there are plenty of things that require two fit balls. The exercise manual is pretty basic, but I found it beneficial, as the more detailed manuals are often not clear as this one is. The pump is very effective (my 8 years old daughter inflated the large ball), and capable of fully inflate the large ball within few minutes). Overall, for this price, this is a steal.",

If I had an automatic pump, it wouldn't be an issue. Nonetheless, the balls are OK.. not worth the price tag. Lesson learned to just go back to TJMaxx/Marshalls/Ross for a less of a cost and work to get the product.",

The pump is not very good and the method of pumping the air into the ball doesn\u2019t allow the cap or plug to be placed quick enough or well enough to contain the air. The ball always seems only partially filled with air and therefore doesn\u2019t seem very stable. The balls seem flatter than they should be. The quality of the balls aren\u2019t that bad but the fact that they don\u2019t keep the air sufficiently inside when inflating, makes these balls unfit for proper ball usage.",

The band I've used briefly, and is the quality you'd expect of a thin, cheap resistance band. Would purchase again. Price has increased but is still a good deal!",
