      "text": "I bought a Bosch 12v drill about 8 years ago which has been an essential home tool. I saw this item, and was astounded to see that the 12v configuration of the battery was unchanged and bought it. It works great. I am not a building professional. I use these devices for around the house projects. It drives 3.5 inch screws without problem into pressure treated lumber repeatedly, and the battery life is more than adequate. I now have 4 batteries for my 2 Bosch drill drivers and am ready for anything!",

I've replaced a drill with this and for light duty nut driving and screw driving into and out of pinball playfields, it's saved my back and shoulders the pain of much heavier, higher voltage units and works just as fast. It also strips out far fewer holes in wood when driving in, compared to a drill. I use it almost exclusive on the low setting. I've also had it for a couple months and it's still got 50% charge on the first full charge I gave it, so battery life is fantastic. Belt clip is great too and its so light it doesn't weight the pants down. Can't say enough good things about this unit.",

      "text": "Very useful tool that does so much right, from installing or removing deck screws without snapping them to driving 3/8\" lag bolts/screws into soft wood. It's compact size and weight make it a pleasure to use on a long day. However, know that its competitor (e.g., Milwaukee 2453-20 or 2454-20) has more torque, which can be very useful in certain circumstances. For instance, this Bosch will not drive 1/2\" lags (yes, we did drill the prescribed 5/16\" pilot hole) into soft wood. If you can live with the PS42's 975 inch-pounds of torque as opposed to the competitor's 1200 or 1400 inch-pounds, then go for it.",

      "text": "A great, lightweight little impact driver. I'm a woodworking hobbyist and a DIYer. It has more than enough power to deal with running screws into hardwoods and its compact enough to fit into tight spaces (cabinets, drawers, etc.). If you're dealing with something that needs to be lightly driven, the low setting is delicate enough to run it through without destroying the screw. The ergonomics could be improved upon, the atypical barrel battery grip could use more of a contour on the back where your thumb and index finger connect on the palm. Though, how it's currently designed is not a deal breaker. If you don't need the power of an 18V/20V system, I'd recommend this 12V.",

This driver is more compact than the last one I had, which was a PS 41, which has brushes in the motor. The torque seems better than the previous model mentioned, too. Batteries charge quickly, and I like the light staying on for a few moments even after you let off the trigger! This driver is just the right size to get into tight areas that I work on every day building various standby generators & power units! A lot of torque for a 12v impact.",
