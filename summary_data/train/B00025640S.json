The other night we had 25 painted turtles. When they see us walking to the dock they start swimming in. It's nice to know that we are feeding them with something that's good for them. I've tried many other turtle food products. This in by far the most popular with our little friends.",

He now looks for me to come out and feed him. It took exactly one feeding for this wild turtle to decide that floating turtle food is a good thing. He eats every bite of it and seems pretty happy.",

The stick are not to big, it can be broken in half and they do after a bit of floating in the water tend to soften up. After a bit of having them floating about try your best to scoop them up since they do tend to create a mess in the tank since the sticks tend to break apart with being untouched by the turtle.",

Since it it resealable, I do not have to worry about spoilage. I would definitely recommend purchasing this product if you have one (or more) red ear slider turtles.",

I have had a really hard time getting him to eat anything other than dried shrimp and insects and worried about him getting enough nutrition. We have tried lots of different turtle foods and even fish foods. But he loved this food right out of the package - it has a softer texture than the other turtle foods we have tried but doesn't disintegrate in the water. It is also in small enough pieces that he can easily eat it even though he is only 1 1/2 inches long.",

This is one of the best foods to feed your turtle and I have never met a turtle who will not eat it. It is such a better deal than pet stores or even big chain stores. I will be buying another bag very soon as the bag I bought well over 4 months ago is getting low.",
