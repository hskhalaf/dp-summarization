I'm tired of all the hustle this piece of trash have caused. This is not the only product of this brand that have failed. I'm disappointed with Olympus.",

I would have bought and may still buy the newer version That I can take down to over 50 feet and has a lot more bells and whistles!!!!!!!!! Its also an Olympus. It was to come on line I believe 6/6/2014 ,but it was also $100 more. I didn't have the time to wait. For the price this camera preformed well. the only draw back was how much more I could have gotten if I had spent $100. more and had the time to wait for the newer model.",

Downside is that if you're taking video the device will not re-calculate exposure. Not idea when moving from sunny shots to darker conditions. The speed of the shutter (in sport mode) and the very quick zoom make up for the video issue. Better than the 860 in my mind.",

Got this to replace the Pentax optio wg-2 that got flooded due to a cleaning oversight on my part. Like the fact that there is only one access panel to worry about. Also the battery is interchangeable with my old optio and a Sony cybershot that I used to have. What would make this camera the perfect one would be to add infrared features to it so it can be used in the dark during my nighttime sea turtle rescues.",

Mine is not even 6 months old and they want me to buy another. Why would I buy new if I know how they handle their warranty and recall claims. Buy another brand look st Nikon or Canon. They have some of the top rated heavy duty point and shoot cameras.",

Thank goodness we had a backup camera (Canon). Now waiting for Olympus to tell us what to do as their webpage does not yet include support information the TG-850.

    "description": "Color:Black| Style:BaseA secluded beach. A trip to the zoo. The kids trying out new snowboards. Active lifestyles generate great photo ops - and there\"s no better camera for capturing these special moments than the new TG-850. It\"s super-rugged and waterproof, yet stylish enough for less \"extreme\" pursuits - like documenting your daughter\"s first lacrosse goal. The TG-850 has a super-sharp wide-angle lens, a 180-degree swivel LCD monitor (selfie alert!) and high-def video capability. Quite simply, it\"s a terrific all-around camera.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\n\nA WHOLE NEW ANGLE ON TOUGH.\nA secluded beach. A trip to the zoo. The kids trying out new snowboards. Active lifestyles generate great photo ops \u2013 and there\u2019s no better camera for capturing these special moments than the new TG-850. It\u2019s super-rugged and waterproof, yet stylish enough for less \u201cextreme\u201d pursuits \u2013 like documenting your daughter\u2019s first lacrosse goal. The TG-850 has a super-sharp wide-angle lens, a 180-degree swivel LCD monitor (selfie alert!) and high-def video capability. Quite simply, it\u2019s a terrific all-around camera.\n\nWaterproof, Shockproof, Crushproof, Freezeproof* \u2013 Let\u2019s Just Say It\u2019s \u201cLifeproof\u201d\nConditions can be a little rough when you live life outside. That\u2019s why we engineered the TG-850 to be a very tough outdoor camera. Waterproof (to 33ft/10m), shockproof (to 7ft/2.1m), crushproof (to 220lbf/100kgf) and freezeproof (to 14\u00b0F/-10\u00b0C), the TG-850 is built to operate flawlessly in extreme conditions \u2013 which means you won\u2019t have to worry about a little rain during a bike ride in the local park.\n\n*When flip LCD is closed\n\n\nThe World\u2019s First Rugged Camera with a Swivel LCD\nA tilting LCD monitor makes it much easier to do things like taking shots from strange angles. But a 180-degree swivel monitor on a waterproof camera like the TG-850 also lets you shoot cool half-in-the-water shots of fish swimming by under a bright blue sky, or your goofy friend Mark pretending to be a fish. It also makes taking really good selfies a snap; in fact, if you mount it on your surfboard or mountain bike, you can find out what your \u201caction face\u201d looks like!\n\nThe Widest Lens of Any Rugged Camera\nThe TG-850\u2019s super-wide 21mm (equivalent) lens captures 25% more of whatever you\u2019re shooting than the 28mm versions on other rugged cameras. Your images will be more panoramic, and you don\u2019t have to move backward to capture more of the scene \u2013 particularly useful when you\u2019re standing on a cliff! You can also fit more friends into the selfies and group shots you\u2019ll undoubtedly be taking to preserve the memories of your outdoor adventures.\n\nOn Top of Everything Else\u2026Pro-quality Video\nMountable video cameras are great for, well, video \u2013 but they\u2019re limited when it comes to still photography. The TG-850, on the other hand, offers the wide-ranging functionality of a robust digital camera and the ability to shoot full HD 60p video, twice as fast as standard 1080/30p. You get professional quality footage with amazing clarity that smoothly plays back fast action \u2013 and you can apply many of the same Art Filters found on Olympus\u2019s more expensive cameras to achieve unusual effects.\n\nCapture a Series of Photos with Timed Interval Shooting\nVideos are obviously a great way to capture live action. But sometimes you want a series of dramatic stills instead. The TG-850\u2019s interval shooting feature allows you to do just that. Shorter intervals are great for capturing each step of an action sequence, or you can set the camera for longer intervals and stitch the images together into a time-lapse movie (software required). You can even mount the camera on your bike or helmet for hands-free convenience.\n\nExpress Your Creativity with Art Filters\nIn case the unadulterated beauty of the great outdoors isn\u2019t enough for you, the TG-850 offers an unmatched array of creative tools to enhance your photos and videos. Art Filters like Grainy Film, Pin Hole and Soft Focus can be applied right in the camera; no need to download your images to a computer for manipulation. You can also experiment with fun Magic Filters like Fisheye, Sparkle and Reflection, and Picture Filters \u2013 including Vivid, Muted and Monotone \u2013 that modify color saturation.\n\nOlympus iHS Technology \u2013 Faster and Smarter\nCombine a newly developed, powerful DSLR-quality image processor (TruePic\u2122 VII) and a best-in-class BSI CMOS sensor, and you\u2019ve got a camera that provides blazing fast autofocus, superb low-light performance and accurate subject and scene recognition (thanks to the enhanced iAUTO feature). It adds up to iHS \u2013 Intelligent, High Sensitivity, High Speed \u2013 and the TG-850 has it, offering dramatically improved image quality from a camera you can take to the ends of the earth \u2013 or to the pool party down the street.\n\nKeep It Sharp with Dual Image Stabilization\nMaybe your target \u2013 say, your friend Rachel trying out her new kayak \u2013 is flashing in and out of frame as she navigates the rapids. Maybe your hands are a little shaky after a sleepless night at the campsite. No worries\u2026the TG-850\u2019s sensor-shift image stabilization system, high ISO sensitivity and blink-of-an-eye shutter speeds work together seamlessly, enabling you to capture crisp, clear images even if the subject (or your camera) are moving.",
