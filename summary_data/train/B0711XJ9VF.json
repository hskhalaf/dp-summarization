Long-distance and decent battery life. My kids participate in a weekly forest school and the group of kids likes to go hiking on their own at times. Now I\u2019ve learned to pack an extra set of batteries so if anything should happen they will be able to get help. The range has been great. Where we usually hike has a lot of hills. If we go too far down we may experience more static but can hear somewhat the other person is saying.",
