      "text": "I bought the small one for my dog's kennel when he was a puppy. As he got bigger... I tried other beds & he chewed up all of them. So I took this small midwest quiet time bed and left it out for him & he would lay half his body on it. He's a 100 lb golden retriever. Very big dog. So I went on Amazon and saw that they made large versions of this bed & bought it for him. At first he was only using half the bed.. probably out of habit, then he realized he could fit his entire body on it. Excellent bed!",

So glad we got her something comfy she can call her own while she heals.",

I was buying a second one for another crate and noticed this. So the next night I turned it in his crate. Then I heard all kind of movement and growling from the crate. He was trying his hardest to flip it over! Needles to say we are fleece side up again. I have washed it many many times and it still looks great!",

Other than the bad seams I did like the mat, but might as well go back to the cheaper ones that lasts longer.",

Still think I would cut them off. Washed and dried well, too. Great bed!",
