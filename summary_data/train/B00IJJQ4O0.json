The base still will not tighten and I can't even confirm if I'm putting together correctly because the instructions are not clear at all. It's very wobbly and unsafe. Also the shades do not spread apart too much. Very little. Image has more space between but it's not like that on mine nor can I adjust too much. I am keeping it only because I don't want to deal with another return. Way better in the image. I would not recommend.",

That's over 3,000 lumens with all three lamps on, depending on the bulbs you choose. And you can turn the switch to get one, two, or all three lights on. Very happy with this purchase.",

I've moved it two times (within the room). I've always had to have it leaning on a piece of furnature to support it. Today I got fed up and tried to take it apart to tighten all the screws again going it would support itself better. Only to find that now the middle joint is stripped. So yet another area in which it won't support itself. This lamp has been a nightmare from day one.",

      "text": "The lamp is very pretty and bright and the price is good. The packaging it came in was odd because the contents were in a box within a box within a box. There were at least three boxes to open. With lots of loose styrofoam balls. The base had a dent in it and the inside of the metal rods were rusted, like the product has been sitting in a warehouse for years. Regardless, it is a pretty lamp and it is sturdy. For the price, I can't complain.",

That being said, with my wife's help we were able to get the lamp assembled. Now that it is, it is indeed an attractive addition to our living room. We outfitted it with a three-pack of 5W (300-lumen) warm-white LED bulbs that I also found on Amazon, and it's become a great, power-sipping light source.",
