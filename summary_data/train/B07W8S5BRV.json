Because of that, they weren't comfortable and although these don't fall out, they do move around in your ears quite a bit which affects sound quality. Battery life is decent but drains quickly when you aren't using them. And for the price, it really should have noise cancelling. Perhaps I'll get their next version depending on the features/comfort.",

      "text": "The product works great but I do have an issue when I attach it to a Kindle. I have to go through several steps to connect the Powerbeats to the Kindle each time I want to use them, when previous non-Apple earbuds connected immediately every time. I think the problem relates to the fact that they only attach to one device at a time. The Powerbeats attach to Apple devises immediately and with ease.",

You will see the green oxidation over time as the outer metal coating wears off. Another peeve I have with this charger is the charger-side metal contacts are really short. It makes it hard to make good contact with the earbuds. I had to go to Apple support to get a replacement. They asked for $350 of deposit upfront as a collateral. I paid $200 for the original product so this doesn\u2019t make sense Apple.",
