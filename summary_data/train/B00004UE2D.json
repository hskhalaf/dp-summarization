I was pleasantly surprised after tuning it to find such nice tones. Most classical guitars in that price range are 3/4 size and not the best sounding. I think to get something better would be an upgrade of several hundred dollars. Highly recommended.",

      "text": "Out of the box the action was pretty.high on the guitar I received. I didn't measure but the height at the 12th fret seemed like it was practically twice as high as at the neck. $25 later my local guitar repairman had filed down the saddle to bring the action to a much more playable height. Still an overall great value: I love the tone and the neck feels quite nice to the hand, but given all of the reviews mentioning the low action, I think I may have developed unreasonable expectations for what it would be out of the box. For the process, I'd still definitely recommend it.",

Real wood fulfilled its promise of tone improvement over time, A little thought about setup will pay you back. I lowered the strings to improve the action. Considering that this guitar is virtually free, actually undervalued, you get far more than you pay for. This homely guitar will grow in your affections. Shipping was fast, a plus.",

You\u2019ll want to get a few packs of strings.. these will last a week tops if your a daily player.
