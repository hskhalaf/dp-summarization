      "text": "The full set deal is fantastic compared to other sets. The shaft is perfect in steel, lighter steel shaft so you still feel the nice weight of the iron heads. The irons are really nice. Good looking sleek design and forgiving. I love that they are not overly strong degrees on them, and just handy to have the degrees on the clubs next to the iron number. The grooves are nothing special my shots are not stopping on the greens any faster than my old cobra irons, looks cool, but nothing really to it. Great turf interaction, even when I hit it fat it gets through the ground easier. Love these irons.",

      "title": "Solid iron set",
      "text": "These irons have a \"hot spot\" which cause the ball to go 10 yds further than normal shots. The spin produced is also lower than most irons, so they run out more. On the plus side, they are quite forgiving, do not induce hook or slice spin too much, and are relatively easy to hit. The offset each iron has is low, so if you are a slicer, don't look for help from these clubs. If you draw or hook like me, they fly quite true and help. That all said, these irons play quite well after you adjust for their run out.",
