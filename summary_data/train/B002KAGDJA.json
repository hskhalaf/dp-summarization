Because it doesnt come with stakes or anything to connect it to the ground it does pose a little bit of a tripping hazard so I wouldnt say that this is for the beginners. The point of this ladder is to help with speed and agility but in my opinion you have to have some kind of foot work skills already before you start using this product. My fiancee is an ex-college foot ball player and though he trips up sometime using this product he has great recovery reflexes that help keep him from hitting the ground or injurying himself.",

Not good for timing so I taped the last rungs of the ladder together on top of each other creating a slightly shorter ladder but evenly spaced. Seems to work well .
