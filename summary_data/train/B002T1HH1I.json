I\u2019m supper disappointed as I love the look of this crib. But I can\u2019t say that this crib is safe.",

I had my doubts about this crib because of some of the comments here but decided to give it a try since I love its classic design and the affordable price point. I am so glad I went for it. We have had this crib for about 6 months it\u2019s held up. The assembly wasn\u2019t easy but also not as terrible as some have described in other comments. For reference our toddler is now 18 months about 32 in long and 25 lbs",

Plus, unlike a lot of other cribs and some of the other colors offered, this crib in green came with the toddler rail included! It also fits the tropical/ jungle theme of our nursery.",

It took me and my wife around 30 minutes total to unpack and fully assemble. The crib seems sturdy when assembled. I do advise you to be careful when fully tightening the bolts because you might risk cracking the wood.",

The crib seems to be very good quality and it is obviously made of real wood. It is incredibly sturdy when put together. As other reviewers suggested, we left off the casters for now as we don't need to be rolling the crib anywhere. Very pleased with this purchase. Can't beat the price.",
