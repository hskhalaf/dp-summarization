I understand the letters have to snap in tightly so that when you close it up, they stay in place, but my almost 2yo constantly likes putting them in and taking them out, which means it's not a toy they can play with by themselves yet. The letter \"Q\" is the most difficult to snap in and take out! Also, when you close up the briefcase, it's even hard for me to open it back up. I also wish the entire thing was about 25% smaller. It is much too big to be played with on a 2yo's lap.",

Shouting the letter and the picture of the slot \"A is for abby!\" As he popped the letter in the slot. Now he is obsessed with \"M\" and \"W\". Then he hides the letters in random spots around the living room. A few of them have gone missing because of this. Any way. This is by far his favorite birthday gift. He wakes up talking about \"playing letters\" and \"needs to find m and w\" It's a really fun alphabet game",

One of the songs that she watches is the Sesame Street Alphabet, and although this toy isn't a perfect match to the song, it's close enough that I could sing the song, with a few modifications, while we did this puzzle. My daughter, who is not even 2, can complete this puzzle by herself now, and was recently given a different alphabet puzzle, which she immediately completed independently, as well. So, surprisingly awesome toy!",

We've had it over a month now and he still plays with it daily. At first the letters were a bit difficult for him to take out on his own but after showing him where the notches are he's able to take them out by himself with no problems. You do have to make sure the letters are all pushed in before closing it up, otherwise they fall and you can't close it. We would definitely recommend this product.",
