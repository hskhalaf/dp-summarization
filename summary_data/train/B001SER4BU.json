Out of the box it was so intuitive to use that I hardly looked at the manual. I took tons of pictures and they all came out great. There was a bad review here by someone who said there was a problem with \"battery charging\" all the time, however I noticed it once and that was it, and even then it was for just a couple of seconds. If you want an easy camera that does alot (the movies were great on this little guy) then this is the ticket.",

Very detailed pictures with great quality when I really take my time and all conditions are good. I'm anxious to spend more time learning all the things it can do. Would be nice if it was a little more compact. Also, when you take a picture it only stays in view about 2 seconds before the screen goes blank. It would be nice to have a longer time to take a look at your shot without having to go into review.",

It just has a very short battery life and you cant leave batteries in it when its turned off.",

Picture quality is as good as any I have seen. It is fun to get her perspective of life through photos. I have a older camera, and hers is probably better than mine, plus it was $200 bucks cheaper. I don't think you will find a better deal. I have no negative comments for this camera. It is really small, will easily fit in an adults pocket. If you would like your kid to capture moments in their life this is the one. It's just a complete bargain.",

It still works but sometimes I have to manually assist the lens open and close. Ridiculous. I treated this camera, like I do my other electronics, well. It goes into a case when it's not being used.

The only things I'm not crazy about are the lack of an internal rechargeable battery and the mediocre quality of the images.",

Response time is however slow as it takes many seconds to recharge the flash and be ready for the next shot. There is no view finder other than the LCD screen. However, back to my previous point, this is a basic low-budget camera so you would need to manage your expectations. You get great pictures, easy of use, and not a lot of bells and whistles.",

Buy a set of rechargeables ( I would say that about any of these types of cameras- they are all battery suckers due to the big video display) Zoom is acceptable until the digital kicks in then it starts to look like a cell phone photo.

But I was disappointed with the time it takes to charge the flash specially during night scene, you miss out on candid moments while you wait on the flash. This is my only inconvenience. Your 2AA Batteries can last up to 650pics. Rechargeable batteries are recommended. It is a bargain price for the quality of the pictures.",

And the battery life is poor -- at least compared to other cameras I've had. I'm sending this one back.",
