The bulbs have a brighter appearance than the regular incandescent candelabra bulbs but I see this as a positive feature. The only downside is my chandelier and Lutron CFL dimmer are not totally compatible with the bulbs. To be fair, the chandelier is 14 years old and not designed for LED bulbs. With a five-bulb chandelier, four of the LED bulbs worked perfectly. However, I had to insert one incandescent bulb in order to activate the off switch. Otherwise, the chandelier would not turn off.",

      "text": "I was concerned about LOHAS note saying I might need a new dimmer switch, but my old original house dimmer switch (1974) worked fine with these light bulbs. They give off better light & dim just fine down to about 20% with my old light switch before switching off. The bulbs are a little bit bigger than regular bulbs but fit my light assembly. I will be buying 3 more for my hallway Candelabra. I will put 2 bulbs in each light assembly.",

I had considered competitors with aluminum fins that would probably keep them much cooler but considering everything, and price, these LED's are great. Besides, the dimming performance is very good and at slightly reduced brightness that we usually use, the heat is greatly reduced to simply being slightly warm, maybe 100 degrees F.",

      "text": "Very impressed with these bulbs thus far. The bulbs came well packaged and their price is competitive compared to more expensive LED bulbs. I installed these in a Hunter ceiling fan on a dimmer switch. These are dimmable and don't flicker or buzz like cheaper bulbs do. I didn't have any issues with installation - I expect to get good life from them and save some money on my energy bill. Only time will tell how long they last.",

This is better than compact fluorescent lights that take awhile to reach full brightness.
