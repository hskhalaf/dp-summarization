They are large, have an odd coating and smells toxic. I'm hoping they are safe but I'm doubtful. My toddler was present when I opened so of course was in love and immediately took to them and we used for bath time. They are okay in the water, look enough like the characters and do squirt water but I can't get over the already opened package, waxy/greasy coating and awful chemical smell. I would not recommend.",
