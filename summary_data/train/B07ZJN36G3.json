I ordered the XL size (men's 9-13), but I had to really stretch them to get over a men's size 10 Sorel snow boot. They just stretched far enough to get the rear spikes properly under the heel where my weight presses down. With a larger snow boot size it could be a challenge to position the spikes. Would buy again, though knowing the size restrictions. Remember not to walk on wood or recycled plastic decking as the spikes will scratch them.",
