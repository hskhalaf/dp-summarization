There doesn't appear to be any damage to it at all, but people can't hear me all of a sudden when I'm using it even though I can hear them. I'm very disappointed because before that this had been a total game-changer for me, especially since it was reasonably priced and lightweight. I haven't even had it for more than a couple months or so. :( Guess I'll have to buy a new one from a more expensive brand that had more positive reviews. I was looking forward to giving this one a boost for being so great until this happened, unfortunately.",

These things break on a yearly basis and the customer service people will always give you a worse headset than what you paid for. It has a few cool things like a mute button and comfortable mic placement, but spending $60 on a headset 6 times because it kept breaking can buy you a good quality headset instead. I've been using the HyperXCloud for about a 18 months now and the damn thing still functions. What a concept.",

Which has been a nightmare when I need to press it quickly to mute, sometimes it works and sometimes not. Now people have been having a hard time hearing me and all of a sudden my sound cuts out and they can't hear me at all, I've been calling my clients from my cell phone. Very embarrassing.

My second issue is that the mic unmutes itself without my knowledge. I thought it was user error (that I was just brushing against it). But I've been paying attention for a week now. Sometimes on long meetings it just unmutes without my knowledge. Not cool.",

      "text": "Pretty poor quality. I\u2019ve owned it for 3-4 months now with only once a week usage & am very disappointed in the quality. Volume button needs to be clipped to you at all times to avoid accidentally muting the phone when talking to somebody or turning the volume down all the way so you can\u2019t hear the other person. The cord between the headset & volume itself is weak & brittle. Even with clipping the volume button to your shirt the cord constantly intertwines itself and tangles which makes it weaker and causes sound problems for people you\u2019re talking to. Would recommend searching other options.",

The Mic is easily adjusted to the right position, and doesn't pick up much sound from in front of me. And they are comfortable to wear for long periods of time. In addition, every computer knows what they are without my having to download drivers manually. Just plug it in and it works.",

The new Logitech H390 proved that the sound was not going through my ears from the ear pieces, into the hollow cavity between my ears, and out my constantly gaping mouth into the mic.",

After researching on the web and then coming back to Amazon to look at the reviews again, there is a definite microphone issue with this headset. There are many complaints about the microphone. Now I am adding my negative review also. There is a general issue with the microphone and looking at the reviews the manufacture is not doing anything about it.",
