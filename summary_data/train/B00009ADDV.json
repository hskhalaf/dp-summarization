This is absolutely perfect and sturdy. Well made. Not too casual for a fancy dinner and not too formal for everyday. As a bonus they match my mirror finish bodem. Just save yourself the searching and get these.",

No issues with it at all. The only thing that would be better is if the creamer had some kind of lid. I knew it didn't when I bought the set. The weight of this is good. I've even placed the creamer on the stove burner to take the chill off the cream and had no problems/discoloration. I am happy with this purchase.",

So the drip coffee maker, K-cup machine and espresso machine moved, along with a mic for reheating went to the bar. Great idea. But we had no good looking sugar and creamer that fit with the stainless/black look. The sugar and creamer, plus the matching tray that is sold separately, fit the bill nicely. We have a western look in our home, but I love the sparkle of the Frieling set. The design is simple and elegant.",
