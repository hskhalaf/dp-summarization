I would charge the product for hours on end, yet the device would never turn on. I contacted Jabra Support, and a replacement pair was sent to me. After two months with the new pair, I had the same problem of the headphones not holding a charge. I contacted Jabra support for a second time, and a second replacement pair was sent to me. This pair lasted me another 2-3 months until the product died again. This product clearly has some repeated faults, and the supplier was supportive by providing replacements. I gave it 1-star due to its reliability.",

They do not seem to be consistent monitoring heart rate. They also block out all noise. I had a motorcycle approach from behind and never heard it. If I run on the street I only wear the one ear. While they do have great sound quality if in the gym, they are a hazard running in traffic and the HRM is not worth the extra money.",
