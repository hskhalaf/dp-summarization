This is super easy to hook up, however, tweaking the settings to make your pictures look great (I/e not balanced and dark) is tricky at best. I spent two hours fussing with it and still couldn't get as good of results as I wanted. I've bought refill paper/ink and every time the ink runs out before the paper does. This ends up being about the same cost per print as taking film to Costco or Wal-mart, the convenience of having it available and in home is great... it's just not super user friendly.",

It's great that we can just print photos for friends and family right after any event. I highly recommend this and the Canon ink and paper value packs.",

Even worse, it only allows you to plug in proprietary devices: Try to plug your USB storage device or any non-Canon device into it and it tells you it's incompatible.

      "text": "I ordered and paid for a Canon SELPHY DS810 Photo Printer through Ritz Camera and received the usual multiple emails thankin me for my order, informing me that my printer \"has been shipped,\" and then \"your order has been cancelled\" because the item was no longer available. Hmmm... So which is it? Has the item been shipped, or has the order been cancelled. I don't know if this is a function of Amazon.com or of Ritz Camera, but I do know I won't believe it when they say an item is \"in stock\" or \"had been shipped.\" Lies, all lies.",

    "description": "Canon Selphy 810 4X6 Print\n\nAMAZON.COM\nDigital cameras and mobile phones have changed the rules about taking photos. Now, the SELPHY DS810 Compact Photo Printer changes everything about how and where to print them. It's only about 9\" x 9\" x 4,\" much smaller than typical printers. It doesn't have to be connected to your computer, so you can keep it in almost any room and print beautiful photos from there. It features Canon Full-photolithography Inkjet Nozzle Engineering (FINE), which uses an innovative print head with nozzles that eject consistent, precise ink droplets as small as two picoliters. This patented technology produces an outstanding resolution of up to 4,800 x 1,200 dpi, for exceptional detail and photo realism. You won't have to wait long; it can print a beautiful photo lab quality 4\" x 6\" photograph in about 63 seconds--directly from your PictBridge enabled camera. \n\n So, you have family and friends over, and everybody's taking pictures, even with their mobile phones. Why wait until tomorrow--or next week--to see everyone's images? Just put this user-friendly printer in a central place in your den or living room. Its built-in card slots let anyone print from their compatible memory cards, or they can print directly from their PictBridge compatible digital camera or DV camcorder. You and your guests can even print photos from an infrared-enabled mobile phone: just shoot, point your phone and print! Plus, using the large, built-in 2.5\" LCD color viewer and control panel you can fine tune your images before printing, for better results. With its small size and easy connectivity, the SELPHY DS810 Compact Photo Printer is the new way to view, print and share your photos. \n\n The Canon ChromaLife100 system combines the Selphy DS810 Compact Photo Printer's FINE print head technology and newly developed inks with select Canon photo papers, with results rivaling that of many conventional photos. These beautiful photos will also last up to 100 years when stored in an archival quality photo album. \n\n What's in the Box:\nSELPHY DS810 Compact Photo Printer, FINE cartridges: BCI-16CL color, power cord, document kit",
