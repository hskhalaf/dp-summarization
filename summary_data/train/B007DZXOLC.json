      "text": "This is fantastic! My husband used this recently on a river tubing trip and it fit the cooler better than the ones they had there. The mesh is very strong and held up better than the actual rafts themselves. I originally bought this for our dog to be able to hang with us while we are in the pool or tubing. She is usually afraid of things like this, but after a bit of coaxing (and a lot of treats) she got in herself. This also has 4 cup holders!",

Haven't tested it in rougher water. It does exactly what i need it to and everyone was very impressed. The only drawback is the air input/output is huge, you can't just blow this up with your mouth. So if you don't have a pump with a large opening, then you will have a hard time. I think a simple valve that you can blow up with your mouth would suffice as it doesn't take a lot of air!",

We strapped a waterproof speaker to it and a trash bag and was set for the river. Never tipped, never ripped, stayed filled with air more then our tubes did. Kept the beers and flasks cold till the end (5hr float ride), and had ice to spare. For the price you can't beat this deal, plus it is super easy to blow up and seal the air hole.",

      "text": "This worked perfectly...not tippy at all! We happened to have that size cooler in the house so it was a no brainer to purchase. We floated down a natural spring in Florida with it and it was perfect. Tied it up to our tubes and off we went. What I like is that it's not as big as others out there on the market. Don't worry about the size...it's perfect and the cup holders are nice and tight. Highly recommend!",
