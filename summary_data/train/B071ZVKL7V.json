I bought these in the sale and unfortunately the seller did not have the next size up in my chosen colour and the price had jumped up so reluctantly returning them. Never got to try them ! Yours may be ok but at the time of writing I think mine's the 5th review complaining of the smaller size fit.",

These are super comfy, and they look great too - they fit as expected, and it feels like you're wearing something that is well-made and of good quality. I like the fact there are patches of slightly off-white suede, which means they're not too white and garish. Will definitely buy Adidas again in the future.",

The actual length might be OK, but it feels like the insoles are extra thick. Heel wants to come out of the back, and toes are under pressure from above. This is after only a week of wear so hopefully the will loosen out a little with wear. Nice looking trainer though. Update.. Can't remember how long I've had these trainers but they have held up really well. Don't wear them all the time but very little aging .. impressed.",

But for me they are slightly on the large size and are more suited to a broader foot. I paid a reasonable price so I am happy with my purchase.",
