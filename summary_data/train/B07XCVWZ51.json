The boy in the picture has sort of longer hair which can cause people to think this is girls diapers, and also misleading is the purple packaging. I know I should have read the description, but come on marketers get paid a lot to create packaging that portrays exactly what you're buying. And yes, there are differences in where the absorbent padding is located for girls vs boys.",

The absorbency of this lot is quite poor compared to my previous purchases and it often leaks during night time. My son really likes the Mickey Mouse design and he never had any skin rashes with huggies and that\u2019s why I always prefer this one over others. This is really easy for pant and potty training. I hope Huggies will maintain the product quality.",
