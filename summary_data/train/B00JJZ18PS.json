It's not as good as the $6000.00 Tempur-pedic my ex got to keep, but it is a close 2nd. I have owned a lot of mattresses, (latex, number bed, memory foam, and a host of name brands) over my lifetime. I am very happy with this product. It has kept it's shape perfectly. It is very comfortable, and hasn't dipped, or drooped in the middle. For the price, it's the best mattress out there.",

We tried to rotate the mattress every so often, but it can't be flipped (different firmness on the bottom), so it didn't do much good.

      "text": "I really wanted to love this mattress and was so excited for it to come home. Unfortunately the mattress did not live up to the reviews. I am extremely disappointed with this purchase. I expected the bed to provide support since it is on the more firm side of memory foam mattresses. However, it sags without giving support. It is also uncomfortable. So the worst two combinations a bed can have, it is not comfortable and doesn't give support. Just as a reference I am pretty petite (5'2 and 100 lb.). Even then, I sink into this hard mattress.",

This mattress is definitely on the med firm/firm side as advertised, and at 240lbs I'm no where near sinking through this mattress. We used a 2\" memory foam topper in our last trailer, and it slept very hot. With this, I've slept great, not once waking up in the middle of the night to change the number of layers on the bed.",

    "description": "Size:Queen| Style:13-InchThis Brentwood Home Cypress Gel 13 mattress provides a medium feel. The 3.5-inch layer of gel infused memory foam responds to your body\u2019s individual shape, weight, and temperature. It adjusts its shape to provide precise support, keeping your spine in alignment while relieving discomfort at pressure points in areas like your hips and shoulders. The infused gel and the ventilated airflow layer evenly disperse heat through the mattress to prevent hot spots that lead to tossing and turning. Our special blend of memory foam actively responds to your movements, allowing you to move freely around the bed without experiencing the quicksand effect. A solid support base absorbs your weight to dampen motion transfer and prevent noise. The mattress is finished in a removable wool-lined zipper cover that stretches in all directions, allowing you to enjoy maximum pressure relief. The wool lining resists odors while it wicks away moisture and regulates body temperature by creating microclimates. This means that you stay cool in the summer and warm in the winter. The safety of your family is important to us so we only use CertiPUR-US certified foams that are free of flame-retardants, formaldehyde, heavy metals, and phthalates. We offer a 25-year warranty as a guarantee of quality. You will be protected from manufacturing defects and premature sagging. We compress and roll our mattresses for easier shipping and setup.
