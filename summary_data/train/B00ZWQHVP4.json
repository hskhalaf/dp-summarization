After checking out some of the hub-based smart home technology, I thought I\u2019d give Roost a whirl based on how easy it seemed. After a 5min install, I was able to verify that my smoke detector was working and that I would now receive alerts if it sounded. All in all \u2013 simple install, smart home technology without a huge investment, and I feel better about my family/home safety. Great Job Roost!!!",

This is perfect for me since I do a lot of traveling, and will give me peace of mind while I'm away!",

Being that this product uses an audible trigger, we figured out that our playfully screaming two-year-old daughter was causing the Roost to alert. I do like the product, and I'm glad the alert actually worked. I'm just disappointed with the sensitivity the Roost has to a false trigger- like a screaming child.",

My advice is, DO NOT purchase this product until it's in the third or fourth generation. First, many of the time it didn't work. Second, when it works, it takes like two to three minutes for the app on my mobile phone to detect the alarm. Many times it just failed and when I manually launch the app, there is no option to snooze because the app didn't detect the alarm or signal from the battery. Third, there is no duration option to snooze the battery.",
