We tried similarly colored yellow tape to try to save money and the fliers weren't interested, so there's something in this formulation (maybe the glue?) that works.",

I put couple of potted flowers indoors, and in a month fungus gnats started to appear pretty much everywhere around the house. I was looking for any kind of spray, but learned that it is inefficient against fungus gnats. So I installed these traps, and in two weeks yellow stickers were half-covered with gnats. I used couple of packs by now, and I don't see gnats around the house anymore. It did not eliminate them completely, I still can see a few of them next to the pots. But the infestation averted, and I'm pretty much happy with it.",

However, if you are fighting flying insects from indoor plants such as fungus gnats its not gonna stop them since it only catches those that have already hatch. Recommend you combine these with a soil/root soak. Mix Hydrogen peroxide with normal water 4 parts water to 1 part peroxide and water the plants. It won't hurt the plant and it'll kill them in the soil before they emerge. You will need to repeat this about every week and 1/2, especially in really large plants, since the eggs will continue to hatch until all of the adults and larvae are killed.",
