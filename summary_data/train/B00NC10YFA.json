Therefore until the design for the plug is changed , I cannot purchase this again",

After about 5 months of use, the charger / plug malfunctioned and it wouldn\u2019t keep the right time, kept resetting due to the improper power it was getting. If the thing got even slightly bumped or moved by my kids (it was on their nightstand) it would lose power for a second and then turn back on, with the times all wrong. At 2am, the wake up alarm sounded and my sleeping kids were torn from their sleep Bc this thing couldn\u2019t keep the time. Faulty transformer/ plug and it needs to be redesigned.",

When the night night story comes on they know they need to listen to the clock in order to get their stars (I have 4 year olds). Amazingly the now also stay in bed in the morning until the Tot clock tells them they can get up. It's been super helpful in maintaining a normal sleep habit for my 4 year old twins.",

It even helps her go to sleep without a fuss. Now if only there was an app so I could sneakily change the awake time if it suits me... ;-)",

Seriously, you could land aircraft with this thing. Also, having blue as the default night setting just isn't a good idea, since blue light stimulates the brain to wake up and can make sleep difficult. As a result the clock actually kept my son awake and we had to switch to his old clock. Really disappointing in the end.",

That being said, it hasn't fully worked yet, but I attribute that to my toddler, her age, and her stubbornness - not the clock :) The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the colors are set. My daughter has requested pink and purple (which they don't have) and to use yellow for something other than wake time and I cannot switch them. I think this option would allow children to have some independence and decision-making power which may make them more excited about following what the colors mean.",

It is such a functional visual cue, since they have no clue what time it is when they wake. Just wish we had gotten it when he was younger. Definitely worth the price.",

Easy to customize. To make it absolutely perfect I would love if there were different wake up times for each day of the week.

      "text": "This clock is great for parents that all have the same schedule for weekdays and weekends. We have two kids, with different bedtimes and naptimes, and different wake times for different weekdays and weekend days. It'd be a pain to program, but helpful if it were like our home thermostat where there is an options for M-F, or M, T, W, H, F and weekend or Sa and Sun. That's the really nit-picky stuff. Overall I think it'll be really helpful, especially living in Alaska where it's dark until 1000 and gets dark again at 1600. The change in colors lets the kids know if this dark is when to get up or stay in bed!",

Sound quality could be a little better, the story telling nap time, sounds a little creepy, but would not really expect much else from a clock in regards to sound.",
