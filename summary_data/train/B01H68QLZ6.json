Built on a dual layer midsole from two EVA compounds, this light, super, cushioned and versatile shoe further refines the Vanquish 2 - Competitor Magazine Editor's Choice Award Winner. An updated asymmetrical external web gives zonal support, and improved breathability adds to the seamlessly constructed upper.

Additionally, the Zonal 3D Puff print also offers added breathability and support. Fitted with a Padded Tongue, the shoe offers comfort which reduces the risk of irritation and discomfort. The upper is also lined with an Ortholite sockliner which is an advanced proprietary polyurethane formula, with recycled rubber content, delivering a combination of benefits unmatched by any other insole manufacturer. Early-Stage Meta-Rocker Midsole Our Meta-Rocker midsole geometry is specifically designed with a low heel-toe differential and a sculptured outsole to create a unique fulcrum effect, like a rocking chair, to encourage a guided gait cycle. This design supports a runner's form while promoting an efficient, smooth roll from initial impact to toe-off. The Early-Stage Meta-Rocket is placed behind the metatarsal heads which help to create a smoother ride and a faster transition to the forefoot. The Vanquish 3 is fitted with a Suspension-Frame and a Dual Layered Midsole Construction which allows for a lightweight, super cushioned versatile shoe. The High Rebound Body EVA provides comfort and responsiveness while the High Cushion EVA Top Midsole provides additional comfort.
