I had to add a small amount of my other shampoo for moisture, scent, and lather. I also had to use a coconut hair mask as the conditioner.",

Don't use too much - the key to curly hair with no frizz is to have a little extra product in your hair to keep it oily. If it dries out too much, it's frizz galore!
