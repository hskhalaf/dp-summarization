I bought them because they lacked a sub as I don't need to annoy my neighbors any more than I already do, so I like the fact they don't come with a sub. One caveat of these speakers is that they are controlled by Razer's awful Synapse software which likes to forget my username and password requiring me to remember my login info every few weeks.

Instead the chroma lags and switches to a random color every couple of seconds. Ive been contacting razer since april, sending logs and more logs and they still dont know what the hell they broke.

I am a music producer with Klipsch monitors for my main drivers, but I wanted to try something different for my living room computer. Don\u2019t get me wrong, they\u2019re good. But there are better speakers out there. I\u2019d only buy this if you\u2019re on a tight budget with tight space. And BTW, I love RGB, but $50 extra dollars for that shiz is kind of a rip off.",

If you're gonna spend $250 might as well get some Sennheiser",

They are a really good buy.",
