      "text": "While I believe this is the \"smallest\" clearing saw Husquvarna offers, it is very adequate for my needs. I have ~20 acres of field and wooded property in the mountains of East TN and am constantly battling mimosa and sweetgum trees. The 336FR takes down 3-4 inch diameter mimosa's like a \"hot knife through butter\". So far, no issue with the equipment. Easy start, the harness makes it relatively easy to handle (and I am normally on hilly, uneven ground) and excellent fuel consumption. The brush cutting blade devastates taller grass and up to 2\" saplings. The string trimmer, well, it blows away any other string trimmer I have used. Excellent purchase.",

I recommend either buying a better blade to go with this if you are cutting a lot of brush or be prepared to sharpen the one included a lot. The blade that came with mine was sharp out of the package but dulled noticeable after the first time running it (one tank of gas and a lot of brush to it's credit). Overall I am happy with the product and will be using it to clear about 2.5 acres of underbrush from my wooded property.",

With the saw blade it is very good for up to 3 inch trunk and a little thicker ones require a little extra time and you have to cut from the other side also. The harness is very sturdy and makes toting it around surprisingly comfortable. Haven't used it for any trimming so can't comment on that.",

In Maine that\u2019s a 45 min ride one way. Follow up. Dealer told me it\u2019s a bad ignition coil. 5 to 7 days to get parts.

Only fuel that had ever been run was Husqvarna pre-mixed fuel, Husqvarna denied any warranty repair. Called their escalation department, what a joke, they said it was a fuel issue. I said it was their fuel, they replied that they don't warranty the fuel just the machine.",

I have been using the Husqvarna 336FR around the farm with the grass blade attached and have found that it is very effective in cleaning off the fence. The unit destroys briar vines but does have a tendency to shoot debris back at your face. Safety equipment is a must both glasses and hearing protection is recommended. The cutter head spins up quickly and the response from the motor is fast. The harness enclosed with the cutter is a real shoulder saver by distributing the weight which makes working longer easier. I am enjoying the Husqvarna 336FR Brush Cutter and would recommend it.",
