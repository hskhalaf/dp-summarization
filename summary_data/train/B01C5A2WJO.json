Before I bought this I read quite a few reviews saying it was hard to keep the net and rim on, but I have had no problems. I would suggest watching the assembly video if you have any of those problems. Overall great quality and value. Very happy with my purchase!",

The balls that come with it are awesome but the kid balls we already had fit! The hoop was big enough. So that is awesome for us. The net is holding up well. It does adjust pretty well so we will have awhile to enjoy this toy. I definitely recommend this one.",

This came and it is smaller, less sturdy, less attractive, and generally cheaper quality. The net they give doesn't fit the rim, the rim is cheap-looking and falls off, the balls are smaller (which they have to be because the whole set is smaller) and look like they were purchased at a dollar store--3/$1.
