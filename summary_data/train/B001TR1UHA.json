      "text": "Great product. Bought one several years ago for my house in CT. We winter in FL and as this season has been unusually cold so far, I purchased one for our home here. As I am using it on my lanai, there is no umbrella to connect it to. So I bought a stand and a pole to hang it from. I can move it around as needed. It would be a great option if the manufacturer offered that as an accessory. I have used both the table top and floor model propane heaters in the past and this product is a much better option for me.",

The manufacturer could improve the design by installing two heat bars in each of the three blades. The nice thing is that it gives off plenty of light which I was missing under our umbrella. For a very moderate evening say in the 60's it helps take off the chill a little bit. I suppose it's better than nothing and the price is not bad so I am keeping it but am a little disappointed it does not put out more heat.",

You can easily adjust the height of where you want to locate it on the pole. It's an exceptional value.",

    "description": "Enjoy your patio in all seasons with this Umbrella Halogen Patio Heater by Fire Sense.\n\nThis heat lamp runs exclusively on your regular 110V household electric current. This makes the heater substantially less expensive to operate compared to traditional gas and propane patio heaters. Additionally, due to it running on electricity, it produces no harmful emissions or toxic residuals, making it safe to be used indoors as well.\n\nThis outdoor patio heater provides you with instantaneous heat so you can warm up quicker than before and uses about a tenth of the energy of LPG tanks. The umbrella patio heater features 3 heating heads and each provides you with 500 watts of heat, providing you a combined total of 1500 watts of energy and heat. It also ensures that there is no wasteful heating of the air around you.\n\nThe halogen heater features a durable and lightweight steel construction with a gorgeous black finish that makes the heater very versatile. The stainless steel patio heater has been designed to be easily attached to any standard patio table umbrella center pole. It features a unique locking system, allowing the 3 heads to be lowered and closed along with the umbrella. To open the heater, simply raise the heads individually until they click into place with the spring loaded locking pins.\n\nWith this electric patio heater, you also get an 8 foot non retractable electrical cord. This unit must run on a dedicated circuit for optimum performance.\n\nThis Fire Sense patio heater is a revolutionary piece of technology in indoor and outdoor heating and provides perfect overhead heating for catching up with friends over a cup of coffee.",
