Now I need to find a completely different food for them as I refuse to continue to feed them something that gives them severe diarrhea to the point of bleeding! Shame on you Natural Balance for caring more about the dollar than your customers. My poor pups now need to adjust to a new diet with an already inflamed digestive system.",

This does have a rather icky smell to it, depending on how you store it. We have made sure the bag stays shut since it's in our pantry.
