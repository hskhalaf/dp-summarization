The stroller has convenient pockets to hold what we needed, and kept the sun off them. The wheels in the front middle do get stuck in turns sometimes, but it's not a bother. We also got the 'J is For Jeep Side By Side Stroller Weather Shield' to go over it, and it fits perfectly on it, and packs easily in the pockets, kept the toddlers dry at the parks.",

On the downside, the umbrella part is pretty useless as sun come pouring from the sides. I ended up bending the shades down to get a little more blockage. Needs a little bit more storage and it sucks when the kids fall asleep because it's so upright that they look uncomfortable. That being said. If your looking for something to hold your kids for a short trip, than this is the way to go. Anything longer than an hour and you might want to bust out your bigger stroller.",
