These speakers sound like crap compared to the Klipsch ones. They sound hollow and don't nearly have the low end bass that the Klipsch has, and I don't even like having a lot of bass. The mid range sounds hollow and when they are turned up they just can't handle it. I had to do a ton of EQ adjustments to make them usable. A battery operated Bluetooth speaker would have been better than these for my patio.",

Long story short- I am very pleased with the sound quality! The sound is exceptional. Outstanding highs and deep bass. I even decided not to purchase a sub! As a setup, I use an old panasonic boombox (stored in the basement) and a Bluettoth 4.0 receiver(bought on Amazon for $15) connected to it. Saved a lot of money;) If you want to buy a brand new receiver, you should look at something with 150Watt RMS per channel.",

I originally had these without the subwoofer and while the bass is good, you had to turn them up loudly to get the bass radiator pumping. The Sonos player is 55w/channel which is more than enough to bring these things to life. One thing to note is that they are extremely large, so measure before purchasing.",

It is worst if they are in sunlight because the sun melts the glue the holds the grill in. I was able to get them to stay in by applying my own glue but these are things Definitive should have thought about before they labeled these as outdoor speakers.",

      "text": "Purchased these to go out on our patio where we just had a new Pergula put up. The sound from them is great for being outdoors. Normal speakers in an outdoor enviornment where there is so much space just sound hollow and more like a PA system from back in the days of high school. These bring great bass through the highs. Now I wish I would have done this a long time ago.",
