This keyboard gets used around 40-ish hours a week between gaming and another household member conducting work from home (lots of constant typing). This keyboard along with the software has a ton of features. A little bit of the matte finish next to \"ROCCAT\" on the bottom of the keyboard was been worn smooth where the lower portion of the left palm rests, but its no big deal at all to me.",

Pressing shift doesn't shift the light to display the alternate characters any clearer on the number keys across the top of the keyboard.

    "description": "The ryos MK Pro offers totally customizable, roccat-engineered per Key illumination in two convenient modes: Smart and manual. This means you can add awesome special effects to your keystrokes, configure your keyboard to highlight your in-game and application key bindings, your modifier keys, your macro sequences and cool downs, your system controls, and much, much more. The included software development Kit ensures that only your imagination is the limit. With the ryos MK Pro, easy-shift[+] becomes the completely remap able easy keyboard. Together with the easy-shift[+] and FN keys, you can assign a secondary key function to virtually every key on the keyboard, to suit every game and key configuration. Add to this the fact that you can store over 500 macros in the keyboard's flash memory and you've got an insanely customizable, fast-acting piece of gaming hardware on your hands. The ryos MK Pro features ultra-advanced anti-ghosting with N-key rollover. This means that no matter how frenzied your intense gaming sessions get, your keyboard will always register every keystroke - and never let you down. Owing to its whopping 32-bit ARM Cortex processor, the ryos MK Pro comes out swinging. Since the MCU is so powerful, not one of the keyboard's advanced features sacrifices an ounce of performance. And with 2 MB of flash memory to store your configurations, your keyboard will Executive all of your keystrokes and macros in real time, without any delay. With ROCCAT R.A.D. You'll never miss a trick.
