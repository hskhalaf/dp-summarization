So I am Xmas shopping and it is still high. Messed up!!!! Something becomes popular and kids love it and then they increase prices because they think we just got to buy it. WRONG in a lot of ways..If I had done this review in March I would have given it 6 stars because she did love it",

My daughters Christmas gift was also ruined because I didn't know that \"Frustration Free Packaging\" meant the shipping would not be discreet. It was packaged in the original package with the \"LOL\" writing in logo on the box. Very upset about that.",
