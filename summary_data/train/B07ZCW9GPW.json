The exhaust blows downward, instead of out of the sides, so all of the dust and pet hair goes flying into the air. The suction diminishes along with the battery. This is going back and I am sticking with the Shark W1. The Shark is twice the price, but does everything I hoped this would. The Eufy provides the performance of a $25 dust buster at twice the price.",

Also, I love its small and lightweight design so that I can take it anywhere easily. Because of its size, there's never a problem to store it. For charging, it can charge via USB and charge fast. I do like how firm the bristles are and how it can scrub and lift dirt well in small spaces. I love how long and narrow the attachment is, and it can get into those hard to reach areas. Overall, it is a good purchase.",

How many times does your kid eat chips, crackers, etc on the couch with the crumbs everywhere? Well, quickly this picks everything up without having to breakout the vacuum cleaner! So easy and powerful! I would have paid more than the sale price knowing this works this well! It is sooooo handy!!",

It should have been placed on back side or have cover over front to prevent this from happening. Initial post: Does well for hand helds. Wish it had larger trash bin and add holder for the attachment. I like that the cover allows it stand upright.!",

The battery life is very ordinary, it is estimated that it can only last more than ten minutes. The design of the filter element is defective. Because there is no sealant, foreign matter can easily enter the motor. It is not recommended.",

It's also too pricey for something that only lasts 13 minutes. The suction is great and it's easy to clean but, the battery life is what I didn't like. I tried cleaning my car with it, and it didn't last very long. Was very disappointed. Had to return the product for my money back.",

My major complaint would be the storage amount for debris picked up. It barely handle a few pieces of popcorn. However, it is very strong and great for small crumbs and reaches hard to get areas. Strongly recommended.",
