So it feels like you\u2019re going to spill or dribble. It just feels odd. My husband took a drink and said it feels wrong and he\u2019d never use it with the lid for that reason. It is functional.

There are no indentions like some other brands, but they are easy to hold. I think the only thing they could improve would be a padded bottom like some others so they don't slip.

Needless to say, I am disappointed in the product received and cannot find a number to call in order to understand why the product is different than the description posted.",

Secondly, the product is just as described, it kept my coffee hot for 3 hrs. Keep in mind that your drink is hot because you won\u2019t feel it holding the tumbler, which is what I really like about it. I don\u2019t have to run back to my desk after grabbing a boiling hot cup of tea.",
