The glass arrived in dangerously small and shattered pieces that could easily spill out of the box onto our carpet with a small toddler in the home. The glass was shattered into millions of pieces. It has been two months and the seller will not respond with a proper response other than, \"more information is needed.\" We have matching furniture pieces to this set and have been waiting and waiting to resolve the issue and get our coffee table. So frustrating. Absolutely my worst experience through Amazon.",

It looks exactly like the picture. Although it is modern in design I have it in a room with a mixture of contemporary and traditional furniture and it looks great. I have already received many compliments on it.",
