This spoon answered my needs because since it's dark, I don't expect it to discolor as easy. It also feels very solid in my hands and it looks like it'll be useful for years to come. The only thing I don't like is the metal loop, I wish it was easier to remove.",

I love stirring spoons with a hole in the middle, it helps with stirring quite a lot. I wish the handle was a bit thicker so it will be easier to stir thick foods. It requires hand washing, but I disregard this advice and wash it in the dishwasher because I am too lazy and because I want it to be sterilized. The color did change some, but the structure is still sound.",
