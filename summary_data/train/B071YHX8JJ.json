      "text": "This is a awesome weed trimmer, I've had used gas trimmers and they work good. But comparing to this battery powered trimmer, I can say it's the best trimmer I owned! I have a large 7 acre land with a lot of trees, with the lightweight of this trimmer I can get done trimming quicker. Now the only down side I have with the trimmer is the battery doesn't keep it charge long but hey I rather sit and wait for the battery to charge then mix gas. One last thing is having this trimmer or anything battery powered, your not polluting the earth with that nasty gas!",

It\u2019s been a month & I\u2019m not happy at all. I won\u2019t buy anything from them ever again.",

This product is much too heavy for me and not at all easy to maneuver. How many of those reviews were written by women? It has to go back. PLUS, there is a 20% restocking fee!!! This was a bad choice all around and has cost me dearly.",
