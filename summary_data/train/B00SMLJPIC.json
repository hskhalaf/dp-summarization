After charging it overnight, it only ran for 8 minutes before dying (at regular, not max suction). I charged it again for the recommended 3.5 hours to ensure that it was fully charged before attempting to use it again and it lasted longer that time but only made it 16 minutes before it died. I may try to purchase the V7 and see if it gets better results but the V6 is just not going to cut it.",

The brush on the bottom gets clogged very fast if you or anyone in the house has long hair. This causes clogging if you don't stay dilligent on cleaning out the brush and tubes.

I have owned two of these over the past few years and it is perfect for getting the dog hair up off mexican tile floors and carpeted stairs. Easy maintenance.

So so disappointed in this especially the amount of money this is. Really needs to improvement.",
