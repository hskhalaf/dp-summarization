      "text": "After only about 2 weeks, the toaster dial would \"ding\" and then continue to stay on - even if I moved the dial back and forward to the bell, it would keep making the ticking noise, heat still on and continue going past where the dial is supposed to stop. I guess the saying \" you get what you pay for\" applies here. If you had left the room while it was on and heard the \"ding\" from another room, you would assume it turned off - so it basically burns the food and could be a fire hazard if you do not run back to the kitchen right away. I have already returned it.",

One thing I will mention though is stay with the oven while its cooking, until you get used to the settings. ie dark for toast means burnt lol so keep an eye on your food til you know what works for you.

    "description": "With its black finish, silver accents, and energy-efficient operation, the Oster 4-Slice Toaster Oven offers more than just good looks. This small toaster oven provides a spacious interior that can accommodate up to four slices of bread at a time and can be used to bake a veggie casserole, broil fish, and much more. Two manual control dials ensure simple and precise operation. The first dial lets you set the baking temperature to up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit or position it to Toast mode for toasting or Broil mode for broiling. The second dial allows you to set the timer for up to 30 minutes and choose the toast shade setting from light to dark. It can also be turned to the stay-on position for continuous cooking. The adjustable rack can be placed in two positions, allowing you to customize the space. A see-through door lets you check on your food at a glance, while a stay-cool door handle makes opening and closing the door safe. This bread toaster and oven comes with a removable, easy-clean crumb tray and a durable baking pan. Efficient in both design and performance, the Oster 4-Slice Toaster Oven makes a useful addition to any busy kitchen.",
