It was missing one of the charcoal boxes, both handles to raise and lower the charcoal, one wheel, the handle to pull out the ash tray and alot of the screws, nuts, bolts and washers. It came in several boxes within larger boxes and appears a box or two wasn't packed in there. In addition to the missing parts, the lid had 2 dents.",
