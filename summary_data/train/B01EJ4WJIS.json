After doing some research, and weighing the convenience factor + cost of buying the necessary quality ingredients to make my own, I decided to try Gaia's ready-to-use formula. SO glad that I did! It was packaged well, arrived quickly, and has definitely helped me relax at night -- I mix a teaspoon of the powder into a cup of very warm almond milk and drink shortly before bed. Warming (in a cozy way, NOT hot flashes!), earthy, comforting... I feel nourished and calm after drinking it. Will definitely be buying it again and again!",

As much as I enjoyed this product, I'd rather go the longer way of making golden milk using all natural, unprocessed ingredients. Sad.",
