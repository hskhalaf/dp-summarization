I would advise getting some type of rubber strips to put on before you add a mattress. The finish on the slats makes the mattress slide around.",

I woke up in the middle of the night to the left side of the frame collapsing because two of the legs came unattached from the metal piece they are \"attached\" too. I am lucky I wasn't injured and the entire frame has been rendered useless. 0/10 would next buy again. A massive waste of money and a HUGE safety hazard.",
