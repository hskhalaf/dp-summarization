I thought speedo brand would be a safe bet, especially with the positive reviews, but boy was I wrong! The mask itself doesn't even seal to my kids heads on the sides, rendering it utterly worthless, and on top of that, though the mask seal itself may be soft, the head strap itself has no stretch whatsoever like my seaventure mask, making it almost impossible for my kids to put on or take off by themselves. On a tight budget, this was a sad waste of money for a useless dollarstore-quality mask. I'd give it zero stars if possible!",

We keep 5 or 6 pairs of children's masks as the neighbor kids are always wanting to swim with our kids and these are definitely much better than some of the cheaper ones. They are constantly wanting the straps adjusted which was a chore on the cheaper masks but is relatively quick and easy on these. Some things are worth spending the extra money on and this is one of those items, in my opinion.",

They seem to have more fun in the pool with these masks. When water leaks into the mask, the first thing a kid does is try to tighten the head band. If the head band is attached to the face seal, the face seal gets pulled out of the hard plastic piece of the mask and the thing is ruined. This model is great because the head band pulls on the hard plastic piece and not on the face seal.",

      "text": "I really love this swimming mask. It stops water from entering your nose, which is painful! It doesn\u2019t fog up neither. This mask encouraged me to open my eyes without even using the mask underwater. When I didn\u2019t have the mask at first, I was having hard times stopping water form getting in my nose. Now that I use it a lot, since the mask stops the breathing through your nose, if you ever swim without, you will probably get used to it and water won\u2019t get in your nose. I love it. Every time I go to my local pool, I bring my mask and swim free! \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01",
