I left a numbered diagram in pics. Follow this and it is hassle free. I was having problems till i found the youtube video. Great jump. Got this for my 8 year old and I to share. We are both thrilled.",

After purchasing the new bungees, the loop connecting the mat to the bungee completely tore away while I was jumping, so I can no longer even use it. I am so disappointed. Don't waste your money.",

This trampoline is a blast. Comfortable, quiet, and bouncy. Taller than expected, however, and not easy to store. It now is a permanent fixture in my family room but the upside of that is that I will use it much more often. (I've been using it daily.)",

It didn't look at all like the diagram which showed loops and ours had tabs. We were getting so frustrated because one of the tubes kept pulling apart, we finally disassembled what we had and packed it up and sent it back. I'm going to try to find one in a store that I don't have to assemble.",
