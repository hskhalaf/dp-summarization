First, yes this works great on my 2019 MacBook pro and did not mess the screen up and it doesn't mess up screens. The reason this messed the screens on other people's laptops is because it's a 2011-2014 MacBook problem, not this cleaners problem. Look up #screengate. It was a big mess up on apples part and happened to me back then when I had one too. If you cleaned your MacBook with almost anything the protective film would come off. Quit blaming this cleaner. I appreciate this also came with a microfiber cloth.",

The cloth is also amazing. No lint trap and is of high quality. Let me tell you ive tried many brands and of all costs. Waist of money,",
