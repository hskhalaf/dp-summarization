I was amazed at how easy it is to use the Flip Mino, and at the quality of the end product video. Is it the \"perfect\" camcorder for every ocassion? No, but for those impromptu, \"down & dirty\", on the spot videos it beats the heck out of using a big camcorder...or a cellphone. I considered buying a Sony \"Webbie\", but dollar for dollar you can't beat a Flip.",

About the height of a pack of cigarettes, and less than half it's width and depth , this wonderful little piece of technology takes some beautiful video, and also surprisingly picks up all sounds and voices with clarity as well. Bottom line - the Flip Mino is for those that want/need something small, lightweight and simple, and don't want to fiddle with converting or encoding, as well as for those who love to upload videos to video websites or via email.",

I can definitely tell a difference, plus the Mineo which doesn't use AA batteries, is so light it's almost not there. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because when I first tried to charge it up, the AC adapter which came as free perk, would not give it a full charge. Tech support suggested I leave it plugged into my high speed USB port on the computer overnight. That worked. I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone who wants fairly good video with little cost and hassle.",

The whole process of setting up, recording, transferring videos and uploading them to YouTube (using the Flip software) was very easy. No issues whatsoever with the latest iPhoto, it downloads movies into the iPhoto library just like any other format. Very portable, nice product and package experience overall. Very pleased. The image quality could be better, but then again it's mostly for the Web so it doesn't matter. It works beautifully for blogging and sharing videos with friends and family.",

The controls are easy- even the technologically challenged will find it a breeze. The transfer of the videos to the PC is easier. The best feature is the software which is provided within the Mino- so you can download/upload your software wherever you are. The software also makes it easy to upload your videos into websites- the compression feature is awesome. All in all, for the price its good. Wouldn't have minded if it was a little cheaper, but then the looks you get for it make up.",

The quality of the video is fine for full screen laptop display and it does an excellent job even in low light situations; also audio is excellent. Now I want the HD version!

Apparently if you tweak some settings and do some conversions it works. But that sort of kills the whole point of an easy to use camera.

I will say that it is better to use a traditional style video camera for occasions such as your child's Christmas play, etc. It does not have a zoom or focus so it is strictly meant to do some quick and simple stuff. I do love it and highly recommend it!",
