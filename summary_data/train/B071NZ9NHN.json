The only problem I have is the scalpel's upper piece, that loosens so you can change the blade, tends to come loose on its own, but a small piece of masking tape fixes that. The files are pretty good, even though I broke the tip off of one trying to dig out a hunk of plastic that wouldn't come off a print, I didn't take off a star for that though because that isn't normal use for that tool lol. The pliers that came with it are good quality, and the sanding boards do their job. Overall satisfied, would buy again.",
