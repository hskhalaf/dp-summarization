This was supposed to upgrade our previous green and we ended up taking the old one back out. I am very disappointed in this product. Lastly, even if it lasted, it came with a crease from corner to corner right before the ramp for the holes. This threw off the accuracy and experience.",

He kept in contact as to the progress of this and in February my husband received the new one which was much improved. Shaun even called to make sure we received it and that all was okay. I honestly have never seen such great care and interest taken from any company. Thanks..glad I purchased this putting mat for my hubbie.",

      "MASTER YOUR SPEED AND DISTANCE CONTROL. If you're looking to improve your putting, our indoor putting green is all about helping you improve your stance, tempo, back swing, and follow through. Perfect for the serious players to practice grooving a solid stroke. Great for golf enthusiasts to have around the house to provide hours of entertainment.",
      "NATURAL ELEVATION, BALL ROLLS TRUE. The surface of this mat has been designed so it feels like the closest thing to practicing in real green, and unlike traditional putting mats that only have one hole, ours has 3 deep holes that will allow you to practice your putting from various angles and distances and allow you to practice a firm stroke and solid putt. On top of that, this putting green has a slight uphill elevation that feels more natural than the plastic ones.",
      "THICKER AND WIDER SURFACE. Shaun Webb's Putting Mat has a new design that will allow you more options for putting practice. It's high-end rubber backing is thicker than the average putting mat ensuring no problems with footprints or creases knocking your ball off-line, keeping your stroke sharp. Just make sure the floor temperature is about right, do not use it outdoors under the sun or on a very warm floor.",
      "FINALLY A HIGH-END MAT FOR YOU. Considering that there are other cheaper, similar-looking products it makes sense that you wonder if you should buy this product as thousands of other customers have done in the past years. To answer that question Shaun Webb recorded for you a short video of the 5 Key differences between our mat and the second cheapest but more visible option out there. Find it in the picture's section of this listing! (find it after the last product pic)",
