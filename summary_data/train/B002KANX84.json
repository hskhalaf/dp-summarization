I was worried that I'd made a bad choice after seeing all the \"blurred image\" commentary in other reviews. I don't know what those folks are doing wrong..I've gotten nothing but crisp & clear shots despite the fact that everything I shoot is from a moving (frequently violently vibrating) platform. This little camera does everything I want of it, and it's lightweight and solidly built to boot. Two thumbs up from me!",

I have had it only a limited time and no great camera trips yet but for family, graduations, home use, etc. It seems to work very well. It is faster for indoor work than my previous digital camera (L-12). The biggest advantage however is the bright screen and one in which you can control the brightness. It is easily viewed on a sunny day whereas my previous camera screen was impossible to see on a bright day. Well worth the money.",

    "title": "Nikon Coolpix S570 12MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide Angle Optical Vibration Reduction (VR) Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Black) (OLD MODEL)",
    "description": "Color:BlackFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nStyle meets simplicity. 5x wide angle zoom in a super slim body. \n\nNikon\u2019s stylish and simple Coolpix S570 combines 12.0 effective megapixels with a 5x optical Wide Angle Zoom-Nikkor glass lens for stunning prints as large as 16x20 inches. The sleek, all-metal design makes it easy to carry, and the incredible, bright 2.7-inch LCD makes it easy to compose and share pictures. The Coolpix S570, with Nikon\u2019s 4 Way VR Image Stabilization, combines four technologies that get you sharp, crisp pictures. The Coolpix S570 features Nikon\u2019s Smart Portrait System that finds faces, removes red-eye, softens fine skin lines, fires the shutter when your subject smiles and warns you if they blink. \n\nA smart, flat design equipped with advanced functions for capturing precious moments with simplicity and style \n\nThe Coolpix S570 features a 5x zoom Nikkor lens with 28mm wide-angle coverage and the performance benefits of Nikon's innovative EXPEED digital image-processing concept. With 12.0 effective megapixels of sharp resolution and a flat body that fits right in your pocket, the Coolpix S570 offers carefree and flexible shooting. \n\nThe Coolpix S570 is equipped with Nikon's Smart Portrait System, a series of advanced functions that help produce consistently great portraits. The new Skin Softening function automatically detects and analyzes the subject's skin and then adjusts smoothness for enhanced results. Face-priority AF automatically detects as many as 12 faces in the shot and helps produce satisfying portraits by adjusting focus and exposure. Smile Timer automatically releases the shutter when the priority subject smiles while the Blink Proof function automatically shoots two sequential frames and saves the one in which the subject\u2019s eyes are wide open. In-Camera Red-Eye Fix automatically corrects any perceived red-eye effect before saving the image to memory. \n\nThe Coolpix S570's high sensitivity of up to ISO 3200 at any image size up to its maximum of 4000 x 3000 pixels enables flexibility when shooting in low light or when capturing fast-moving subjects. This creates new opportunities to take sharper, more natural-looking photos the moment they occur. \n\nNikon Coolpix S570 Feature Highlights \n\nEXPEED digital imaging technology\n\n\nVR image stabilization in action Nikon\u2019s smarter approach to digital imaging technology. From image capture to processing, Nikon\u2019s comprehensive EXPEED digital imaging concept encompasses the entire picture-taking operation. EXPEED is much more than a processing engine; it is a revolution in digital photography. \n\nFour advanced image stabilizing features help ensure sharper results \nNikon's electronic VR (Vibration Reduction) image stabilization compensates for the effects of camera shake. Motion Detection automatically controls shutter speed and the ISO setting to compensate for subject movement as well as camera shake. ISO 3200 capability at any image size up to its maximum of 4000 x 3000 pixels allows faster shutter speeds when shooting in low light or capturing fast-moving subjects. Nikon\u2019s original BSS (Best Shot Selector) function automatically shoots a series of sequential frames and saves the one with the sharpest focus. \n\n\n\n\n\nNikon\u2019s Smart Portrait System with Skin Softening\nFace-priority AF helps produce more satisfying portraits by adjusting focus and exposure for as many as 12 faces in the framed shot. Skin Softening function detects and analyzes a framed subject\u2019s skin, and then adjusts smoothness to produce enhanced results. Smile Timer automatically releases the shutter when the subject smiles, while its Blink Proof function shoots two sequential frames, then saves the one in which the subject\u2019s eyes are widest open. Blink Warning presents an alert when it suspects that someone in the shot has blinked. In-Camera Red-Eye Fix automatically corrects any perceived red-eye effect before saving the image to memory. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmart functionality, carefree shooting\nNikon\u2019s Scene Auto Selector eliminates the need to manually select a scene mode to match the shot, making it faster and easier to capture the moment. The Coolpix S570 uses this intelligent function to analyze the subject and surrounding setting and automatically selects the most appropriate of the following six scene modes to achieve optimal results--Portrait, Landscape, Night Portrait, Night Landscape, Close-up, or Backlight. \n\nQuick Retouch\nQuick Retouch automatically adjusts the contrast and saturation of selected photos to create an enhanced copy with the right finishing touch. \n\nNikon Coolpix S570 Other Features\n\n *  D-Lighting in action \n * 16 handy scene modes for optimized shooting in various settings \n * D-Lighting \n * Active Zoom \n * Auto Sort and Favorite Pictures functions \n * Four movie modes with sound \n * Time zone function for easy setting of multiple locations \n * Approx. 47 MB of internal memory \n * Hi-Speed USB connectivity \n\nWhat\u2019s in the Box  * EN-EL10 Rechargeable Li-ion Battery \n * MH-63 Battery Charger \n * UC-E6 USB Cable \n * EG-CP14 Audio Video Cable \n * AN-CP19 Strap \n * Coolpix Software Suite CD-ROM",
