I'm very happy to have found this source for my protein, which cannot be purchased in Nashville, at least for close to the same price. I expect to use this dealer as my sole source from now on.",

I like to mix it with 8 oz. milk, 1/2 banana and a little sweetener. When I have it for breakfast, it lasts until mid-afternoon. I have more energy and alertness than when I eat, say, an egg and piece of toast.",

It dissolves great, tastes like flour.. I wouldn't recommend doing it this way. I need to find some good recipe's for it. Tip: I dumped all 4 bags into one of those big Creatine / Whey Protein jugs you find at walmart and it fit perfectly.",

I tried to use it twice and both times I didn't drink the smoothie. I'll stick to whey protein.",
