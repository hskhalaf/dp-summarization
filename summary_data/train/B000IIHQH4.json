Mispresented, However, the wonderful people at AMAZON credited my account to my complete surprise and satisfaction. Thank you!!! Steve",

Unfortunately it does not have a battery, so it must still be plugged in. I really like the fact that the ink and paper are purchased together, and the quantities of both seem to line up fairly well, so I'm not running out of one or the other at different times. As far as the ink goes, I'm not sure what the other reviewer is talking about, because, according to Epson, even the different kind of ink this printer uses is still archival quality. I think the picture quality is good for the price of this machine.",

Colors are bright and exact, while printing RGB format. It feels like the pictures are clone from the screen. I recomend this product to anybody that needs to create their own family album and not wait until the store developers have it ready. Also for postcards and invitations, where you dont want large quantities.",

      "text": "I bought two, one for a gift. Very good quality photos. Fast printing. The LCD screen is too small and you can't zoom in to see if you need to edit more before prining (w/out a computer). With a computer, no problem; but the software package for photo editting leaves something to be desired. Sometimes the red-eye reduction needs to be undone. The photo managing is not always easy and intuitive. Overall, I love this printer and recommend it for the price, quality, and cheap recurring costs of printing.",
