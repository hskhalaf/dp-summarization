It tracks well and has a great balance for kids, so you don't need to worry about fishing them out of the lake or river. This is a great option for introducing your kids to kayaking!",

For the price we paid you\u2019d think they would think they would at least include nice paddles instead of these cheap flimsy Ones that I am sure won\u2019t last!! I would not recommend this kayak based on the paddles alone !! We got my our granddaughter a lifetime kayak and her paddles are 100% better and the whole set was cheaper but better built!!",
