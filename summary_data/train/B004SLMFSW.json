That said, mixed with just water, Trutein provides the best flavor (Chocolate Peanut Butter is more like \"essence of. . .\") that I've ever tasted. Also, it blends very smoothly and even gets a bit foamy. If you're going to blend with milk alternatives like almond milk, get the original or unsweetened version of the almond milk. The blend will likely be too sweet, otherwise.",

I bought popcicle molds and made popcicle which my best friend had no idea she was eating a protein supplement :)~",

I got the vanilla bean to be on the safe side and I all the people I know that you won't go wrong getting this. I am going to order another one, but this time I am going to try a different flavor.

It's like dessert!!! I make protein shakes using mocha or cinnamon bun and use unsweetened vanilla almond milk. Those also taste like dessert! I really can't recommend this protein enough.",

I can add peanut butter powder, or blend up blueberries in it, or even add yogurt to the mix. The flavor is really good on its own, better than any other protein powder I have ever tasted. My favorite blend is made with unsweetened vanilla almond milk, peanut butter powder, & chia seeds. I will continue to purchase trutein again & again as I have done many times before because it's a good product & it's my breakfast almost every morning & I love it.",

It also lacks the grittiness and powdery feel other protein powders have. It was very smooth, velvety, and foamy. I used a \"bottleblender\" protein shaker to mix it up with water only. Also, this batch is new with an expiry date of November 2019.",
