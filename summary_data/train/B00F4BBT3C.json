My dog really loves meat and usually refuses anything else. The only dry food he eats is from the Blue line. I was so excited to find these since they're a dry treat that he actually loves! I liked that it's grain free and has few ingredients. Considering how picky my dog is, I would say this is a high-quality dog treat. The only potential downside is that my dog leaves crumbs whenever he eats these, so it's best to feed outside.",
