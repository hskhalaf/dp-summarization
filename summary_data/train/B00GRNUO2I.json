I have had the experience in the past of another brand to stop working. I really didn\u2019t need to buy this second one...as the first one was working fine after a couple of years.",

As others have noted, however, you must be working on a flat surface for the iPad to contact the keyboard correctly to make the Bluetooth connection. Also, it arrived in its box barely protected in a lightly padded envelope. I was frankly prepared for it to be broken. I like it enough to keep it: it's attractive, sturdy and easy to type on, but the connectivity issue is something prospective buyers should be aware of. And consider purchasing from another vendor who will package it well for shipping.",

Other features are an ability to put the iPad in apps display mode (my term) where you can horizontally scroll through your open apps and close apps you're not using. It almost invariably pairs (it's a Bluetooth device) right nearly right away. For those that use the Remote utility from Apple, it did not interfere and interfaced correctly.",

It has an auto-on switch when you mount the iPad in its slot but it has a tendency to jar loose while typing occasionally. I'd prefer turning it on and off manually. .",

The magnetic coupling to the iPad when closed is not strong enough to hold the (heavy) keyboard in place, so it constantly falls-off. You cannot use the iPad in portrait mode without taking the keyboard off or the two items fall-apart. There is virtually no way to use the camera without detaching the \"case\". Since the \"case\" detaches so easily from the iPad it provides no protection. I have returned the item.",

The keyboard connects to your iPad Air wirelessly through Bluetooth and has a long battery life. \n\nDesigned to support a comfortable 35-degree-angle working position; simply snap your iPad Air into the hinge.\nView larger\n\nKeyboard's automatic on/off switch responds to the iPad Air's weight--for best results, use it on a stable surface. \nView larger\n\nWELL-SPACED KEYPAD FOR FAST, ACCURATE TYPING\nThis laptop-style keyboard is made with well-spaced TruType keys that promote typing accuracy. A spring mechanism under each key provides a tactile response with every stroke, letting you type quickly and with fewer errors as you draft emails, write papers, or chat online. Shortcut keys make it easy to copy and paste text, adjust volume, or control music.\n\nSTYLISH, MINIMALIST DESIGN\nMade with anodized aluminum, this cover's slim shape provides a snug fit for your iPad Air without adding bulk. Snap your iPad Air into the hinge, and magnets hold it securely in place, making it easy to slip it into your bag and go.\n\nCOMFORTABLE 35-DEGREE VIEWING ANGLE\nA slot in the cover holds your iPad Air at a 35 degree angle--a comfortable working position--and accommodates both portrait and landscape orientations.\n\nUP TO 79 HOURS OF TYPING BETWEEN CHARGES\nTo use the keyboard with your iPad Air, simply switch on the keyboard, pair it with your iPad Air, and the two will connect via Bluetooth. The battery lasts for 79 hours of active use and 3,100 hours of standby. You can easily recharge the battery using the included USB cable. \n\nAUTOMATIC ON/OFF SWITCH\nThe Belkin QODE Thin Type Keyboard Cover comes equipped with an automatic on/off switch that is activated by your iPad Air's weight.
