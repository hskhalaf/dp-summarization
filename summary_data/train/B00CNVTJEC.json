Sure they may be nonstick surfaces but if you do not do this you will have a messy broken bowl that is hard to get off. If you do this the product works wonders and the bowls cook in moments.",

That being said, They are cute, they cook very quickly, and they are super fun. We made waffles from the recipe in the booklet that comes with it and they were good. We used them with yogurt & fruit, eggs & crumbled bacon with syrup drizzled on , and even ice-cream sundaes! Fun for the kids. A great price.",

I don't know if this is a peculiarity of my individual unit or a problem with all of the bowl makers, so I thought I'd pass on the easy fix.

The cups are approximately 2.5 inches diameter at the bottom, 3 inches diameter at the top, about 1.25 inches deep. Two cups cook in about 2 minutes. So the cups are not very big - they hold 1 scoop of ice cream and a few toppings.",
