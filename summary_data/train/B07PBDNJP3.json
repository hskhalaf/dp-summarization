      "text": "I normally wear Elta MD sunscreen SPF 45, but I was intrigued by the \"blurring effect\". The first things I noticed is It is hard to spread all over the face. Second, if you are planning to put on foundation after, the sunscreen will cause pilling and add to the appearance of texture. Third, it is heavily scented. I do not appreciate high end products that contain perfume as I have sensitive skin. Overall, not worth it for me as a makeup wearer. I would not purchase again.",

It feels like rose petals being brushed up against your face when you apply it. In the mornings I follow it with powder and mascara.
