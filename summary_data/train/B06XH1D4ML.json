I really like that fact that these earphones are not \"bass\" heavy. A very clean and natural / neutral sound. Highs are crisp, nothing in the audible range is muddled.

      "text": "Purchased in August '17. Now, April 2 '18. I take really good care of everything - and these are no exception. However this morning I noticed that they just aren't fitting quite right.. upon inspection, I noticed that the band has cracked/split right at the top. So now they have a hinge point on the top and that digs into my head and they also do not fit as snug. Great sound - just poor quality in that one area.",
