      "text": "I wanted a way to keep a large number of small balls of yarn available for knitting, while also keeping my yarn safe from my puppy's curious teeth. This bag does that very well. The slits on the top are perfect for knitting multiple colors at once (for stripes, for example.). The only way this could be better is if the pockets on the side had a flap to cover them and protect objects from falling out when carried, or if the pockets were large enough to fit a full-sized set of sewing shears securely.",

The holes are well reinforced, so the yarn does not easily slide between in the slit. It holds 4 super bulky skeins, 6oz each of yarn. The only complaint I have is that the over-the-shoulder strap was missing from my package. Else, it would have been five stars. I would recommend this to any crocheter or knitter to keep your yarns organized while working. UPDATE: I found the over the shoulder strap weeks later. i have updated my rating to five stars.",

      "text": "Received this item missing the shoulder strap from the package. It has deep creases where it's been folded flat that cause the bottom to curve upward, so that it doesn't sit completely flat. It most certainly has a chemical smell. It's not the strongest plastic smell I've encountered, but it is noticeable and unpleasant. I could have overlooked the creasing and tried letting the smell dissipate, but the missing shoulder strap is maddening to me! This was likely a returned item that they just stuck right back onto a shelf. Very disappointed in this transaction.",

However, it also does not have separation inside to keep you yarns from tangling, esp. if the skeins/balls have already been used some and have loose ends. Also, I thought it was rigid, but it collapses the same as other types, unless you totally stuff it with yarn. It is nice to have the yarn end feed through the hole in the top, but I got along with putting the ball/skein in a plastic bowl just as well. Would not buy again.",

However, I've given it 4 stars instead of 5 because for me there's one negative. If the bag isn't completely full, the sides tend to collapse making it difficult to pull the yarn while crocheting or knitting. In my opinion, it would have been better if the sides had been reinforced in some way to make them hold their shape whether the bag is full or not. Maybe a future design will address this issue.",

It also keeps the yarn clean and dogs hair free, I can even keep my work-in-progress in the bag too.

I crochet in several places throughout my house and have found it handy to keep things together as I move around.

      "text": "This is a great, extremely portable yarn bag - I purchased one a few months back that I use for other crafts and when my daughter started knitting again, I purchased one for her. She also loves hers - there's lots of storage and the bag itself is pretty nice to look at so you can work on your crafts/knitting etc. anywhere and this bag will not likely clash with your decor.",

I bought it to store my latch hook kit yarn, canvas, and hook, so I don't need the holes at the top that knitters can use to pull yarn through as they knit. But, if I take up knitting. it's good to know it's there.",
