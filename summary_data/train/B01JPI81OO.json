In the box they felt very hard and rigid so I used some snow-seal and worked it into the leather then I used the hairdryer to melt the stuff in even more. Now they are more supple but not soft. They are warm outside and not too hot when inside and traction is terrific. I will edit this if anything changes but I really love these boots.",
