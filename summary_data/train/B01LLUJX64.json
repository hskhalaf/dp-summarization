Love the color, it's that medium gray that just fits...Soft as the daylights. It's a little stiff, but with use, it will relax. If it came relaxed, I'd worry it wouldn't hold up. The electric part is wonderful. I do have one thing to note. I have short arms, when totally extended, I cannot reach the electric controls unless I sit up. If you are buying this for a medical reason, please make note of that.",
