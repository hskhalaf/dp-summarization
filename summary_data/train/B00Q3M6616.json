Scent could be improved; a little too sweet to feel refreshed. Definitely recommend Shiseido Tsubaki shampoo/conditioner over these. After blow drying, hair wasn\u2019t the smoothest so I adjusted with Kerastase leave in hair oil for moisture control. Overall: small portion, overpriced, not worth the try.",
