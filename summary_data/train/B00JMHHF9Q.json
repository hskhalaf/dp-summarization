These are definitely quieter and smoother than previous generations of Lippert power tongue jacks. I also think maybe they are a bit slower in operation too, which is perfectly ok, as they still allow you to raise and lower the tongue quite quickly...just something I happened to notice about them. If you have a trailer with a manual jack, this is an upgrade I would absolutely recommend. Installation is easy...if you can use a socket wrench, you are good to go.",

The head cannot be rotated 90o on the jack. Second. the jack has no limit switches.

After a couple of hours on the charger everything worked great. This jack is so convenient it should be required equipment on all trailers. I'm going to add one to my other trailer as well.

      "text": "This jack worked great on our Micro-Mini. We'd only used it a couple of times before the Covid19 hit and most of the parks nearby closed, so it didn't get a lot of use. Well, we went to leave recently and the jack would not retract. Had to switch back to the old manual jack. When we got home I disassembled and found the contacts on the retract side of the switch had apparently arched/corroded and were not making contact. I cleaned them up, and reassembled everything, but haven't reinstalled yet on our trailer (it's working fine now) as I'm hesitant to use this jack that failed so quickly after relatively few cycles.",

What's great about this jack is that the simplicity shouldn't cause there to be any questions. If you can't put your tailgate down while attached to trailer, unattach from your trailer. If you want a wheel on the bottom, pull the pin out and put a wheel. I don't understand why there are any bad reviews on this product.",
