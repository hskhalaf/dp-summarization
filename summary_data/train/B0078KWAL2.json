There is an easily installed \"plug \" for using it bagless in the mulching mode. I suggest that you use a dry lubricant spray on the underside to prevent cut grass from sticking.",

Half the price of a cheap gas mower, with 10% of the maintenance and far, far less noise. I chose the 16\" 10 amp mower to ensure better power/area ratio. If you're cutting a healthy lawn, that should be your main consideration. It's also light and folds down easily for storage or transport.",

Pros; easy to store, easy to move around and easy to lift over things. Cons; doesn't weigh enough to sink into the grass. Therefore, it rides on top of the grass. So you might have mow over areas were the grass is long a couple of times.",

The only problem is the cord, which is a pain in the butt to work around, and it always scares me that he's going to accidentally hit it and electrocute himself. For now, it's a great mower (it even inspired our neighbor to go out and get an electric mower), but we will definitely be upgrading to the cordless version in the future.",

Only downside to this is narrow width and front and back wheels don't overlap, causing some grass patches to get pushed down and not get cut. As many others have said it takes a few times to be able to learn the cord dance but not too bad. Check where your outlets are and make sure you get a cord that reaches everywhere. I am using a 25' and 50' plugged together which can come unplugged if it gets pulled to hard.",
