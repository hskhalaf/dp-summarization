If you have a particular picture you want to get the best, you can increase the DPI to 600 but that takes about 6 seconds. I used the 600 setting for proper old pictures but normal colour ones were perfect at 300 DPI (2seconds). I spent a few hours over a couple of days and scanned over 2000 pictures. It was actually very satisfying and now I have all my pictures digitised and in relevant folders. A little bit expensive but a fantastic bit of kit",

When this dawned on me I wanted a better solution. This scanner was it. 50 photos now take 5 minutes! It straightens the photos and balances the colours. The scans are a better quality than my flatbed and I actually enjoy the process. I cannot recommend this photo scanner enough!",
