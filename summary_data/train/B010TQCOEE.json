      "text": "Got to use the compressor for no more than 20 seconds before the black gun broke. Air hose was leaking air, as the compressor kicks in and holds pressure to 60psi, before it continues to drop without anything being released on the triggers. Unable to spray out anything otherwise from this gun, (with or without ink) Tried switching to the other two fine detail guns that were provided but nothing is able to connect to the hose. I feel like I'm missing connectors for these two to be used. Hoping others have a better experience with this product, I'm rather not happy.",

He's been very happy with it so far. Everything works well, the compressor is quiet, and he's learning to produce very good results on the models he is painting. I opted for a kit because some of the brushes, hoses, and compressors use different fittings -- this kit makes everything easier for a rookie. His only complaint is the brushes require frequent cleaning and are somewhat difficult to clean. He may purchase a different type of brush in hopes it will be easier to maintain and use.",

However I have only used the 0.3mm one (I think it's the gravity-fed one with the larger cup). I have tried to use the siphon one, but I can't seem to figure out how to attach it into the compressor yet.",
