Based on the size I would guess kids up to 5ft could probably use it - but I would start looking at the next size up for a kid 4ft6inches, as a 5ft tall kid would be kind of at the limit of being able to stretch his legs inside without popping out. Very pleased with the bag, I recommend it!",

It also has no drawstring to close the top either, which most of our colder weather bags have. Overall, though, it did it\u2019s job.

      "text": "These are great first time sleeping bags for warmer weather camping, backyard camping and sleepovers at their friends houses. They pack down nicely and the stuff sack does what it's made for. My only complaint (kind of?) is the velcro at the top of the zipper is big and a little rough on the edges so it could scratch your little ones face a bit. Nothing big, more of an irritation.",
