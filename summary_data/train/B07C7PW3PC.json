I\u2019ve used this three times now and so far, so good. Because it\u2019s only 750 watts it\u2019ll take longer to get up to temp, but apparently that\u2019s the trade-off for the smaller size. It took 30 minutes to go from cold tap water to 130 degrees. However, if you start with hot water you get there much more quickly. Really enjoying this cooking process.",

The meats are insane, we haven't bothered to go out for steaks simply because the ones I make are now better than anything I can get in a restaurant. Advice for new users - this is not a fast cooking method. Plan ahead! Don't use extremely lean cuts of meat, this needs the fat to self braise. You can drain the fat of later easily. For most foods at lower than about 160 f, Ziploc bags work just fine. The good eats guides to sous vide are really helpful.",

The chimichurri sauce I made was also good, but the temp on the steaks was definitely a huge factor. Would like to make fish next! My friend made fish with a sous vide and it was soooo succulent! I want to utilize this for vegetables too. Tried carrots and it wasn\u2019t that exciting.",

The timer on the stick and the timer on my phone app go out of sync when I adjust the cooking time. Not a fan of the cooking in a bag method. Not easy to get enough air out of the bag to keep it from floating unless using a vacuum sealer but the sealer is tricky and tends to suck out all the butter and seasonings added to the food. This stays in the drawer most of the time.",
