Even more admirable is the fact that it\u2019s waterproof.The Moab Prime 2 WP has surpassed the expectations of many when it comes to performance, protection, and durability, though it is best suited for well-maintained trails and less challenging terrain.",

I bought this pair of Moab's to replace another pair of all leather shoes Merrell discontinued years ago. I had them for 15 years and wore a hole through the bottom of both soles. So given my past experience with Merrell I'm confident these will meet or exceed my expectations.",

Unless you want to spend a few hundred for American made Danner, everything else is about the same. Even the cheaper Danner are now Chinese. I seriously doubt that anyone can tell the difference between a $30 (no name) and $130 (brand name) pair of Chinese made hikers. Next time, I'll just buy the cheaper junk.",

The same was true of the Primes, though they were a little bit more stiff (not surprising since they're all leather). The day after they arrived, I got to test them out in the torrential rain (my dog better realize how much I love her), and my feet were nice and dry by the time I got home. And my feet weren't as hot and sweaty as they were with other waterproof shoes.",
