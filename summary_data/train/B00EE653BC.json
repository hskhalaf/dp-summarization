My main complaint is that these are \"teething\" toys, but one is for puppies with NO adult teeth. Teething, by definition, means the puppy is currently growing in some adult teeth. This means that the soft toy is great for **pre-teething puppies only**. Please follow the package directions and don't give the softer bone to a puppy with any adult teeth. They will rip it to shreds, which is dangerous to them and a mess to clean up!",

And considering they aren't natural, I have to really watch him, because he swallows all of the little crumbs/pieces. They will end up making him sick to his stomach and he throws up. I gave these chew bones 3 stars, because they aren't worth the money and they aren't edible. They should cost half the price. Its basically a hard piece of plastic. Now that my dog is bigger, I can't trust him with these bones and will no longer buy them. I recommend looking for something else thats more natural.",
