Lag spikes every 5-10 seconds means I freeze and other players teleport constantly. Absolutely unusable. Router has been updated, factory reset and manually configured to the best of my abilities.

The WPS feature is very easy to use as well, and ensures consistent and efficient setup of other devices.
