It\u2019s actually a replacement for an identical one that lasted about a year... the round stand in the back had broken at the connect point, but it was such a great case that it was worth repurchasing. If you\u2019re looking for durable, can take a drop, this case is it. It\u2019s like a very, very dense styrofoam.",
