Cons: fan comes with decorative lights with Mini threads. I ended up not using them, and instead went out and bought LED lights to replace them. I believe that they are brighter, and use a lot less electricity. I only gave this review four stars because the screws to mount the fan to the box were missing, and I had to spend a few minutes looking through a jar of screws to find What I needed.",

The installation is well thought out by their engineers. Anyone has installed fans will know what I mean. After install, I wanted to order another but the price went up tremendously. I am in communication with the supplier attempting to get another. This fan will not disappoint. It comes with the 3 bulbs, but I ordered led daylight bulbs because I have become used to this level of light now. Daylight led's are throughout my home.",
