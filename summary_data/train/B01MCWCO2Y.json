The gel pills don't leak, are possibly flavored as they are a pleasant and almost sweet flavor. Its also a great price for the quantity. My dog suffers from dry skin and this along with MCT oil has made him SO shiny with no more dandruff. I've tried MANY other fish, salmon and krill oils and none compare to this brand!",
