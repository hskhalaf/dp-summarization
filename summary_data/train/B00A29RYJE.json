I paid more because I was led to believe it was professional strength, not just the regular pet shampoo!!! So now do I just lose the $10 because they LIED, or return it and wait SEVEN DAYS after they get the product back to get my refundso I can buy the $26 bottle like it should be!! !!??? That is not right!!!",

I did everything exactly how my Kirby Owner's manual instructed me. After the carpet was completely dry and I had vacuumed it all up, the carpet still smelled like urine. So I did everything all over again. The smell is still there. Do not waist your time or money using the Kirby carpet cleaner or shampoo. Go rent a professional carpet cleaner and professional urine eliminator shampoo.",
