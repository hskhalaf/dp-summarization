If you are scared of intruders, make them scared of you. If you have rocky soil, rock out with these.",

The fit is very comfortable and the gloves without the claws are great for cleaning out under the mower without fear of getting cut on the blade.

Sure enough, Amazon had it, similar price, but Amazon had it with \"claws\" on both hands, so better value this way. Yesterday I put in our tomato plants and it was so easy! A lot of times I end of alternating between tools and my fingers, this gave both together! Awesome gadget. (Plus my son thinks it's monster gloves, he's trying to scare other kids with it, not that anyone's really scared. It's more of a curiosity than a scare.)",

I haven't tried clawing around in the dirt, but the tough plastic finger caps are deep enough to provide leverage for picking things up. They are also surprisingly comfortable. I have somewhat soft, thick hands, and I could put them on with just a slight feeling of support that made them feel like a second skin. Just make sure you buy the set with both hands clawed if that's the effect you're seeking; some pairs are on the market with only one clawed hand. Enjoy!",
