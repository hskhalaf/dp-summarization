      "text": "Awesome chips! Great crunch! Not too greasy. The jalapeno taste is awesome and it has just the right level of spiciness to them (I love spicy foods, so this will vary by person). I have tried all the other jalapeno flavored kettle cooked chips and these by far are the best! The only complaint, if I had to make one, is that it is a tiny bit too salty - but this will also vary by person. Overall, anyone that loves jalapeno kettle cooked chips, you should definitely consider trying these.",

Saves tons of $ versus a Vending machine. From the crispness of the kettle cooked chips to the Jalapeno zing, these are perfect! Plus, they arrived early!",
