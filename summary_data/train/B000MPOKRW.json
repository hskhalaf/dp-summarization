I tried cooking a pizza over a campfire, an old past time of mine, and we lost a pizza to the fire because of how unstable it is. When the fire was bigger it heated one of the legs and the internal elastic line melted. I'm bummed it has to go to the landfill.",

Lost quite a bit of food into the fire between the swaying and the uneven platform. My boyfriend had to keep holding it in place with tongs, especially when you flip the food. Also when we were taking it apart the day we were packing to go home, we found that the black elastic strings inside the tripod legs had melted and snapped in half. The legs still click together so it\u2019ll work, but it\u2019s still stupid they would make something designed to go over a fire that has parts that melt.",

Easily adjust the 17-in. diameter grill grate so it hangs over the fire at the perfect height for just the right amount of heat. When the meal is done, use the tripod to hang a lantern for just enough campsite light. When the fun is done, the shock-corded, durable galvanized steel legs collapse for convenient storage.",
