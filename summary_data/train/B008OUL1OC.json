They sound great only if you get them sealed to your ear correctly. If that's possible with the tips they provide, great. If not, give the Comply tips a shot. They worked wonderfully for me. The other issue I have is that they'll lose connection right when I turn them on, but it does reconnect shortly after. Other than that I would say if you're looking for a good pair of Bluetooth earphones, you have found them.",

Cons: the cord is pretty small, you can leave them around your neck and they can easily fall off if you're not careful. The Bluetooth disconnects at times, annoying but not a deal breaker",

That said, they are relatively inexpensive, sound ok for the price, so I purchased another pair. Again the sound was ok for the price, but the battery life was VERY poor. Advertised 8 hours with just music and at best last 2 hours. I returned them. There is a huge difference in sound quality and battery life for headphones <$100 and those $>100. Be careful.",

Each charge lasts a considerable time, and I love that they're wireless. Aesthetically, they are slightly bulky and don't fit super closely around your head.

It's not the machine--a loaded Dell XPS 27\" AIO Touch--it's the headphones. They've never reconnected easily on any phone, tablet, MP3 player, laptop, or TV I've used them with.

      "text": "I bought this to pair it with my Kindle. It pairs up nicely to the Kindle but I've found it doesn't always pick the kindle back up when you return back to it. So there is the inconvenience of going back into the bluetooth menu and connecting them back again. But I don't know if this is a Kindle issue or the headphones issue. Good sound and easy to wear since most of the weight is carry by the over the head strap. Does block out other sounds to some extent. So far the charge hasn't gone out on me. I'm thinking of buying another set for home as the current set stays at work.",

The design, construction, operation, and sound quality far exceeded anything I was expecting, especially for the price! Rich bass, super clarity, ease of operation, quick and simple pairing, and the list goes on! The comfort with wearing them, even with glasses is nothing short of amazing. Telephone call quality is unbelievable. Android and Windows operation flawless. I have a Roku 3 with the remote than can use headphones - you can screw the $1000 TV surround system. Put these on and you are in the movie! The 3.5mm jack is definitely a great touch. Nothing bad about these headphones. I only wish I got them in Red.",

One thing that this set had that I really wasnt aware of , but was pleasantly surprised by, was the built in microphone. It is really awesome for using with my phone. Bonus !!",

I'm not a huge bass guy, but I love a good clear bass line and this product delivers. On high volume, the apple ear buds are usually distorted. This sound quality is amazing with no distortion. Highly recommend especially for the price.",
