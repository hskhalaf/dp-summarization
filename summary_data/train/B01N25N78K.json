Sure it giggles but not what a child could have fun snuggling with. A cheaply made, poor version of what used to be a very cute toy. It also arrives in a plastic bag inside a brown corrugated box so it would look as if you got it at a local resale shop rather than new if you plan to give it as a gift.",
