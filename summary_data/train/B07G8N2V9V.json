Thought the color was going to be darker, but it is a bright silver. Ear pieces fit exactly around my ears, which is very comfortable compared to ear buds. Sound quality is good. Cord to actually connect (ie when I want them connected to my computer audio instead of bluetooth to my phone) is extremely short, so I wouldn't suggest these as a work headset. Overall, nice headset, good quality, and will definitely continue to use over ear-pods.",

The app also lets you control auto shut off times, custom equalizers, and what a special button does; I use it for the ambient passthrough feature. The case is sturdy and of good quality, the charging and auxiliary cables are pretty wimpy, but the headphones themselves feel excellent and sound great.",

Battery life not so great i am not getting more than 12 hrs. Try to increase bass with equalizer, the sound is distorted. Charging pin seems to be fishy.
