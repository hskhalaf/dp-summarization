      "text": "Good entry level compressor for small jobs like topping off car tires. The tank holds the charge with no leaks. You can shut off the tool hose so you can swap attachments. It recharges in a couple of minutes. The motor is loud, however. The hose is cheap but does work. It is what you would expect at this price point. It has an air blower/jet attachment which is very handy. You won't have to buy anymore canned air. You probably should be looking at a higher end air compressor if you expect to use air powered tools. All in all a good addition to my home shop.",

Thank you Amazon! I see other reviews complaining how this air compressor doesn't do this and that . This air compressor has a great price for what it is intended. If you want an air compressor for air tools and painting get one with much higher cfm and be prepared to spend quite a bit more money. Thank you",
