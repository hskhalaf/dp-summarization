      "text": "Some of the answers are literally just wrong, particularly in the 2nd test\u2019s integrated reasoning section. They also don\u2019t offer great essay section help (have no sample essays to look at nor any explanation on what your practice essay should look like. It feels irresponsible to sell a test-prep book with flaws and I\u2019m unsure where all the 5 star reviews came from. It\u2019s frustrating to sweat over one of the practice tests and then to have an insufficient answer group. After buying the book I took practice tests on the GMAT official website. The books tests are significantly easier and not a good indicator of how the test will appear. The overwhelmingly positive reviews for this review are baffling.",
