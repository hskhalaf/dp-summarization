The worst, which we did not see right away, was two deep gouges to the underside of the paddle housing which appeared to be impressions left by the fork points of a fork lift.

Best of all, the boat easily books across the water thanks to the three-position pedal cranks, which allow for one-, two, or three-person operation. Just settle in, place a beverage in the recessed drink holders, and start pedaling. The boat even includes built-in coolers for pop, water, and other cool beverages (the coolers can also function as storage areas). \n\n Other details include a folding canopy design; high-back support; a built-in motor mount; a protective vinyl rub rail; maintenance-free, oil-impregnated bronze bushings with rubber seals; a mooring cleat; and light-colored decks for maximum comfort on hot days. \n\n Specifications:\n\n * Capacity: 825 pounds \n * Length: 93 inches \n * Width: 65 inches \n * Height: 24.5 inches \n * Weight: 110 pounds \n * Deck: Pewter \n * Hull: Blue/teal \n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe Sun Dolphin five person is the most popular size pedal boat.
