      "text": "Solid. Great Construction. Simple. Here is the VERY IMPORTANT trick I have learned about it cleaning the WHOLE pool though. KEEP YOUR HOSES STRAIGHT WHILE IN STORAGE!! As soon as you get those things bent all bets are off. Bent hoses cause it to loop on itself and only clean a small portion, usually just the deep end. However, if you buy a hose hanger, like HoseHanger Pro it will straighten back out, or just lay them flat out in the sun. Even bent hose can be made straight again and when they are the system cleans the deep and the shallow ends and works great!",

I was skeptical and it was such a screaming deal that I bought this one on amazon figuring if I can't add the leaf skimmer acessory i'll just return it. Well it works great and I found out ofcourse the leaf skimmer can be purchased and added on afterwards for around $50 bucks.",

It does a beautiful job of cleaning walls and floors but don\u2019t expect it to do stairs unless they are very broad. Install will be uncomplicated as long as you observe the directions completely. Note that this cleaner does not work well under a pool cover as the hose is designed to float. Research your needs before flashing the cash",

Not as complicated nor in need of addtional parts (bag, weights, special pool pump inlets, etc.). It does require a little more attention getting in-and-out of pool. Also, if you have acorn dropping trees (oak) you will need to get them out of the pool first, as they are hard and will not pass the throat, stopping the pulse cleaning action and require getting the shell out with your finger. If you have a larger pool you will definitely need to purchase extra hose segments. I highly recommend purchasing the Zodiac Cyclonic Leaf Catcher CLC500.",

It works flawlessly to clean the entire pool except for the stairs and sunstep which I am completely fine with. Takes a little patience to get the jets right to push it where it needs to go consistently but once those are adjusted correctly you never have to touch them again. Keeps my pool looking clean and awesome and when a part eventually breaks replacements are cheap and readily available. I would definitely recommend.",

I just had surgery and we have a lot of medical bills and didn't have $400+ to replace it so we were looking for a less expensive option. This was the right price and had great reviews. We have had it running for a week now and the pool looks great. The only thing that surprised me is the \"pulse\" motion it uses to clean so the hose bops up and down. At first we thought something was wrong but googled it and found it was normal. I'll update if anything happens but so far so good.",
