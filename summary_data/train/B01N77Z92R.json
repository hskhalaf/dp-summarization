Also this kit comes with more than it shows, come with the hose for any water source like bucket, lake....also has the 2 liter or 20 0z connector fitting, carry/storage bag. So description was leaving out some very useful features and tools. I was mixed about it meaning didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d like it but found enough uses for it so keeping it.

The flexibility of using any kind of water source is amazing. Once you own it, you will discover so many uses. What I would like to see improved: Either longer battery life (lasts about 30 minutes on average), or faster charge time (about 2 hours). Or both. I would buy this tool again.",

The water wouldn't come out at all on the first, then the second one they sent had the pressure of a dripping bathroom sink. NO JOKE! I could spit and get the deck more wet. Such a shame as this would've been exactly what I needed had it worked as advertised. Maybe I will try in a year or two after some improvements have been made.",

Then I connected the HydroShot to my garden hose and pressure washed the siding removing the mold-like residue from the cedar. The tool performed better than expected.",

Not only does it NOT have enough power to even superficially wash boat cushions, or deck furniture (due to both lack of power and lack of volume of water), but the battery will run out and leave you stuck with a mess in the middle of trying to get things clean. DON'T FALL FOR THE ADVERTISEMENTS! If I could return this today, I would...but I got sent away to military duty and the time has passed for me to return it. Save yourself the frustration and just buy a real power washer...not this.",

I've tried to clean mold off a sidewalk drawing water from a garden hose with limited success using no cleaner.

    "description": "Style:w/20V Battery, Charger, & Cleaning Kit| Pattern Name:CleanerWhen you want cleaner vehicles, a cleaner outside to your home, just a cleaner life in general, you want this Hydroshot 20V Share Portable Power Cleaner with Accessories bundle. The Soap Dispenser adds soap right into the stream, so you don\u2019t have to mix it into a bucket first. The 7\u201d Cleaning Brush attachment scrubs hard to remove dirt with a low-pressure stream supporting it. And the Hydroshot even does windows with the Squeegee attachment. A 20-ft Draw Hose lets you pull water from the nearest lake, pool, or bucket. And now, with the Bottle Cap Attachment, you can screw on any 2-Litre soda bottle and take your fresh water with you. The 5-in-1 Pressure Nozzle lets you select from 5 different stream intensities: 0\uf0b0, 15\uf0b0, 25\uf0b0, 40\uf0b0 and a watering setting. And the Short Watering Lance lets you keep the plants happy, too. Plus, the Hydroshot is easy to use! It weighs less than 4 lbs with the battery attached, so even though it\u2019s spraying out 320 psi of pressure, almost anyone can control it with just one hand. So much more useful than a hose and nozzle, and so much easier to use than a traditional pressure washer with a tank and bulky hose. The perfectly portable yet powerful Hydroshot. Get one and get cleaning.",
