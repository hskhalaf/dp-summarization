Yes, I know it's supposed to be strong enough to basically hold the weight of my head, but having used a cervical collar for years, this is, hands' down, just plain hard. It's almost as though it's not foam, but some unforgiving material. This equates with being uncomfortable, at least, for me. The second issue I have is that the 2\" wide velcro in the back definitely keeps anything from moving or slipping, but at the same time, is also obnoxiously loud. I mean, LOUD. So, there you have it...pros and cons.",
