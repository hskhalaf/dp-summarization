I read a lot of reviews about lint being an issue but o have not had a problem at all with the white version. If you're a runner this is a great purchase.

It Broke after 2 months as it wen't into a constant boot loop. UPDATE - After Broken watch was replaced, the replacement ALSO Broke, which was then replaced by another broken 360, which was then also replaced by a 3rd broken 360 sport! I just opened my 4th replacement for this issue and the screen was completely shot, AGAIN! BROKEN! Motorolla continues to ship broken refurbs, it's as if they don't even test them. DO NOT BUY these things are complete garbage.",

The gps works great if you let it set up before taking off, about 30 seconds or less. The screen works good outdoors. As an original moto 360 owner the battery is even a big improvement.
