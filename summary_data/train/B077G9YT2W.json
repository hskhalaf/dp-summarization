No heel slippage in sprint or climbing efforts. Plenty stiff and vented. Size 44 is consistent with Mavic, Shimano and Pearl. Because of the boa system it does seem it would accommodate wider or taller feet. The R3 has more room in the toe box than any of my other shoes. Speedplay Zero fit perfectly. This is now my favorite shoe.",

There are not available in that size the closest size for a US mens size 10 on the fizik web site fit chart says 43.5. these shoes are way too big. don't waste your time or money.",
