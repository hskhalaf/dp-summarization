      "title": "Great sound quality, but they will break",
      "text": "It's sad. I love this style of headphone from Sony. I've had numerous models from them, starting with some of their classic egg styles in the past. The problem is that those, like these, suffer from subpar build quality. I bought two of these. Each one broke in the exact same way: the plastic pieces that hold the headphones in place broke. They both broke after 2-3 months of ownership. When they do break you see how poorly constructed they are. The plastic is very weak. Also, these are just headphones I wear at the office, while working at my desk. I'm not stuffing them into some overstuffed bag or throwing them around the house.",

These Sony cans have rejuvenated my listening to really immersing myself in the music, which, to warn you, has also inspired me to pump up the volume of my music as well (simply for enjoyment purposes). Haven't used them on a plane or train, but for sitting at home and at the office, they're great for blocking out what's going on in the outside world. I can't imagine getting a better pair of headphones for <$60, and these were only $30!",

They are balanced in the high and mid section as well and best of all: no crappy noise cancelling white noise (at least that I can hear). The lows are decent. In most pop/rock songs the lows are more than adequate, however, are lacking in most hip-hop songs. I know there are better, more expensive headphones out there, but these are a great budget audiophile set of headphones.",

The extra hi frequency range and lower response was what attracted me to the flame, and it burned! Worst feature: -There's no kick in the bass, and if I tried to max it out, it just distorted the track. -It's got SCREAMING hi's and very weak lows. Not what I was hoping for AT ALL! Best feature: they're cheap (U get what u pay for!) Soooo, I just bought a pair of Sennheiser HD-555's a sec ago. Hope they sound better than the 280's(from what I've read they do)",

I was surprised when I first put them on at how small the ear holes are. There is barely enough room for my whole ear to fit inside, but the edges of the padding are pressed against my ear, and it is uncomfortable. And I don't even have big ears. The ambient sound switch is retarded, it does nothing. Sound is good, but I want a more comfortable pair.",

So-so build quality, may break easily. Definitely worth $30, probably not more than $60, due to the discomfort. The triports sound slightly better and are much more comfy.",
