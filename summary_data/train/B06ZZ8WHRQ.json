And at 85cm it is substantially larger than my wife's other exercise balls. Definitely a great addition to our workout equipment collection.",

Great support and durability from what I can tell. I used an electric air mattress pump to inflate and it still took about six minutes. Can't imagine how long it would take to inflate the 95cm ball with the hand pump.",

I bought this exercise ball to bounce on while holding him and it works like a charm. Its high quality and I really like the color. It seems to be durable too, I've used it a lot to bounce the baby and its been hauled around our house (including thrown down the staircase multiple times). I'm assuming it would be great for exercise too, someday I'll get around to actually using it for that purpose.",

The sizing chart was totally accurate, I'm 5'10\" and got the 65 cm. Fits perfect for exercise and sitting at my desk as I write this.
