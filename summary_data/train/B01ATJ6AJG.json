I use twice as much grounds to make the same quart of coffee, and mine is concentrated - 1 part coffee with 2 parts water makes a cup of regular coffee. This just won't give me what I need, so I'll go back to using nut milk bags in a pitcher of water. A little more messy, but worth it. Buy this if you just want regular coffee cold brewed, but if you're looking for something stronger, find another way.",

In this way, coffee and water mixed thoroughly producing strong coffee. After 24 hours, I put the filter into the pitcher and pour the coffee and water mix into the pitcher through the filter. When done, store cold brew coffee in a fridge.",

The cap and threading are not the best and lacks some required space to fit the gaskets for the filter and lid to stay on securely. Best advice is to not lift this up by the cap and neck and instead grab the entire jar to prevent accidentally dropping it.",

No complexity. I recommend buying just cheap regular coffee because you will use A LOT of coffee beans if you use this device all summer. Fancy coffee is a waste when it comes to cold brews.

The parts themselves are very easy to clean with soap and water. I let them air dry after I'm done. I had a very slight issue with the filter and contacted the company. They were beyond helpful and amazing to communicate with!! I could not be happier with a product and company! I have 3 of these sets now they are so great. Highly recommend County Line Kitchen!!",

Wash filter in dishwasher versus hand wash occasionally and if storing brew unit. Recommend light and medium roast coffees to maximize caffeine (darker roast = less caffeine).",

Do keep in mind that the most concentrated weight ratio (water:coffee) i got was 11.5:1, i completely filled the strainer and put in 1.5 liters. Depending on where you research, they will suggest 6:1, but then will need to be watered down when you drink it. 11.5:1 can be drank straigh, but will be a strong coffee. I\u2019ve also tried 15:1 which is good regular strength coffee and can be drank without haveing to be watered down.",
