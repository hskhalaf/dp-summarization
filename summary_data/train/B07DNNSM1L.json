I'm sure there are other uses (much better uses lol), such as looking inside drains and stuff, BUT if you do decide to look inside your ear, please note the scope does get really warm after a few minutes. P.S. my ear is fine by the way, thank you for asking =P",

I am tired of tech items lacking proper documentation and this one proves my point. If documentation is lacking, I can just imagine how the manufacturers customer support is like. Amazon did offer to give me technical support and I greatly appreciate their offer. This is NOT a point and click camera so it needs proper documentation otherwise it should not be sold. PERIOD!!!",

The LEDs are bright enough to help get a clear HD picture and video of damaged components, even if they are black or dark gray. The recordable Micro SD card capability is a real safeguard that prevents customers from blaming us for pre-existing defects. How can you complain about a $30 wireless water resistant inspection cam. Use it at home or work. Wireless means you can keep the image steady while you maneuver the cam head around bends. I highly recommend this product.",

My only knick is that the company needs to hire some better copy editors. The setup instructions were not easy to follow. Once set up is done, however, it is very easy to use.",
