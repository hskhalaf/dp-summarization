Shark cleaned my house effectively especially picked up the pet hair in the mud room and amazingly picked up the long hair without tangling the brush roll. It\u2019s loud on the hard wood floor but I really don\u2019t care since I only use it while no one is around. it is very powerful to clean the pets hair.",

Seems as though many of the reviews are from Roomba fans (or the company) and they have a targeted campaign against shark. It's analogous to iPhone vs Android users. Competition brings out the best, and sometimes paying more doesn't always get you more. Very happy so far with my shark. Yes, it's a little loud but so is a vacuum... We have it scheduled for early mornings when there is ample light. Sensors get a little dirty but that is expected. It's a vacuum cleaner and it cleans! I'm frankly very happy to pay half the price and get the same quality!",

The biggest issue is mapping. I have been stuck at 33% for weeks. Without a complete map I'm unable to use all the features this vacuum has, most notably the ability the clean specific rooms.
