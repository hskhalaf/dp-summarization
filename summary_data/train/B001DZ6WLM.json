      "text": "I needed something a little better than the really old phone I'd bought years ago for emergencies and got something much better for great price. Iphones and others of that level don't appeal to me; I already own a computer, a camera, and so on and just wanted a way to make a call when needed. I don't need a 2-year contract with a phone company. This phone rarely needs charging since I do not leave it on all the time. When I need it, it is ready to go on and do its job. The sound is clear, the connections quick, and areas of use pretty good.",
