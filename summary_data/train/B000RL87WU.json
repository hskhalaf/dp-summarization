I have exceptionally thick and rather long hair, so the bottle only covered about 1/6th of my hair, but for someone with average thickness, I think it might fully cover all hair if its shoulder-length or shorter. Overall, I'd recommend it for touching-up roots or to covering a few grays.",

It's been over a week and I have noticed no fading and very little wash out as well. I'd also like to add that this hair dye was very easy to blend with my gradation/ombre look of black to teal to purple. I'd order again if I need more black any time soon!",

I must note that I also use once a week, Clenditioner in Copper color, in order to keep my color vibrant in between color retouches.",

It bleeds when i wash or wet it & it stained my hands when I styled my hair so I have to wear gloves just to do it which is annoying. Good thing that I only paid $2 for it. Maybe that\u2019s why it was so cheap cuz it\u2019s kind of a poor quality. I\u2019ll be going back to using splat",

Turns out, nope! Those dyes just sucked. This one gets you to the perfect, natural black color immediately with no extra steps! This will be my go-to from now on.",
