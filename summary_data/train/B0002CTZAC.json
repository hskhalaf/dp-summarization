The tripod was larger than expected. Once it got dark it we were looking at craters of the Moon, Jupiter, and Saturn within minutes. It's a smaller telescope so planets don't have great detail, but it picks up Saturn's rings and the four Galilean moons of Jupiter with the lowest magnification. Love the slow motion altitude adjustment, which isn't available on lower models. If you are brand new to telescopes, invest some time reading the manual and expect some learning curve, but this is a great place to start.",

I was able to see the details of the moon easily and saw 4 of Jupiters moons. I live just outside seattle, so there is light pollution, but that didnt matter.

The Barlow lens is worthless, even using the 20mm (though i'm not sure why--should be less magnification with Barlow + 20mm than with 4mm alone). All in all, pretty good for the money.",

    "title": "Celestron - PowerSeeker 60AZ Telescope - Manual Alt-Azimuth Telescope for Beginners - Compact and Portable - BONUS Astronomy Software Package - 60mm Aperture",
    "description": "Style:60AZ Refractor| Configuration:Telescope Only\n\nWhether you\u2019re an amateur astronomer or becoming more comfortable with using a telescope, you\u2019ll love the technology and user-friendly features packed into Celestron\u2019s PowerSeeker refractor telescope. The Celestron PowerSeeker 60AZ is a powerful yet easy-to-use telescope. Our PowerSeeker Series telescopes for astronomy beginners have been designed with a combination of value, quality, power, and user-friendly features. They are built to enhance the experience for beginners but are also exceptional for mid-level experienced astronomers. This 60AZ telescope features powerful magnification and easy-to-use controls that allow users to obtain crisp views of the Moon, the rings of Saturn, and Jupiter\u2019s Galilean moons.\n\nThe telescope\u2019s sturdy and durable yoke mount and slow-motion rod deliver smooth and accurate pointing. Move the slow-motion altitude rod in an up/down fashion to pinpoint and track your object. The 3x Barlow lens is added to triple the magnification power of the included 20mm and 4mm eyepieces. We\u2019ve included an accessory tray to store accessories conveniently and a free download of our BONUS Starry Night Basic Edition astronomy software with information on 36,000 celestial objects, printable sky maps, and more. The software can be used on your Mac, PC or laptop. It\u2019s the best way to learn about the night sky and plan your next observing session. Additional accessories include a tripod.\n\nYou can purchase this Celestron telescope with confidence from the world\u2019s #1 telescope brand, based in California since 1960. You\u2019ll also receive a 2-year warranty and unlimited access to technical support from our team of US-based experts. Tom Johnson founded Celestron in 1960 after building a telescope to share the night sky with his sons. Since then, Celestron has established itself as the world\u2019s #1 telescope brand. Celestron telescopes are used by scientists in world-class research observatories and even aboard the International Space Station.\n\n\n\nAMAZON.COM\nCelestron's value priced PowerSeeker 60 is an affordable entry level telescope with some nice extras like a correct image prism and \"The Sky\" astronomy software included. The package also includes an Alt-Azimuth mount with adjustable aluminum tripod, high and low power eyepieces, a 3X barlow lens, and a 5 power cross hair finder scope. \n\nThe PowerSeeker 60AZ comes disassembled in a compact box, but the fully illustrated quick set-up guide makes it easy to assemble. Go ahead and try it out in the daytime, that's the best time to align the finder scope while looking at a distant tree or telephone pole. \n\nThe optics of the PowerSeeker 60AZ are surprisingly good, especially when I use the low power 20mm eyepiece. The correct image prism and the 20mm eyepiece give me a magnification of 35X, so backyard birds seem five times closer than with my seven power binoculars. My first view of Saturn's rings and globular cluster M13 in the constellation Hercules came with a 60mm telescope similar to the PowerSeeker 60, and the new PowerSeeker 60AZ is just as good showing me literally hundreds of craters on the Moon. \n\nThe PowerSeeker 60 can be upgraded with standard 1.25 inch telescope eyepieces. A 25mm plossl eyepiece for example gives a true field of view of almost 2 degrees for delightful views of star clusters like the Pleiades, while a 6mm eyepiece provides a magnification of 117X, just right to see the rings of Saturn or the cloud bands on Jupiter. The Alt-Azimuth mount included with the PowerSeeker 60AZ is lighter and easier to use than an Equatorial mount, but it does not track stars and planets. As soon as you get the Moon centered in the eyepiece it starts drifting toward the edge, this is caused by rotation of the Earth. The Moon may stay in the low power eyepiece for two or three minutes, but with the high power 4mm eyepiece (175X magnification) a star will disappear in only twenty or thirty seconds. \n\nCelestron's PowerSeeker 60AZ is a real value because it has surprisingly good optics in a package that's light, portable and affordable. The drawback is that it has a lot of plastic parts, including the finder scope and the 3X barlow. For a more rugged alternative, take a look at Celestron's AstroMaster 70AZ which has more powerful optics, better eyepieces, and a much sturdier Alt-Azimuth mount. --Jeff Phillips \n\nPros: \n\n * Surprisingly good optics \n * Correct image prism \n * Easy no tool set-up \n * Light, portable, and affordable \n\nCons:  * Does not track stars and planets \n * Plastic finder and barlow lens \n * Light weight tripod \n\n\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nFrom the Manufacturer PowerSeeker 60 AZ - General Features \n\n * Quick and easy no-tool setup\n * Slow motion controls for smooth tracking\n * Erect image optics - Ideal for terrestrial and astronomical use\n * Fully coated glass optical components with high transmission coatings for enhanced image brightness and clarity\n * 3x Barlow lens triples the magnifying power of each eyepiece\n * Accessory tray for convenient storage of accessories\n * \"The Sky\" Level 1 planetarium software with 10,000 object database and enhanced images\n\nDetails Celestron PowerSeeker telescopes are a great way to open up the wonders of the Universe to the aspiring astronomer.
