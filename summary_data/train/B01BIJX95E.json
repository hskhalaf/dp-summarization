I bought this to strengthen my knee after total knee replacement so being able to start on the lowest option & work my way up was great. I never could have used it without that option. I left it in the kitchen & did a certain amount of repetetions each time I was in the kitchen. This allowed me to do fewer at a time & still get the same number needed for the day. That also worked well immediately after surgery since just a few steps was very difficult.",

It's a GREAT concept, to stash the legs underneath and conserve storage space, but unfortunately, wasn't constructed well enough. Also, the surface is slicker than preferable as it's just stamped plastic and not some sort of rubbery/grippy surface.",
