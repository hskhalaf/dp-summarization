      "verdict": "Merrell Chameleon 7 Limit Stretch has earned both praises and criticisms. It is hugely appreciated for being comfortable right out of the box. Its easy slip-on style and grip on a variety of surfaces were also noticed. Despite being a good-value shoe, it had fit issues and premature wear and tear. Potential buyers are advised to fit this model in a store before making a purchase to get the right size. Overall, this issue aside, this footwear has attributes that will be useful on the trail.",
