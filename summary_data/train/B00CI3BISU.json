I do not actively use this hard drive on a daily basis, but it rather gets used behind the scenes by my Tablo devices multiple times per day. And I can happily say that I've had zero issues with it. It was formatted correctly, and has worked as advertised. Actual storage space after formatting was 492 GB, which is to be expected. If you are looking for a drive to use daily, I recommend the WD Elements drive - it is extremely reliable and has caused zero issues for me.",

We all know how computers can unexpectedly die, so this is good \"insurance\" that your photos and documents won't be lost. You just plug it into the USB port on your computer and you can start downloading. You do not need an additional electrical outlet (which was what was necessary for my old clunker backup hard drive that was also much larger but had less storage than this one). I highly recommend this product.",

The external hd itself is slim and about the dimensions of a wallet. Thus, it is very portable as the name suggests. Hooking it up is easy as pie. Take it out of the box and hook it up to your pc using the included cord. Also, if you want really fast transfer speed, plug it into your USB 3.0 connection. Currently pushing over 1GB transfer rate and it's sweet! For the price, you really can't go wrong with this.",
