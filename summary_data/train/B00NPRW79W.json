What I really like about it is that it is small, modern looking and functional with network access to the inserted USB stick via smb:// on your PC/iMAC. Only the v3 has the USB 2.0 Port - so be careful. No need to Flash it with AdvancedTomato as it works with NordVPN directly, unless you want to use OpenVPN instead of L2TP. On the downside the Linksys Router Settings Dashboard is nasty, clunky and extremely basic.",

The setup took a few minutes and was up and running fine. The setup automatically created a guest network and since I did not want that, I had to later go and disable that. The firmware upgrade is automatic and gives notification if there is a newer firmware available. The range appears to be good. I've used it at a distance of up to 20 metres with a couple of walls thrown in between and it worked fine. Will definitely recommend this router",

The product looks quite sleek but does show finger prints easily. There is also no obvious light on the product (apart from the back) so you'll need to take a closer look if you start having WiFi issues. Also note that unlike the picture shown, this product doesn't stand up. It lies flat.",
