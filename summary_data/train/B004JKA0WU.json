Other than that, very sharp looking watch. Beefy, great luminescence at night once you've lit it up with a flash light. Masculine look and feel. Plus the solar power (Eco-drive) for it means never replacing a battery. Keeps time perfectly. Have not had to adjust it a single time - no seconds gain/loss month to month.",

Because of the styling and dial structure it can definitely go into an office setting and a night on the town. The date has gotten the biggest complaint but I have no problem with it. Easy to set time and date, and another worth the investment. When your wrist is sweaty or wet the strap will rotate ad expected, but that's really it. Glad it's solar so never have to worry about the battery or winding!",

What more could you ask for? Not wanting to wear it just for diving, he puts it on anytime he isn\u2019t working. He has yet to dive with it, but knows it will be fabulous.

This seems to be more of an issue with this watch than most of my others. I think it may be due to the rubber used in the strap.",

My only gripe is the date window is a little small and it\u2019s deep below the face so if you\u2019re not looking at it directly from the top it can be hard to read.

The luminescence glows for a few hours at least, if charged in the light first.

With a 47mm case diameter and a 14mm case thickness I was concerned that the watch might be too big. While it is bigger than my other watches, it fits really well and does not overpower my arm.
