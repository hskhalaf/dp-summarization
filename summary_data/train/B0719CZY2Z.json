The Seeml kit allows you to collect and test at least 3 samples where many others only include one and there are hidden additional fees. I received the results promptly and they provided me with more information about the results and type of mold then previous labs I've used. They also called to see if I had any questions or needed any additional assistance. This kit is highly recommended not only for the price but for the quality of the testing and followup assistance from the lab.",
