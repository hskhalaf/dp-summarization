It works great and the angled design makes getting into corners a snap. I also like the added features, such as the ability to adjust pressure and the choice between rapid fire and single burst. Before my purchase, I had once used my brother-in-law's air compressor nail gun kit, and my nail gun is so much easier to use. No hoses or wires and no air compressor noise. Of course, my Dewalt is heavier to hold due to the necessary battery that is attached to it. All in all, a great purchase for me.",

      "text": "This has become one of my favorite tools in the 6 months or so I have owned it. Yes it's a little heavy, but you get used to that. It does make a strange, unexpected sound when the safety is pressed against your workpiece as the flywheel is engaged. This too you get used to, just warn unsuspecting first time users. It drives the nails just as well as my Bostitch 16g air nailer, just not as light weight. Sure beats having to lug out the compressor and airhose on those smaller jobs or up on a scaffold.",

The nail gun loaded easily, the task light was very helpful and I can't beleive I didn't buy this tool earlier. The carrying case was a nice additon and since I already had the 18V battery from my Dewalt drill, there was no down time over the course of a full day's work.",

    "title": "DEWALT DC618K XRP 18-Volt Cordless 1-1/4 Inch - 2-1/2 Inch 16 Gauge 20 Degree Angled Finish Nailer Kit",
    "description": "AMAZON.COM\n\n\nEnjoy the power and efficiency of pneumatic nailing with the DEWALT DC618K heavy-duty 20-degree angled finish nailer kit, which can drive 16 gauge nails from 1-1/4 to 2-1/2 inches in length as rapidly as five nails per second. This cordless nailer is powered by DEWALT's 18-volt XRP batteries, and this kit comes with one battery and a 1-hour charger.\n\nThe 20-degree angled DC618K nailer\n(view larger). DC618K 18-VOLT, 16 GAUGE, 20-DEGREE ANGLED FINISH NAILER KIT AT A GLANCE:\n * Consistent nail penetration into both soft and hard joints\n   \n   \n * Sequential and bump operating modes\n   \n   \n * Integrated LED lights\n   \n   \n * Includes one battery and 1-hour charger\n   \n   \n * Three-year limited warranty; two-year free service\n\nPOWER AND PERFORMANCE\nThe DC618K's engine design allows the tool to work as fast as you do with consistent nail penetration into both soft and hard joints. The 20-degree angled magazine (with up to 120-nail capacity) will accept DEWALT and Paslode 20-degree nails, and it has a rear-load magazine. You'll have easy access to the nosepiece for the removal of jammed nails without the use of screwdrivers or tool wrenches, and the contact trip lock-off allows trigger to be disabled when not in use.\n\nCOMFORT AND CONVENIENCE\nYou can select sequential operating mode to ensure precision placement of each nail or a bump operating mode that allows you to harness top speed. A 6 position dial enables you to move between applications without having to re-acquire exact depth setting. And at just 8.5 pounds, this tool is lightweight for easy maneuvering and reduced operator fatigue. This nailer also includes integrated LED lights for perfect placement in low-lit or shadowy areas.\n\nDEWALT'S XRP EXTENDED-LIFE BATTERY SYSTEM\nA tool's only useful if it runs long enough to get the job done, and the DEWALT XRP extended run time batteries keep the DC618K running at full tilt. They provide up to 40 percent more run time than standard Ni-Cad batteries, and any XRP battery can be used with any 18-volt DEWALT tool, which allows you to expand your system by adding other DEWALT cordless tools (sold separately) as the demands of your job grow.\n\nThe DC618K comes with one 18-volt XRP battery and a 1-hour charger.\n\nWARRANTY\nThis DEWALT tool is backed by three-year limited warranty covering any defects due to faulty materials or workmanship (from the date of purchase). It's also covered by DEWALT's two-year free service contract, where DEWALT will maintain the tool and replace worn parts caused by normal use--for free.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\nDEWALT DC618K 20-degree angled nailer; 18-volt XRP battery; 1-hour charger; reversible belt hook; no-mar tip; safety glasses; operating instructions\n\nThe DC618K engine works as fast as you do--driving up to five nails per second (view larger). \n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe DEWALT DeWalt DC618K Cordless Angled Finish Nailer combines the precision of hand nailing with the speed and ease of pneumatic nailing. With this one compact, portable tool, you can drive nails ranging in length from 1-1/4 to 2-1/2 inch as rapidly as five nails per second. And best of all: no compressor to buy and no air hose to drag around. The 8.5-lb. tool is powered by a rechargeable 18-volt battery and shoots readily available 16-gauge finish nails. Its 20-degree angled, rear-load magazine holds 110 nails, and is specially designed to seal out dust and debris that can cause the nailer to malfunction. The DC618K can fire nails through softwood, hardwood, and plywood and other sheet goods. It\u2019s an ideal tool for trim carpenters, cabinetmakers, and others who routinely install baseboard, shoe, crown and chair rail moldings, paneling, hardwood flooring, staircases, and window and door casings and jambs. The tool\u2019s narrow nose and angled magazine allows it to fit into tight spaces, such as under toe kicks and inside of cabinets. Choose between two operating modes: Sequential for precise one-at-a-time nailing, or high-speed Bump firing for rapid production work. Other features include: precise depth-control mechanism, swing-open nosepiece for clearing jams, safety contact lock-off that disables the trigger, a no-mar tip, and a reversible belt hook. The DC618K 18-Volt 16-Gauge Angled Finish Nailer Kit comes with an 18-volt XRP NiCad battery, one-hour charger, reversible belt hook, safety glasses, and plastic storage case. It\u2019s backed by a DEWALT 90-day money-back guarantee, and three-year limited warranty, and two-year service contract on the XRP battery.",
