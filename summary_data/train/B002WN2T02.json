I virtually wear them 4-6 hours at the time & they keep me dry & wear good both with and without socks. When I'm doing jobs that I can wear my jeans, the jean legs easily tuck down into the boot, very well. And when I'm doing jobs that require my rubber suit for pressure washing, they overlap outside the boot nicely also. Great quality at a tremendous value.. Highly recommend!",

Also, there is no insole, just a completely flat rubber feel. Lastly, the size 10 boots smell like a chemical factory! I cannot believe how different these boots are just by buying a different size.
