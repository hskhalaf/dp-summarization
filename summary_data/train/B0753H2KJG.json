It comes turned on so anytime the box was jossled it made noises. We had to take it out of the box and attempt to locate the off switch so that way it didn't constantly go off. Unfortunately there is no off switch, but you can turn the volume down completely. So far it seems like a decent toy for the price. Not completely sure on the durability yet though since it was just opened",
