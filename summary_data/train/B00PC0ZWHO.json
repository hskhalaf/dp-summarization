      "text": "Although I absolutely love Jane Iredale- This one I believe to either have gone bad or a fake somehow. This was my first time purchasing this item via Amazon back in January 2017. It is now August 2017, so I have been able to thoroughly test it. This product, in general, has always looked lovely, but this specific item has been awful. I was hoping it was just my brush or moisturizer or primer or what have you. Moving forward, I will just be buying from the spa or online.",
