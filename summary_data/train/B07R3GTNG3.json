It looks like someone took a needle and scratched the ever loving hell out of the screen, two of these scratches are deep and very noticeable even with the screen turned on and can be a bit distracting. Aside from it's outer condition, it at least it works fine, and if you don't mind beat up looking devices, it's a very entertaining little toy. Just hoping mine was a fluke and no one else ends up with one that looked like this.",

With average use the battery lasts 7 days. I've used good brand name and cheapo ones and it was still one week. That's the only downside is if you plan on playing for a long time, get yourself a good size pack of batteries so you have them on hand.",

If you're looking for a good Tamagotchi, I would recommend version 4.5, or the Tamagotchi P's.

Im not going to spend another $50 just to get a second tamagotchi so I can visit sport town. They should make an alternative way to see it, like use the app 5 times.

A minor peeve, but: 1. The screen has scuffs on it (I'm not sure if that's from the factory or the shipping) 2. These are expensive, and rightfully so, however they are mailed out in flimsy bubble envelopes, which has caused some kind of damage to 2/4 product boxes so far. Some of us like to keep our boxes for collection purposes. Anyway, bottom line, thankyou Bandai for making these available in English finally, and please bring us more in future.",

One of the screens have a yellow tint/hue compared to the other one's which is a bit annoying cause white colors look more yellowish.

      "text": "I'm in love with my new friend. The tamagotchi itself is super cool, the whole community is really nice. The \"shell\" is good, really steady and easy to hold, the screen(!) had some scratches and some weird spots under the screen itself, not super happy about that but it hasn't been super distracting. Overall really happy with it, you pay for the design and for the mini game, which is pretty cool. I'm thinking of getting one for my sister so we can play together",

No scratches or anything bad. I'm a collector, so the boxes are important to me as well. So i am a bit disappointing on that part. Also, pre ordered, prime and all, and it arrived two weeks later than release date.",
