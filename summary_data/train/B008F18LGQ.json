I started on the middle setting of '3' and after the toast started to catch fire, it went downhill from there. There is an annoying 'beep' before your 'charcoal' pops up and the high-lift lever in my unit didn't work so I used my bamboo tongs to fish out my 'flaming hockey pucks of death'. Needless to say, I do not recommend this toaster, even to Batman (who likes things dark).",

I use gluten free, egg free, dairy free bread so I have to watch the settings 3 works for a good solid toast, avoid four unless you have some thick german style multi-grain bread or bagel. The red colour is a typical KitchenAid red or medium cherry red but not deep cherry red. Looks stylish, match the KitchenAid kettle I have and makes a decent toast you can also rap the cord under the toaster if you don't plug it in everyday.",

You don't go through amazon.com but through Kitchen Aid's customer service website. As long as the toaster breaks within the year warranty then you are covered. The new toaster I was sent has a year warranty too. So far the new toaster has been great. I keep it on setting one because it is pretty powerful and will burn your toast easily if you aren't careful. Heavy duty and easy to clean. Quality merchandise.",

It is easy to use; easy to clean; has a special bagel setting, and a dependable eject button. I was thrilled the first time I used it and didn't have to wait forever for my bread to become toast.

It does beep when its done, which I think is great because if I am doing other things, it lets me know my toast is done. I would recommend this product to everyone!",

While attempting to adjust the darkness dial (Levels 1-5), any setting over 2 would burn the toast leaving the upper ranges (3-5) relatively useless. I manipulated both the darkness setting and ensured the BAGEL setting was OFF, however the toaster continued to malfunction and burn toast. Unsatisfactory.",
