The premise is still the same, a limited amount of time to uncover the truth behind the outbreak and survivors to rescue. Weapons can be combined to create powerful new ones. My favourite part is the sandbox mode, a free-roaming unlimited time mode where you can complete challenges and explore Fortune City. There is online multi-player, but no local multi-play.",

To me it's an alternate version of DR2, which is pretty cool! I've noticed a couple of glitches that I've found on another site that happen to occur sometimes, like a zombie falling out of the sky and them perfectly fine lol. Another weird one is I encountered not being able to attack with my weapon at the time, and Frank starts moving on his own. But besides all that it is an awesome game, and it is really fun!!!",

Off the record is a little bit better constructed than the original deadrising, and I love the camera feature that is brought back from deadrising 1. Off the record IS NOT A NEW DEADRISING it is just a little bit different from the original deadrising 2, new character,new places in the mall,new combo weapons,and new enemy`s to fight,and of course the camera feature. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes any of the deadrising games,its worth buying.",
