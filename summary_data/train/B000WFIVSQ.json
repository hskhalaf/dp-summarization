She hasn't had a reaction to them and doesn't seem bothered when I wipe her. I suggest storing these in an airtight container or ziplock bag so they don't dry out. This is one of many great Earthbath products.",

At the same time, they weren't able to absorb moisture from wet or muddy feet. Moreover, they were incompletely cut, so removing one from the dispenser required two hands, Finally, I found them too small; unfolded they were still not large enough to keep my hand from the surface being wiped.",

I wouldn't use these to really clean my dog; but they are great for in-between, or wiping off paws and belly after a long walk or dog park visit.",
