Gets stains out, smells great, but the smell doesn't stay after drying (which is normal for natural scents) I use it for whites and colors and it keeps my colors bright. So far this is the only brand that has worked for me that is a 1 on the EWG. If you get the unscented I think it is lower, but I like the scent. For reference I live in Southern California and have horrible hard and chlorinated water and this works great for me! Finally found a winner after trying 5 other EWG recommended brands",
