The actual stem is really close to the rotating ball so if you try to use a spanner wrench it will strip the stem nut. A 17mm wrench must be used. Personally, I feel that a shower head at this price point would have everything near perfect and I didn't find that to be the case. Especially since a $19.99 shower head from WallyWorld has plenty of space for tightening the stem nut.",
