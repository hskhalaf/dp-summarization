      "text": "Have only been using this pot for a few weeks to make the coffee for church, so don't know how long it will last, but so far I'm very happy with it. It takes about a minute per cup, we have been using hot tap water to start with and it reduces your brew time by about 1/3. It is a little noisy when it first starts perking. It sounds like it's trying to launch into orbit, then quiets down after it gets going. Attractive coffeepot, so far I like it a lot and the coffee tastes good, doesn't leave many grounds in the bottom.",

We chose \"two\" 55-cup urns this time for the ability to have two coffee stations going instead of a single line. Plus, the smaller urns are easier to handle and to clean. We love having the two coffee stations. The West Bend coffee urn is the workhorse of coffee urns.",
