The design is much better than old style models, the cartridge is locked in underneath and no chance of it dislodging while pouring water. I have now dispensed with all my Brita cartridges that had to go in kettle and coffee machine and just fill everything from this jug. Much cheaper than Brita for the jug and the spare cartridges and a superior design",

Very happy with this purchase. Love the easy fill lid, just slide the slots open, fill with tap water, then close again. Careful not to overfill as it can spill a bit if there is too much water and you pour to fast. But simple enough to avoid doing that. Makes the water taste so much nicer!",

I've been using it for about two weeks and it seems to be working well. I never drink water straight from a filter as I prefer the taste of tap water, but I have to use filtered in my kettle otherwise it has a metallic taint to it. This filter jug results in good tasting tea so it must be doing it's job. It's also really easy to fill, pours better than my old jug (it WAS very old and a bit leaky) and looks smart.

Update: The first filter worked fine for the 60 days. It was changed 6 days ago and was also OK for a few days until it started taking an hour to drain through. Writing to Optima to see what they are prepared to do. I again changed the filter yesterday and will see if that last longer than a week!",
