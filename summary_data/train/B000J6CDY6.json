He loves the river water sound and it helps him fall asleep faster. Helps to drown out noise too. The other sounds have been helpful when we want to distract him in car rides. The only thing I wish is that there is an option to leave sound on constantly (vs 25 or 45 mins). Some of my friends told me their babies didn\u2019t respond to this- but I say give it a try!!! You\u2019ll never know unless you try. Good luck",

Since he always slept well ( me too over the monitor) I ordered another just for the sound box as there is no replacement for just that part. The whale sound is not the same, none of the sounds are. I am very disappointed. I really thought if he had the same sound that he slept so well to in the past it would help him now. Boo!",

Don't let it fool you, it's not a tiny version of the big one, it's still a decent size. Our little one seemed to like white noises in the earlier months, so this sheep went with us everywhere. The volume control is great (many baby toys come in mute or super loud only). The two timing options (23 vs. 45 mins) are great as well. I usually just leave it at 45 mins though. The battery lasts quite a long time. We used it everyday for a few months before we had to replace it.",

Really, the sounds are based on preference but are not obnoxious like some I have encountered. The volume dial is very versatile from soft to loud. Nice product. Worth the buy.",

Having both the regular size and smaller size, definitely just get the larger! Because it is soft, it really doesn't take up that much more space and the larger size will be so much more cuddly!",

It attaches onto the crib rail with a velcro strap. The fabric lamb is very soft nice quaility. It has a timer, and a volume control. The only negative, and it's not that bad, is that the whale sounds are a little scary, but the other 3 sounds are very nice and natural. I would recommend this product.",

Without having to get out of bed, I simply press the rain sounds button--my favorite setting--and inevitably I fall back asleep. I enjoy it so much, my 11-year-old son wants one!

The \"gurgling stream\" sound is the clearest/most soothing to us, \"rain\" sounds like higher-pitched white noise, \"ocean\" sounds like freeway traffic and the whale sounds are on too short a loop (gets repetitive). So overall, could use improvement on the sound quality but this is a great soother and the rigid audio unit is removable so sleep sheep can be cuddled at a later stage.",

    "description": "Color:Sleep Sheep on the GoA compact version of the award winning original Sleep Sheep, this adorable travel companion brings its comforting sleep time sounds with you when you are away from home. Similar to the original Sleep Sheep, the On The Go version has four soothing sounds to help your child sleep easier; however its convenient size (8\" tall) fits easily in a diaper bag or luggage. On The Go is especially helpful in calming children to sleep in an unfamiliar environment.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nSoothe your child into a restful, relaxing nap or night of sleep with the Sleep Sheep from Cloud b. This soft, adorable and compact sleep time pal plays calming sounds and is great for home or on-the-go use--anywhere baby needs a little extra help drifting into dreams. \n\n \n\nFour Soothing Nature Sounds\nWinner of several industry awards, including the National Parenting Council's Seal of Approval and the iParenting Media Award, the Sleep Sheep is plush and very cuddly, so it immediately gives a restless child something pleasing and calming to hold on to. It also creates a tranquil environment with four soothing nature sounds, including gentle stream, spring showers, ocean waves and harmonious whale sounds, making the Sleep Sheep a kind of audio pacifier that helps take some of the stress and crankiness out of rest time. Great For On-the-Go Parents\nThe Sleep Sheep is specially designed to be easy to take with you on outdoor excursions or car trips. It comes with a Velcro strap that allows for fast and simple attachment to car seats and strollers. As you drive or push baby through the grocery store, he'll be able to take a breather. And because he's relaxed, you can focus on task at hand, which makes running errands more productive.\n\nUser-Friendly Operation\nThe Sleep Sheep features user-friendly operation that both big and little hands can handle. Select sounds by simply pressing the push button, and then choose the most comfortable volume. For added convenience and to save battery power, the sounds automatically time out after either 23 or 45 minutes--giving your little one plenty of time to drift off to dreamland.\n\nCompact and portable, the Sleep Sheep stands eight inches tall and takes two \"AA\" batteries (included). The sound box removes if your child simply wants to use the Sleep Sheep as a stuffed toy, and clean-up is a snap--just wipe the surface with soap and water.\n\nAbout Cloud b\nCloud b, the baby sleep specialist, was established by two new mothers with the philosophy that every baby deserves a sound night's sleep for healthy development. That's why all of Cloud b's products are developed in consultation with an advisory board of pediatricians and sleep specialists with a single focus: to achieve a better, safer sleep for baby.\n\nWhat's in the Box\nOne Sleep Sheep and two \"AA\" batteries.\n\nThe On-the-Go Sleep Sheep offers:  * Cuddly plush toy that provides soothing sounds. \n * Built-in Velcro strap for easy attachment to strollers and car seats. \n * Timer shuts off the sound after either 23 or 45 minutes. \n\n\n\nShown together with larger Sleep Sheep.\n\n\n\n\n\nBRAND STORY\nBy Cloud B\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nA compact version of the award-winning original Sleep Sheep, this adorable travel companion brings its comforting sleep time sounds with you when you are away from home. Similar to the original Sleep Sheep, the On The Go version has four soothing sounds to help your child sleep easier; however its convenient size (8\" tall) fits easily in a diaper bag or luggage.
