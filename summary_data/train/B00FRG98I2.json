It doesn't seem to be sensitive enough if you are trying to count steps while walking around the house or shopping or walking a dog - any time you have to stop frequently. It doesn't count a lot of those steps.",

    "description": "Get fitter, healthier and happier with Fitbug's newest activity tracker. The Fitbug Orb is a discreet, button-sized device that tracks your activity around-the-clock. From steps and aerobic steps to calories burned, distance walked and even your sleeping patterns, the Fitbug Orb sends all this data wirelessly to your smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth Smart technology. You can then view all your progress in one place - on the Fitbug app, or on the robust Fitbug member portal. Super-sleek and available in three eye-catching colours: white, hot pink and black, you can choose how to wear the Fitbug Orb. With several different accessories, including wrist strap, belt clip, lanyard, which are included in the box in matching colors, you can transform your Orb into a fashion statement or hide it discreetly under your clothing. Push, stream or set up the 'Beaconing' mode for the Orb on the app; it's up to you to decide how to upload your steps and sleep data to the Fitbug account hosted on the Fitbug app. All it takes is a click of the button on the Orb to send your steps to the app. What's more, the Fitbug Orb comes with an online platform and your personal digital coach. Here you can log what you've eaten and set goals. Realistic targets are set for you to hit based on your information.
