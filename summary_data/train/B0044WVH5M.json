      "text": "My toddler went to a preschool that taught him all letters, sounds, 1-10, and shapes and colors by 18 months. When we moved I didn't want to lose what he had learned so we started with the Teach my Toddler kit and then the Teach My Preschooler. He's just turned 3 and counts to 100(thanks to the cards) he prefers to draw on paper with crayons but is drawing shapes and numbers. You are your kids first teacher, dont wait for school to teach them...their little minds are ready. Your toddler can read if you teach them. Start with these kits.",

The magnetic writing board already has dead spots that don't appear when writing on it. I have no words for how disappointed I am in this set.

The little board is cute, but the pencil is loose it's not attached to the board like most magnetic boards which can be a big con since this is a preschooler kit and they tend to loose everything.
