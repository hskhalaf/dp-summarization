Everyone considering this pillow should know, it is EXTRA FIRM - feels like a car seat rather than a pillow. It also SMELLS funny - and no, the smell does NOT go away (I've had this for over a month and it still smells like wet dog).

If you need a pillow to handle your upright sleeping needs, I recommend this pillow. The pillow is kind of heavy so keep that in mind if you plan to lug the pillow around the house.",

I chose this one and after 24 hours of letting the pillow expand I was disappointed with the amount of give it had when I leaned on it. Not functional at all for keeping me mostly upright. But after a full 48 hours, it had really filled out and is totally deserving of a 5-star rating. Good back support and the memory foam is very cushy while keeping a firm shape. It's exactly what I was hoping for.",

Would recommend this to anyone who needs support or who wants to master the lazy life. Oh and my dog approves of it",

I would give another star if they had a leg bar and head bar for tall persons. A pouch on both arms would be nice to hold things like a remote and a book.
