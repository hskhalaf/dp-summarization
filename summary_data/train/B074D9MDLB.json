Ended up having to jackhammer and scoop out 960lbs of concrete because Amazon install person didn't mix the concrete and still hadn't set in the middle after 3 weeks. Happiness guarantee from the Amazon installer side was terrible to work with. Won't take calls, only emails and takes days-weeks to get back to you. Hire a contractor you get to interview. Don't use amazon.",

      "text": "When we moved into our new home, our son's only request was a new basketball goal. After shopping around and debating whether the extra money to by a Goalrilla Goal was worth it, we are SO HAPPY we made the investment. We purchased the goal in the summer, but we didn't want to write a review until it had been tested by our son and his friends. Well, 6 months of rim-grabbing, slam-dunking, three-on-threes later, our goal looks as good as when we first installed it. Living in Indiana, we take our basketball seriously, and we couldn't be happier with our Goalrilla Goal.",

Adjusting the height is not a big deal, but can be a pain if you need to do it frequently. This is a lot of fun for the entire family and I can see us using this for many years. It is worth the money to have someone else install it unless you have prior experience and some extra help. It is definitely a 2-3 person job and not something you want to mess up.",

The anchoring systems is a great design, simplified the leveling process, and will make it possible to move the goal in the future.",

The ability to raise and lower the rim keeps the whole family entertained and interested. After we found a couple friends who had installed hoops before to help with installation it was smooth sailing for us. I love the in ground anchor system - it is secure and gives us the ability to easily move hoop to another house if we need to. The hoop looks good in the driveway and is sleek enough not to draw any unnecessary attention to it. Our kids love it\u2014it\u2019s a win for us!",

Contacted the manufacturers about this and their response was that the overhang is four feet when the arms are completely horizontal...yeah....because most people apparently play on a 7ft hoop.
