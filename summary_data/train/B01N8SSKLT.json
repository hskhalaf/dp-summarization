      "text": "I had been looking for a hanging coffee cup holder for some time. Surprisingly they were rare to come by. I saw this one early on but wanted to keep looking as $50 for one seemed a bit steep. I love the way it looks on the wall. When we were installing it, 3 of the hooks broke very easily. I hoped for better quality and was sad to see that was not what I got. We did find matching hooks and I was able to replace the broken ones. Be very gentle with them if you do purchase this.",
