      "text": "I attempted to install this in my 2017 Dodge Challenger. It was pretty easy to install and seemed easy to use. Looked great on the windshield, HOWEVER, it did make my Check Engine Light come on! I have 10k miles on it and it's serviced by Dodge only and, in fact, was just serviced by Dodge today and the light was definitely not on! I can't use this product if this happens so I will be returning it. Buyer BEWARE! Update: Went and had my check engine code read and it was U0001 Problem high speed bus/communication control module. This HUD plugged into the OBDII port makes it so my ECU cannot communicate properly with the car.",

The accuracy is a little off depending on how fast you're going, but once you figure out how much it overstates your speed you'll be fine. Plus, this helps even further at keeping your speed down. Pretty easy to install and see even in the daytime without the reflective film (which I prefer). I don't mind the slight shadow like reflection on my windshield (better than that ugly film).",

In the settings you can adjust the brightness but even at full it's just not enough. Ultimately i returned the unit and went with another that has it's own display screen and it works much better.",

The reflective screen is kind of annoying though as it shows the whole device, which makes it a bit hard to see and tends to get really annoying as it also takes away from the effect. The reason I put this at 2 stars is because it says it does not need a reflection film yet it does, and without the reflection film it isn't visible.",

One shortfall of the design is the housing has a lip on the side facing into the vehicle, hiding the screen itself from view. But that lip tapers down towards the outward facing side, making the quite bright screen very visible from outside the vehicle, particularly at night",
