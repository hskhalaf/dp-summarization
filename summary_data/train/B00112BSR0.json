Boom, out the door. Lipstick or gloss if I'm feeling it. Actual foundation and blush for special occasions. This goes on smooth and is long wearing. Doesn't irritate. Great at covering my lids which tend to be on the pink/red side.",

The eye shadow that showed up is named Urban Basics, but there is not a single purpleish color in the kit. It comes with a white-ish color, light sparkly tan, goldish brown, and gray. I'm pretty disappointed. It's confusing because they do not provide the color number in the product description. I would have sent it back to get the color I wanted, but I can't find the color number anywhere in the product description.",

These colors are so minimally different that you can't build much definition without introducing other colors from a different set. I don't feel like the shadow stands up all day either, whereas neutrals from other sets seem to have longer wear times.",

This little trio is perfect for every day wear. Each shade is a shimmery wash of colour, with the darkest shade being the most pigmented. None of the shades are matte, they all reflect light. If you are used to super pigmented shadows, just keep in mind that these are not like those. These are more sheer but you can definitely still see the shade. I have yet to test the staying power of these shadows but they go on super easy and look beautiful on the lid.",
