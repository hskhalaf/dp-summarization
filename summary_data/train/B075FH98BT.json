It will cancel repetitive sounds like an aeroplane engine, but it won't cancel everything (e.g. someone else watching the TV) Negative points: - Quite heavy (although this does suggest solid construction) - The pads made my ears feel too hot, but my wife said she didn't have a problem",

The cups are comfy, but lose their firmness pretty quickly. Overall, not bad, but not a headphone I would want to use for a long time due to the comfort level.

The noise cancelling difference between these and the quiet comforts is definitely noticeable with the music off but when you are listening at a good volume I really struggled to see much of a difference. This is totally subjective but I can definitely recommend.",

Furthermore, unlike most headphones, they stay put during movements like deadlifts in the gym which is a major plus!

Appel really need to address this. Very comfortable to ware Sound quality good Noise cancelling ok Volume not that loud Very easy to pair especially with Apple products (iMac, tv, iPad, iPhone Mac Pro, etc..) Don\u2019t pay 300 as not worth that price but at 200 they are worth that",
