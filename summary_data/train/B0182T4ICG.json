At the same time, due to that very design, it's somewhat difficult to put the shoes on especially if one has wider feet. I use these mainly for cross-training workouts and they serve that purpose well. But I don't think I'd buy these again nor will I recommend them to people simply because how the tongues were sewed almost entire to the upper.",
