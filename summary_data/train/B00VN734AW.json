This challenging novelty toy is the perfect gift and is all the 'Kraze' for youngsters worldwide. Competitions are popping up across the globe for this worldwide phenomenon. The kendama is comprised of 3 cups, one on the bottom of the stick, and one one each side. The 2 cups on the side are actually different sizes, making one of the cups more difficult to catch the ball with. Of course, the most difficult trick of all is to catch the ball on the spike. While it may seem like a simple children's toy, the Kendama can entertain for hours as you try to master all of its difficult trick sequences.",
