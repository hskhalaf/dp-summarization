While it sits on the counter, there is a pan beneath the rack that drains all water into the sink; it is just wonderful. The only way it could be improved upon would be to make it more collapse-able for storage. You may pay a bit more, but you won't be disappointed in any way. There is even a rack for hanging your wine glasses to dry. The folks at simplehuman really do have their fingers on the pulse of the market.",

The quality is far too low for the initial cost, and especially too high for the maintenance cost. (Which I cant believe a dish dryer even needs)",

It repeatedly catches on dishes, pots, and pans, and is impossible to re-seat (yes, I watched their painfully slow online video). My most recent purchase in 2017 has the same problem as the rack I purchased in 2013. Reviews by others reveal the same problem. Surprising for a Simple Human product.",

I usually trainers, and always kept it in our sink, but now that the kids are helping with dishes, they do better with two sinks open. Most trainers are ugly, but this one is stylish. Plus the feet make it tall enough to go over the lip of our farm sink. The drain wasn't quite long enough unless it is setting on top of the sink rim, which made it slanted back. So I put rubber feet just on the two feet that set on the counter. Besides the cost, which was crazy I know, I am happy. Hopefully it will be worth the money.",

Room for the many odd size plastic containers we wash daily Cons: wish it held more than 8 plates/lids; wine glass rack is useless unless you use stemmed glasses on a regular basis (we don\u2019t ); If your sink is on a diagonal you may find it hard to drain directly into the sink (we put down a small rectangular lid to catch the drainage in order to keep the drainer perpendicular to the counter.)",

This was much sturdier and it was even bigger than the Rubbermaid dish dryer. The wine glass rack at the back also came in handy for drying long spatulas. I'm extremely pleased with this disk rack as it works excellently as advertised.",

      "text": "Several design flaws, but the best choice for a big drainer. The major design flaw is the drain spout. it accumulates mold and the only way to clean it properly is to remove the screw that holds the two parts together. See Picture. The other design flaw is the rubber gasket which seals the plastic base to the stainless rim. It comes out easily. It can be stretched to fit better though. I like the size and the good drainage. The pull out cup drip catcher and the wine rack are useful and the utensil and knife baskets re good. Will see how long this lasts.",
