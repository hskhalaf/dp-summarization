This morning it held less than a gallon. Heats just fine. Temp outside this morning is 14. The utility company here says a 1500 watt space heater uses about $90.00 a month above and beyond standard regular usage. This heater uses about $2.00 a day a savings of $30.00 a month other than cost. Good savings in the long run. I expect good use in the future.",

Also there was some huffing of the flame which I was able to eliminate by moving the globe back and forth. I am using the 4.99 a gallon K1 kerosene that says for indoor use. That's 2.00 more than what I put in my car. So...maybe I just got a bad one but wanted to let you know my experience.",

Only thing I don't like about is top of heater never get hot enough to cook anything, only good enough to keep coffee pot or hot coco warm. The heat shield doing it's job too well. Will have some smell of kerosene at start of lighting or turn off, just make sure to have good ventilation when use it. Overall it is very good, I plan to take it for car camping soon and it will be good for emergency as well.",

NO, I won't use it in the house, but I've used other brands (Senguko) with no where near the odor of this one.

Yes, when it is ignited, there may be a kerosene odor for about 5 minutes. Otherwise it doesn't stink like older, less efficient stoves. The heat is very warm. Central heat is not a heat you can stand in front of and get warm....This heater is deliciously warm. Ahhh.",

By itself, in a small space, I was only able to get up 98-100 F degrees. I ended up adding 3 electric heaters and was about to get heat up room to 115 F degrees.

I have a fan in the hall to draw the heat to the rooms at that end and it really helps. We have not had extreme temps yet, but down in the 20's so far very pleased with this product.

When I removed the cover, it appeared nothing was broken, but what we saw was a cheap plastic catch for the metel shut off lever, which seemed to have worn out. Seriously, metal hitting against plastic......how long will that work? We returned the heater, and purchased the Sengoku OR-77 model, hoping it was a more durable model. Time will tell.",

      "text": "This is a great little heater if you don't need to heat huge spaces. At 10K BTU it is powerful enough to heat my 640 sq ft basement to 75 degrees even with a crack in the window and outside tempreture of 30 degrees. If you use a good quality Kerosene such as Crown 1-K or a reputable K-1 Clear suitable for use in unvented Kerosene heaters, you get virtually no odor from this heater. Adjust the flame correctly and it is a sweet burner for sure. I may use this one regularly to knock the chill off on those extra cold nights. I would recommend this heater.",
