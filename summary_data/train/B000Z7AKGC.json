      "text": "The D-Link DGL-4500 GamerLounge Xtreme N Gaming Router offers decent performance and a long list of features for home wireless networking and hardcore gamers. However, it lacks support for simultaneous 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands along with random resets during heavy loads. You may want to wait for a successor to the DGL-4500, or at least a firmware update, before buying it. With the hefty price tag of about $180, we expected better stability. Unless you plan to take advantage of the DGL-4500's GameFuel feature for prioritizing bandwidth for games, we still recommend D-Link's DIR-655 Xtreme N router for its superior performance or the Netgear WNR854T RangeMax for its speed, stability, and price",

      "text": "This is basically the DIR-655 router with an LED screen on the hood, but side by side I have not experienced any different in game, bit-torrent or general network performance. It has however proven to be the least reliable of the two. I had this router for a month, towards the end it was running very hot, until it literally cooked off. Getting it RMA'd was a hassle--no worse then dealing with Linksys or Netgear though--but they got it back to me the same week, and had upgraded both the hardware and software. Personally I would recommend theover the DGL-4500, it's essentially the same router without all the extra eye candy and at a lower price.",

I did not update the firmware, as other reviewers suggested. Only potentially bad thing I noticed is that I was backing up one PC to an online backup service (Mozy) and this router limited the upload rate--even when all other PC's were off. Turning the \"Gamefuel\" feature of the router off improved--doubled--my upload rate. Never noticed a difference otherwise though, so I generally keep Gamefuel on, and the gamers have never complained of lagging.",

Of course you need to read the manual (i recommend to DLINK print a short instructions in paper) and start to learn about networks. The instructions to establish the router settings via online are complete but for a novice like me could be complicated. I think that DLINK could translate the manual in different languages because not all the buyers understand very well english. The device is simple but beautiful.",

We were having frequent disconnects with the previous linksys router, problems have all dissapeared with this beauty. We've had this for over a month and only had to reset the power once, other than that it just works. Would definitely reccomend to anyone interested in a reliable wireless router that saves bandwidth for online gaming(without the hassle-filled setup).",

Also, it would lock up under heaving gaming load (hosting a Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 PC coop server). It would also randomly reboot. The router LED seems cool at first, but then you long for standard router activity lights. Do some searching on DGL-4500 firmware before purchasing this, and check out broadbandreports.com. This is a flakey router at best. Amazon was great with the return, though...very easy.",
