I mean it takes times to climb in and out, especially if you use a liner. Moreover, it takes time to regenerate that lost heat. For me, 48 oz is about the right size for nighttime evolutions while on Diamox. Any less, and you may have an issue. Being lightweight and collapsable\u200b really helps with conserving packing space/weight restrictions. Highly recommended for this use.",

      "text": "I just completed an 8 day climb of Kilimanjaro and one of my concerns going into the trip was having to get up at night in frigid temps to drain my bladder. My father and I both bought one of these bottles and we both agree it was one of the best purchases we made for the trip. The large capacity, wide mouth, tight seal, and ability to be packed flat made it excellent for use as a pee bottle. Spending $20 for something to pee in seems a bit ridiculous but considering the alternative it was money well spent.",

I can't see this type of plastic lasting too long with frequent use. Maybe I'm wrong? Who knows. I just have a hard time trusting it based on the stiffness and expect it to crack eventually.

I've had an identical lid on my regular Nalgene bottle that I got in 2002 and it is still in perfect working order.

Along with a water purifier (Katadyn Hiker, that fit the bottle mouth perfectly), we gathered water for meal times, and stored water for the early morning breakfast. This bottle worked in conjunction with a couple of 20oz. water bottles for the actual day hiking. The bottle weighs in at a scant 2.3 oz empty, and takes up almost no room in the backpack.
