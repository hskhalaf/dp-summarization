Today was the first time I wore it in my car, and I noticed that the zipper separated from the bottom and was very difficult to got back apart without damaging it. Once this happens, I become wary that it will happen more easily again until it is no longer any use at all. At the price and the brand name, this is unacceptable. My return window just closed on this purchase. I will be checking on the Bosch warranty next...",

The battery is small but a pretty heavy and noticeable when first put it on, but after a few minutes you forget its there. No wind gets though the fabric... I would recommend this jacket to others.",

It breaks so close to the holster that you can\u2019t just splice the wires back together. Bosch took the coat in Feb and I got a refurbished one in July. I then used the refurbished one no more than 15x this winter and it happened AGAIN. My coat is now past warranty and they refuse to fix it. Huge waste of money. Just pay the extra and buy the Milwaukee one. Everyone i work with swears by it and I\u2019ve never heard a complaint.",

I work for Red Bull ,and I'm ALWAYS either outside in the cold loading up, or inside a walk in cooler freezing my butt off and this jacket definitely keeps me warm.
