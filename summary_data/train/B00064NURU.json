I was purchasing this heater for my garage as I epoxied the floor, to be able to keep the room temp from dropping. Due to the fact that the plug fitting is not standard, and they do not sell the adaptor at home depot or ace hardware, I was unable to use it. Another thing that I found out is that standard plugs would not be able to support the voltage output that this unit requires. I wish that they would have posted these facts upfront before I purchased the heater.",

But my free-standing, rocked and insulated, double car garage/shop is apparently too much for this thing; which generates, by an order of magnitude, more noise than heat. I live in Southern Oregon so it doesn't get exactly cold here, and it couldn't even stay ahead of 30o temps. After a season of having to augment this roaring piece of junk with a propane unit it just up and quit....pathetic. At least it's quiet now.",

I had thought the heating element would be bright red when the unit was climbing to 70 degrees, but that has not happened. All I see is a very dull orange/red which seems to be only half of its potential. Paying to have a 240 outlet installed appears to have been a waste. Probably could have used a couple of 110 heaters. I all fairness the unit was easy to install and the 6 foot cord was a big help.",
