It doesn't give me a confidence that I can push the tail, so I am going to take it off and get a dakine pad. The material is fine and stickiness is fine",

Trimming up was easy with scissors on the nose, while the tail piece fit without alteration. I'll add content after I've had a few months in the water...OK...Several trips and no issues with peeling or tearing.
