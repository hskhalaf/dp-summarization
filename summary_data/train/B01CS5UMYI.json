What I like about it is it has the little light to tell you if it is warm air or cool air. Whenever you press on the cool button, the red LED would turn off. When you turn the temperature to high, it becomes very warm. Pros: cheaper but comparable to brand name dryers. Cons: none that I could think of right now.",

It not only looks curlier and fuller, but the style stays for days......like when the stylist blows it out. Very reasonably priced, for how it performs. I bought it after reading the good and bad reviews and, although I do agree with some of the bad reviews, I am so glad that I bought it. I particularly picked it out based on having curly hair; not sure how it would work for straight hair.",

I generally use in LOW. It has a good sophisticated look and is very easy to use. It also provides some additional features for hair different hair style and user convenience.",

That always messes me up lol. Overall a great investment and the red infrared light while drying your hair is pretty interesting.",
