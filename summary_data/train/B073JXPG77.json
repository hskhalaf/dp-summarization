The pictures are their condition after 659 miles. I have already had to replace the SuperFeet insoles once. Simply put, these are excellent boots and I've ordered another pair to replace them. Wish I started with them. They dry out quickly, protect very well from rocks and are comfortable. Update: Finished my hike with the 2nd pair. Strong winds on a cool day were felt by my feet & almost got cold. That's how breathable these shoes are.",

Was looking for a mid-length boot that was a bit lighter, cooler, and quicker to lace up for the warmer weather and think these are perfect. They are a bit lighter than the Quest 4 but much easier to lace up and feel cooler on my feet. Great grip and sole, and very comfortable. They did not need a break in like my Quest 4's did. If you need waterproof versions, there is a GTX model.",

Kiwi Never tie again shoestring no tie laces (just used the clamp helps them the laces stay tight and do not have to keep retying) and added a pair of insoles as I have a high arch. I finished a 17 mile hike today. No blisters, no real foot pain. They grip very well when going up hills or climbing on rocks. I highly recommend it. It is really a great investment in your feet and will let you hike further and over more rugged areas.",
