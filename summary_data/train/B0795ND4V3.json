I have been using them for 2 days so let's see how they work after a few weeks. They are good in my book. Wear it with a thick sock until you have used them for a while that helps with the pokey feeling.",

They really help stimulate the soles of my feet. They are impressively made. I imagine the more I wear them, the more comfortable they will be, once my feet get used to them. I'm a tenderfoot and that may be the reason I can really benefit from them, since my feet don't usually get such a great work out as these sandals offer. Thank you, for your innovative foot product!!",

Just ask yourself this: \"What could be more comfortable than standing on some hard plastic knobs with some springs underneath them?\" The list of answers is several thousand entries long and I would advise you to just go see a foot doctor.",
