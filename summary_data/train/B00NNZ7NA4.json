I tested it with kids - same reaction. I created a \"DonorsChoose\" request to get Osmo for my students and it was funded. The kids ASK to play the game again. Kids who are not in my class asked how much the game was - they wanted to tell their parents to purchase it for them. GREAT game! Well worth your money! Better still, you can create your own games and play them yourself.",

My 6 year old has drawn pictures using it that are incredible. My 3 year old loves the word games, and they both enjoy the shape puzzles. For a designer, artist, teacher, cartoonist, this is an amazing tool. I just think $80 is a tad high for what is in the box.",

Designed for anyone aged 6 and up, this educational toy can be enjoyed by nearly everyone in the family.

Our mission is pretty simple - design holistic play experiences that are loved by children, parents and teachers alike.\n\nHow does Osmo work?\n\nOsmo consists of a base and a red reflector.
