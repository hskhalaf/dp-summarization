Had to send both the battery and charger back to them for testing. At my out of pocket expense. Purchased the bike on 12/26/2014 and today 2/10/2015 I received the warranty replacement battery. With the replacement battery the bike is working well. If nothing else goes wrong, I consider this a good deal for a electric mountain bike.",

The headlight is not even close to what is seen in the picture. The one included does not even fit on the bike. I had to buy another after market one that fit. The rear tire rack is nearly impossible to get on. That along doubled my assembly time. When assembled you can expect to have much fun and enjoyment. Once I had the battery charged and went on a test drive I had a hard time getting off.",

You have to start a ticket and then maybe they will get back to you. Then they send you something that they think might fix your problem and it doesn't. Then you have to start over. Now I am stuck with a piece of junk. Don't do business with these folks. You will regret it.",
