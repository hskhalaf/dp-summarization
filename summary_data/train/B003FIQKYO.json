      "text": "It came fully assembled in the box. I absolutely enjoy using this thing as it is so much easier than shoveling snow. The only downside is that it works great for fresh powder but anything that's been compacted by feet, tires, or general buildup of ice is not very effective at removing and have to resort to using this like a regular shovel a few times since the motor doesn't seem powerful enough to remove it without potential long-term damage. It's still a great alternative to a more bulky snow remover.",

This machine simply couldn\u2019t handle it at all. I tried to use it on my driveway and I had to stop every 15 seconds to clear the snow out of the blades. Basically you have to shovel the entire driveway beforehand and this machine clears off the last 1/4\u201d. Very dissatisfied and disappointed. This machine is advertised up to depths of 12\u201d but it can\u2019t even handle 4\u201d of fresh snow.",

Third the shute control works the opposite of the way you turn it. How dumb! And for all that frustration it does a so-so job of cleaning snow. Save your money.",

This is NOT a snowblower, and it's not very useful in more than six inches of snow. But for less than six inches of snow, it's just amazing. I had no problem clearing 5\" of snow covering a two-car wide driveway in about fifteen minutes. Just as important - no messing around with gasoline. Plug it in, and go. And unlike snow blowers, the power shovel is light enough that I hang it from a large wall hook in the garage, so it doesn't take up any floor space. Highly recommended.",

The cord is a hassle, but shoveling all these February (2019) Minnesota record breaking snow falls we've had, we will deal with the cord. Thank you, Toro!",

Cuts through crusty iced-over crud, no problem, and can handle 10 to 12-inch fall without really forcing. It even did the path over the lumpy lawn out to the generator without hanging. Highly directable, both very high elevation and across around 160 degrees horizontally. And it never jams. Toro did a fine job engineering this sturdy, capable little machine. I highly recommend it!",

Cost is around 30 cents worth of electricity! No oil/gas cost, smell, loud noise, or maintenance! The biggest downside is the stupid forearm workout they try to give you with the dumb button your supposed to hold down. I felt the need to zip tie it to the on position permanently. Just plug in to turn on, unplug to turn off. I recommend amazon's 12ga 100ft cord that stays completely flexible in the cold.",

Worked great. Toro plows right down to driveway/sidewalk. and the directional bar is with it's wide loop is very easy to access and use.

Keep in mind a gas blower is more powerful but you never have to do maintenance to this. If you are about low maintenance and you have patience using this it'll work well. Since it's electric you have to make sure you go out before the snow piles up too high. It does get annoying holding the trigger down while pushing it around and dragging a cord. Positive side is you never have to change the oil in this thing.",
