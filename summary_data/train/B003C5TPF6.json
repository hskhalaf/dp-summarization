I've been using this heater in a barebottom 10g tank that has cory fry which are about 3 months old. Woke up this morning and saw some dead along with condensation all around the glass. I quickly check the temperature of the water and it's freezing cold, meaning that the heater was busted. One month...and it's busted. Can't return it, lost some fry, and I will never be buying aqueon heaters again. The glass heaters failed me once, and this \"pro\" version failed even faster.",

With the Marineland I was having to constantly adjust it because of minor changes in room temperature, whereas this heater I have set and pretty much is within +/-0.3 degrees F based on three temperature probes in my tank including a \"La Crosse Technology 926-25106-Wgb Wireless Monitor System Set with Wet Probe\" which logs readings every 15 mins. Might not be needed for those that don't care that their temperature changes a few degrees, but for me/someone who wants the range tighter this is worth every penny.",

So I rely on my thermometer to set the temp instead of the number markings on the heater. I first got this model because it fit perfectly inside the filter compartment of the Fluval Spec 5.

I wouldn't put too much trust into the numbers on the thermostat as they don't correspond with the actual temperature. But, that's not enough to be a deal breaker. Just use a thermometer, and you'll find that once you get the water at the temperature you want it at, this heater will make sure that it never budges! Also, read the directions and make sure that you let the heater \"acclimate\" to the water before plugging it in. A half hour to an hour should do, then you're good to go.",

The temperature setting dial is easy to use, even with wet hands or at an angle, and the status light is very clear about when the heater is on. The sleek design blends in great with a black background, but I imagine it would look good anyway. Spend a little extra on these heaters and you won't regret it. I would definitely recommend these to a fellow fishkeeper.",

After a horrendous experience with a cheaper aquarium heater getting stuck and raising aquarium temps over 90 F, I won't run any heater without a regulator in line after it for peace of mind.",

I use it with a Willhi digital temperature controller, which I also purchased on Amazon. The Willhi gives me peace of mind that my fish will not cook if something was to happen to this heater, I would recommend purchasing both the heater and the temp controller together as a fail safe.",

Very easy to stick onto your aquarium and it's pretty accurate. In my experience so far it tends to be accurate within a +/- ~2 degree range, I have the dial set just below 84 and so far it has stayed at a steady ~81 degrees. Great overall buy!",
