The watch was a gift, and the recipient was thrilled and extremely happy with the watch. The only downside was that the instructions included with the watch were not the correct instructions for the watch received. Additionally, it was necessary to watch a YouTube video to figure out how to work the watch clasp. Having received the appropriate instruction manual would have been helpful. Also, we aren't sure whether the watch is self winding or battery operated. It will be necessary to try to find an online manual for the watch.",
