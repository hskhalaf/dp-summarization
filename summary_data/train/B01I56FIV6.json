He will be in 8th grade playing 14u so he can still swing the -5 again next season is some usssa regular tournament but not in the NIT and other high level tounaments. Got to keep going forward in weight and legth to get ready for high school. This bat is very well balanced with the pop to back it up. I can't believe the zen was still available on amazon!!!",
