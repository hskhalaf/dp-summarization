The reviews I read were all pretty good, but the product is lackluster. It arrived and an enormous box and I wasn\u2019t sure if I had ordered a bag or an old tube tv. The actually carrier only took up about 1/16 of the box and unfolded easily. It\u2019s merely a canvas bag with nothing that i would describe as padding. The shoulder strap is not comfortable and the only protection this will offer your console is from incidental abrasions during travel. I think you should get a different item.",
