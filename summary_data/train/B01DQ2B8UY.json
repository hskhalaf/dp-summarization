There was just too much flex in the frame and the telescoping handle, like a cheap rollaway suitcase. Also, I really don't recommend this stroller if you're tall.

This fits easily under the seat in front of your child or in the overhead bin. My nearly 40 lbs, tall 2yo fit comfortably. Folding does take a bit of practice.",

It won't go through grass, any kind of gravel, or uneven terrain at all. It also feels cheap and flexes quite a lot when turning, and the handles could extend longer (and I am only 5'3\" tall). Definitely not worth the $200 plus price tag. I am quite disappointed with it since it is advertised as all-terrain. It is also quite difficult to fold and lock together. I would recommend you go for a folding wagon style with actual all terrain wheels if you are looking for something that folds smaller but will work on all types of terrain.",

It's definitely not as sturdy as a standard stroller, or even perhaps an umbrella stroller - mainly because it needs to fold up into such a small size.

We don\u2019t have a backpack that it can be carried in. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the sunshade that comes with it really is too small and doesn\u2019t do anything for protection. Practice a few times folding it and opening it up. Daughter is now 3-years-old and 30 lbs.",

Also the basket underneath is VERY small so Mamas that put their purse there you'll need to find another way to carry your stuff. Overall we highly recommend this!

It's modular, so the bassinet configuration will depend on you having a basinet that i presume is either sold separately, our a different version of the stroller.

As an everyday stroller it lacks the ability to hang a baby bag or groceries, etc. It is light so the added weight of hanging bags makes it fall over when baby is taken out. It's also flimsy if you decide to go off road with it through the park. All in all perfect for traveling but not for everyday use.",

      "text": "Nice idea but I hated this stroller from the first try to open it. So much pain in the... - you definitely need instruction to pack/unpack it. It's definitely NOT a breeze to fold/unfold it, in comparison to other brands like Recaro easylife or pegperego pliko mini. Those strollers are so intuitive and easy to open/close even with one hand. THIS one is quite a challenge - even with two hands it is more like a puzzle. Would not recommend.",

It handles surprisingly smoothly for a stroller that can fold so small. There are only two cons: the sunshade is not really useful, and it doesn't recline. This wasn't a big deal for us, since we already have the Summer Infant shade which goes right over the top, and my daughter doesn't nap in the stroller so we don't need the recline.",
