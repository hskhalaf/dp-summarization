Well, at least our older guy does\u2014he went right to work breaking it in, and has been having a go at it regularly. Our five month old kitten is still in her \"wild explorer\" phase, and seems more interested in using the scratcher in her efforts to scale the bedroom wall, rather than for its intended purpose. We'll be ordering another of these for the living room.",

I tried to wiggle the post to see how the hooks were working and I couldn't move the post at all so I doubt my cat would be able to. I like this post design because it allows my cat to stretch out his arms like he normally does when scratching -- it's a very natural scratching design.",

Only downside is he now walks by two other much more expensive options to use this one. I would estimate this will last several months based on very little damage after two weeks of using it. But full disclosure he is barely 10lbs and pretty gentle. I highly recommend- both aesthetics and cat acceptance/use are excellent. Would buy a wider version also - so if you make other versions please let me know.",

It's a good idea - longer scratching surface - but when he uses all of the front, I want to be able to flip it over and use the back. Instead, I'll have to use the back as a scratching board on the floor. He likes to stretch and scratch upwards, so I only wish this could be a front and back vertical scratcher, especially for the price.",
