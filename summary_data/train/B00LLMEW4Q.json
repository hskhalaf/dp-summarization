I really feel like they helped my pack more in a smaller space & kept all my items together so when I arrived for 3 weeks in France unpacking was a breeze!

I am able to roll up clothing pieces and stack them into the cubes and the cubes in turn, fit nicely into my backpack. I have more space then ever to bring back extra \"stuff\" from my trips. Nice product and I will buy them again when the time arises. Highly recommended for the functionality and price.",

Thus if I knew I wanted to wear demin pants, I went to the cube that had demin pants and tops. Underware and nightgowns in another, evening clothes in a third, etc., etc. They kept me very organized.",

The other two aren't useful for any type of clothing, except maybe socks. With this in mind, the cubes won't save you that much space. What they will do is organize your clothing into separate pouches, and $20 seems like a lot to pay for something like that. On the positive side, they're sturdy and the zippers appear to be well constructed, but again, I don't think they're worth $20. If they sold a package of four of the biggest cubes, that might be something worth buying.",

I have watched so many videos on how people pack the cubes, so for ideas, I'd recommend doing that. These are much better priced than other brands I've looked at. I also like that they come in a myriad of different colors. When traveling with your family, that is essential. Highly recommend these. We bought 4 sets and no one has had any issues with them.",
