My 2nd games are always my worst games and I've never gone up before like this. Truly an excellent ball and btw there was no practice with this ball. Went right into league bowling which is very scary. Highly recommend this ball because my experience was awesome!",

My average has jumped 30 plus points in the week and a half I've had this ball. You only need two balls in your bag. The widow legend and the widow spare. That's it",
