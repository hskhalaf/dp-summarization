The weight of the pan and height and thickness of the sidewalls are just right. The angle of the sides, the radius of the join where the bottom and the sides meet... they are perfect and will not break even heavy dough. The glaze is lovely and free of flea bites or imperfections. Sometimes a thing transcends its label. The pleasure of making a pie in this makes it more than a mere pie plate. I'm glad to own and use it.",
