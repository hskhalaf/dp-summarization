No more redness, itchiness, flakiness, or dryness ANYWHERE on my face. I now use the beardwash every other day and this has been sufficient to maintain the results. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",

I could still get it out and use it, but it was a pain in the butt and dispensed more than I needed. I reached out to their customer service and they were amazing!

Left my beard feeling silky smooth and that's a good thing (especially for your wife or girlfriend). What I like most is after with just one use it healed my dry skin and itchy beard. No more beard dandruff. Give it a try, its good stuff.",
