So missing about 20 pages in the entree section which is kind of an important part of the book. Really disappointing. The page that gives the recipes for the entrees is part of the missing pages so no way to know what they are.",

The smoothies recpies are great and the soups are delicious. I do recommend this cookbook.",

(Plus, the photos are GORGEOUS.) I've made a number of these recipes, multiple times, and they've all been delicious. Even my husband, a dedicated carnivore, devours the food I make from this book. Tonight I made the sweet potato and black bean enchiladas, and they were amazing. I like that Ms. Liddon uses fresh ingredients, without meat substitutes. It's food that makes you feel good and energized, rather than sluggish and tired. Definitely recommended.",

I've yet to find a bad recipe in here, it's obvious everything was well tested. I also love the substitutions included in most recipes to deal with various allergies, and especially her notes on what DOESN'T work as a substitution (i.e. if only soy milk will work in a recipe, she'll tell you that and why so you don't waste time using almond milk and then wondering why it didn't gel properly). I can't recommend this highly enough.",

I've truly enjoyed cooking with my partner from this book, especially the sweet potato enchiladas and the creamy avocado pasta. Looking forward to trying the granola recipes for my upcoming camping trip. The minor downsides: recipes can be complicated, and the prep time is really not indicative of the prep time of beginner/intermediate cooks who are learning to be vegan. With two people, A recipe that supposedly takes 50 minutes takes us two hours. Still, well worth the money.",
