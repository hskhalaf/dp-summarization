What I think is ridiculous and poor engineering is the requirement to drain the chain oil after every use. I've never had a chainsaw that has this requirement. I thought at first there was an issue with the saw, after moving in on the garage floor and finding a puddle of oil. Double checked the manual and noted the requirement. Not sure if it's ok to save it and reuse or a marketing campaign to sell more oil.",

      "text": "While the saw has the power to cut down decent sized trees, the chain comes off easily. The chain is rather narrow compared with other chainsaws. I believe this lends itself to jumping off the bar. I think it doesn't take much debris from the cutting action to foul the bar. Also the tool less chain adjustments are not capable of proper tension being placed on the chain to set the slack of the chain correctly. The narrow kerf of the chain also results in binding of the chain much more often that a typical chainsaw . The 40v 4 amp battery allows for hours of cutting before it needs to be recharged.",

You can set it down anywhere at any time because it is not hot, and there is no fuel tank to spill. I routinely get about 45 minutes of work out of a charge, by which time it's time for a break anyway.",

      "text": "Works as expected except for chain oil which seems to inject more than is needed. Chain oil usage is high. Battery power is superb...lasts a long time under light duty. Perfect for my intermittent use. Have yet to re-charge but only used a few hours. Convenience of no gas, oil, spark-plug trumps all. Starting no hassle, clean, variable speed as needed. Recommend a carrying case which can be purchased at Home Depot for $40, cloth case with plastic bottom to keep oil dripage contained.",

I have used it to cut some big pine trees on our property, small trees, branches around the garden.....all fast easy and with little maintenance. Just keep your eye on the oil level, sharpen the chain (I would buy one or two extra ones) and you are good to go. I would say each battery gives you about 30 min of hardcore cutting but if you get a 2nd battery with the charger plugged in you can cut all day long with this baby.",
