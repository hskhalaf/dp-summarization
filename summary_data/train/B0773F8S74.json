I put the magnet between my phone and the case (did NOT use the adhesive, as the magnet stays in place just fine) and now I'm able to see the navigation app on my phone perfectly. The back of the part that goes in the car is small enough to fit almost anywhere. That's where I always had a problem in the past. The magnets are super strong too. While the phone is on it, I can try to move it up, down and sideways and it WILL NOT MOVE. The only way the phone comes off is to pull the phone straight UP. Perfect!",

Plus you don't have to worry about the magnet coming with your phone when you remove it to leave your vehicle, which tends to happen with the vent ones. Strong magnets, which is great. The vent ones are handy if you plan on renting a car as it is easy to pack with your chargers and then you have the GPS mount with you in the rental car. Not as optimal but it is better than getting lost and paying extra for the GPS package the rental company would charge.",

I had been using one of the vent based holders which, rather than the magnet, grabbed the sides of the phone. But it was always hard to position it so it didn't hit the on/off or volume switches of my phone. This works a lot better.",

The magnet itself is very strong, it holds iPhone X Max in otter box, but that\u2019s all useless if you can not put it in your vehicle. Maybe I was just unlucky and received defective product but none of the adhesive pads were sticky enough to stay on the dashboard.",

Position the plate more towards the middle of the phone so the phone doesn't want to rotate around the mount. Once it's mounted correctly, there is no better mount on the market.",

So I guess it's a 2.5/5 stars, but seeing as how little it actually lasted, it's a 2/5. Do not recommend this product to anyone, find something else that works. One thing I will add that is not a con since I understand why it doesn't work, but wireless charging does not work when you have the plate on the back of your phone",
