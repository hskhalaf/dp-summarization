I kept doubling the fabric until it was to thick to go under the presser foot. It sewed through 12 layers of canvas as if it was sewing a single layer!!! I've sewed canvas, leather, plastic, foam and cardboard without a hick-up.",

Second one received - the needle made a cycle then jammed in the base and locked-up the motor. That's enough for me, have again notified Amazon and am asking for return and refund. PS I have sewn for over 50 years on all types of machines. I had 2 other people with similar experience test this machine with identical results - so, this is not operator error. I think I will search for a Husqvarna Viking machine.",
