Also, the toe of the boot wore off after one attempt to get a feel for the stop. all in all, I think they are ok for the price point, i'm enjoying them a lot for the price, but I wonder if I should have went with the Chicago Bullets that are much less in price.",

Of course they do not compare to higher-end leather skates, and I assume that anyone at that end of the skating spectrum is not even looking here. So for the rest of us, they're comfortable, they roll, and they are synthetic, not leather. They come with all the adjustment nuts tightened down (and for several wheels I had to use a ratchet wrench to loosen them). So expect to loosen the wheel nuts almost from the start, and the trucks somewhat later, depending on your skating ability.",

Not much cushion so I plan to put in a sole. They are not made for outdoors according to the instructions that came with it. But that's where I use them. Smooth skating. Met my expectations.",

I ended up spending more than the other pair of skates I was looking at. The stopper is junk too but I don't really use it much.",
