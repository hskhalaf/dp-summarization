The chicken was moist and delicious, as were the rice and potatoes. It's a very lightweight pan, which I like because it's easy to lift even full and cools down quickly. It also goes through our dishwasher with no issues.",

It's just a good old-fashioned serviceable pan that has held up very well. As with any enamelware, be careful to avoid chipping the finish. Update--also super for cooking smaller amounts of pasta. Have been using it for years, and it is one of the most-used pans in my kitchen.",

    "description": "Size:5 QuartOriginally founded in 1871, Columbian Home Products is the oldest cookware manufacturer in the U.S., famous for producing Porcelain on Steel cookware. Granite Ware has a carbon steel core for strength, conductivity and superior heat distribution. Porcelain is fused to the steel at 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit producing a non-porous, inert glass surface that is naturally non-stick. Porcelain can chip if dropped, however this does not reduce the effectiveness of the cookware. There are no PTFE\u2019s, PFOA\u2019s or any other chemicals to change the taste, color or nutritional value of the food. Just the right size for empty nesters, singles, college students or use in a second home. A smaller version of the traditional casserole. Perfect for cooking your favorite dishes in smaller portions or use to cook and serve side dishes. Includes Lid and capacity is 5 quarts.",
