      "text": "I initially had some trepidation about a battery powered cutting tool. Not anymore. I used this trimmer for 2 hours before the battery ran out. It required less than an hour to recharge. I am still aghast as to how well it performed in cutting branches up to big finger size thickness. It is also remarkably light for its power. I use one hand to get to the high branches. I am trying to convince my wife, who uses old fashion hedge clippers, that she would save hours of time, as this instrument is light enough for the fairer sex to use. Sorry if this sounds sexist rather than informative.",

      "text": "Surprised to see the positive reviews for an item that would not operate for longer than two weeks. Trimmer worked well for smaller items and battery lasted long although after several uses, it started to become louder and louder. The gears sounded as if they were not connecting although the blades were still engaged. Soon thereafter, the blades stopped working altogether. Took it apart to see if the gears had slipped out of alignment but that was not the issue. I may have gotten a defective unit or these are not designed for heavy use. Either way, I would not recommend the purchase as longevity and durability is in question.",

This little guy is powerful! I only used it for about 30 min, but it was as powerful as a corded trimmer, and I got the work done in half the time. If you hate trimming bushes like I do, but you have to get it done, I'd recommend this trimmer.",

I'm using it with the 40V battery that came with my string trimmer, so that saves both money and resources.

I have a 20 volt that works well on really small diameter and this one is more powerful but not as good as claimed.",

I hated the cord. For the last four years, I have used a manual hedge trimmer that took forever and wore me out. This beauty cuts through thick hedges like a hot knife through butter. No exaggeration. This is one of the best purchases I have made in a long time!",

I've used this trimmer three times now and find the battery gives me well over an hour, then recharges quickly. Because of the battery composition, you can leave it on the charger continuously without battery deterioration. Only downside is that it tends to heat up when using for fifteen minutes or so; I stop and give it a rest while I clean up the debris. That way it seems to fit my needs perfectly.",

    "description": "Style:40V Hedge Trimmer KitThe BLACK+DECKER LHT2436 Hedge Trimmer has a powerful 40V battery that provides plenty of power and run time and can cut branches up to 3/4 inch think. These lithium ion batteries hold a charge 5X times longer and have double the life of NiCd batteries. They are also powered by an energy star qualified charger for a better environment. This trimmer has a 24 inch dual action blade that gives up to 40 percent less vibration than single action blades and cuts cleanly and comfortably. It has a full wrap around front handle that provides a comfortable gripping area in all cutting orientations. Soft grips ensure a comfortable and secure grip while trimming. The pre hardened, rust resistant steel blades stay sharp longer. Its lightweight, compact design is easy to use and causes less user fatigue. This trimmer can trim up to 6000 square feet per charge. Includes trimmer, one battery, and charger. Backed by a 2 year warranty. For use only with LB series 36v or 40v batteries.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\nThe LHT2436 dual-action hedge trimmer. Offering BLACK+DECKER's exclusive PowerDrive Transmission, the 24-inch cordless LHT2436 dual-action hedge trimmer delivers more power from the motor to the blades so you can get the job done faster. It's powered by BLACK+DECKER's high-powered 40-volt lithium battery system, which offers power, excellent runtime, and the versatility to share batteries with other tools within the system. \n\nTHE LITHIUM ADVANTAGE\nBLACK+DECKER's 40-volt lithium-ion system offers numerous benefits over older battery technologies and gas options, notably the ability to put more power into a small and compact battery. Lithium batteries have a longer lifecycle than other types, and they also hold their charge longer when taken off the charger. This means that once charged, a lithium battery is always ready to use. The included Energy Star-rated fast charger fully recharges the battery in about 1 hour.\n\nCUTTING POWER AND CONVENIENCE\nWith BLACK+DECKER's exclusive Power Drive transmission, you'll be able to cut up to twice the amount of branches without stalling, and the 24-inch dual-action blades produce less vibration while trimming compared to single-action blade models. It's enough to cut through branches up to 3/4-inch thick.
