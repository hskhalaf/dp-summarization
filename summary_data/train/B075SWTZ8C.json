When I used this stuff it was like a miracle. The thing is quite shiny and looks brand new. However, because astrolabes are essentially computers from the Middle Ages I will now allow it tarnish again to get back that \"old\" look.",

On my 22k-24k jewelry, it cleaned it well enough but if my piece didn't have a sheen to start, it didn't make it shine. It just cleaned and restored a \"brand\" new look to it. Didn't leave any residue nor damage my gems. Pretty much odorless, and I used bare fingers working it; didn't irritate my skin. Great product. Works well.",

Used a couple of microfiber clothes to clean with & clean ones to buff out with, each vase took about 10 minutes total to clean, they look like new again; also wore latex gloves! We also have a bunch of silver holiday decorations that need to be polished every year so will be using for those as well! Would highly recommend & will purchase again!",
