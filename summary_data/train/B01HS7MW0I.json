      "text": "This cheese cutting set allow our guests to help themselves with ease. We recently hosted a party in our apartment and had a huge cheese board. During previous parties, we just use regular utensils which caused a mess because some cheeses are more dense and in various shapes. Try cutting aged Grana Panago with a butter knife in one hand and a glass of wine in the other. The Lunar set just made it so much easier this time around. Completely satisfied with this purchase. Nothing like having the right tools for the job.",
