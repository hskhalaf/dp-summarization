I had a very difficult project, that needed to be done while inside of a cupboard size space on Wood, PVC, and Copper. This saw is extremely adaptable, and because of that I was able to complete the project even with a few unforseen obstacles that any other saw configuration couldn't pull off (Such as sawing a Copper Pipe sideways though a 2\" x 8\" opening while avoiding the surrounding conduits, all right next to my face.) Good quality, super robust, and surprisingly solid for having a 4-part tension frame.",
