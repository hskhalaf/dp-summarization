Only problem is it seems like the Bluetooth is constantly scanning. Because of this, now and again the sound drops out and suddenly comes back. We live in a neighborhood and I swear it must be other Bluetooth devices in the area messing with it. Seems like a poor radio engineering design flaw for such a high end brand. You guys overall could do better. Especially for the price range.",

Prior CNET reviews, when this unit was selling for MSRP $599 said it's the best sound bar under $1,500. Without a doubt the best sound system I've ever owned. Crispy highs and thumping bass from the 8\" woofer. It doesn't have fancy HDMI connection, but it does have an optical cable included.....if you've bought a HDTV/LCD/OLED fancy flat screen....it's got an optical cable receptacle. Best purchase ever.

Bluetooth connection to my iPhone 7+ is a little sketchy, but the workaround is to just stream my music through the TV first via AppleTV. Quality sound for a low price! Great deal in my opinion.",

I have not been able to link it with my TV remote and have to adjust the volume with the teeny tiny remote (hope I don't ever lose that) AND I have to walk across to stand within 2-3 feet of the sound bar for the remote to work.

When I connected this thing and powered it up I was floored by the sound coming from this unit. I had the sub turn up to 3/4 volume and had to turn it down to half. Kipsch is top of the line when it comes to speakers I own various products from them and am always impressed. I also tested the Bluetooth with my old lumia 635 and my new Lumia 950 and it had excellent range and clarity with both phones.",

Sub does a good job too. But then it's made by Klipsch, so you get what you pay for!! The remote could be a little nicer, but it works.",

The subwoofer is just amazing, the low bass shake my walls. Klipsch is an amazing speaker company and not overpriced like Bose. Highly recommended.",

BUT, just turn the little switch off on the bar when you're don with it and you're good! Not a big deal to us at all compared to the blue tooth synching a few seconds after you turn it on. I can listen to Pandora from my mac to by turning on air play to my Apple TV (since Apple TV removed Pandora from it's app list). We can finally hear people talking on the tv more clearly now.

    "description": "Klipsch R10B Sound Bar w/ Wireless Subwoofer\n\n\nA soundbar should be more than just a larger and louder version of the diminutive TV speakers it is replacing. Another primary function should be to increase sonic details, especially in the midrange frequency area and above, in order to significantly improve dialogue clarity that is extremely lacking with most of today's flat panel TV's. The Klipsch Reference R 10B addresses this need with a proven technology consistently refined over Klipsch's legendary 68 years plus loudspeaker experience: horn loading.\n\n\n\n250W Peak Power Output\n\nProvides quality sound to drive your favorite movies, shows, games and music. You should do more than just hear them, you should feel them.\n\n\n\nTrue 2 Way Soundbar\n\nTwo 0.75\" horn loaded textile dome tweeters with 90 degrees x 90degrees Tractrix horns deliver crisp highs for sound effects and musical detail. All while, Two 3\" polypropylene woofers round out the enhanced sound with crisp vocals and dynamic soundtracks.\n\n\n\nBluetooth\n\nCompatible with most Bluetooth wireless technology enabled devices, including mobile phones, audio devices and computers for wide ranging use.\n\n\n\naptX Audio Coding Technology\n\nEnables lossless, high quality music streaming without elaborate configuration processes. Just pair your device and enjoy.\n\n\n\nDolby Digital Decoder\n\nAllows the soundbar to automatically reproduce detailed, high quality sound no matter what format of sound is coming from the TV's output.",
