I can actually get it to work if I go back and forth from counter clockwise to clockwise with a short 1/8 revolution motion. It is quite a workout but at least I can get it going. I may just open it up and superglue the catch mechanism so that it just always spins.",

    "description": "Culina 5Qt. Large Salad Spinner is the fast, efficient, affordable, chic way to maintain a healthy routine and improve diet. Arugula, spinach, cabbage are as many possibilities to increase your daily salad intake and foster a long life! Keep salad-making quick, easy and fun with Culina 5 Qt. Salad Spinner whether a vegan, vegetarian or paleo diet best suits your appetite. Ergonomic design, robust features: Superior quality, robust construction, Culina 5Qt. Large Spinner is a durable, time-tested, resistant, spinning powerhouse, outfitted with a side hand crank discreet enough for easy storage, yet broad enough for a comfortable, non-slip grip, it's effortless to . Food Safe: Exercise caution, reduce germs and potential bacteria by washing raw vegetables thoroughly. Using Culina 5Qt. Salad Spinner, you will immediately see leftover dirt and other foreign residue wash off as they collect in the clear outer bowl. Removing excess water allows for food to be that much enjoyable, crispy clean, full of nutrients and tasteful rather soggy which besides looking unappealing and lacking in taste can ultimately deplete food of its essential minerals. Easy to Use: Simply fill up the basket with desired amount of salad, rinse, set back in the clear bowl, cover and with a simple, forceless turn of the ergonomically designed crank handle spin and dry your salad. Better Performance: Spins with impressive centrifugal force reminiscent of a drying spin cycle, capable of wringing water out of leafy greens in no time. Ideally, you'd want your salad to soak in the dressing for a delectable experience; that's not entirely guaranteed when using the underwhelming, poor-performing spinners currently flooding the market. In contrast, Culina 5 Qt. Large Salad Spinner is a top of the line spinner with an enviable price, accessible to all budgets.",
