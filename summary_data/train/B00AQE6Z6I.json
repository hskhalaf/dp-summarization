      "text": "I\u2019ve had this gate for around 4-5 months now. It was annoying to setup but looked nice. My 18lbs dog was left alone for 20 minutes and he nearly chewed through two of the columns. My dog never chews anything and he was able to do that much damage in a short time. If your dog has issues with chewing, absolutely do not buy this gate. A dog bigger than him could chew through it in one bite, the wood is super flimsy and just barely above paper quality. I\u2019m trying to figure out if I\u2019m mad at my dog or at how cheap the wood was for him to be able to do that much damage.",

What I especially like is the wide opening. It is much wider than your typical 'fancy' gates. Helps with carrying things through. I purchased this for a very low price because it was considered an open box. Actually it came in the product box and was slightly scuffed. NO PROBLEM - can't see it and I would have eventually scuffed it anyway! Overall - very pleased with this purchase! Important to note: the door actually stays open, which I absolutely love. My other gates are self-closing.",

Just a poorly designed product that looks amazing, but fails in function and feels cheaply made.",

      "text": "This gate does not perform well when used at the maximum extension. It lacks the rigidity required and tends to bow to the point of falling over completely. Even when the gate is manually realigned, the bow factor prevents the latch from aligning and makes it cumbersome to close. A fix for this would be to increase the product height or to offer some additional support at the extension hinges. This would probably suffice if used for a typical door span, but just does not work for extended lengths. I would recommend buying a gate with a greater height or with reinforcement at the extension hinges if you are looking for something other than a typical door.",

So far, this gate looks great, once we figured out to put the opening part in the middle, it hasn't budged even with the kid tugging on the bars. It's a game changer that I don't have to literally jump hurtles anymore to avoid bumping the baby gate when it's in a \"perfect\" position. To install, it's best to have two people, to make sure the resistance and centering is correct. Overall, it was a great investment.",

We have a fenced yard but there is a walkway leading to it that is not blocked off and housing won't allow us to screw into the walls. This gate is perfect because it is pressure mounted and looks so nice!! I highly recommend buying the \"wall savers\" for pressure gates as it makes it feel so solid and doesn't feel flimsy. (It's worth the extra $11 ) Our opening was so large we needed that little bit extra. Happy shopping!",

The fit and finish of the gate are top notch and it is quite sturdy. Our 65lb dog often puts his paws on the top of the gate (trying to train that out of him..) and the gate supports his weight and does not fall over.",

The install took about 10 mins, including unpackaging. I thought lifting the door to open the gate might be cheap or annoying - it\u2019s neither. The lock button and lifting maneuver is really easy. Also, the gate opens in either direction which is very convenient. It looks so much nicer than the all-white or all-wood gates I\u2019ve purchased over the years!",

      "text": "After scrolling through tons of gates, we went with this one. The width of opening was great and the wood/metal construction looked great. My husband installed it easily at the bottom of our stairs to prevent dogs from going upstairs. Wall on one end and the newell post on the other, no screws used on this gate. Door latches well, my 7-yr-old grandson figured it out right away, and it seems like it will hold up well. It's only been a few weeks but so far no issues. Also bought Wall Nanny supports and together my husband says it seems like a very stable set up.",
