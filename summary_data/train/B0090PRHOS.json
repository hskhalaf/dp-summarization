It is super-quiet and the ride feel is remarkably like being on the road. I haven't had it long enough to evaluate durability but by the build quality and the lifetime warranty (to the original purchaser) I'm pretty confident that it will last and last. I'm really happy that I decided to spend the extra $$ for a quality trainer. Sometimes, you get what you pay for.",

It does create a little bit of wear on the tires (more than we expected) but still doesn't wear them as much as frequent outdoor use for 6+ months would do. Overall very happy purchase.",

      "text": "I coupled my Cannondale road bike with a Wahoo Speed and Cadence sensor, Bikemate slimcase for the iPhone, a Polar H7 heart monitor, and this Cascade Fluid Pro Trainer for the most complete cardio equipment set you could ask for -- all bought on Amazon. Add the iBiker app of the iPhone to collect the data. This trainer is superb. It really does feel like riding on the road, and is very stable. You can find spinning videos on YouTube to add your workout, or just watch whatever. I have been very pleasantly surprised by this piece of equipment and would highly recommend it.",

Most were very large and bulky with big flywheels, but were usually not the same feel as actually riding your bike. My husband commutes to work on his bike and after using this Fluid Pro trainer for 30 minutes, he bought a second one to use at our cabin during the winter months. He had never liked trainers before because of the \"jerky\" motion. This one is very smooth and lifelike. We both agree that this trainer has the feel of actually riding a bike. We now own two of them.",

Over the years I have logged a significant amount of time on trainers and the Cascade Fluid Pro Trainer has the best feel of all. I use my trainer for very specific intensity workouts and the trainer provides a very real feel. The other benefit is the stability of the trainer base. Standing, sprinting or accelerating all feel great! I highly recommend this trainer to anyone that wants the real road feel indoors.",

The back roller is extremely quiet, which means no more of that \"whining\" noise when you train indoors. The two orange legs on the front pop back, and the back roller moves forward, which allows for compact travel of the trainer! I really enjoy using the trainer; it's very sturdy.",
