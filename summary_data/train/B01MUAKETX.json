After eqing with specific player app the high end ( those tent to be too bright and cause ear fatigue, ) I found that I can have my punchy bass and sub bass too. I use this and the Sony MDRXB70 for Funk, House music ( where bass frequencies are needed.) urge u all to custom your sound with specific players Apps- Onkyo HF or Colatplayer are the bomb! Alexia.",

But the sound was something else, very shrill treble and no bass at all. I downloaded their app as advised by reviews and tried it out. It worked for some tracks on my ITunes library but not others, all in all I got very frustrated. They are being returned, I will buy a bose pair instead.",

Maybe make sure you can tweak the sound of your source as I found them a bit muddy and bass-heavy when feeding them with a flat equaliser. After dialling back the bass frequenices a little they sound fantastic. Also worth noting that I haven't had a single connection problem while listening. On my phone (Samsung S7 Edge) I had to use the NFC feature to pair them, as the standard bluetooth pairing refused to work, but other than that they've been absolutely solid.",

Quite expensive but well worth the money. I looked around for a while and was going to buy Bose but glad I got these. I could never go back to wired now",

      "text": "I went for these earphones after upgrading to a headphone jack-less iPhone. I was over the moon with the quality of the wired momentums so these felt like a must buy. The quality & comfort is identical to the wired which I have to say impressed me as I was expecting a drop in quality. However, there\u2019s a massive issue in terms of audio/video lag on these. On any app I\u2019ve tried watching a video or playing a game, the sound comes through about a second after the video. You can imagine this makes for a frustrating video watching experience. Given the price tag, I would expect much better especially from Sennheiser.",

      "text": "Great sound. Unfortunately the bluetooth connection is sometimes a bit slow and cumbersome, even while connecting to devices that were already paired before. Some cheaper products connect faster, I would have expected more for the steep price. The message for \"power off\" and \"power on\" are virtually indistinguishable, so when the connection is slow, it is sometimes difficult to establish whether you are switching your product on or off. Apart from connection issues, good quality product.",

Shame as they are otherwise good headphones, easy to link via Bluetooth to an i-Phone and, despite any misgivings about having a yoke round one's neck, comfortable to wear. I'm not seeking a replacement this time.",
