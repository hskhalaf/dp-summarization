The fin fit just a little tight, but when I got them wet, they were perfect! I would not recommend going up a size. The fins have good propelling capabilities, are really easy to walk around on land in, and fit comfortably! They also fit easily in a suitcase, so are a good option to take on vacations! I live on the beach, so lucky for me, these beauties are going to get a lot of use in the coming months.",

My only complaint is that since they are a bit shorter, they don't propel you as far as other fins do.",

So lots of blisters after several hours of snorkeling. They are a bit more difficult to get on, especially once they are wet. They are handy, though, if you have to walk up beach due to rocks or coral. They are fairly easy to walk in, unlike most flippers.",

And being so short, the fins let you stand and walk relatively easily, in shallow water, which is the main attraction for them in our case (snorkelling in a small very rocky sheltered bay).",

My shoe size is 9-9.5 so I got a men\u2019s size 10, but it was a very tight fit; too tight. My wife tried them on and they fit her perfectly; she is a women\u2019s size 8-8.5. I bought another pair size 11 for me. Hope they fit well!",

The ability to walk around out of water allows me to get out of the pool to get something without having to remove them. I love the short finS.",

      "IMPORTANT SIZING INFORMATION - We have recently updated our sizing so in most cases Topside snorkel fins fit true to size; however, please review sizing chart in the images to ensure you pick the correct fins size.",
      "COMFORT - Topside fins fit like a shoe. No more blisters as you happily spend as much time as you want swimming, snorkeling, body boarding, or paddle boarding. The closed toe and heel prevent cramping and hypertension in your foot. Each fin has an adjustable Velcro strap around the ankle to provide further support. The neoprene boot allows for flexibility in sizing as the material has some stretch.",
      "VERSATILITY- We combine the function of both shoe and fin. Walk around land comfortably. No more awkward waddling in and out of the water. Easier to wear than most other fins. You will have more foot protection as each fin has a strong rubber sole. Additional uses for Topside fins include body boarding, paddle boarding, and river boarding.",
      "THRUST - While longer fins will provide more thrust for applications like diving, these short blade fins will provide noticeable boost to your swimming. This design has a stronger down kick than up due to the primary fin surface on top of the boot. For extended swims and deeper dives, we recommend you choose fins with longer blades. For casual snorkeling and shorter distance swimming a short blade fin will help with improving strength while providing needed thrust to get the job done.",
      "TRAVEL READY- A pair of Topside fins will fit easily into a carry-on or backpack. No need to suffer through low quality rental gear. Our swim fins also float. Drag from the rest of your body is reduced by the buoyancy of the fins lifting your legs in the water. They'll also never be lost to Davy Jones' locker."
