I purchased 2 by mistake and was going to return the other one, but I like it so much, its great to have a second great ball for others to use. A+",

My only issue would be that despite being called \"tack soft\" it really isn't soft. It's made to handle the rigors of outdoor courts so I'm not surprised. Just don't expect a ball that feels like an indoor only ball (like the Baden Elite or Wilson Evolution).",

The grip is pretty nice, but the ball feels a bit harder than usual for the ones I pick up in its price range. Now it's been a couple of months of use (about 6 times a month), it's been well broken in and feels very nice when dribbling and shooting now. The grip is holding up well, although I only play indoors. One down side to this ball is that it's pretty slippery where the NBA logo is printed.",
