They have exceeded my expectations. I drive around 150 miles a day 5 or 6 days a week as well as take long road trips driving 5+ hours at a time. I haven't had a single issue with these tires and would not hesitate to buy again. These tires will last quite a while. They barely show wear and it I'd either over 13k miles. I definately reccomend.",

I do have a lead foot and drive my cars hard, but 15,000 miles is ridiculous. I purchased these on a chance and I have about 5,000 miles in since August when purchased and my Saturn rides smoother than before, handles very well, and have very nice grip in the rain. Haven't had snow yet so waiting totest that, but I'd purchase another set in the future no problem.",
