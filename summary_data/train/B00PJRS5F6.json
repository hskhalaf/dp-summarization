The bouncer is virtually silent as well so no worries about noisy hardware waking him up. The music/sounds are a nice touch, but we haven't really used them yet.

The toy bar does unhook too easily in my opinion, but it stays put once it\u2019s in place and I don\u2019t think it would come off unless knocked pretty hard or grabbed; also, the toy bar is lightweight so I don\u2019t think it really poses too much of a hazard even if it was knocked loose. If worried though, there\u2019s no reason the toy bar couldn\u2019t just be taken off and stored. This is a good solution if you want a bouncer that actually bounces and doesn\u2019t just vibrate.",

Even on the high setting, it barely moves, and if the baby moves at all, it stops bouncing. Also, this doesn't have anything to do with the function of the seat, but if you notice in the pictures the little toys that hang down? They face out, so the person looking at the toys see the cute faces and details, but all baby sees is the white back. Nothing major, just a little detail that bothers me. I would not recommend this.",
