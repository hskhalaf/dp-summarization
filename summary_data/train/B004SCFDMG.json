The thin metal motor housing, which came already installed, was bent at the base and scrapped the blade mounts. Had to take the fan down and bend the housing to miss the blade mounts. The candelabra lights limit the choice of LED lights to get a brighter output. Since the LEDs use much less current and generate much less heat, regular medium screw bases would allow one to choose almost any light level desired. Otherwise, it's a ceiling fan, but not a very good one for the price.",

      "text": "This is a nice, quiet operating fan. The reason I didn't give it five stars is because the color really isn't 'maple' - as indicated in the discription. Rather, the color of the blades is more of a 'dark walnut' as is shown in the picture. I actually used the blades that came with the fan as patterns as I cut new blades out of some nice 'Ash' veneer that I had. The light Ash color of the blades I made looked better with my decor.",
