      "verdict": "The sleek and stylish design, sturdy yet flexible insole and the aggressive outsole of the Saucony Caliber TR have earned many followers in the market. Its long-term durability and the reasonable price make it a decent choice for most neutral runners who are looking for a rugged trail running shoe to sustain various challenging surfaces.",
      "pros": [
        "According to the majority, the Saucony Caliber TR is a reasonably comfortable shoe",
        "Most of the runners were happy with the lightweight disposition of the shoe since it apparently increased the efficiency of their runs",
        "Several customers noticed that the upper was highly breathable",
        "their feet remained cool and dry while they were out on the trails",
        "A few purchasers appreciated the overall look of the shoe by calling it \u2018stylish\u2019",
        "A wearer said that he loved the \u2018glove-like\u2019 fit of the upper"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "Some customers had problems with the sizing scheme of the shoe",
        "it was apparently inconsistent",
        "A user was of the opinion that the shoe was not sufficiently durable as its condition quickly deteriorated after only several miles of running"

These are very light weight, yet they have excellent traction. They are comfortable and I love the laces! All sneakers should have these types of laces. They are a prefect length and textured to not unravel.",
