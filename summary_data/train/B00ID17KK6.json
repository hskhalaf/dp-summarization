      "text": "Perfect laptop, better than any windows laptop for general web browsing and word/powerpoint processing (courtesy of Google Docs). Speedy, doesn't lag and no problems with storage or RAM. Currently using it everyday and can't fault it. Battery easily lasts all day with charging only necessary every couple of days. Lightweight portable, great for working on the go such as on a train or bus. Would 100% recommend to anyone looking for an inexpensive laptop. Note: Chrome OS doesn't run certain programmes such as Photoshop or Microsoft Office (however Microsoft Office on-line is available with limited functionality compared to full version). Acer C720 definitely one of the best Chromebooks, just make sure you are aware of Chrome OS' limitations.",

Her friends have an MacBook Air, and an Alienware PC. For their purposes, this is just as good: the price was so low, the battery life is excellent due to no moving parts, and it's reasonably light. It's got it all for surfing, editing docs, and watching videos, and if you do want a more complete experience, you can always install ubuntu in developer mode.",

    "title": "Acer Chromebook C720 Touchscreen 11.6\" Laptop Black - 2GB RAM 16GB SSD HD Intel 2955U 1.4GHz WiFi Google Chrome Bluetooth Webcam C",
    "description": "Style Name:Non-touch screen 16GB SSD| Colour Name:Silver\n\nACER C720 11.6-INCH CHROMEBOOK\nThe Acer C720 is small but powerful. It's easy to pop in your bag, yet packs a powerful Intel Celeron 2955U processor based on the Haswell micro-architecture, plus offers up to 8.5 hours of battery life for smooth sailing all day. This Chromebook also boots up in seconds and resists viruses, so you don't need to wait or worry. \n\nALL-DAY POWER\nThe C720 is extremely powerful, thanks to the Intel Celeron 2955U processor based on the Haswell micro-architecture. You can zip through your tasks and have fun too, without recharging, because the C720 has up to 8.5 hours of battery life. \n\nINTERNET LIFE\nLog in once and you're set. The C720 syncs and safely backs up all your data in the cloud: docs in Google Drive, emails in Gmail, and even open browser tabs and bookmarks. Collaborate in real time or go solo with hundreds of apps that can be used while offline.\n\nAPPS GALORE\nPlay and work from the get-go with your favorite Google apps. Find thousands more in the Chrome Web Store. Everything looks stunning on the C720's 11.6-inch 1366 x 768 display. Plus, you can access your media on external drives super-fast via the USB 3.0 port.\n\nQUICK AND EASY\nThe C720 makes life easier for you. It starts within just 7 seconds, so you can wait less and do more. You won't be bothered by updates, as they're done automatically. The C720 has virus protection built-in, so it stays healthy -- which reduces your stress too.\n\nSTORE MORE\nYou can save more files on your Chromebook, which comes with 16GB Solid State Drive (SSD), and a SD card reader. It also offers up to 2GB of onboard dual-channel DDRB3L system memory, making it ideal for both work and play.\n\nGOOGLE CHROME\nThe Acer C720 features the Google Chrome OS interface. Fast and intuitive, this new interface allows you to easily pin your favourite apps using right-click, customise the background or resize windows in order to create the best fit computing environment.\n\nHDMI-OUT PORT\nIf you need a bigger screen, the HDMI interface supports exceptional high-definition viewing on a full range of peripherals. Perfect for connecting to a big-screen HDTV, plugging a HDMI cable into your Chromebook allows the transmission of both audio and high-definition video, up to a 1080p resolution. You'll find lots of compatible HDMI devices are available, or already in your home, so the C720 will fit perfectly into your digital life.\n\nGET CONNECTED\nSurf the Internet and stay in touch with your people with reliable, high-speed connectivity via Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth 4.0. A Wi-Fi Certified wireless-N network connection enables long-range, fast, reliable wireless Internet. Acer SignalUp with Nplify technology increases transfer speeds, and reduces dead spots and dropped connections.\n\nThe Acer C720 also offers DC-in jack for AC adapter, SD card reader, headphone/speaker jack and USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports. USB 3.0 allows you to transfer files from your PC to external device up to 10 times faster than USB 2.0.\n\nACER CRYSTAL EYE HD WEBCAM WITH BUILT-IN MICROPHONE\nThe integrated high-performance HD webcam, with 1280 x 720 resolution, and built-in microphone offer optimal video capture and sound clarity for engaging in high resolution face-to-face communication.\n\n\n\nLEGAL DISCLAIMER\nPlease note prior to dispatch the product we/supplier open the Box in order to make sure all the Contents and Accessories are present and then we put our Company\u2019s seal (if required) or Supplier\u2019s Quality Checked Seal which means that the Product has been inspected & Quality Checked.
