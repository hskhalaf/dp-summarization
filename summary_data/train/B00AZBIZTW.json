I avoid the overheating by taking a 10 minute break between every 200 sq ft, which happens to be approx when the canister gets full.

One-pass gets nearly everything! For steps, there's a brush with a separate motor that works better than the Dustbusters of old! To top things off, it's easy to clean and very lightweight. The bottom design also prevents it from grabbing cords and shoelaces, which often get chewed up in other vacuums. Great purchase for my first time researching vacuums!",

It does fill up pretty quick though (but that could be due to our pets...) Speaking of pets, it works GREAT with pet hair. Only complaint is there really isn't a good way to carry it!! it's so awkward when my wife has to carry it upstairs or down into the basement. Normally, I just do it for her because it's so awkward.",

The hose attachment does a poor job sucking up any dirt and the hard floor option is awful. Yes, I have emptied the canister and cleaned the filters. The cord is shorter than my previous vacuum. Not enough attachments. The hose attachment does not even fit in the holder, I have to use the attachment to keep it in place. Turn on/off switch in inconvient place. PROS Smaller frame, lighter than most vacuums. I have an older Hoover that I have upstairs, I will switch them since I use the downstairs vacuum daily.",

      "text": "The vacuum seems to be great. But two things immediately stood out. First of all, this one had been used before. Had dirt/dust in the canister. Don't know how or when, but even the filter was dirty. Second, not one thing was in the box, or on the box. My address, and that is it. No directions, instruction manual or warranty card. Nothing, period. Ok, it's a vacuum and not that hard to figure out how to put together. But surely \"something\" would come in the box. So my review isn't dinging the product s much as it is the experience. First time I've ever had an issue with ordering from Amazon.",

One thing to keep in mind--empty it outside so you don't re-dust your house with dirt when emptying the chamber. Went to town on the rugs in my roommates' rooms and it picked up a ton of dirt. A great buy for $65. It is a bit bulky, but I really love this vacuum. So excited I'm about to give it another spin.",

The wand hose which is too short and attaches to the bottom of vacuum has to be pulled out when using the wand, which is weird design because dust and dirt blow out of wand holder hole.

      "text": "This is the worst product I have purchased on Amazon and certainly the worst vacuum I have ever purchased. There are MANY design flaws. Bottom line - every time I use the vacuum I have to take it apart to get the dirt, pet hair, etc, from around the filter and all parts - dirt flies everywhere; it is disgusting! read the other reviews that spell out all the flaws as they are 100% spot on... I have never had a product that is this defective - obviously I am very disappointed... and also I will be calling customer service as well- this is completely unacceptable",
