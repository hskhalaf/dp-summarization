      "text": "I paired this shampoo with the wow conditioner and my hair feels amazingly soft without being heavy. I love the smell and the fact that it doesn't feel like I'm stripping or drying out my hair. After having a baby and living in an area with hard water my hair was looking a feeling rough. I used expensive products, and home remedies with no improvement. I used this bottle at my friend's house and immediately fell in LOVE! I feel pretty passionate about this product because I really didn't think I would ever be able to have nice hair again.",
