      "text": "I've had the same pair of Sennheiser headphones for 14 years so I'm a pretty big fan of the brand. These were good, but I've sent them back for a refund as the wireless range is very poor. You'll maybe get 4 metres before they start cutting out, and Logitech 2.4Ghz dongles for mice/keyboards cause interference on the connection. You also cannot toggle between the wireless and bluetooth connections on the headset, which is a peculiar failure of product design. Quite comfy and well made, however.",

      "text": "Sound quality, when it works, is great. However every now and then (every 20-30 seconds, to every few minutes) there are interruptions and static crackles. I've moved the dongle from the back of my computer (wooden desk) to front, with 60 cm distance from the headset and from interruptions on every 5-10 seconds, now I get crackle every 30 seconds-2 minutes. As for the claims that it's \"studio microphone quality\", that is just blatantly false, microphone sounds like on any other gaming headset I have ever tried. If this was a 50-100 pounds headset, It would get 4-5 stars, but at 260 GBP, such issues and bad quality is unacceptable.",

I have problems with the connectivity sometimes, the dongle seems to need clear line of sight and tethering internet from your phone interferes with the signal. Pros: 1. Sound amazing 2. They charge really fast 3. Very comfortable after you wear them in for a bit. Cons: 1. Almost no range 2. Not as loud as i would like. 3. Base is balanced but lacking real punch.",

The power delivery on 3 interferes with the signal and reduces range dramatically. This is not isolated to this device but a lot of dongle\u2019s suffer from this.",

Adjustment of head set makes no difference at all. Moving more than two metres away and the signal starts to drop out. The sound cancellation has stopped working and am trying to return, So far I've waited two and a half weeks for a call back!! Absolutely dont buy these!!!",

The headphones sound great and they look the part too. No matter whether you're gaming or watching or listening, these just sound great. You can switch between EQ profiles with the press of a button but I tend to leave this as is, though you can save your own presets. The Bluetooth range and connection remains throughout and suits walking to the kitchen without loss of signal. As I say, I've not had the issues others seem to have encountered, so recommend these. The battery is good too!",
