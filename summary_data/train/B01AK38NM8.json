The toe box everyone talks about is nice and gives room and toe bashing protection. My shoe sizing is 12 wide but not available so I went straight 12 and they're not too tight. Good support. Look Cool. Keep feet cool and dry. Oh no they wear out like every other pair of shoes. Negative reviews can suck it. 2 weeks and I haven't left any cleats behind from them. Pick up your dam feet neanderthals. If you live the boot life these should be your sneakers.",

Merrill runs about a 1/2 size big so I got a half size smaller than my road running mizunos and they fit perfectly. I went for a run after it rained all morning and I had a ton of grip on the trails, awesome! If there is gravel on your route, you can still feel the rocks but it doesn't hurt like it does running off road in my road shoes. I would say if you don't wanna feel the rocks then maybe not this shoe because some trail shoes have harder soles, but these work well.",
