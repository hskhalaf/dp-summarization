My baby had a food line around his neck with tommie Tippie but not with this brand. The material is flexible so it\u2019s adjusts to baby for snug but not chocking fit. It fits my baby and my 2 year old son. Love that it catches dropped food...less waist. Makes meal time cleanup much easier!",

We can just wipe them off when we wipe off the girls and throw them right back in the bag so they're ready for next time! AMAZING.

Liquid can tip out of the bib if there is a lot in there and the child leans over or to the side though as a mommy hack you can stick a little paper napkin in the trough of the bib to help reduce this kind of spill with very liquidy foods/drinks. My only complaint is that for kids with longer hair, it can be hard to close the bib without catch some hair in the snap/button closure.",

Babies are learning how to grab or pinch the food and they drop so much! I pull out the tray just a notch more than usual to make room for the bib, and 90% of dropped food falls in the pocket. I scoop it out and let her try again! Some will still get in her high chair, but I always bathe right after dinner and this bib makes the clean-up so much faster.",

If you're a new parent or are still looking for the right bib, then definitely consider giving these a try.",

      "text": "These bibs are awesome. Easy to fasten (and not quite so easy for the baby to pull off), easy to clean (you can even put them in the dishwasher), easy to store (roll up and shove into a diaper bag), and great at keeping food off the baby's lap because the pouch actually holds its shape (unlike some cloth/plastic hybrid bibs where the pouch is essentially useless). We've used lots of bibs over the years, and I do like the waterproof green sprouts bibs for drooling babies, but as far as eating goes these are by far the best. Wish they had been around for my oldest many years ago, but we're definitely getting good use out of them now!",

Also, as some people mentioned, liquids tend to go through the top gap between the neck and the bib which gets the top of the shirts dirty. After having it for 8 months, the area to close the bib is starting to tear around the holes but would definitely purchase again if necessary.",

      "text": "Very nice quality bib that easily cleans up. I purchased these for my 13 month old who is becoming a more independent eater...who drops a lot of food! He even thinks it's pretty entertaining to dig food out of the pouch and eat it from there! These bibs catch the pieces nicely without being too big to be in the way. Colors are as vibrant as displayed - really pretty. Overall a great product! The only change I might make to them is to have a the closure area be a cotton fabric so it was a bit more comfortable on the neck...then of course they wouldn't clean and dry as easily...so you can't have it all I guess! :)",

The only thing to be aware of/cautious about is that the flexibility of the \u201ccontainer\u201d part of the bib can mean that the food can come out as you take the bib off the baby. I happen to like the flexibility because it means I can invert the container and wash it out really quickly under the tap. I can imagine other people not liking it though (my cousins kid throws up regularly and she needs a firm container).",

However, when the second order arrived, the box was torn up and the bibs were almost cut - even the plastic bag inside was cut. They were inside a box that was inside an Amazon box, so I'm not sure how that happened. I wish they weren't wrapped in a plastic bag too, they're already in a cardboard box so the plastic is pointless and more for me to recycle. Please consider getting rid of the plastic packaging.",

Specially on the go, when you can't clean it until getting home, it molds. Now, these all-silicone bibs are great because you wipe it clean and they are perfectly fine. Obviously you need to clean them with soapy water later on but they dry fast. Also, the OXO are velcro and she takes them off so much faster. These silicone ones are harder to take off. We love these! and the colors are good for girls and boys.",

There's a similar looking product made by another company with a very recognizable brand name that I've tried at a friend's house that is much stiffer and less comfortable. Very easy to wash, you can hand wash, toss them in the dishwasher or even washing machine if you want (but please don't put them in the dryer). Highly recommend these over any other bib I've tried/seen... I'll probably start giving these as gifts too because they are just awesome.",

I'm so used to baby items always staining. The first time I thought it had stained after washing it but when I checked it again after it dried it was mysteriously gone.
