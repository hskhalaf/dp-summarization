    "title": "EcoDecors Eleganto Teak Shower Bench, 18\", Natural",
    "description": "The compact size of 18\" length x14\" width x 18\" height provides a compact footprint that will fit in most tight areas. These stools include foot leveling pads to provide extra flexibility and stability to allow stabilization due to any minor slope, and uneven surfaces, like shower floors. Teak is naturally water, mold, and mildew resistant due to its natural density and high oil content. It has been the wood of choice for hundreds of years of luxury boat builders. This natural resistance has been supplemented by using our proprietary EcoDecors sealer which is a deep penetrating stain with added mold, mildew, and fungus inhibitors. It provides the ability for this teak furniture to be used outdoors as well as indoors. EcoDecors develops unique home d\u00e9cor & furnishings using recycled, reclaimed, and upcycled materials. We focus on using materials that let the natural beauty of teakwood be highlighted, including the natural wood grains and color variations. We have developed a coating process that both protects the wood, and brings out the natural grains and colors of the teak wood. Every EcoDecors furniture and accessory uniquely highlights its materials. EcoDecors is a small family owned and operated company pricing itself on quality, value, and service. We source directly from small rural workshops in developing countries. Our craftspeople use artisan techniques handed down from generation to generation to craft cast off doors, old boats, buildings, brides, rail road ties, teak roots, and other material into one of a kind functional works of art. To assure our quality we employ our own inspection staff on site and do 100% quality re-inspection in the USA. Made in Indonesia by local crafts people. Sustainably sourced and manufactured. Weight capacity is 250 pounds. Please Note: Some Assembly is required",
