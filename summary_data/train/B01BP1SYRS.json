I could have handled one quick electric pump to set up the inflation BUT surprise??!! there are 8, yes 8 other smaller nozzles that have to be inflated before you sit in this mess. The nozzles do not fit the electric pump so I would seriously have the lie down in the base and try to get my mouth on each nozzle to 'hand' inflate!! I can imagine the neighbors watching this!!! And of course, it doesn't get hot enough here until mid-June and by the time I asked for a refund....seller said too late.",

I found this on amazon, and finally had a day off of work and blew it up (with a pump) and filled it up. Literally, 1.5-2 hours after inflating it, I go outside to get in it and this is what I see... the water was not over the max fill line, nor was there a visible defect. A total waste of Gallo\u2019s of water that I will have to pay for along with a waste of my time.",

It does have a stopper, but it doesn't allow the water to drain very well. The seating is pretty comfortable, but the space between the seat and the wall is a great place for gunk to grow. It is just too much maintenance for a smaller pool. I could live with the other flaws if it would just stay inflated longer.",
