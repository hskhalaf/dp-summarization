The little lock that allows you to open and close the lid seems sturdy enough. It has a button snap on the left and right side of the box that gives you access to where you can hang your necklaces and they won't get tangled. The ring holders keep my rings in place nicely too.",

The travel case is such a nice add on piece. She is just going to love it. Thank you so so much.",

I didn\u2019t like the holders for earrings, made of cardboard with small holes. Not a good choice either if you have many necklaces, especially longer ones. I still need additional containers for my jewelry collection but like the lock on this box to store more fine jewelry although it would probably be easy to open anyway as it is very tiny. I like this case, but it could be better.",

With a little tweaking it serves its purpose for me, but I\u2019m not a huge jewelry person. If you are and need easy access and visualization or simply have a lot to store, you may want to reconsider.",

It tends to want to close on it's own. The front of the chest comes down when you open the case so be prepared for that. She thought it was a great place to set her earrings while changing them so they don't get lost.",

The inside is lined with a soft, microfiber type of material which keeps each item in its place. All of the drawers glide in and out smoothly, and the side flaps are a nice bonus for necklace and bracelet organization. Highly recommend!",

      "text": "I absolutely LOVE this! Even though it's more than I wanted to spend, I instantly knew it was worth every dollar. My only qualm: there needs to be more space for necklaces. I could barely fit mine. I ended up hanging them across all four of the \"hooks\" longways and was able to fit about 3 chain necklaces on each side. I had a few thicker statement/bib necklaces that I had to stuff in the pouch in the top above the earrings. The travel case is such a nice addition and so much safer than throwing your jewelry in a zip-lock as I've always done! Would definitely recommend to any accessory enthusiast!",
