You still have to have your hands on it, but it makes it much more easy. Only took three tries and I was up on the board. Great value for what you pay and has been holding up nicely all summer.",

If water sports are your thing or if you are planning an aquatic adventure for the family, you're going to need a surface board you can count on to bring along the excitement! \n\nDon't think you need to grab a separate kid's knee board? Want the kids to learn how to share? This cushioned knee board is the top choice among those looking for water boards for kids, teenagers and adults! Use it as a water board for kids and then hop on it yourself to do a little board surfing so you can show the young ones how it's done. \n\nKneel surfing is easier than ski surfing, which is why it is popular aquatic activity among kids and adults of all skill levels.
