It has virtually no scent. It's light and goes on smooth with a satiny feel. It's on the lighter side, so if you have dry skin and is looking for something heavier, this may not be it. I have combination skin and it works well for me.",

      "text": "I don't think this is a bad product, but it is not for me. An hour or two after applying it, my face will be slightly oily, and the oiliness will increase over time. If I apply it lightly, it will not moisturize properly. When I look into the mirror, I can see it as a clear mask on my face that accentuates wrinkles with normal facial movement. It's as if I had applied a clear facial mask rather than a moisturizer. I have enough experience to know there is no \"one-size-fits-all moisturizer. I'm sure it will be perfect for some others, but it isn't perfect for me.",
