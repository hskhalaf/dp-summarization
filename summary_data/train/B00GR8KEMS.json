The plate is big and heavy and you attach the strap to the end of plate which will naturally cause torque. This torque is the reason so many people have complained about it coming unscrewed. I also found the plate incredibly bulky and cumbersome - especially when lying it down or putting into a camera bag. The large clip on the strap that connects to the plate just adds to the bulk. On the positive side, I have found all the materials to be well made.",

The neck straps that come with camera are nice, but after being around your neck for a while, you end up holding your camera in one hand, to relieve the strain on your neck. using this strap relieves the strain, and the strap is not even around your neck. It's nice to have your camera rest be your side on the strap, and not have to worry about any neck strain. I give it a four star, due to the padded section. I don't think a zip pouch is truly necessary, and makes the padding a little too thick, but doesn't hinder me from not using it.",

It didn't state a weight limit in the description, but it appeared that with this lens on it was too heavy to keep the plate tight. I contacted the manufacturer who suggested that I watch the videos for use, but I didn't find a fix for this issue. This item would probably be fine for a lighter set-up. I purchased a cheaper one, and it works fine, but it is not made as nice as this one.",

One of my favorite features of this strap is the small bit storage it had for SD cards or small caps, very convenient. After using this product for a few months, I highly recommend it.",

An additional nice touch is the backup attachment point to where you normally attach you camera strap to the DSLR. This gives me an extra sense of comfort knowing that if I fudge up and the main attach point unscrews itself, the camera will not fall into a potential catastrophe. Well thought out Design.",

For me the benefit of a long cross shoulder strap for carrying any camera for a lengthy period, particularly a heavy full frame dSLR, is well proven in real world use. My main issue with this strap is the size of the slad that connects to the tripod screw. The strap has features that may make it desirable for some users but not for me. I prefer a different brand that has a simple screw in connection to the tripod socket on the base of the camera to minimize weight and complexity.",

I feel very comfortable and do worry at all about my camera dropping. The strap is adjustable and allows your camera to ride safely and comfortable at you hip. If you have large telephoto lens like 150-600mm this is the perfect strap. You can attach the metal connector plate to the tripod mount on the lens avoiding stress on the camera itself. When you are hiking in the wild with a 6-8 pound lens attached to your camera you will be thankful you purchased the Quick release sling.",

I love the zippered pocket to keep a microfiber cloth and extra SD card. The thing I dislike about it is the mount, it's big and bulky. I didn't have any issues with the thumb screw backing out. They use a rubber washer between the screw and mounting plate. This gives the screw some grip so it can't back out on its own very easily. I used the included safety strap just in case.",
