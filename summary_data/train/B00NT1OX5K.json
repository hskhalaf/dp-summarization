      "text": "I bought this for the front door. It stayed in the box for a little over a year until we could finally decide on a new front door. I installed it almost a year ago and the batteries haven't even died yet so it only is used moderately. Randomly it is malfunctioning and keeps trying to lock itself even when it's already locked. I checked and made sure the auto lock feature is turned off and I changed out the batteries just to make sure. Still no good. I expected more from a higher end lock like this.",

I did like the wifi features that I had integrated with samsung SmartThings. When it worked it was good. But it\u2019s reliability for remote control was a coin toss on a daily basis.",

This was super helpful because as shipped it was too large for the door. A quick screw or two later and it fits perfectly in the door-lock housing. Overall works great, fairly easy to install. Wires are a bit cramped so if you can afford to have 2 folks working on it then you should do so. It will make it easier. Last few steps fall in line pretty easy once you get the initial stuff out of the way.",

TIP --- If you are having trouble with the lock automatically locking all the way and it keeps beeping (happened to me) it's because your hole isn't deep enough for the lock to go all the way in. I took a 1/2\" drill bit and deepened the hole and then the locked work great! Don't expect this to be installed without a little modifications to your door...let's be reasonable people.",

This is as close to a standard keyed deadbolt as you can get but with the convenience of a keypad. You have to change the batteries every six months or so but otherwise, it's been flawless. It's also bump-proof, which is important.",
