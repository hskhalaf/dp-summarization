The seller Laptop Outlet continually refers me back to the manufacturer and has no interest in resolving the problem as it is out of the Manufacturers 12 month Warranty period. When I contact the manufacturer they direct me to a website which clearly states that the faulty parts have a 24 month warranty. When I called the seller and explained that they have obligations, they told me to contact Trading Standards. I would not recommend either this product or LAPTOP OUTLET as being reliable",

It works as a portable device but trying to connect it to fixed appliances in an office has revealed flaws in the design. There is no HDMI port, the USB 3 Type-C port being used instead. The Type-C port does not appear to conform to the standard and is a proprietary implementation. This is frustrating since third-party products will not work correctly, particularly docking devices and HDMI+Hub adapters. Since Lenovo don't make a docking unit for this range it is both inconsiderate and stupid!",

Lenovo have lost ONE customer. I won't be going back! Unfortunately I've been overseas since I bought it. If I'd been in the UK I would have sent it back!!",
