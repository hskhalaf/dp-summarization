Like the kind of quick spark you get when you rub your feet on a carpet and touch someone. But continuous. I yanked them out and threw them in the trash. I\u2019ll go buy from Apple website now.

But they are what they say they are. They are good for working out, and for listening to audio off your phone. I received the ones require for lightning port (using iPhone 7 Plus) the volume + - buttons work and they have a built in Mic to answer calls and talk with the ear pods on.",

If I was moving at all they reported a ton of back ground noise they described as crackling and rubbing. I have since bought another pair from apple directly and they work fabulous.

I already spent more than 60 bucks for these things! Does Apple know these EarPods are pretty much junk? really kind of disheartening. Might as well buy after market EarPods for fraction of cost.They'll probably last just as long!",
