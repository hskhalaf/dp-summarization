Aside from that it does seem durable and will definitely serve its purpose. There are lots of outer pockets for creams and such, very handy! I love the leather looking carry handles. Warning: it does come completely flattened and the inner dividers must be attached but it only takes a matter of seconds and the weight of diapes, wipes and goodies will get it to keep its shape. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase!",

The felt is great for giving that little bit of friction needed to hold the yarn in place. The side pockets easily hold all the accessories I use in an orderly fashion. And it stands on its own. All in all I highly recommend this product as a yarn basket.",
