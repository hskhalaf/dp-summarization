I bought this as an alarm clock and thought it had a radio. But as the description says it does not. - This is not necessarily hard to set up, but it is far from intuitive. Over time if you change things often you would get them memorized, but I am sure I will need to keep the instructions handy. But that can be difficult when you have kids around.",

There is no humanly way possible to adjust the volume for the alarm. Plus it doesn\u2019t allow for am/fm radio play when waking up, only an annoying alarm melody. To get the alarm to turn off you have to go through a series of steps instead of pressing a button... this is frustrating for my 7 year old! The color changing is awesome and the speaker sound is great so it works very well as a Bluetooth speaker!",

This digital clock/speaker definitely requires using and following the instructions, because there are so many features and they are all controlled by how you hit the mode button and use the left and right (rewind/fforward buttons). Not 100% intuitive, but as long as you never lose the instructions, this is a good product. Seems good quality. Recommend buying a USB plug with it, so you have the option of keeping it plugged in and using it as a clock that stays on.",
