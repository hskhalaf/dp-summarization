I would think that since it was being shipped and not bought in store that they would be sealed and not just put in paper bags. Also, everything was set in the box a little haphazardly and the stencils were bent. Not a huge deal, but I would think that they would at least be placed between notebooks to keep them flat and nice. Overall the set is really nice. Actual decent sized wooden stamps, notebooks set up as comics already. But the packaging could've been better.",

The front and back of both books are blank. The pages are super thick like card stock paper and each page has different version of squares for comic art! I was missing a marker from the kit but after contacting the company they were quick to fix the problem! Great company! Great product! Recommend for anyone who wants to create their own comics!",

I bought early when I came across it on amazon, and when he opened it for his birthday (over 30 days later) one of the bottles of ink was unsealed and had leaked all over the contents of the box. Boo! Couldn't be replaced because it was past 30 days. Such a frustration and disappointment. It looks like it would have been a great kit.",
