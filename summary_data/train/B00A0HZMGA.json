The whole process went more quickly than mounting a conventional, fan-based cooler, while leaving a lot more open space in the bargain.

Running a mild OC on my 4690k (4.3Ghz @ 1.24v currently, been up to 4.5, but voltage is a bit too high for my tastes) and it keeps it in check with torture test temps ~70C. I will say one thing, though - the pre-applied thermal compound was good for 75C with the same settings. 70C is on Arctic Silver, but your results may vary! You do need access to the back of your motherboard to install the backing plate, but once that's done, installation is a breeze. Looks good, is very quiet, cools well, what more can you ask for? Also, no leaks. :D",
