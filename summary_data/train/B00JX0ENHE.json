I ground up some chicken breast and made pesto meatballs which turned out great! I also liked the \"lock,unlock\" switch on the side which after a few minutes I realized was to suction the unit to the countertop. After that it was smooth sailing. Would definitely recommend and have already bragged about it to friends. I preferred this over a mixer attachment because once back in the box this item stores easily and minimally.",

You need industrial shredders for that so go elsewhere and quit complaining your inexpensive plastic grinder didn't work well on them. The fine mesh worked great for ham and the larger size worked well for salsa ingredients. Also, I think for ground beef, the larger size mesh would work better since the goal for that would likely be to help keep in juices when you make patties and meatloaf.",

I had used a similar one when I was younger so I knew how to use it, but this thing was not like the sturdy silver one from my youth. The knob for the crank handle came off almost immediately. I used only the largest grinder but still no use even on soft chicken meat. Wow was it a HUGE disappointment!!!",

      "text": "I purchased this for the specific use of making sweet bell pepper relish. Unfortunately, the only way I could get the peppers and onions to grind was to cut them in approx one to two inch pieces. Any bigger and the feeder would not grab them and feed them to the chamber to the grinder. And the lock down feature was a joke. It would lock down...until you started using it! Once I cut the peppers into smaller pieces and held on to the grinder with one hand and turned the handle with the other, it did grind them up into the size I wanted....but was not the quick work I thought it would be.",
