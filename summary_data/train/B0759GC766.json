I was really nervous to put this in the water because it's got some weight to it. As advertised, it performed great in the water. Watching it hit some deep bass while in the water is super cool. One feature I would suggest for future models, is a way to flip through songs from the speaker. Getting out of the water to do that was a little cumbersome. I will still give this 5 stars as it is one of the coolest products I've ever purchased. The battery life and sound quality far surpassed my expectations.",

For $450 I can't emphasize enough about the bass. I bought a bluetooth speaker from Aiwa for $300 and the mids and highs sound great and it has definitely more \"Booming\" (Bass) to it.

We hung out with about 5 other boats and swam with it floating the water for about 5 hours one day. It was loud enough for everyone in the area to enjoy it. Battery lasts a long time. I have yet to run it out. Should also double as a coyote call this winter.",
