Let me tell you, there was nothing like the feel of this Wilson NCAA Composite football under my arm as I trucked 12 year old kids and relived my freshman year C team glory days. Although the kids haven\u2019t come back to play in my yard due to various injuries, I know lead the neighborhood in touch football stats for the season. Can\u2019t wait to bust this out at the neighborhood picnic this week!",

I spoke to customer service at Wilson Sporting goods and asked them which iteration of their football design would perform best for my Grandson. Customer Service directed my attention to the Youth Composite Football. My Grandson opened his presents today and found the football. We went outdoors and through the ball around for a while. Two thing I noticed immediately was the ball was easy to grip because of the finish of the ball. The second thing I noticed is that the football easily fit into my Grandson's hand. This is a great youth football with from a great company",
