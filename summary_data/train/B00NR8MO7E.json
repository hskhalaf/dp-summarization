It's warm, and really smells like Suede Leather. I've long stopped buying anything made with leather for personal reasons, so very nice to have this aroma in my home again. Straight Razor smells old school shaving lotion. Never thought about that, but for a bathroom, it's perfect. The Mahogany is a perfect compliment for either, if you're in a larger room. This is warm, fresh and a really unique alternative to the overly sweet candles on the market",

(Maybe they were talking aboutt the 11 ounce candles and not the 4 ounce candles) This is not my favorite candle set though. There are just too many other choices out there. This is just too lightly scented for me. :)",
