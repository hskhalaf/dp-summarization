Sure there are graphical enhancements on the current gen systems, but that\u2019s just icing on what is already, a darned fine cake. Highly recommended this version if you just have a PS3 and haven\u2019t got it already. An all time classic! \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\udc4d",

Fantastic all-round game. Rockstar expands the story from one central character, but three individuals, each with their own personality and perspective. The player can switch between characters on the fly. This makes for some interesting situations, such as sending yourself to go help yourself when you're in a bind. Or, my personal favorite: driving two characters directly towards each other and switching back and forth until the inevitable loss of control takes place. I take a bizarre amount of glee watching my \"other\" body fly through the windshield in front of me.",

It's an 18 for a reason, so those who are easily offended I suggest you look at another beige title !).

Gunfights are smooth with almost Gears of War fluidity to taking cover, voice acting is first class, highly recommend to play with with headphones and without subtitles for the movie-like experience. Online multiplayer is good fun, especially with friends. Cons:- The LOOOONG loading times are almost Resident Evil 1 frustrating, there is only so much patience one can spend looking at the loading screen pictures. Once you max out all the skills (which actually doesn't take that long), there is little incentive to keep grinding away. Even the new missions unlocked at higher levels feel repetitive.",

The characters are foul mouthed - which is refreshing in a age where so many games try to shelter innocent minds from such vulgar and repulsive behaviour. Not for children - they should not be cycling at their age. They should be outside playing. I recommend buying Trevor a suit. The views are delightful and the scenery exquisite.",

The storyline surpasses most of the Hollywood Movies around.

It's the same as always, guns, gangsters and in-depth stories, (lots of the 'n' word as well, cheers Franklin) There's a reason it's an 18, much more of a reason because of Trevor.

If ONLY Rockstar had given the option for a custom radio station (using PS3 music) then it would be perfect.

If u like your cars you will love it. there are some great cars in the game. Plus choppers, motor bikes of all kinds plus bmx's, boats jet skye. 5stars is not enough.

The free roaming and side line missions are a great distraction to carrying out the main missions. Main missions make up a great story following three main characters who lead a very varied but clashing lifestyle which has something for every type of player.

      "text": "This game has so many games within this one game it is almost a steal that you get it for one price. From the mini adventures to the online gaming, this game is simply put a work of art. The characters are all great in their own respective way and working with them all is enjoyable and not at all off putting as I had feared when first hearing of three characters. The story line flows and one of the few games where you can enjoy it over and over again. Astonishing and beautiful.",

      "text": "Great continuation of GTA. Improved all areas of the game but still recognisable as GTA and same feel as the others. Only things people may not like (personal preference really though) having to switch between characters for the first time rather than following the journey of just one guy. However i think the story is interlinked enough to keep this a good new feature so the characters don't seem like its 3 different games in one. The only thing i don't always like are the (in my opinion) sometimes overly long cinematic footage bits before missions begin, they sometimes seem to go on a bit too long when you just want the mission to start",

Spectacular graphics for a current gen console game, intuitive controls, moderately faithful recreation of Los Santos as many will remember from San Andreas and immersive gameplay. Whilst I feel the amount of swearing in the game is slightly gratuitous, it does not severely hinder the game's story in any way. Very much recommended for any fans of the Gran Theft Auto series, or anyone looking for an almost sandbox-like game that encompasses many different genres in one!",

It's very humoristic and the storyline is also one of the best storytelling in the range of games that i've played. so i definitely recommend this game to every gamer, from strategy game players to FPS players.",

    "description": "Platform:PlayStation 3| Edition:Standard Edition\n\nGRAND THEFT AUTO V\nLos Santos: a sprawling sun-soaked metropolis full of self-help gurus, starlets, and fading celebrities, once the envy of the Western world, now struggling to stay afloat in an era of economic uncertainty and cheap reality TV. Amidst the turmoil, three very different criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a former street gangster, now looking for real opportunities and serious money; Michael, a professional ex-con whose retirement is a lot less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent maniac driven by the next big score. Running out of options, the crew risks everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life.\n\nThe biggest, most dynamic and most diverse open world ever created, Grand Theft Auto V blends storytelling and gameplay in new ways as players repeatedly jump in and out of the lives of the game's three lead characters, playing all sides of the game's interwoven story.\n\nAll the classic hallmarks of the groundbreaking series return, including incredible attention to detail and Grand Theft Auto's darkly humorous take on modern culture, alongside a brand new and ambitious approach to open world multiplayer.\n\nDeveloped by series creators Rockstar North, Grand Theft Auto V will be available worldwide for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 on September 17.\n\n\n\nBlaine County\n\n\nOur largest open world yet - by far - and spanning vastly diverse cultural and geographical areas, the entire world of Grand Theft Auto V is open from the very beginning of the game to explore. Visitors to the greater metropolis of Los Santos and the countryside of Blaine County will encounter faded celebrities, meth heads, party people, violent gangs, hikers, bikers and every other manner of colorful denizen. You'll be able to traverse everywhere from the tops of the mountains, through the streets of Los Santos and to the depths of the ocean floor.\n\nMichael, Franklin and Trevor\n\n\nThree playable protagonists - Michael, Franklin and Trevor may live in different parts of town, have their own issues, attitudes, lifestyles, desires and goals - but they do know how to work together. They also each have their own unique skillsets to bring to the table when it's time to get the job done.\n\nHeists\n\nPetty crimes, hustling and stealing cars can only get you so far in Los Santos. To score big, Michael, Franklin and Trevor will work together to pull off grand Heists - big, multi-part missions that require careful preparation, recruiting, and precise (and often explosive) execution. Cash is king in GTAV and while there will be plenty of ways to acquire and spend it - heists are the way to earn the big bucks.\n\n\"Recreational Activity\"\n\nThe open world of Grand Theft Auto V is not just massive in scale, but will offer more to get into than ever before. For recreation, play a bit of golf or tennis, zen out with some yoga or cycle through the countryside... For adrenaline heads, parachute over the city, or customize your Cheetah and take it to the streets to race suckers for money... Or earn cash the old fashioned way, by taking it - whether by ripping off liquor stores or by buying and taking over businesses that will earn you dividends... Even minding your own business having a stroll you may meet one of Los Santos' weirdos, junkies, drunkies, or starlets and find yourself off on a wild misadventure you never expected...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto V is the largest and most ambitious game Rockstar Games has yet created, and takes full advantage of every ounce of processing power available in the current generation of consoles. In order to provide the best possible experience for such a massive and detailed world, the game will have installation requirements on the PlayStation 3.\n\nGrand Theft Auto V ships on one disc and will install content as soon as you insert the game. The install is roughly 8GB, and players will be able to play as soon as the install is complete.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOX CONTAINS\n1 x game disc",
