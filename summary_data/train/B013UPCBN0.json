I will split up Pros and Cons than writing a review, since ultimately that would be more you are looking for Pros: 1) Sturdy Product 2) Easy Menu's especially for Kids 3) Intuitive sound for keeping kids engaged Cons: 1) Below Standard Images 2) Kids tend to move the camera while taking pics. This is not handled. 3) Though Sturdy, we lost one grip once my three year old dropped it down 4) Preview LCD has little protection. Verdict: If you need to wait, I will recommend that to get a Shock Proof and Waterproof camera.",

The only down side is the wrist band to carry it while not using it. A shoulder strap or belt type strap would be way more logical for a child. Otherwise its awesome. Also love the fact that you can disable the games. Games on a camera doesnt even make sense.",

Within 20 minutes the screen froze and the buttons wouldn't allow us to move around under the menu. Followed the troubleshooting directions to remove the batteriesand wait. Was able to reset it. It continued to happen every time she played with it. After day 3, it wouldn't reset at all. I returned it.",

The quality of the printed photos was surprisingly good. I strongly recommend buying the slightly more expensive model with a larger internal memory, like I did. A good decision because he would have filled up the smaller memory quickly. The fact that it has an optional SD card is great.",

Am impressed how quickly he was exploring the various functions and explaining things to me even though he hasn't read the very good instruction manual that comes with the camera. He has even allowed his 2-year old brother to mess with it and record videos. He does things with the camera on his own and proudly shows his Mama and me what he's done. We are all really happy with this purchase!! He still wants to borrow our telephone cameras but much less these days.",

The one real negative is that it has so many filters and trick for the kids to play with, and even games (ugh). Kids like the filters but it takes away from what the cameras are meant for, taking pictures. You can disable the games but they are still there and I imagine one day the kids will figure out how get to the games but hopefully by then they will be ready for a real camera.",

This has come with us to balloon launches, parades, to the beach.

Was the biggest screen we could find on a toddler camera which is why we bought it. Our toddler still prefers using her older brother\u2019s regular point and shoot though because the quality of the pictures and the screen are better on that than on this camera. Overall good but doing it again we should have just gotten our child a regular point and shoot.",

It has taken a few drops fairly well and it's burst mode seems to grab the good pictures, while she is doing her best to wiggle them into a blur!",

I also got her a camera case from Best Buy where she stores it. I personally find the quality of the pictures not up to my standard. It takes better pictures in natural light than with flash. That being said I personally own a Pentax SLR camera and so my standard is pretty high. But, it's my daughter's camera and she sure has fun with it.",
