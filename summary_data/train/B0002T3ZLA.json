The 1.5 mm stubby Italic is too fat for general writing (I should have believed all the other reviews) but I had a different brand of 1.1 mm stub and the line variation was hardly visible. But for signs, certificates (filling in names) this Lamy 1.5 is great. The pen itself is very handsome with its red highlights. The long tapered, artist style body will not fit in a pocket, but you can can clip it TO a pocket so that the body hangs out in space.",

The 1.5mm nib can fit inside the wide ruled paper but it just ends up being way bigger than my normal handwriting. Still its a lot of fun to write with, had no problems with the feed or anything(Make sure to flush before first use!), and writes pretty distinctly with awesome line variation. I was on the edge between 1.1 and 1.5 mm nib and went 1.5 because I like big variation but its really just too big for note taking.",
