Then i have discovered a major design flaw on both products: The charging connection is becoming loose to the point that we have to move it slightly for the unit to start charging and a simple movement of the speaker and it stops charging. In fact, we just lost complete charging capability now/ I'll see with JBL what they can do since it should be under warranty. Hopefully, they have a good customer service. For that simple reason, i can't recommend the product.",

The lights add an awesome ambiance and the sound is just incredible. This speaker can play pretty loud, even when outside, and the sound is incredibly dynamic. When my hubby and I decided to get a bluetooth speaker, this was a no-brainer. We looked briefly at other options, but nothing else compared. I'd just warn that there isn't really a great spot to hold onto the speaker without touching the perforations and potentially pushing dirt into them, so make sure your hands are clean and dry to keep it looking nice.",

It only turns on if plugged into its charger, and even then, it doesn't respond to \"on\" button, or volume buttons. It cannot pair with my phone and is just completely unresponsive with and without the charger. I will say though that I loved this speaker very much and used it almost everyday. It has great volume and sounds great.",
