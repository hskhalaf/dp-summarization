If your bike is any larger, or has apes, this cover might not work for you. A lot of people were saying that this cover is not waterproof... IT IS WATERPROOF. I covered my bike and it rained for 3 days afterwards. I did have a few drops of water on my bike, but it was from CONDENSATION under the cover. The cover itself did NOT leak. Thick, heavy material. I feel this cover will last a while! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",

This cover is supposed to be water proof and clearly is not. If you just want a nice looking cover to throw over it in a garage then sure.

I am so impressed that I just ordered a second cover for inside my storage unit. The first cover will be used outside at my Condo.The only thing that could be better would be if the colors were reversed. Orange top/black bottom. Otherwise perfect, especially for the price.",
