I'm slighly ahead of everyone becaue it processes the image quicker and there's no perceivable input lag which means when I move the mouse, or thumbstick when playing on the PS4, the movement happens immediately on screen; I feel more immersed because everything is so clear! If your into your gaming and your still playing on a T.V, your missing out.",

The only reason it isn't getting 5 stars is because the red accents on the monitor should have been LED instead of coloured plastic to give it a slightly more expensive feel. Freesync is also a plus feature which makes a huge difference when gaming at 144hz. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a mid to high end gaming monitor.",

Once set to 144hz and the colours are sorted, it's really easy on the eyes. I'd recommend using the monitor itself to configure the settings, as their \"Display Pilot\" is rather slow and frustrating.

The time it takes for the image to be sent from the graphics card to actually being displayed is one of the lowest available on the consumer market in this price bracket. Funny that alot of manufacturers (including BenQ) don't include this specification on their products and consumers have had to invent devices purely to test this.

Xbox One games have never looked so crisp, the little remote is awesome to navigate trough the menus as well, Honestly speaking if you have the money just buy it, it's crazy good!

The picture quality is great, colour reproduction needs tweaking but after this it gives pro photo monitors a run for their money. As for gaming, after you experience 144hz with blur reduction you don't want to go back to 60hz counter-strike.",
