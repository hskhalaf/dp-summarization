I also suffer with auto immune symptoms and every one of my doctors has recommended a product like this. After using it as instructed.

Although this IR Sauna is more expensive, you will be pleased of the quality and results you will get plus ultra low levels of harmful EMF. The company also has great costumer service. I will say that this is the best portable Infrared Sauna in the market. I am very satisfied with the product and company that sells it.",
