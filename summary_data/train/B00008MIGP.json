You might be asked to guess what player A has written in answer to \"What is the job you'd like least?\" or you might have to figure out that player B has sculpted a hotdog out of playdough. This is fun for all ages, as long as the players can read the cards.",

Although the game is rated for kids 8 and up, younger kids even some 5 year olds, would enjoy it with just a little help with reading. Passing around the guess box with the music going is great fun- kind of like playing hot potato. Like some of the other great games by CRANIUM the clay adds a fun dimension and encourages creativity. This game would be good for HOURS of fun for the whole family!! Take it from a mother of 4. This game is great and a different change of pace from the others out there.",

At first the directions seemed a little too much, but once we started playing, everyone caught on real quick!! Some of the questions were hard to think up of answers, some were easy, but it was all very fun!! We all cannot wait to play again!! This is a great game, not only for the kids, but even for adults only!!",

It's especially good for multiage groups and family gatherings--one of the few games where being older and sharper doesn't confer much advantage. Even kids who don't really read and write yet can play with adult help and have fun. Another plus: We ran into a bit of a problem with a defective part and Cranium's customer service was absolutely first-rate in resolving it. Anyone who buys anything these days knows how rare that is!",
