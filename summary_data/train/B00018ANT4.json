This hammer puts more force over a smaller area and fits into tighter spots. I like the dual head with black for I don't care what this thing looks like and white for I care what this looks like. It has a real nice balanced feel. I mean bottom line it is a rubber mallet so you can only get so excited about it.",

Extremely disappointed. The look and weight if the mallet is great, but durability just isn't there. I wish I had done a project that fell in the month return time period so I could have identified this flaw. Ultimately I am out my money.",

I cannot attest to the durability but by inspection it appears that it will last a very long time. The center head is cast steel or iron giving it a substantial weight. The two rubber heads appear to be slipped over the metal, not screwed on, so should be very secure. The rubber heads are also have good sized faces for serious work. AND IT IS MADE IN THE USA which is a big plus for me.",
