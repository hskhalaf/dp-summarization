This is the third time I have experienced it and I always think it won't be as amazing as I remember.... but it was even more so. I bought a cheap used mapex. Kick sounded drab. Again, cheap kit...... after playing with tuning the remo head it had on it i finally ordered one of these.... absolutely amazing. I barely had to tune it at all. Thumps. This is the one most important thing you can do. I think with ducktape and a superkick 2 I can make any drumset sound amazing.",

I found the head to make my drum impossible to tune (there is no resonance so there is no resonant tone) and super quiet. It just sounds super, super dead and thuddy. I ended up putting my old batter head back on (but keeping the Aquarian resonant head). Used minimal muting and tuned it with a Tune Bot so the intervals are spot on, and it sounds 100x better.",

At a recent gig, my bass drum mic had to be turned off because of too much vibration form a shaky stage. I didn't want to lose the sound of a thumping bass drum, so I was stomping extra hard on the pedal. My current head is kind of old now, so I thought I'd go right thru it, but there were no problems whatsoever (and it sounded awesome!). The ring reduction strip around it works wonders. Only bass head I will ever use.",

Never again; as long as Aquarian continues to make this model, I will go out of my way to order it. I can't promise it's got the sound you're looking for but it's perfect for me: a deep resonance that sounds equally at home in a Beatles song or a badass hip-hop beat. Can't recommend it enough.",

Looks great, although only you as the drummer are going to see it. The floating muffling ring is incredible, no need for a pillow in the kick anymore. This head is thick enough that if you put on a kick pad as well, I can't imagine needing to replace it for a very long time.",

I recieved the head, installed it and enjoyed two practices with it before the inner muffling ring fell off completely and the kick sounds horrible. I think next time I'm going to stick with the original SKI22.",
