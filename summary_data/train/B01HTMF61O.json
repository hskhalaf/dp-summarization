      "verdict": "People who are in search of an exceedingly comfortable mountaineering boot, one that doesn\u2019t disappoint when it comes to climbing performance may look no further as Salewa\u2019s Rapace GTX more than fits the bill. It is also a footgear with surprising lightness and true-to-size fit. Sadly, some users smear the boot\u2019s rather flawless resume by decrying its letdown of a waterproofing feature. Overall, barring its disappointing water protection, the Rapace GTX has a lot going for it that puts it on quite a lofty pedestal.",
      "pros": [
        "Droves of users praised the Salewa Rapace GTX for its superior lightness",
        "This boot impressed dozens of mountaineers with its jaw-dropping comfort",
        "One of them linked this amazing level of comfort to the boot\u2019s ability to flex during transitions",
        "Quite a number of wearers raved about the Rapace GTX\u2019s true-to-size fit",
        "Some owners were delighted to find out about this boot\u2019s almost non-existent break-in period",
        "They used the boot straight out of the box and, after covering a few miles, came back blister free",
        "The Salewa Rapace GTX\u2019s climbing performance is simply extraordinary, based on a few user reviews",
        "The overall sturdiness of this boot impressed a few owners",
        "Evident to this quality durability is the footwear\u2019s layered upper, complete with a full-on rubber rand",
        "A small percentage of users applauded this boot\u2019s crampon connection for working surprisingly well with their aftermarket crampons",
        "A couple of customers felt compelled to give the Rapace GTX great remarks for its excellent ankle support"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "According to a very few, this boot\u2019s waterproofing feature is criminally underwhelming",
        "One of them said his feet got wet for merely walking through some wet bushes",
        "A hiking blogger felt betrayed after discovering the shoe\u2019s outsole has worn out too quickly"

I've yet to test this out by spending all day out in the wet but they handled walking through a stream without any soggy socks. All in all a quality boot at an OK-ish price. I hope they last as long as my last pair of boots (Salomon) which have just started to let in water after 10 years!",
