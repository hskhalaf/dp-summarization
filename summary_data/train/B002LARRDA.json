Seamless, comprehensive access to unlimited Internet streaming sources PLUS total access to music stored on my computer via the Logitech music server that comes free with this device. Easy access and a high-quality DAC (digital-audio converter) make this a top-of-the-line product. But wait, there's more: If you have an android phone or tablet, download Squeeze Commander for $4.99 and get total remote access to the Squeezebox (including volume control) from your phone!

The product support people at Logitech are excellent and the online documentation and community forums are helpful if you find yourself coming up against sticking points.

It streams the flac files perfectly from the wireless router, which is halfway across the house, and sounds great running through a good receiver and good set of speakers. The controller app works very well on my android tablet and on my android phone. After reading a lot of reviews I chose squeezebox over sonos and am very happy. I am about to buy a second touch and eventually will have four throughout my house.",

I gave up on being able to play my own collection of music with Squeezebox Server. Connecting to the server to play my own music would generally trash my ability to play anything off the internet (Rhapsody, Pandora, or internet radio stations) until I reset the box.",

      "text": "There are a lot of raves about this, but the interface is actually quite clunky. You have to click through far too many menus to get where you want to go. The different apps are not well integrated together. In retrospect, I wish I had bought the Sonos system which has a far nicer user interface--much more Apple-like. The Sonos system is also expandable, which this is not. One other thing: the remote has these buttons, 1 through 10, that should let you push one and go to your favorite channel. But they don't work. In fact, they are useless. I don't understand how Logictech let such a glaring bug make it through the production process.",
