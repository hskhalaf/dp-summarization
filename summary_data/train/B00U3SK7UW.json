I usually switch between the Lamb and the Duck (they tend to get bored after a few weeks of the same flavor). They did not like the salmon at all (which was ok with me because of the smell) and I haven't tried the Chicken or Turkey flavors because of the allergy issues. I have found that over the past year that not only do my dogs really like this food (eating the whole bowl) but the allergy issues have reduced and their coat stays shiny and soft. It's not cheap, but it's worth it.",

Did not and a new issue popped up. Switched back to grain free and 2 vet visits and antibiotics and she was back to normal. Waste of 2 bags as I could not feed to them any longer.",
