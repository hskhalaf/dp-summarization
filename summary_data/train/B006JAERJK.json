The manufacturer of the kit need to make the results more bold. I \"may\" send in the sample swab if the mold gets worse. I wish the test had been more definite like a pregnancy test does. Since the test didn't show up clearly as it being the bad kind of mold, I will assume it's not.",

    "description": "The best value in DIY mold testing and most sensitive. The ONLY test that also detects allergy-causing mold particulates. Why wait days or even weeks for a lab report that doesn't detect mold allergens. Get the facts before spending your hard-earned money on obsolete and antiquated \"tape lift\", \"Petri dishes\" or \"air sampling\" test kits. These old methods require the consumer to send a sample in. That's why the 5-Minute Mold Test is the one product that mail-back sampling kit vendors don't want you to know about. Uses EPA-recommended dust samples. No need to see the mold. If it's growing behind a wall, it's in your air and it's detectable in the dust. Tape lifts CAN'T see what's behind the wall, and should never be recommended for examining dust. Do your own testing quickly, easily and discreetly. The 5-Minute Mold Test detects the most worrisome mold spores AND mold particulates as determined by the US EPA. Uniquely, the 5-Minute Mold Test Kit includes specific antibody-based tests against more than 32 different Asp/Pen and mold types that cause discomforted and illness. Worried about you air quality? Test the settled dust in the room of concern or suspect areas of possible contamination. Uses the same proven lateral flow assay technology employed in medical labs. Validated in an EPA-licensed and AIHA-accredited al lab as the most sensitive and accurate rapid tests available and up to 100 times more sensitive than other tests. Provided are all the materials necessary for testing including 1 Asp/Pen and 1 rapid test, 1 All-in-One Collection Swab and instructions-for-use. Sample multiple areas together and test with one kit to survey whether you have a problem or order separate kits to test each area individually. A postage-paid mailer and sterile swabs for optional lab confirmation are included. An instructional video is available at My Healthful Home. Questions? Call toll-free number provided in the kit. Proudly Made in the USA.",
