When I noticed a little wiggle in the head I tightened the thread with moderate pressure and it snapped right off. Luckily I caught my camera mid air all ninja style.

Don't really care for the wrist strap at the top but it fits my video camera and is easy enough to collapse and pack up in seconds. Grip should hold up for quite a while and is comfortable. The only thing I think that I might add is an adjustable elbow at the top so I can shoot different angles while holding it like a selfie stick or just needing a bit more reach. I shoot football games and band performances as a hobby and this fits the bill. Would recommend and purchase again.",

It's well-built, solid and can be extended to any height within its range easily. The bottom can either be a rubber, non-slip foot or (with just a few turns) it can be turned into a metal spike for use on dirt, grass or sand. Seriously, unless you're a professional who needs some super high-end features, spend the 20 bucks and get this one.",

Seems almost like it is designed to breakaway but I can\u2019t fathom a reason to do that. I only use it with GoPros and small 360\u00b0 cameras. Now that I\u2019m aware of the construction I would never attach a full DSLR to it. At 2 for $22 I\u2019ll probably buy another set. Right now I\u2019m happy with my work around. Only took a mild snag on a tree branch to shear off the mount.",
