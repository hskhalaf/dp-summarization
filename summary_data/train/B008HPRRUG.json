Several years ago I was diagnosed with Stage IV breast cancer, and I take an amazing amount of medication daily. I was instructed to also always stay hydrated. The oncology nurses told me not to just drink water, but to find a beverage with flavor and vitamins and minerals, something I would like and keep using. After several different waters, I settled on these and have been drinking them for years. I hate to think what might happen if SOBE quit manufacturing them.",

      "text": "The change to SobeWater appears to be more than a cosmetic name change. This new beverage no longer contains erythritol which is a natural but expensive sweetener and now has that slight bitter after taste that you get from stevia. I loved Lifewater, SobeWater is second rate to their own discontinued product. I haven't heard of an explanation for the name change. Perhaps changing the name means not having to explain the removal of erythritol which is much more expensive than Stevia. I do see a bottled water in the store now called \"Life WTR\", which is probably cause of the name change. I'd love to hear SoBe's explanation of the name change as well as dropping erythritol.",
