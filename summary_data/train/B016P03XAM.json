I replaced the original cheapo speakers in my '14 F150 SuperCrew with these and I will say the sound quality went from a 5/10 to a 7/10. After 14 months (out of warranty) my drivers side front speaker was cutting in and out. But now at 19 months old, the passenger side is cutting in and out. These are not quality speakers. They have not been abused or hooked up incorrectly. Out of warranty, the company is unwilling to replace. I will now throw these away and try another brand.",

I was looking for a low budget door speaker setup for my f150 (yes I'm that cheap to install this vs what I could get at cost) Was kinda hoping I'd be disappointed so I'd go with better speakers. I was quite surprised with the audio quality off of Kenwood head unit power. Surprising range and clear highs. Can't wait to throw a small 4 channel at them and hear them really warm up for low budget speakers!",

So far I just put 2 in the front door, not sure if I'm going to put the other 2 in the back or just keep them as spares. They don't get very loud and the bass gets distorted pretty easily but I just have a factory head unit so these speakers probably aren't living up to their potential. They are definitely a step up from stock though",

      "text": "Replaced the factory speakers in my 2010 Ford Ranger. They fit perfectly. The bass quality is good (not subwoofer powerful but have a solid thump) and the mids and highs are nice and distinctive. If you want to improve your sound system, these are an inexpensive way to do that. I have an aftermarket double din stereo that power these.",

      "text": "Replaced stock Ford 4 ohm 25W speakers in my '07 Taurus with these. Paired them up with the Pumpkin single DIN Android radio. They sound awesome. Clear and crisp across the spectrum. You get to hear all the different aspects of your music due to the 4-way design. For sure worth the money and made my 1.5 hour commute much more tolerable.",
