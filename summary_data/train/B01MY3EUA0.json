      "text": "I really could not be more pleased with this bag. It is well made, cute, sturdy, and has plenty of room for my Canon 70d with a 17-50mm lens attached. I purchased it for a vacation abroad and it will be perfect to hold my camera, and everything else I will need during long days of walking around. Also, it is a more discreet camera bag than some, and doesn't scream, \"Im carrying a nice camera!\". It also came very nicely packaged in a nice cotton bag that was then double bagged in plastic. It showed the company really cares about the product. Love it!",

It's small, waterproof (haven't fully tested it yet and I hope I never need to), with nice cushion and made from nice materials. I am able to bring along my Sony a7 with the standard 28 -70mm lens and a 50 -210 mm telephoto lens as well as plenty of small accessories like battery, cable, lens caps etc. It's not massive and bulky, it fits just what I need for around town shooting for the day. I can also put it into my larger bag and it doesn't take up too much space. I will be purchasing another larger bag from them for ALL of the gear I need.",

Very spacious- can hold my Sony A6000 with the 16-50 mm lens and strap attached, a separate 55-210 mm lens, 3 batteries, a battery charger, cloths, cell phone- and has plenty more room for other accessories. The large bag comes with a smaller bag inside that can be removed to put into a separate bag. (I put this smaller compartment into my hiking backpack). This smaller bag has little pieces that make up separate compartments inside the bag, adjustable by velcro. Last pic attached is the size of the LARGE bag next to an iPhone 7.",

For those who want to store more or larger camera, you may want to consider a large bag. It gave 5 stars because it meets my needs.",

Of all the other bags I looked at, this seemed like a wise choice and it was, because it's actually leather with waterproof material inside, strong Velcro liners. Plenty of pockets. Looks rad. Very happy with it, since buying in September 2017. Personal use: I have a Sony A6300 mirror-less camera with a Canon digital zoom lens and adapter plus all the other things one needs for adequate shooting. There is a space for everything with this cool and stylish bag. Watch the review for more insight into this most wonderful camera bag!",

Just slightly over a month since purchasing the bag the lining is falling apart. I first noticed the zipper was fraying the binding. I have an actual hole the seam in the interior bag!

I used both dividers together to keep it more open. But I\u2019m overall very pleased with the bag. It has a lot of storage & works well as an every day bag incognito.

It's very comfortable, my phone and extra batteries/SD cards fit in the front.

Canon 70d with a 18-135mm lens on it. It fits extremely well with a little room on top.(I\u2019ll be putting my passport, Id and money for my day trip there) Plenty of room in front pocket for an extra battery, And SD card. It has pieces to separate inside but my camera fits perfectly inside it without them. Excited to take it to Europe!",

I was able to put the camera inside quickly and take it out quickly. The bonus was that the extra zippered pocket was just big enough to store a second lens. Nice camera bag.",

It holds my Nikon D3400 very well with either my 18-55mm or 55mm-200mm lens, but not both. The pocket in front of the main storage allows for an extra battery and smaller accessories. Overall, I am pleased with this purchase. I will probably get the bigger version down the road, just so I can carry more than one lens with me.",
