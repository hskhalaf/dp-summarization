Looking through them in low light made me chuckle and shake my head that we spend so much money on high dollar equipment that can\u2019t beat something like this. I\u2019ve replaced this spring all of my VX-2\u2019s, FXII\u2019s, and VX3\u2019s with Freedoms and VX3i\u2019s...Its that much of a difference. I would equate the freedom line in low light about on par with the VX3i\u2019s. I also use these freedoms on 444\u2019s so they have taken a pounding. I hunt almost year around, I do not maintain my equipment, and I\u2019m hard on the rifles.",

Adjustment dials are mushy but this has been mounted and sighted in 3\" high at 100 yds where it will stay so I cannot comment on how well it tracks but the mushy turrets don't bother me. Magnification dial is smooth and the scope overall seems well worth the $169 plus tax that I paid but time will tell.",
