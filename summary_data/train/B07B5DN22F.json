      "text": "Overall I am very pleased with the product. It provides performance in line with or superior to competing products. I must take issue, however, with the claim that it can be used with conventional prescription eyeglasses. As I almost exclusively wear contact lenses, this is a minor issue for me. When I am forced to wear conventional glasses, however, it is simply not practical to use the Vive headset. For people who wear glasses rather than contacts for day-to-day use, I would say that renders this product all but worthless. I am not aware of any competing product that addresses this problem better, but it is nonetheless a fact. Glasses wearers beware!",

      "text": "It was well packaged and nothing seemed damaged, also everything worked correctly. But, I found out that there was a dead Pixel in the HTC Vive's right screen, but at least it is almost on the border of the screen so it's not noticeable in-game unless I look for it, and this is not damage from the packaging but from factory. I could claim my guarantee but to be honest I don't want to go through the hassle of dismounting everything/sending it to repair. So a great way of getting one as easily and quickly as possible.",

The only reason they did not get 5 starts is viveport (their online brand specific game store) would not send any account confirmation to my email. So I made a secondary email, everything went through. All good I thought, then once I clock on the link to sign into viveport, it takes me to a blank webpage saying \u201cerror, Grant not approved\u201d and no matter what I did, even through live support. Nothing changed that. So I will use steam as my main supplier for games which isn\u2019t the biggest problem. But for $600, I\u2019d expect their proprietary library system to work.",
