Trimming the edges means it doesnt fit correct in the 3 compartment zippered cover AND also cancels any returns if something happens. So trim at your own risk. Picture is misleading. Buyer beware.",

I do the same with hotel mattresses, but always checking this doesn't make it too high for your baby so that they can climb out!!

      "text": "Padding is nice and fluffy way better than the pack n play mat. Didn't notice any smell when opening. Left the pad out for several days and it fluffed back up after shipping. However it doesn't fit our graco pack n play length wise. Its too big by about 2-3 inches which seems to be A LOT. Just have it bent up on one end. Hopefully it won't be an issue with our 1 yr old or attract her attention to pull at. Or else will cut like others have done. Great material for the cover and pad, would be 5 stars if it actually fit well.",

I didn't notice the scent to be particularly strong when I opened it. The cover has individual zips for each foam cell, which is nice. Will take it on an upcoming trip, so hopefully it will be really handy for that.",
