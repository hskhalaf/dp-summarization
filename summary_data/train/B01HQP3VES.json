      "text": "I took a trip to Europe while pregnant and wore these almost exclusively. They're so comfortable, even with walking 10+ miles some days. My feet can be a little picky with shoes and these never gave me any issues. The only thing I didn't like was that they only come in whole sizes. I'm an 8.5 and bought both the 8 and 9, and kept the 9 even though it's just a tad bigger than I'd like because the 8 was too small. If you're between sizes, I'd definitely go up!",

I am taking them on vacation and have been wearing them for increasingly longer periods to make sure they remain comfortable. I recently wore them to a food festival that was on uneven ground with grass and pavement. My feet were fine for the duration, in addition to the entire hour I stood in line on asphalt to get into the event.",

I\u2019ve had these for a few days now. They took only one day to break in and fit perfectly. The toe strap was a little snug right out of the box, but after breaking them in, the leather softened and I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t go bigger. I\u2019m going to end up wearing these every day this summer.",

I have high arches and these don't touch my arches at all, but I expect that as I usually put a high arch insert in my closed toe shoes. Nothing rubs too much anywhere, I can walk around the city no problem. I bought a surprise pair for my friend since she loved mine.",
