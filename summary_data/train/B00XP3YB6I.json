He wanted something that wasn't too bulky, could fit under his wrestling shoe and could give him the range of motion he needed to perform. We looked at major drug stores, pharmacy in the hospital and couldn't find anything quite like this ankle brace. They all were either too bulky or didn't allow him range of motion. This is exactly what he needed and it has held up very well. He's been using it for about 4 months and it is still in perfect condition.",

The only problem I really have with it is that it bunches a little around my ankle which can be irritating.

The brace supports the ankle well, but the top cuff is ridiculously tiny - I have small ankles and *not* large-around legs, but I can barely close the top cuff at all. To have it fully closed as recommended with the logo front-and-center would (and did) cut off circulation. It doesn't fit terribly well, but that may be because of the afore-mentioned smaller ankles. I am using size medium and do not believe a small would have been big enough otherwise. Still, the ankle is mending, and the brace helps support the tissue during the process.",

If you have temperamental ankles and sometimes need added support I recommend this brace! Make sure you measure your ANKLE to get the right fit.

I came back and bought this one, which I should have done from the beginning. The how to measure sizing chart makes selecting the right size easy. I was tempted to buy a size bigger because I have really big ankles, but I went with their recommendations and it fits perfectly. It's supportive enough without having to tighten to the point of causing skin damage. My pain from a week ankle sprain had been reduced dramatically. I'm off my cane thanks to this bad boy.",
