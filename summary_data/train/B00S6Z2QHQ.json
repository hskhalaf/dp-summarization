Very disappointed, After normal use the mechanism to engage the blades does not work making the lawn mower useless. Contacted Amazon, who referred me to the seller CPO, who told me it is not their problem and I should seek my own recourse with the manufacturer Honda. $900 piece of junk. Do not buy this product",

This is not mulching.....

I have a half-acre lawn, and upon start-up, the self-propelled feature is superb. I have to run to keep up with the mower. After a couple passes, however, the mower gradually and steadily slows down, and within 15 minutes it is essentially a push mower--a VERY HEAVY pushmower. I've taken it to the Honda certified dealer twice in two years, and they don't see anything wrong with it. A great mower is rendered almost inoperable by this glaring deficit. Never again will I buy a Honda mower.",
