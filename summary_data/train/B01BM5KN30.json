Emailed and there was NO response. I purchased other yardage devices (not rangefinders) from Golf Buddy and they are excellent on supporting their products, even AFTER the warranty.

My one \"con\" is that I wish the battery door were attached with a small tether - always afraid I'm going to drop it and lose it, otherwise, this range finder works great, is a reasonable size and is easy to carry on your belt.",
