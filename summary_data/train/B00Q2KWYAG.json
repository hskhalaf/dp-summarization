I've got plenty of support for side-to-side movement, and the under-ball of foot padding is wonderful. Fit is amazing. I like a big toe box and these fit the bill. I'm going to order these again.

The wide shoe size does not actually feel wide at all and I am happy with the fit. 6 2E fit too small and I had no room for my toes to wiggle, but the width is not noticeable to be wide. I would have rated 5/5 stars if I could have tried out 6.5 B(M) / 2E to see how they compared to 7 2E.",
