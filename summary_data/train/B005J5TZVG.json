They are not visible in all shots but yeah they are there. Really thought that \"very good condition\" should have a clear lens. So what to do....",

Its overall image quality is acceptable to good and I do like that it is very compact. This is important when traveling by air and sight seeing in museums and cultural centers. One does not want to be over bearing with a large camera and huge lenses in these environments. Les lens on a 4 thirds compact camera is only lightily larger than typical tourist point and shoot cameras. This is great!",

The zoom button is solid and works great for a smooth transition! The manual focus is a bit weird, since you focus by pressing up/down rather than having a focus ring.",

This little gem is very sharp, can focus faster than any lens I own (P20, PL25, P45-200), and the power zoom is really nice. This is now my favorite walk-around lens.",
