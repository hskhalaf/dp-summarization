In stiff shoes that don't come in wide sizes, I usually size up to a 9, so I went with the 9 here (since the wides were out of stock), and couldn't even leave it on my foot for ten minutes without the squeeze becoming painful. Plenty of room around my toes, but not the wide part of my foot at all. These seem well made and sturdy, but definitely don't try to squeeze into a standard size if you tend to wear wide sizes (even if you size up!)",
