This guy died 5 feet from my back door and within 5 days the house was infested with fleas. After trying two other products over a month, this stuff really did the job after its first application. The others did nothing and were like treating fleas with peanut butter. Now the Precor 2000, it worked within 7 days of application and after following the directions carefully and repeating as required, our problem was solved. Thank You Precor 2000, your product really, really works. And per the directions, you don't need a lot to do the job!",

We have gone through expensive pills, yard treatments, dips, baths, natural products, special lights, you name it. Nothing worked. Until I bought this. One can goes quite a long way and has seemed to last for some time. Our once out of control flea infestation is now under control and they are gone. I will purchase this product again and again!",
