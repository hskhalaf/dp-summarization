I realize I can just leave those out or try to substitute, but honestly the majority of the recipes would then be pointless without them. I might pick it up for something here and there but it will probably collect dust on my cookbook shelve. I would've returned it but it's too late now.",

Just do what works for you as an individual, while noting that no two people are alike when it comes to the results from both exercise and eating clean.

The Clean Eating Cookbook offers simple and easy to understand instruction on how to incorporate clean eating principles into your daily routine. With precise information and clear language the authors specify which foods impart important nutrients and how clean eating preparation techniques maximize the health benefits. Then they go beyond that and include a fourteen day eating guide which illustrates how to implement clean eating. And finally and perhaps most importantly the book ends with over a hundred tasty recipes thus arming the reader to shop, cook and eat cleanly.",

I did the Buzzfeed Clean Eating Challenge and was a million times more impressed with the food usage, planning and delightful recipes than with this book. (I bought this in an effort to continue that challenge). I say google clean eating and find a plan - you will be happier that way.",

There was a little of that, but I was pleasantly surprised to also find recipes that were simplistic and appealing to families - like Honey Breakfast Cookies, Orange Cream Ice Pops, and Clean Tuna Noodle Casserole. My biggest gripe? NO pictures. A cookbook with no photos is like a Playboy with only articles. Sure, the articles are great, but... If you want to be enticed into a new eating lifestyle, this publishing house book probably will not motivate you for that. But if you have begun a clean eating regime and want some new recipes to try, this will deliver.",
