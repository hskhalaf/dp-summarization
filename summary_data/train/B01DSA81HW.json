The NaturVet vitamin did cease the habit - today (after about 5 days of using the new vitamin, my dog feasted on her feces today...). She hasn't eaten her feces in months while on the NaturVet, I shouldn't have deviated our product or routine. My fault. Nonetheless, the vitamin is not appealing.",

I don't think it's a bad product, but I think my dog can't process synthetic vitamins. I'll be supplementing with all natural products from now on. But if it works for you, it's a good product for the price. You won't find any other daily supplement with as much vitamins and a low dose. Some of the other brands will have you giving your dog more pills with less vitamins.",

One tiny complaint: The print on the label is so tiny that I couldn't read it and had to email the owners for info. Good news: The owners are accessible to help out their customers.",

Buddy & Lola vitamins really do seem to help my dogs with their skin, coats & energy. I originally got my dogs these vitamins because of the good reviews & because I've had to change my dog's diets. I wanted to ensure my dogs' nutrition was still excellent. The only drawback is that these vitamins are difficult to find.",

My other, large, dog will eat them just fine and actually seems to have more energy with them. I'm so tired of trying to find a tasty enough vitamin that my dog will eat!",
