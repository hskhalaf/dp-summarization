I bought this to be able to have a camp shower or a folding toilet in the woods for the women that often go camping with my group of friends. When I began exploring the many types of shelters, I could only envision small cramped locker sized spaces without enough freedom to move. This is fantastically roomy and provides an excellent home for your throne. Enjoy",

Was a good purchase . Oh folding it up.. lay flat, step on one end, bring the other over to your feet. Push down on the hump, it will make a circle so you can get it back in the bag..",

I would recommend building some kind of portable frame to fit inside if you want to use a solar shower that holds more than a gallon of water as there's no way to secure it above without it collapsing. Thus my 2-star Sturdiness & overall rating. If using in a windy area, you will need to use the tie-downs in addition to the corner stake points.

I put my bucket towards the back corner and it stayed almost completely dry. Only down I could find is there is no mesh for the window. Since I'm using it as a bathroom, it results in more bugs inside. Unzip the top and that does provide a good escape route though. Overall, very satisfied with my purchase.",

      "text": "We took this on our latest camping trip and it does what's advertised. To set it up is as easy as removing it from the carry bag, removing the cover straps and watch it pop open magically like Harry Potter cast a spell on it! Now, folding it up was a bit more challenging, but I think that it's with most of these pop up items. We had a great laugh seeing how each family member attempted to out do to last trying to get the shower back in its carry bag. Now...Overall I'm really happy with this this product.",
