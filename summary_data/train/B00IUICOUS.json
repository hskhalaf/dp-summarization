The product appears to function just fine, but it is clearly a factory second / blemished model. After reading several other reviews to confirm this, the white and blue model has a very easily seen red blemish on the head band. Mine is almost 1 inch long. I plan to keep the headphones because I did get a good price and like them, but I would like to have known I was buying a blemished model beforehand. I will mostly be using them at home.",

The sound quality didn't overwhelm me, but I sure like them. Another very positive note is that the cable is detachable. I bought an extra cable for home and only have to transport the headphones back and forth between work and home. It comes in a sharp carrying case for just this kind of usage.",

They were badly stained and covered in some sort of sticky crud, which I was able to clear away with sanitation wipes. The wire was slightly damaged that connected the headphones to my device, but overall it was functional and the sound quality was \"good enough.\" Now, 8 months later the headphones don't even work at all. Very disappointed. I don't think this is an issue with Bose and more likely an issue with whoever the heck previously owned these headphones that clearly must have dunked them in vats of coffee and custard pudding.",

They helped drown out the noise of airplane travel (despite not being noise canceling, I definitely noticed a great difference when they were on vs off my ears). They're comfortable, fitting around my hear and stay on my head. Plus they're WAY more comfortable than earbuds. My only complaint is that the cord requires some twisting occasionally in the airplane armrest in order to have sound come from both ears. Also, when using these on a phone call, it's odd to not hear my own voice playback into the headphones, causing me to almost shout.",

The middle button plays and pauses music on a Galaxy S5 though. Have not tested the mic function, (if it even exists). 4 out of 5 because it feels great, but is pricey, has no android/pc support with the buttons and could be just a tad more bass orientated.",

It's been like experiencing my music library for the first time. The biggest drawback for me is the cable itself. It's so long, thin, and delicate that it snags and tangles easily. I owned this pair of headphones for two weeks before the cable needed to be replaced. The headphones themselves are stellar, but the durability of the cable is awful. Luckily, I was able to order a new cable on Amazon with ease but I think it detracts from an otherwise exceptional pair of headphones.",

These, however, are fantastic. Great sound and very little pressure. I can wear these for hours with no problems at all. I don't think you'll find better headphones (combination of pressure and sound).",

And the cushions over the ears make them easy to keep on for long periods of time without hurting. I do wish I had spend the extra $$$s and bought the sound-cancelling ear phones, though. You can still hear outside noises, which don't necessarily interfere with the sound but are somewhat distracting.",

      "title": "Great!",
      "text": "Extremely Comfy and lightweight. I like these so much better than headphones like Beats because the sound is more even, and not so bass heavy that it gives me a headache. While they are not specifically made for reducing outside noise from your surroundings, the fact that they are around-ear style does make it block out some more sound than an on-ear headphone. So this blocks enough sound off for me without completely isolating myself from the outside world. This way I'd be able to hear enough in case there was some sort of emergency going on. Anyway, I love these.",

The cord is very long so you can keep it your phone/ipod in your pocket while you wear them and you dont have to worry about it not being long enough. They are not 100% soundproof but they keep out a lot of sound. This is one of the best purchases I have ever made.",
