The only flaw I have experience with this unit is that when using the remote, the unit has a disturbing propensity of switching input from whatever is chosen by the user to 'TV.' Apparently, the unit has hidden preferences (tongue-firmly=in-cheek.) I would greatly recommend this unit; it is great!! As an engineer, I would love to learn this trick of giving electronics a mind of it's own,;-)",

Set up was easy except for the CEC, which didn't work well with having an LG OLED TV, Panasonic BluRay, and an Arris1100 FIOS box. It kept switching the input back to TV or FIOS. So, after turning CEC off on and off on each device, it came down to the Arris box being the culprit. So, CEC is off on all the devices and it works flawlessly with my Harmony remote. The receiver operates great and even though I don't have height speakers, the ATMOS virtualizer works with my 5.1 set up. Nice upgrade",
