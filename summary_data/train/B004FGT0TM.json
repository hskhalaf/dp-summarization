It is expensive and a large purchase for my family and for it to be missing assembly instructions and the DVDs, it is unacceptable and disappointing. The machine itself is nice and I think that it will be of good quality but the order was incomplete and disappointing.",

The only drawback would be if someone wasn't able to get up and down from so close to the floor - but most Pilates fans have been doing these routines for some time before buying this for home so this won't be a factor.",

It's getting a lot of use, but I would suggest before purchasing make sure you enjoy Pilates. There is a learning curve in the beginning.",

Also, don't be intimidated by the fat assembly manual -- a lot of the steps were already completed when the reformer arrived.",

Considering the professional model is about four thousand dollars, this home reformer offers exactly the same movements for 1/2 the price. It is lower to the ground, and it's about an inch narrower. Delivery was interesting. Mine was a \"threshold\" service. You need to have help getting it to the room in your house you plan to keep it. Once set up it's easy to move about. I think that we were missing one nut and I had to go to the hardware store. But Great!",
