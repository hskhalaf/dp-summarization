      "text": "I'm a huge fan of Blundstone boots. I am very hard to fit (wide feet!) and Blundstones are a dream come true for me. These Bump-Toe's are my fifth pair, and I have to say that they don't fit like the first four. I attribute that to their work boot heritage; they are a heavier grade of leather, it seems, and aren't quite as supple and comfortable right out of the box. I have high hopes that they will break in to a long lasting and (more) comfortable boot. For buyers new to Blundstone - beware the sizing difference between US and AUS standards. These 7.5 boots equate to a US 8 1/2 wide. Check sizing carefully when you order.",

Could probably squeeze another month or two out of them easily, but why bother running the rubber completely bare. The leather itself is in great shape, the bump toe really keeps the leather by your toes from wearing out too fast if you spend alot of time kneeling or sitting down in tight spaces. Definitely lasted me longer than my Ariats or Redwings did.",

I expect them to last for a long time. Besides all of that, nothing beats the look of Bludnstones with white socks and shorts. So uncool, that it's totally cool.",

The ankle and front of instep took a few wearings to loosen up but the boots have been incredibly comfortable straight out of the box. I can't wait until mine are as scuffed and broken in as those of all the happy Blunnie reviewers on YouTube.",
