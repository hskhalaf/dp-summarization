They were missing the little chains that hold the lid on but I don\u2019t know if they were really supposed to have those or not? Had a little neighborhood shindig the other night and they were a hit!! I definitely recommend! Just an FYI personal opinion, I would cut down the wick a little first...just to slow down the burn...the flame is huge and they burn pretty fast :)",

The wicks are nice and long. Be sure to let your torch in the tiki liquid for at least 30 minutes or your wick will burn up top quickly. Also, be sure to either adjust the wick so only about 1/8 of it is showing. My deck looks so beautiful when these are lit up at night. I relax in my lounge chair and enjoy an hour or so of reading.

One was knocked over by a ball, but we just put it back upright, relit the wick, has another fire safety talk and it was of use again! With minimal to no spilling. I would recommend these torches.",

The flame is huge! And there\u2019s so much smoke. In my personal opinion, this is not meant for table top. I paired it with the citronella oil and I don\u2019t think that worked either cuz my family, dogs and I still go bitten.",

Such a nice ambience and they repel mosquitoes pretty well if you buy a good fuel to burn in them. The only downside is that we struggle with how to transport them to and from the camping trip without making somewhat of an oily mess.",
