      "text": "I used nikon D700 which is still an excellent camera. However, when i met with this Sony A9. I fell in love with all features. Pro: fast focus. Clear and superd viewfinder. Excellent image quality. I wish, there is suitable 35mm 1.4 lens for this camera. Cons: So far, i can tell return button is on the other side. So you have to keep 2 hands runneing around when navigate menu. Return button should be closer to the OK and select button. Price should be about $3500s. There is no $2000 premium needed over A7rii. If you are on budget and not making money out of photography, get the Sony A7Rii",

This camera is amazing! The non-black out shooting is amazing, and once you use it you will never buy another camera for action photography that doesn't have it. My only decision now is if I should buy a second one, or the new a7riii to get that sweet 42mp sensor for non-sports relation shooting. Either way, my 5D4 is going on the selling block as soon as I decide.",

The focusing capabilities are amazing and the frame rate of 20 FPS make it amazing for sports.

I shoot architectural interiors professionally and don't need speed so I never tested the speed part. I was just hoping the high ISO/DR would be better than the 7RII. Nope. Was WORSE!! At 50 ISO the 7RII outshines the A9 as well as at 6400 ISO. However, I did like the feel of the A9 as well as the instant buffer, better EVF and less mushy buttons and dials.
