They fit perfectly in my Mainstays brand cubbies (from Walmart)....the smaller set of shelves in the 2nd photo. I will be buying more as I am using them in my craft room to hold all my crafting supplies. The bins are deep enough to hide lots of things in them. Overall I am pleased. I can't attest to how long they last as I just received them and haven't used them yet, but I have no doubts they will work great for my purposes.",

I will definitely consider them if I need additional storage boxes in the future.",

Although probably not for long as the storage boxes are on not the best quality. The boxes easy bend and fold, and the mark remains- also making the box more flimsy and delicate. I guess the boxes could last a long time if not used often, or the weight can evenly be destributed to avoid it from breaking or folding. For someone like me (busy mom) this item wont last long. I should have invested in a product that could withstand more. Can\u2019t beat the price.",

The fabric wrinkles very easily (even where there is cardboard backing) and again the light color makes it more noticeable. The color itself is more yellow than I expected... Not a fan.",
