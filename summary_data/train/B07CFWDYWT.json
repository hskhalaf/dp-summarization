I didn't know what jazz shoes were so as always I looked on Amazing Amazon and there they were. They fit perfectly, they're very comfortable and our girl loves them. I looked at other brands however alot of them said to order the shoes larger because of the European sizes. Dynadans said order your shoe size. I really appreciated that. I will always get her dance shoes from them, we are customers for life!! Thank you Dynadans, you are the best.",

Overall, the fits larger than it's supposed to and she is going to have to wear something to give her the right fit. She is happy with the product, but now I know that perhaps an 8 or even a 7.5 would've fit better. You can't have loose jazz shoes.",
