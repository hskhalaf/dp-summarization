I was skeptical at first but after using it for two months straight, my supply ran out for about a week and a half before I decided to get my next bottle. I didn\u2019t think much of it bc I stack it with other supplements and thought that the others should suffice and that I\u2019d get the Genius Mushrooms eventually. I ended up feeling totally different, much less clear in my head and less able to handle certain feelings and thoughts. So, It definitely wasn\u2019t merely a placebo effect for me. We\u2019re all different. Try it. It might work for you.",

Not a huge difference from normal, but enough to tell the difference. It's definitely worth trying if you haven't purchased these before.",

It's pretty subtle guys so don't be expecting some crazy adderall-like effects. But overall I'm quite satisfied with this product and this brand overall. I'm definitely gonna try out more of their products!",
