I've been using this square for months and assumed that I just needed to be more careful. The worst feature of this square, is that it's unsquareness changes every time I adjust it.",

By comparison, my Starrett combination square is perfect relative to my reference square and has a 1/64\u201d scale instead of the metric scale.

The edges are rather sharp in many places and some of the surfaces are rough with tool marks. No doubt the manufacturer could have done a better job.
