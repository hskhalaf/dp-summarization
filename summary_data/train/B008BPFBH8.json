Every time I use it, something else on it breaks. The strap and plastic nozzle broke almost immediately. Although it is only a year old, it looks like it has been in use for decades....it is only being held together by lots and lots of duct tape. My loyalty to Oreck products is over. I will never buy another Oreck product!",

The Oreck Commercial has these advantages And in addition has better suction. The longer cord is also nice to have. It\u2019s much easier to do steps with it compared to our upright. My old standard model is still going strong. Hope the new one is of equal quality- it appears to be. Very pleased with our new Oreck Commercial. Also, the Commercial was less expensive than the standard, not sure why...",

I tried to buy a longer hose, but that is not available. The attachments will not stay attached, but continually come apart. It has wonderful suction, but that doesn't help if the vacuum lacks usability and this one certainly does.",

The attachments are great except for the brush part that has all the hairs on it. The hairs seem to be a little long so when you attach that to use it, the hairs suck in a little blocking the path for dirt/hair to get by. So it can clog up easily but with the suction power you don't have to take it off and suck all the debris out of there very often.
