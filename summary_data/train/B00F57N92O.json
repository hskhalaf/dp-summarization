One of our pups has allergies and we were told not to put it in a food storage container, but to leave it in the original bag.

The Wild Game Formula is his preferred flavor -- he likes it more than the Original flavor or the fish based option, which he's also tried. I also feed him soft food (either the Wellness Core canned food or homemade food) in addition to this and add in a small amount of pumpkin puree to it. If he eats only this kibble with no soft food, his stools tend to be excessively dry -- which isn't surprising given the higher protein content.",
