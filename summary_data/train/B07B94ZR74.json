The spinner does a terrific job getting casual clothes almost dry ..will wait and see how it does with towels...the only issue I saw is that the hoses are too short....I used buckets to fill and washed close to my shower so I could drain it.. plan to buy a detachable shower head to fill and that will work well.

I'll say this, the spinner really gets the clothes dry, so if you can get a unit that doesn't leak, you're golden. I think it's a winner for a small space.",

Dont get me wrong, This is not a bad machine and it does what it says it will do. My only issue is that I am used to a larger capacity bin and the spin cycle on this is not as strong as my previous one. If I hadn't experienced the other one I would be over the moon with tnis one. So if someone is trying for the 1srlt time, this is definitely going to do the job. No lint remover/collector so you can imagine lol",

When you drain the washing water from the bin, the grime floats on top and settles on your clothes. The spinner gets unbalanced very easily and makes a noisy clunking sound. I found out too late that the spinning basket was slamming into the sides of the machine and that the friction burned a hole into the washing portion. I strongly recommend you spend a little more and get a portable washer that had the spinner and the washing section together (ie not two separate compartments).",

But the real surprise is how effective the spinner is at \"drying\" the clothes. I would say the 5 min spin cycle removes at least 90%-95% of the water from your clothes and even towels will be completely dry after a couple hours. One of my favorite purchases ever!",

      "text": "I was very excited to have the new compact laundry machine come in but it wasn't as powerful as I thought it would be. It could be because I was washing heavier clothes but I don't like that it's noisy and it doesn't do cleaning well on the thicker clothes. I really like that it's very easy to move around and it's very compact. Overall, it does its job well with summer clothes but during the winter I think going to the laundry mats might be better or having the bigger laundry machines will be better.",

Not a bad tradeoff, though, as we no longer get mystery socks or panties in our wash. It is a bit bulky and awkward if you don't have a decent setup, but the spin cycle is actually pretty good at wringing out moisture from clothes. We might upgrade to something later, but for now it's going strong.",

However after trying it out once, im not impressed. The side that washes the clothes is much BIGGER than the side that spins the clothes. So if you wash too much at once, you have to divide the load to spin it out properly thus making the wash process take longer than a normal machine cycle. The drain is short so id recommend using it in a shower or having something to catch the water once it drains.",

Drain cycle is great but I still have to tip it over to make sure all the water is out. Overall I would recommend it for small loads. Beats going to the laundry mat in my book.",
