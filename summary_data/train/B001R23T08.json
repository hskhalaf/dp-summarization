I found out if you remove the side panel (merely a dust cover with two screws holding it) the blade change is very simple as you now have good access to the lower blade holder.",

It seems to work ok. However, as the other reviewer \"den\" puts it in detail it is not acceptable as a saw that will use pinless blades. Buy at your own risk. I was a newby and broke so was looking for a deal not realizing what was important. The ability to change pinless blades is important. I've broken several just now and still can't get a pinless blade attached and threaded through a small piece of wood.",
