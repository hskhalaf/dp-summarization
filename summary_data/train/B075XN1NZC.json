All that was accomplished with this upgrade was that the strength of the connection went from one bar to two out of five. I can only suggest one do more research then I did.",

There is also a TV guide built in. I returned the digital boxes to Spectrum and keeping my $16 a month rental fee. My husband says set up was very easy, just follow the prompts and it only took a couple minutes. Great deal!",

BUT, I have tried 2 different phones and followed all instructions and cannot get it to connect to the ROKU mobile app so I cannot use my phone to control the unit. This was one of the main reason I bought this. I used one on my beach vacation and was very impressed. Getting hold of the ROKU Customer Service and Support is almost impossible. I haven't been able to connect with them. I guess I will have to go through Amazon even though it isn't their problem.",

Again, setup was easy, and I\u2019m catching up on my Netflix shows and Youtube subscriptions before bed. Really happy with this buy, and really pleased to recommend Roku to anyone in the market.",

All of their sticks should have this capability. Consider upgrading to one of the more expensive options. Supposedly Stick, Stick+ and Ultra will work. Basically I wasted $25 bucks.",

I think that is more because this unit is wifi and my roku tv is ethernet cable. All in all it's an easy kit to set up and use on a non smart tvs. One thing I didnt like is that the hdmi cable it comes with is really short so you might want to get a longer cable to use instead.",

      "text": "After 8 moths of setup, the image and sound stops streaming in cycles of ~1 sec each 30 secs! No HDMI problem because signal to TV is stable and no HDMI error message from TV is elicited by this error. It's like the streaming itself (Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube, etc) is cycling to a short silent blank screen each ~30 seconds, which is unlikely. It is a Roku device problem. Updating system files didn't work. Roku does work continuously streaming each movie or serial you select, but the cycle of silent black screen appears when navigating menus, Roku interface, channel streaming, etc.",

When I used the FireStick which as 5G for a different service, I didn't have this problem because it's a different frequency. My suggestion? Get a Roku with 5G or a cable service that supports FireStick.",

However, the wires plug into the back and now you need 3 or more inches of clearance behind your TV to accommodate the wires. My 60\" Samsung is mounted on the wall so I couldn't attach the Roku at all. It's hanging by the wires under my TV right now and it's going back tomorrow.",
