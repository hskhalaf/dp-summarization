The materials seem fairly sturdy, and my only real complaint is that the \"measuring\" jigger doesn't have the measures labeled on it. The shaker is on the small side but enough for about two martinis at a time, and I've never had problems with leaking as another reviewer suggested. You really can't beat the price, and I'll probably opt for a nicer set the next time I get one, but I have a feeling I'll be happy with this one for quite a while.",

I\u2019m new to this whole scene but ever since I received this set and used it for mojitos when I had some friends over I have been so excited to use it again next weekend! The only reason I took one star off is because the cap for the shaker gets a little difficult to take off once the contents have chilled inside due to the ice, but otherwise it\u2019s great for someone looking to get into bartending at home like me!",

Cold enough that the two sections of the shaker fuse together for a short while, so don't panic. I feel fancy when using this set.
