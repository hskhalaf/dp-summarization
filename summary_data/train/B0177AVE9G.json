      "text": "This swingset has a wonderful design, but the wood is as soft and cheap as it could possibly be. Just placing the screws in split many of the boards, and I doubt the entire assembly will last more than a couple of seasons, because the wood is already disintegrating at all the joints. The entire swingset creaks and rocks, and that's with my not yet 4-year old granddaughter, who weighs 32 pounds, climbing on it. I'd rather spend more money and have really solid lumber, where I know the swingset will last for years and years.",

Overall though it was a solid buy. At 1/2 the cost of similar units, I won't complain too much. I modified the Swing setup. I didn't like how close the swings were so I drilled my own holes and removed the swing glider. Now my kids have more room between the swings to twist, sway, or whatever they like without being so close. Great buy!",

It's very dangerous. I had to remove them and buy all new plastic handles. And there is alot of handles on this set. Other than that, it has stood up to two hurricanes here in Florida.

It is very sturdy and well constructed, we dug down into the yard to make a rectangle enclosure for the playground and filled it with 5inches of wood-chips then anchored the playground to the ground with long reinforced metal nails.",
