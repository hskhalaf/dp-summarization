What I dig about this light is that it comes with a battery and charger. Most other lights use batteries and chargers that comes with the unit or require you to change out batteries! This is all in one. What I disliked about this is that even thought you can co trip the brightness (10-99) you can't control the color it puts out. 4 star for that as the light is sometimes to harsh even with filter in place",

In the middle of the interview, the light turns off. The battery was fully charged the night before. It was as if the battery was dead. I found that if I put the battery pack back on the charging dock and put it back on the light it would work again. It\u2019s like the battery needs a jumpstart. Besides the battery issue or perhaps I\u2019ve gotten a faulty battery pack, this product is a great light source to compensate for your camera.",

This light is very bright and can even be dimmed. I used it last weekend as a camping light and it is was awesome for this. I also used it for light when my neighborhood recently experienced a 24 hour outage. My neighbors asked me later if I had a generator to be able to have the lights so bright in my house during it! It seriously confused them how our house still had lights on!",

The battery doesn't last long and the case doesn't have room for spares, so bringing a plugin cable would give a backup option. Otherwise works well, I have been primarily using it with my Hero 5 Black Edition onwith a Rode mic. Works well for cutting down the low-light graininess.",
