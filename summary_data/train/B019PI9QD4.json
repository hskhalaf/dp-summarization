Gave 4 stars because it isn't powerful enough to charge them and my phone at the same time, but seeing as the main purpose I bought it for was to charge my headphones I'm very pleased with it. It seems sturdy, has good weight to the base and snaps together so super easy to assemble. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a nice way to charge and store their headphones.",

It does fulfill my needs i can hand my headphones on it and use both my external drives so I am satisfied",

The fact that it is made of sturdy materials with a sleek and elegant design is just secondary. Really though, my only complaint would be that, for me, the USB cord to connect the stand to my PC was a bit too short for my setup. So factor in the cost of buying either an extension cord or another, much longer cord to the total cost of this product if your stand is going to be on the opposite side of your desk from your PC.",
