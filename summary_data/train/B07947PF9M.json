It\u2019s a little awkward to adjust to at first but it ends up saving you on more than one occasion. That being said, this is a truly lame re-design! They\u2019ve evened out the proportions and kicked some of the features that once made it the best. The inner pocket no longer snaps but instead zips - it feels like paper in your hands. The straps are thinner. Yuck. Returned. Buy the old style through customer service, you don\u2019t want this one.",
