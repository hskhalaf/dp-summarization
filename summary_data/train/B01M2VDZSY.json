My 16 month old son likes to throw his plate when he\u2019s almost or done his food and we\u2019ve been trying to teach him not to do it. So we decided to purchase this suction plate and he tried to throw it last night and he couldn\u2019t get it off the table! We did have to buy a silicone mat though because it won\u2019t stick to our wooden table as it is not a smooth table. But we are very happy with the product and definitely recommend it!",
