I won't even try to mention all the features because it would take all day to describe them. I highly recommend that you buy Supercharging the Olympus OM-D E-M10 by W.N.Green and spend some quality time with your new camera while reading this book. The owner's manual is decent, but there are so many features on this camera that you need someone to help walk you through them and assist you with the settings. It's only 7.99 on Kindle. This is an amazing deal for what you are getting.",

Very disappointed - you would think that Olympus could do a better job by either making good sensors, or at least buying good sensors for their cameras. Not likely I will try Olympus again - I only need one lesson to learn.",

This camera in manual mode and with an inexpensive OM to 4/3 adapter handles my old OM-1 lenses very well. This OM-D E-M10 II has a \"focus peaking\" feature that allows great crisp manual focus control. One must find the menu and set the native focal length of the manual focus lens and enter that so the in-camera image stabilization works properly. I have been shooting pictures with the OM-1 lenses mainly in Aperture Priority mode, and the camera's automatic exposure setting have worked well, But, these are controllable too.",

White balance is set to be abnormally warm (for some reason), and there's a handful more setting that need to be changed to get the best image quality. But, once the camera is set up, its awesome. The kit lens isn't terrible, but its really nothing great either ( I've seen reviews that the kit lens is great... I was disappointed). All pictures I uploaded were with 40-150mm lens.",

Other than that, it works flawlessly, has a brilliant EVF, a great range of reasonably priced lenses, and is nicely made and finished for its price. Wi-fi works significantly more reliably than in prior model. Olympus' current price for the 40 -- 150mm, f4.0--f5.6 kit lens -- $100 -- is a roaring bargain. Grab it!",

      "text": "this is THE mirrorless camera to get right now. amazing price/quality ratio. i have had the panasonic GF1 and GX1 before and have been with m43 since the early days. The EM10 II has reached a great level of maturity. The EVF is fantastic (I never liked earlier EVFs), it is compact yet very well laid out. It is fun to use and give great RAW and jpeg images.",

Serial number on box and camera do match. I may keep the silver rather than returning it since I like both versions. Found the camera to be a bit larger and heaver than expected, but this is not a problem for me. It does have a lot of options to manage. Overall my impression is very good, although strongly recommend buying the Kindle book - Supercharging the Olympus O-MD-E-M10 from Amazon. Now on for a field trial.",
