Even with stiff wind waves, it was stable and moved easily. It still can be improved by proving larger pockets, a longer striping basket, and a couple more D-rings in beside the backrest",

I saved a lot of money buying it used, I was sceptical at first, but I will buy more used items on Amazon from now on. I'm all about saving some of my hard earned cash. Get you some!",
