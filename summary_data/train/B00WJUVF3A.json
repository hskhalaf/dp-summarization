I was very unhappy with them and went back and read the product description and it says 30% Blue Blocking. It doesn't appear to even be that much. I don't normally need corrective lenses and I didn't order any correction in the lenses. But the writing on my computer screen is blurry with the glasses on and clear with the glasses off. So the blurriness causes even more eye strain. If you are concerned about all the blue light from your electronics and are hoping for less eye strain, these are not the glasses for you.",

What\u2019s worse is you cannot return the product, which is not mentioned anywhere on the product description. So they pretty much sell you a product that does not work then they do not allow you to return it, they should not be allowed to sell on Amazon.",
