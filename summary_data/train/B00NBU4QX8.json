It is NOT returnable so you are stuck with it. I bought a Den Tek mouth guard and got it setup the first time and it works great.",

This caused my jaw to sit in an unatural position when I sleep. Very uncomfortable and I would end up taking it out while I slept. I'm sure others have no problem but it's not for me.",

As the instructions note, if you suck too hard when waiting for it to harden (lol), it will be uncomfortable when you wear it afterwards.",

Made to withstand extreme chewing and grinding, the 1.6mm thick, ultralight SOVA guard is tougher than basic night guards, thanks to non-compressible, non-toxic materials that distribute force over the entire perforated surface of the mouth guard. One-of-a-kind Diffusix technology dissipates grinding forces, protecting against issues that can cause and perpetuate jaw pain, ensuring a better night\u2019s sleep. The optimized design and perforation pattern promotes the natural flow of air and saliva, making it possible to breathe and drink easily while wearing the ultra-thin, odor and taste-free night guard. Customizable and remoldable up to 20 times, it\u2019s easy to achieve the perfect fit without a costly trip to the dentist. The mouth guard is even compatible with braces, but a dental professional must be consulted for proper fitting. The SOVA Aero Night Guard is available with or without a ventilated carrying case, and is easy to clean using soap and water and/or toothpaste and a toothbrush. Made in the USA.",
