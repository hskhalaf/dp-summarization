My only request would be that the strap be a little wider for use as a shoulder strap. Otherwise, no complaints whatsoever.",

Wrapped the strap around the bar in the front of the bus (in front of the front seats) and put my trip binder, pens, some snacks, etc. in it. So handy! Also like it for holding random work things in when I'm on the road. :)",
