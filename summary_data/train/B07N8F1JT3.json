I've been using this every night for about 6 weeks now I believe and it is definitely very moisturizing without being greasy or heavy but I really haven't noticed any improvement to the few fine lines I have. It seems to plump the skin slightly so I suppose those with heavier or more wrinkles may notice better results on that front but for me it just seems like a very basic, if nice moisturizing cream. It's okay, and my skin doesn't dislike it, so I'll use the jar. But I'll stick with my Tret cream for actual anti-aging products.",

Its attributes include: unscented, pleasant, easy to apply and comfortable overnight.",

It keeps my skin nicely moisturized throughout the night and I wake up with a nice glow. I had no bad reactions from the lotion or rashes. All in all... a great night lotion.",
