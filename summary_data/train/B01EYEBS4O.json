      "title": "Mirror Door Jewelry Cabinet Organizes Precious Jewelry",
      "text": "This is the perfect way to organize your jewelry. Slots for rings, hooks for necklaces, arms for bracelets. On the bottom two drawers for important papers or odds & ends. A couple of design suggestions:1)move the bracelet bar to the right side below the necklace hooks. 2) Add an additional bracelet bar. 3) Remove two shelves on right to allow space for two bracelet bars. 4)By moving the bracelet bar to the right side, there can be more space on the left side between the two rows of necklace hooks allowing for longer necklaces. This cabinet is a real WINNER!!!",

NO assembly required except screwing in the hanging hooks on back with a Phillips screwdriver and adding 2 AA batteries for light (light has on/off switch on top; but, also has a sensor button inside which turns on/off when opened and closed like a refrigerator). Comes with Molly bolts to hang on the wall and adhesive pads (x2) for bottom back to ensure the cabinet door is secure when opening. Great quality for the price and nice storage capability for jewelry or other items. Perfect buy!",

      "text": "Although it's not a full length mirror, I like it ALOT for the amount of items it holds. I mention the mirror because since it IS an over-the-door hanger, it isn't as long as a full length door mirror is, and you can't see your ALL in it. However, it is very handy anyways. I love the compartments, the hanging section, the ring section and the velvet it's lined with. I just have one problem with the earring holder section. It's hard to hang studded earrings on it. And if you happen to accidentally bump it, things fall/shift, etc. But all-in-all, I'm happy with it.",

It was a bit of a pain to hang however, the holes on the back were not perfectly placed and I had to make modifications to get the cabinet to hang level. With slightly better quality control on the fabrication this product would be perfect. My advice- if you need to hang it with screws, measure everything twice before drilling and do not assume the pre-drilled holes are level.",

      "text": "This jewelry cabinet is very attractive and well made. I have been looking for one for a couple of years, but found that many of them have cheaply made interiors that don't look like they would hold up over time. This one is well made and has an LED light inside. I can't believe how much jewelry this cabinet holds. It had some weight to it, so my husband mounted it on the wall instead of over the door. The cabinet has a sturdy closure, so when I open it, I hold it against the wall as I pull the door open. The cabinet comes with a lock and key which is a nice feature.",

If you have many bulky necklaces, they may not fit since the door may not shut. Not much room for bracelets and those you do put on the bar, need to be flexible or again, the door may not shut. But there's plenty of room on the shelves for more bracelets or watches. It would be nice if it was an inch deeper but it's hard to complain for the price.",

I think it would be fabulous if you could reconfigure it for your jewelry, but it's still pretty cool. I think it's a decent value.

Would have been a much better design if the slats were hinged on one side, allowing them to open and shut! So I ended up using some of the rings spaces for earrings.
