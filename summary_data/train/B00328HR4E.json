Its small, takes good enough pictures and has the ability to be adjusted as necessary for more custom shots then \"point and shoot\" This is my second Sony camera, and I am impressed with the advancements Sony has just made in a couple years. I shopped around looking at reviews, and after checking out what seems like a hundred reviews I am glad I just picked the Sony. Camera snobs who are looking for some magick camera that is a $2k Nikon for a couple hundred bucks or less should review their subject matter. Orange is good because it is easily visible too.",

It accomplished that but froze up and I could not get it to take any other pictures after the 2nd day of use. It keeps showing a command of \"turn the power off and on again\". of which I have done that multiple times without any success of it becoming able to take more pictures... And the memory disc still has plenty of storage left.......So disappointed.....909 322 5739..If any one cares.....",

    "description": "Color:BlackA large 3.0\u201d LCD makes taking and viewing pictures easy with the DSC-S2100. With 12MP resolution and 3x zoom great shots can be taken from greater distances plus enjoy the convenience of AA battery operation. Features including Easy mode, iAuto and SteadyShot\u2122 make it easy to capture great images in various conditions.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nA large 3.0-inch LCD makes taking and viewing pictures easy with the Cyber-shot DSC-S2100. With 12-megapixel resolution and 3x zoom, great shots can be taken from greater distances plus enjoy the convenience of AA battery operation. Features including Easy mode, iAuto and SteadyShot make it easy to capture great images in various conditions. \n\nSony DSC-2100 Highlights \n\n12.1-megapixel Super HAD CCD image sensor\nA powerful 12.1-megapixel, 1/2.3-inch Super HAD CCD image sensor helps you capture gorgeous images with superb contrast and clarity down to the finest detail. With 12.1 megapixels, you can create stunning, photo-quality prints up to A3+ (13x19-inch) size, or crop your images and still come away with high resolution shots. \n\n\n\n3.0-inch Clear Photo LCD display (230k pixels)\nGenerous 3.0-inch (230K pixels) Clear Photo LCD display features sharp, natural color that makes it easy to compose shots, read menus, and view photos, even in bright sunlight. \n\nIntelligent Auto Mode\nUnlike traditional auto mode, Intelligent Auto (iAuto) mode thinks for you, recognizing scenes, lighting conditions, faces, and adjusts settings resulting clear images, faces with natural skin tone and less blur. Take advantage of all the technology without leaving Auto mode. Take a picture from a kid on the playground, to landscape shots, to a beautiful flower or an indoor birthday party. All clear images without leaving auto mode. \n\nIntelligent Scene Recognition (iSCN) Mode\nIntelligent Scene Recognition (iSCN) Mode automatically detects nine different types of scenes and, within just 1/30th of a second, selects the appropriate camera settings: Backlight, Backlight Portrait, Twilight, Twilight Portrait, Portrait, Landscape and Macro. \n\nSteady Shot Image Stabilization\nSteadyShot image stabilization compensates for camera shake and helps prevent blur by capturing two photos at high shutter speeds and combining them into a single clear image. \n\nHigh Sensitivity Mode (ISO 3200)\nHigh ISO allows for faster shutter speed, so you can take photos indoors or in low light without the need for a flash. In addition to High Sensitivity Mode (ISO), you can select up to seven ISO settings (Auto, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200) when shooting in Program Auto Mode to adjust sensitivity to your shooting conditions. \n\nFace Detection technology\nFace Detection technology detects up to eight individual faces and adjusts focus, exposure, and flash to help deliver crisp, properly lit images of family and friends. \n\nSmile Shutter helps capture the best possible shot Smile Shutter technology\nSmile Shutter technology captures a smile the moment it happens. Simply press the Smile Shutter button and the camera does the rest. Intelligent Scene Recognition can now be used together with Smile Shutter mode when the Intelligent Auto mode is on. This means that beautiful smiles can be captured with settings optimized for the particular scene, even in difficult conditions such as twilight and backlighting. \n\nScene Modes\nThe DSC-S2100 features 8 convenient scene modes: High Sensitivity, Twilight, Twilight Portrait, Soft Snap, Landscape, Beach, Snow, Gourmet. \n\nEasy Shooting Mode\nWith Easy Shooting Mode, even beginners can take great photos. In Easy Shooting Mode, easy-to-understand basic instructions are displayed on the LCD screen and the camera switches to all automatic settings, removing several function choices and allowing you to focus on just your subject. Since this mode works together with Intelligent Scene Recognition, the camera selects the optimum setting for each scene. In addition the easy mode simplifies preview mode. \n\nIn-Camera Retouching Tools\nRetouch and enhance your photos on the go with in-camera Trimming and Red-Eye Correction functions \nIn-camera retouching options \nAA Battery\nOperates on AA batteries for convenient and affordable replacement. \n\nCard Slot\nCard slot for optional Memory Stick Duo media. \n\nSD Card Functionality\nSony SD memory cards are the perfect solution for storing and sharing your digital content such as high-quality photos, videos, music, and more. \n\nIncludes Sony PMB (Picture Motion Browser) Software ver. 5.02\nSony Picture Motion Browser software offers a simple, intuitive way to transfer, sort, and view your video and still images on your compatible PC.
