I've had it for several weeks and I'm pleased with the quality. If you want a large leather wallet with a chain and plenty of storage this is a good one. The chain isn't the best but it works. I'll replace it later with a dog choke chain like I do with almost all of my wallets. The wallet is as good as others I've owned that were 50-70 dollars so I'm very satisfied. Would definitely buy it again.",

Several concerns I had are: the zipper/overall quality may be too cheap, it may be too thick for my back pocket, and it may difficult to sit since it sticks out my pocket. All of the concerns were unfounded. This wallet works great. My only caution is for those with very small/tight pants pockets. I typically wear jeans and dress pants. Very tight/small pockets may find this wallet to be too big. I would buy this again. The primary reason I bought this wallet is because it has a zipper and received good reviews.",
