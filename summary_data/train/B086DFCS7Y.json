A mom with a baby doesn't have that much time on their hands. For reference, 1/2 cup made about 3 containers of food. It would take hours to fill all the containers provided. I'm disappointed in this product and wish I could return it. The blades aren't powerful, no matter how soft the food you add is. For $50+ I expected higher quality.",
