I live in AZ so I like to ensure that there is always fresh water out for any animal who may need a drink. I purchased this cat food with my Prime Pantry & love the quick free delivery. The price point was also cheaper than if I were to get in the car, drive to wally world & buy it. After I open it I put it into a big plastic container so it stays fresh & no bugs or ants can get into it.",
