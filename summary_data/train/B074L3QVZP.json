If you've never assembled brake lines before, it might take a bit more effort, but still should be pretty easy. Assembly took me roughly 10 minutes. A little pro tip: Do not try and tighten the allen bolts with make shift tools.. it'll be impossible without the right size allen wrench. You will break flathead tips and strip the heads. It takes a great bit of torque to tighten enough that handlebars don't move and loosen when doing bunny hops and wheelies. Great product from the best brand for freestyle.",

Another family member got their bikes from Walmart and it's the same exact bike but $50.00 less, already assembled, and had more options( pegs and had brake cables so the handle bars could spin around). It was a differnet color and did not have the mongoose stickers. O well.",
