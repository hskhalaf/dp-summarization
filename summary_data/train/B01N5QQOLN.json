Advertised as tulips but purchased for our 15th anniversary which is a crystal anniversary. Looked great with roses. Almost half the cost of another retailer that rhymes with Tracy's. Shipped fast and came in the Lennox box just as it would from any retailer. Recommended for a gift, beach theme decorating or just because.",
