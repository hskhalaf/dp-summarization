      "text": "I've been on a quest the last month looking for the perfect headphones, after leaving my job working for a subpar headphone manufacturer. In my new headphone I wanted: perfect call quality (from the other person's perspective, audiophile quality music, dual Bluetooth connection without issue (new chromebook pro and a note 8), comfort, vibrate when ringing, sweat proof for rowing, cords that aren't annoying, long battery life, and basically, I just want them to work as advertised. I've tried both sennhiesers, LG, Samsung, Vi, Jaybird, and beats. The RHA's are the only ones to not only meet all of my expectations, they blew them away. Seriously, great job guys. Wow. Recommending to everyone I know.",

They also don't ever seem to get to 100% charge and I haven't really tested out the 12hr rated charge time. Sound quality is great, but as others have mentioned I have had problems occasionally with dropouts when playing audio from my phone when it's in my pants pocket. Typically this is when I'm outside working in heavy clothing though. All in all I'm happy with them but am hoping to get a good pair of truly wireless earbuds one of these days.",

However, one of the biggest draws for me was that unlike JayBird and Beats (and even Bose), the MA750 actually uses USB-C to charge; this should be standard given how USB-C is the new standard for non-Apple phones, but only RHA and a small amount of others offer this. No need to pay top dollar for a soon-to-be obsolete device or buy essentially obsolete chargers.",
