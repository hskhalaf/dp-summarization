Then we're left with the discomfort of finding somewhere to go. Go On The Go has a better way!\nOur hygienic disposable bag turns into an instant toilet on the go for whenever and wherever you may suddenly need one. It was designed with just these emergency moments in mind. The wide opening and unisex adapter make it work for every person, regardless of gender, age or body differences. With the 20 oz. capacity, you don't need to worry about it overflowing during your flow.

These convenient bathroom bags can even double as vomit bags. \nThis Go On The Go package includes 6 pouches to keep you and your loved ones prepared for various scenarios. Each compact bag is simple to store in a car, a camping pack, a boat or a plane, and various other places where you might end up stuck without a bathroom.
