Based on reviews and You Tube videos , I was excited to get this generator and am very upset it failed completely. Don\u2019t they test these things? Update 7/5-contacted manufacturer recommended authorized repair shop. They stated that they were not authorized to work on dual fuel. Returned unit to Amazon with replacement due 7/9.",

A little disappointed I had to contact service because despite starting and running great it didn't produce any power. Turns out a wire had come unplugged from the controller. I had to take off a back panel and it was obvious and easy to fix. The only other thing that I was unaware of and didn't see in the manual is that the only way to turn it off when running on propane is to turn off the gas. Not a big deal, but I thought I was doing something wrong initially when the off switch didn't work.",

All internal combustion engines loose power as elevation increases, due to rarefied atmosphere (unless they have oxygen sensors and mixture computers.) Also, more carbon is produced that fouls the engine. Call Champion for a free orifice for the carburetor. You need to be handyman to install the orifice. Instructions are not thorough. Champion please post an instruction video on the procedure to install the orifice.",

      "text": "Although I had to add an hour-meter, I still like these generators. I have used propane only, but gas is an option. The shutdown method of stopping the flow of fuel is a wise idea. No more gummed up carburetors caused by forgetting to shut off flow. Using the parallel kit is a nice feature. Bought the wall feed-through kit so my wife has easy access to power if I am not home when she loses electricity. I think the most convenient thing is that I can still pick up a generator and put it on a wagon and pull it out to the field if I need power a long distance from the house.",

Recently, I could not pull-start the generator after neglecting the battery for a whole year. The battery voltage was 9.8 volts (all my fault). Champion \"support\" said 12 volts were necessary to pull-start the generator when using gasoline, but not when using propane. This important information should be in Champion's pre-sales literature and owner's manual. I would have bought the recoil-start only option if I had known this quark. The recoil-starter is a worthless feature to me now. I wonder if the single-fuel models are designed similarly.",
