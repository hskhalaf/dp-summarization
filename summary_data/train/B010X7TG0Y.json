Amazing low light performance - both video and photo. Nice compact size - although it does feel a bit too small at times - but I suspect I will get used to it. It fits in my trouser pocket - just about! Cons: Charger a bit naff - you have to charge the battery whilst in the camera. Seriously Sony?? Feels a bit too small for comfort sometimes - but I suspect this is just because I am used to the larger LX7.",

Very small, take it anywhere. Astonishing wide range of features. The drawback is the modest zoom range, but if you want a longer zoom range with this large size chip I think the camera size has to increase, so you just have to decide what's best for you. I bought it on a Sony cashback scheme and found it very difficult to get the cash out of Sony who were simply unhelpful, unlike Amazon who helped me get the cashback",

Totally recommended, and get a little grip as well and a FAST SD card if you want all the amazing video quality this camera can deliver. I wish Sony included a microphone input though.",

I find if I press the capture button to take a photo via timer setting, then move, it's almost never in focus. It seems the camera lacks the ability to refind focus once it is lost.. and sometimes getting focus at all does take awhile.. I try and combat this issue by just taking many many photos.. although I do get upset when what looks like a great photo is horribly out of focus. I tried using my phone as a remote to capture without moving.. but it never works for me.",
