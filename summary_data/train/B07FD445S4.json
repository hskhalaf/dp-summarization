Its traction, arch support, and short break-in period were also commended. However, there were those who found this piece smaller than what they initially anticipated. Sizing issues aside, the Merrell Alverstone Waterproof can be a beneficial piece of gear for outdoorsy individuals because of its hike-worthy characteristics.",

Thus, the potential to be 5 stars is all there. The negative: However, the thin leather side lace holders rip way too easily, which means you can't lace them up - rendering the shoe unusable - unless you hike or walk around with unlaced expensive shoes, which then are not comfortable or waterproof. Team Merrell needs to redesign this shoe so that the laces feed through durable plastic, metal, or nylon lace grommets - as they use on the Moab hiking shoe.",

Has great traction for hiking, but the treads are spaced effectively to minimize the dreaded problem of trail pebbles getting wedged in your boots. These also stood up well to a day of rough gardening - stomping on shovels, kicking things into place, hauling things, etc. - without showing any noticeable wear or causing any foot strain/pain. They would likely also be a good choice for women pursuing other home repair or construction tasks, but haven\u2019t had a chance to test this yet.
