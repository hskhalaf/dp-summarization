The photo above shows an accumulation of black dust building underneath the bike. I don\u2019t see any way of adjusting the wheel to eliminate it striking and rubbing against the factory frame. I was trying to use it daily for light exercise, two 20 minute sessions. I\u2019ve had it a little more than 2 months, and it\u2019ll be roadside with the garbage soon. Just a piece of junk!

The seat is stiff and will make you sore after 20 min. It came missing the distance/calorie display completely. Had to make several emails n calls to rectify that situation. Now after a month of daily use the front wheel wobbles violently and loud no matter which resistance setting i set it on. Waste of money. Buy a better brand for more $ and you won\u2019t have regrets like me.",

The bike itself is a good product for the price, but the seat is terrible it's too small and too hard and this is supposed to be an improved seat.

I asked the company for a better seat or give me a small refund to purchase a better seat locally and they refused. I don't know why Amazon puts up with a company so inflexable.",

So as my mom pedaled the main wheel slowly twisted until finally it began to grind down the sides of the housing.
