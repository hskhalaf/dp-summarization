Wider toebox/forefoot is good if you have wider feet, padding inside the ankle keeps the shoe snug in that area. Bounce cushion is plush enough to feel soft but still retain some court feet. If you need a lot of ankle support these might not be the right fit, the collar around the ankle is stretchy and the shoe more or less feels like a low. Overall a 4 star for me, I might give these 5 stars after more wear time.",
