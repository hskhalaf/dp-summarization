Primary is that the yellow duck bill comes off, and when this happens the water isn't well-directed. Also when the bill is off there is very little protection from the end of the facet. You might think that you'll just never take off the bill, but a 9-24 month old helper will find taking it off very fun while taking a bath. Also, if it is not correctly positioned, the water will go out the back of it possibly flooding out of the tub. Overall, I can't say that this makes bath time any safer or easier.",

    "description": "The Aqueduck bath extender is a product created after speaking with numerous moms about bath time problems. Moms wanted a solution for filling baby bath tubs easily without wasting water and an easier way to rinse a toddler's hair without bumping their head on the faucet. My solution for these both time problems (and more) is the Aqueduck Bath Extender. It is fun and useful for kids and parents.",
