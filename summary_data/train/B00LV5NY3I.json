For extra dry skin, I would recommend carrying this product around with you to \"touch-up\" on your moisturizing throughout the day.

Even after applying 2 layers of this moisturizer right out of the shower, I still got dry patches. This being said, if I were still in my 20s, perhaps this lighter moisturizer would do the trick.",

I no longer break out, my makeup goes on smooth, and my skin has a natural healthy glow. I definitely recommend buying if you're on the fence.",

I wish the bottle was more eco-friendly and it is hard to tell how much you've used. But I like the cream itself. Good value for the money.

I have found it to be, however, too thin to take away that taut feeling, although in summer it may be enough on its own. So in winter I wait a few minutes and then apply a thicker cream on top. Together they provide the result I need, my eyes are not irritated and my skin feels smooth and supple all day.",
