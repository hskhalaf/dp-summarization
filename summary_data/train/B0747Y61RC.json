      "text": "This smells really nice and refreshing, and goes on really nicely. Some moisturizers feel heavy or oily, etc., but this one is very light and a few minutes after you put it on, it doesn't feel like you're wearing anything on your face. I have oily skin so some moisturizers make me feel even oilier, but not this one. I do get acne but after taking vitamins and using witch hazel I have seen a reduction in acne, so I'm not sure if this moisturizer has directly helped with acne at all, but it certainly doesn't cause breakouts and it probably does help with acne.",
