      "text": "A splendid camera. So many functions but the buttons are tricky to use. They get in the way of others. I do want to keep the camera but it is difficult to grip. It is heavy for such a small camera and it is not balanced. The thumb grip for the right hand is small so it either tends to causes one's hand fatigue or the thumb fouls the adjacent buttons. The parcel delivery was swift and too the \u00a335 bonus. thank you very much. Brian H",

I cannot believe that this camera has only lasted two years. I have had canon cameras for nearly 50 years now but it seems that manufacturing standards or design have slipped. Maybe it's time I tried another brand ! Very disappointed.",
