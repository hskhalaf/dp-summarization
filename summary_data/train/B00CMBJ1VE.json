      "text": "Ok, so some of you might be thinking, how does this boat hold up in water. Well this inflatable raft is awesome I have had many hours of enjoyment with this raft and has held strong in lake water. I added an 86lb trolling motor and a total of 2 adults and 2 small children and still have enough room for all our fishing gear and a cooler. This raft is a nice addition to a cheap funfilled day at the lake. It comes with an easy to store bag. My only suggestion is upgrading the air pump and adding wood floors for stability many modification and add-ons can be done to this boat search online for great ideas.",

I take it out on the Chattahoochee river almost every weekend, and it's held up like a champ. I added a few enhancements to her, and she's turned into a pretty sweet boat for being an inflatable. It fits my dog and a fishing buddy no problem. I have both a 30lb and 40lb minn kota motor for it. I initially got the 30, and it works great for ponds and lakes, but I needed the 40lb to get me up stream on the river, which it does flawlessly. Highly recommend this boat.",

I would suggest getting a motor but thats more stuff to drag around with you but if it gets windy, its really hard to row when you are sitting on this air boat. I bought a 12v inflator and it takes about 10 to 12 minutes to make this thing full, it also stores nicely as i fit it just fine in the trunk of my Honda Fit. Only mod i really would suggest is to make a wooden bottom for support, otherwise you wont be able to stand up. Get one, its awesome",

That being said, it held up well during a rocky river adventure with small rapids. The WOOD FLOOR MODIFICATION is a must! Cut some 1/2\" or 3/4\" plywood to fit inside the raft, paint it, and wrap it in some outdoor carpet. Search google and you'll get some ideas. The solid floor makes the raft much more stable and comfortable.",

I did not know about this issue before I bought it. I feel that for what I paid for this raft it should not have any defects. Dont waste your money. I am buying a patching kit but doubt itll help if that bubble blows. Very disappointed with the flaws in this raft.",

I've only had a chance to take it out once with a couple friends of mine but the 3 of us had a blast. We all had plenty of room even with the battery riding shotgun with me.

It has been easy to inflate and doesn't loose air. Even our teenage children can carry and maneuver it. We live on rip rap and it has stood up to going over rocks as well as over the sticks in the river. The seats are comfortable and the oars worked well. We have now invested in an electric motor so that we can go farther. The boat has become a family bonding experience and is especially appreciated during this time.",

However, I ended up not installing the seats at the either end. Because I didn't like that the seat anchors were directly attached to the inflated body without any reinforcement. I didn't want kids pulling on it. Excessive pulls would definitely weaken or rip that area. But without the seats, the seat anchors stick out. Can poke you in the back if not careful... But since you'll be wearing a life vest, it should not bother you.",
