Additionally, it did take considerably longer to receive than what was projected... However, I did order it right before Christmas, so that could have been the problem. Despite these things I would definitely recommend this collar. As far as the scratching and stiffness, I broke it in by flexing it, and put a couple layers of shoe polish on it and it looks fantastic. If you have a general idea how to take care of leather, none of the issues are a deal breaker, and for $30, its totally worth it.",

It's also going to have to have a new hole added. Its stretching even more. Teddy does not use a leash so that's not why it has stretched. This is probably the worst purchase I've ever made on Amazon.",
