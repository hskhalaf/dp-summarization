As I sit up to read, it allows me to maintain comfort in my lower back with my knees elevated, but not too high. It\u2019s really the perfect amount of cushion. I recommend this to all who are unsure, you will love it!",

She had little to no pain after using it for the first night and after a 2 more nights she was waking up with no pain at all. She appreciated that she could take out one of the cushions for more of a comfortable fit and, along with her morning stretches, she was so happy to be rid of that pain in her neck - and so was I :)",
