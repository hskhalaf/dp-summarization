      "text": "This is perfect for creating an emergency kit for your car in case you are really stranded. I was able to put a leatherman, rope, solar/crank-able radio (can charge iPhone too) solar flashlight, a first aid kit, emergency blankets, and emergency fire starter kit. I also plan on adding some food. There are tons of pockets on the outside and it zips close! It's lightweight canvas but sturdy so it easy to carry. It's definitely a great way to carry tools or emergency items in case the world goes crazy! I bought this as a gift for someone at Christmas with the emergency items. Now I plan to buy one for myself!",

Both are about the same price but I decided to try something new. The only drawback is that the mouth of this bag doesn't open as wide as the Craftsman did and it's probably because the Craftsman was an inch (13 in) bigger. It was easier to search in the Craftsman bag. Not a big deal though. My dog loved this bag too since he chewed through one of the handles and a pocket within a week or receiving the bag. I guess it's a great chew toy as well.",

There are pockets inside that help with the organization of the different tools the multi tool can handle. The outside pockets are great for holding general plier's, crescent wrenchs, and other misc tools. Very nice bag for what I wanted it for.",

I will be using this bag for a long time!",

This, as I'm sure you can imagine, is very upsetting for him. I looked for a while, and then stumbled across this. It came, and I'm very impressed. I don't think it would fit a grown-up man's tools, but for my little man, it was perfect. Great quality, too.",
