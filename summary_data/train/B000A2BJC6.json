It does really nice photos. However, it does not work with newer Mac operating systems. They quit upgrading drivers. With a down-loaded third party driver, I can do some text.",

Pros: Separate ink cartridges(& reasonably priced replacements). Prints full bleeds. Reasonably priced. Lots of settings/preferences. Cons: Prints dark. Large/bulky. Doesn't include printer cable.

Each ink cartridge have a computer chip that it will not allow refilling of the tank or use of any non-Canon brand ink cartridge.

I needed a good all around printer that wasn't initially expensive or costly to replace cartridges. I liked the previous Canon printers I've owned because of the quality and cheaper ink tanks. The price was right and the rebate with the purchase of a Canon digital camera was too good to pass up. I've been happy with the overall print quality, but I haven't used it for photo printing.

    "description": "The 9600* x 2400dpi print resolution ensures detailed and vibrant photo lab quality output. Superior quality is achieved by Canon's FINE technology with minute 1pl ink droplets. ContrastPLUS technology with an additional dye based black ink brings extra depth and contrast to photos.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nWhy bother waiting for the photo lab when you can print images that are just as good--or maybe better--at home? The Canon PIXMA iP4200 combines five-color printing with a 1,856-nozzle print head capable of delivering superfine 1-picoliter ink droplets. The result is gorgeously clean, sharp prints delivered into your hands just minutes after you snapped the shot. \n\n Color resolution is as high as 9,600 x 2,400 dpi, with black resolution up to 600 x 600 dpi. Print speeds range up to 29 ppm for monochrome and 19 ppm in color; a borderless 4-by-6-inch photo takes as little as 51 seconds. With the iP4200's automatic two-sided printing, you can easily produce glossy brochures and invitations right from your desktop. Improved ink technology supplies rich black text that offers exceptional resistance to smudges--it even holds up to highlighter pens. (All reported speeds are maximums. Actual speeds will vary.) \n\n With its straightforward USB port, connecting the printer with your computer is a snap; the iP4200 is compatible with both Windows and Macintosh operating systems and includes software tools like Easy-PhotoPrint (Windows/Mac), Easy WebPrint (Windows), and PhotoRecord (Windows). A direct print port allows you to print directly from a PictBridge-compatible digital camera or DV camcorder, with or without your computer. The printer is backed with a one-year limited warranty covering parts and labor. \n\n What's in the Box\niP4200 photo printer, PGI-5BK black ink tank, CLI-8Bk photo black ink tank, CLI-8C cyan ink tank, CLI-8M magenta ink tank, CLI-8Y yellow ink tank, power cord, setup instructions, CD-ROM, Canon photo paper plus 4\" x 6\" glossy sample pack, quick start guide, registration and warranty card; printer cable not included\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe PIXMA iP4200 Photo Printer is a high-performance machine, combining exceptional print quality with advanced convenience features. It delivers a resolution of up to 9,600 x 2,400 color dpi,1 for amazing detail and clarity. To achieve this, Canon Full-photolithography Inkjet Nozzle Engineering (FINE) uses a high-performance 1,856-nozzle print head that ejects precise, consistent droplets as small as 1 picoliter, resulting in beautiful photos with virtually no detectable grain.\n\n Also, the ContrastPLUS 5-color ink system--four dye-based inks and a pigment-based black ink--produces true-life photos with a wide color palette, along with laser-quality text. You'll be amazed at your results.\n\n High performance doesn't stop there. The PIXMA iP4200 Photo Printer can produce a photo lab quality 4\" x 6\" borderless print in about 51 seconds.2 (Actual print speeds will vary.) Its USB 2.0 Hi-Speed interface enables the fastest photo transfers possible from your computer.3\n\n Advanced paper handling and direct photo printing\nWith a dual paper path, you can keep photo paper stored in one tray and plain paper in another. You're always ready to print--no paper switching required. Plus, you can print two-sided to help save on paper costs. And with direct photo printing, you simply connect any PictBridge compatible digital camera or DV camcorder, and print! This PC-free process saves you time and eliminates the need to be tied to your computer.\n\n A system for long-lasting photos\nThe Canon ChromaLife100 system combines the PIXMA iP4200 Photo Printer's FINE print head technology and newly developed inks with select Canon photo papers, with results rivaling that of conventional photos. These beautiful photos will also last up to 100 years when stored in an archival quality photo album.4 And with the new smart LED ink, your LED lamp flashes when ink is running low, and flashes even faster when nearing empty. When you install a new ink tank this smart LED system will even glow to let you know if its not properly installed, making it an ease to use.\n\n Notes:\n\n 1 Resolution may vary based on printer driver setting. Ink droplets can be placed with a horizontal pitch of 1/4800 inch at minimum.\n2 PPM print speeds are based on the highest speed printer driver mode. Photo print speeds are based on the default mode driver setting using Canon Photo Paper Plus Glossy paper. Print speeds will vary depending on system configuration, interface, software, document complexity, print mode, types of paper used and page coverage. Actual speed will vary.\n3 USB 2.0 Hi-Speed requires Windows XP, 2000 or Mac OS X operating systems. For Windows 98, Me and Mac OS X v. 10.2 to 10.2.6 operating systems, the printer will operate at USB 1.1 specifications.\n4 Based on accelerated testing by Canon in dark storage under controlled temperature, humidity and gas conditions, simulating storage in an album with plastic sleeves. Canon cannot guarantee the longevity of prints; results may vary depending on printed image, drying time, display/storage conditions and environmental factors. \n\nSee more",
