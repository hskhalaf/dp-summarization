Setup was ridiculously easy, by far the fastest setup I've experienced short of those twist collapsible pop-up tents. The PVC basin held up, the zipper was not horribly finicky, and the rain fly held. However, when I woke up in the morning, I found water inside the tent along the edges. Apparently, rainwater seeped in through the seams where the sidewalls meet the basin. I will attempt to weatherproof it, but if you're expecting inclement weather soon after getting this, you're in for a rude awakening (literally).",
