Only problem I have is that this cover bleeds through when you wash it. I washed with similar colors and the yellow line bled through to my other clothes and now that line is all over the blanket. Is so disappointing. I was planning on ordering the little hat to go along with this but I don\u2019t think I will anymore.",

I\u2019ve tried using as a nursing cover and if you and baby are still figuring out breastfeeding, this cover is hard to use. It would be easy to use now because I\u2019m more hands free when trying to get baby to latch. But at this point I\u2019ve learned how to wear an under tank to cover my stomach and my breast is covered by my shirt.",

This happened with the first one I purchased and Copper Pearl was very helpful and quickly replaced the item for me at no charge (and were very apologetic too) and we didn't have any issues with that particular one once replaced. Overall, its a lovely product and I'll still use it (with or without holes), just bummed about the material quality and hesitant to purchase more to give as gifts.",

It seriously came in handy so many times when she was asleep in her carseat and we wanted to take her out but wanted her to have a little privacy for sleeping. It is super stretchy, washes well, and fit our car seat perfect. It was also breathable. Would recommend and would probably buy again. The ONLY thing that didn't make sense was using it as a nursing cover, my wife could never get it to fit on comfortably and didn't like it while nursing. She just put a swaddle blanket over her shoulder most of the time.",

I'll definitely be sad when we won't need this anymore and I'll have to find something made from similar material to love on lol.

I carry my newborn around with the cover on EVERYWHERE and I use it to nurse as well. They are just perfect! Pros: Versatility, private/fidget free nursing cover, fun colors, easy to use and take on and off. Cons: Because the fabric is jersey and stretch, it's not very breathable. Kind of a minor complaint, but can make for a sweaty baby if you're using it as a nursing cover. Also fabric is thin so can pinch or rip in certain conditions. Bottom Line: For the price, it can't be beat! I will be buying more.",

It has been so great to have a full coverage cover to use - we've used it on planes, at Disney World, at restaurants. It helps me be super comfortable while nursing my baby. I would highly recommend! The only reason i gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the fabric is a little more see through than I would have expected, but that would be easily remedied by selecting a darker fabric.",

It's so much easier than a blanket because you don't have to worry about the wind blowing or what's showing in back. Was perfect for nursing modestly on the plane. And just recently began using it on the carseat as I bring my baby in and out of stores so the wind/sun doesn't startle her awake. Love it!",
