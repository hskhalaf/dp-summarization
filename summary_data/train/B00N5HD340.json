This is a $5 blade holder and performs like it. - The blade is hard to install, but can be done with a little time. - The handle is pretty heavy compared to the blade holder which gives it a bad balance. - The tip of the blade has a little bit of wiggle to it. - One side of the blade tends to stick out a little more. I was more scared shaving with this than my first straight razor shave. I also got terrible razor burn, although that's user error or bad blades.",

The \"secure cap\" or piece that is supposed to lock the blade from coming undone didn't do that. Overall, I immediately stopped using it and returned it before I hurt myself. Do yourself a favor and skip this one or just go the safer route and get a straight razor that has a slide out loader.",

Most other razor holders over expose the blade making it vulnerable to bending. with this only a sliver of the blade is exposed and the covers hold it tightly in place allowing for precision cuts everytime. One word of advise is to use the pre-cut single edge blades not the double edge blades you have to snap in half. Wont fit right with those.",

The blades can get pushed out while closing it too but that's not too bad. I just carefully push it in once it's closed. The blades that come with it are good for two shaves Max for me. They have a couple stroke break in then run really smooth until they don't all of the sudden. Overall very serviceable shave from the combo.",

Watched a couple videos, read a few articles, bought some decent shave gel and gave it a shot. Hands down the smoothest shave I've ever had. I honestly can't wait to shave now. For a starter set it works great for this newbie. I'll run through the set of blades then pick up a higher quality straight edge.",

It's not as firm as I would like and easy to shift while shaving. Not a big deal though. 5 stars for first use.",

The blades won't do any terrible damage, but they are more prone to nicks the more aggressive they are, and these are very aggressive. As for the shave with this combo, I give this overall package a good, solid B. For a travel blade, this is perfect. For daily use, this is a good replacement, but not my first recommendation.",
