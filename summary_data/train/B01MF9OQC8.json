What a difference this has made the the usability of the broadband in the house - signal's good in every room, and connection is very stable. 2.4ghz works better for us as there's very little interference. Around 6-7 devices connecting at any given point and manages traffic without a blip - the BT hub was very poor in this respect. Worth every penny, we can now use our fttp properly!",

Ports are 100Mbps - but do you really need 1Gb? This replaced an Asus RT-N12E that I never got to work properly with a NanoBeam modem. It has a good solid MIMO WiFi and never needs resetting. Old technology - but reliable performance. Worth every penny. Quick update: Easy to load Tomato offers a better range of features than the standard software and seems to be rock solid.

I can't comment on the WiFi because I don't use it (dedicated Wireless Access Point for that). Performance wise it's coped with everything I've thrown at it so far and not broken a sweat. The 512MB of RAM definitely helps.",

So great for people who are in the know but others will struggle, it took me a few hours to get it going!",
