This is easily the hottest thing I've ever consumed, and it was gaggingly painful for a solid 15 minutes after eating a full piece. I gave this 5 stars because the meat is of high quality, not too much stringiness or excess fat. I know this is perfect for someone who actually appreciates heat (unlike me). I'm sure hotter jerky exists but I don't want to experience the nightmares that follow it, so this will end my journey to the top of the spice rack.",

My photos show the largest of 3 total pieces included in one pack. My recommendation would be to try it at least once and then decide for yourself if the taste is worth the price. I got 3 packs for $24 or whatever and I could easily smash this all in one sitting. I went with the \"seriously spicy\" flavor which was spot on for heat and about in the middle of the pack for what they offer. FYI I eat everything spicy, if u don't I'd go with a milder option.",

When he tried this Jerky, he was very uncomfortable and it definitely got to him. He was very uncomfortable and almost sick for a few days after eating it.

I've had Carolina Reaper wings at a wing challenge in Statesville NC, and while this jerky isn't as hot as those wings were, it will still wreak havoc on your senses.

If u guys have any other flavors u would like me to try just email me( I'll pay for it of course) . I'm always lookin for the spiciest foods so if u have new products I would love to know about them.

However, having tasted all peppers organically (habenaro, ghost, reaper, scorpion), it is clear that the actual peppers were used to spice and flavor the jerky, not just flavoring. Habenaro is great for all day snacking, but I would reserve the ghost through xxx scorpion for special occasions. Pros: Crazy spicy, very flavorful, natural, low sugar, good texture. Cons: Crazy spicy, so not the best snack. I recommend the habenero for an all-day snack, and reserve the ghost and up for spicy occasions.

Paid for it later where my stomach hurt! But it tasted amazing and highly recommend. Would also recommend, even if you can eat spicy, don't eat it all in one sitting like I did. ;) Great flavor, not super salty, and soft!",

That would be my only dislike. My nose was running and it was so worth it. I love spicy! I look forward to trying other flavors. I wish the price was less for so few pieces of jerky. This is a winner, for sure, for jerky lovers. Just beware of the price.",

Quick note: Close your eyes as you take bites, some of the pepper dust can fly straight into them. I am used to paying huge fees for Jerky, I know it's not a cheap food. And I understand this is high-quality stuff. But maybe let your customers know that they're paying $10 for literally 3 pieces of jerky? This is more of a sampler bag than anything else.",

    "description": "Flavor Name:Carolina Reaper| Size:1.8 Ounce (Pack of 1)WHAT MAKES KATIE\u2019S JERKY THE BEST? Do you LOVE homemade jerky & are disappointed when you take a chance on something you found at the gas station? I have not changed my recipe, quality standards, or process from the way I started making jerky 25 years ago! WHAT MAKES OUR PROCESS DIFFERENT? Many things, but one is that WE TAKE OUR TIME. We trim & slice the meat & soak it in the marinade RIGHT AWAY, & that\u2019s where it STAYS for DAYS! Then we put it in the dehydrator & have our experienced jerky experts watch over it until each & every piece has been hand selected, ready to be packaged. WHY DO WE PACKAGE IT THE WAY WE DO? Vacuum packaging removes all of the air from the bag & keeps it fresher. This way we don\u2019t have to add artificial preservatives! It\u2019s the perfect snack. Take a few bites, zip up the bag, & stash it! The protein will help you feel full & the low fat & calories makes it guilt free! WHAT ABOUT OUR MEAT? The meat we use is always high quality! The fat is trimmed so our jerky is minimum 97% fat free. It\u2019s the same quality meat you would be proud to serve to your family & friends! It\u2019s cut with precision so that the slices are consistent, not too thick & not too thin. This allows the jerky to be perfectly tender with the right amount of moisture to hold in the natural meat flavor amidst all of the other seasonings. WANT TO KNOW HOW KATIE\u2019S JERKY HANDLES FLAVORS? BIG! The first flavor you will ALWAYS get is MEAT! After that, it\u2019s whatever the package says, & a LOT of it! Our recipes are honed to perfection, & when you find the perfect flavor for you, the challenge will be trying to make it last! Why fight it? Multiple Flavors Available. SATISFACTION GUARANTEE: If you are not completely satisfied, we will REPLACE or refund your order. Customer service is our top priority! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? ADD THIS TO YOUR CART NOW!",
