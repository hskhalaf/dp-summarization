I could have changed the one end but not the main line that went to gas tank. The cost of the filter was great if it worked. This fuel filter just did not work for me. I am sure it is a good filter, not for my John Deere LA135. So, i am out the cost of the filter! Guess I won't try to cut corners next time.",

Changed blades, drive belt, mower belt, oil, oil filter, spark plugs, fuel filter and air filter. Bought everything except belts, which I had bought a couple of years ago, on amazon. Everything fit perfect like OEM. Most importantly after taking everything apart and putting it back together no leftover parts and the mower still worked and drove around!!!",

It gets 5 stars because of the price and overall value. But I didn't do any great scientific studies or anything. Just know that it seems to work perfectly and is a great value. And really, you ought to change these little boogers every once in awhile.",

This forced me to either stretch the fuel line to try to make it fit or replace a section of fuel line. Since I had some fuel line on hand, I choose the latter. Might not be a problem depending on the amount of slack in your fuel line but it was with my engine (B&S 22HP twin).",
