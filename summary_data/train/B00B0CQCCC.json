I get the \"DNS could not be found\" way too often and a few seconds, \"no internet.\" Sometimes it happens up to 10-15 times a day. I've read other reviews with people having the same issue. I would have to constantly disconnect and reconnect to the wifi. Unplugging the router and plugging it back in doesn't help. AAAHHHHHHHHHHH!! I never have this issue when I'm at school, friends' places, or other coffee shops. But home, the god damn router is a piece of crap. Doesn't matter how close I am to it. -_-",

After several troubleshooting attempts, I stopped using It and went back to my dependable old router. Last week I decided to give it another try. This time, however, I searched the support website for a firmware update and installed the latest one. I then installed it as usual and it has been running without issues for several days. The signal is strong on both bands and I am now very happy with this purchase. I would rate it 5 stars save for the initial issues. Hopefully this helps some of you with similar issues.",

Just open the website that comes with the paperwork, and start configuring. VERY IMPORTANT: his model has two distinct signals to connect to. Some routers just combine them into one signal, but this one does not. The only thing to remember with this is to configure BOTH the 2.4 AND the 5ghz signals. Give them the same password, and your life will get easier when you're frantically trying to connect to either network signal.",

The instructions were cryptic but manageable - they left me in a spot that was confusing but once I realized I needed to go to the TrendNet website things got brighter. We were hoping to increase our wifi range enough to set on the back porch - didn't make it. The range of routers seem to be quite inflated by the manufacters. Overall, we feel we made an improvement in speed for our iPad which makes us happy. Parting advice - do your research before purchasing.",

I went and got a Netgear R6300 and for a couple more dollars I got an amazing piece of equipment that I have had no issues with and the options are out of this world!",
