Setup was simple, I don't use the manual to setup, its that easy. printing forms and checks have been outstanding. Its quiet, very fast and hold alot of paper in the tray. Don't let the word compact fool you, their idea of compact is different then canon's, but in a good way. It does not feel cheap, its actually a little heavy and twice the size of my cheap canon compact printer. Overall I would recommend for a good office type printer.",

They escalated the issue to the department who turned off the firewall on F-Secure PSB anti-virus program and sent an invoice for $150. I find it unfair and frustrating. The second issue is that the toner cartridge that was sent with the printer barely printed 100 copies and had to be replaced. Only one page at the time can be copied or scanned because there is no auto-feeder on this printer. I would not recommend this printer to anybody for any kind of use.",

It's a bit clunky and suffers from connection issues, but I can usually get it to work. The real issue is scan size. It cuts off the edges of a letter sized document. So if you have anything close to edge, within 3mm, it will cut it off. I tried reducing copy size, but it doesn't seem to work, and there is no reduction for scanning. If anyone has a fix for this... please let me know.",

Perhaps I have to slow down and let it rest a bit after each couple pages, which is ok for my application but could be annoying if you need to print a lot.",

Cons- I hated trying to get it to connect to the computer and print. It does not wake up on it's own out of sleep mode.
