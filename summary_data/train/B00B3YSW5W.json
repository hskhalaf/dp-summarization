It may not take DSLR quality photos but they are nearly so and more than good enough for everyday shooting and this thing fits in your pocket along with a 20x lens!!!!! What matters in digital cameras most is the glass (lens) they use. This Leica is fantastic and compact. If you are considering this camera along with others I would say you can't go wrong with the ZS30! I will add more info and some example images latter.",

      "text": "I bought the Lumix DMC-ZS30 to replace my older ZS20. The camera has many features that are important for prosumer photographers. It has a 30 times zoom range, RAW capability, GPS, a viewfinder for more stable photography and a Leica zoom system. I am retired and a serious photographer but often I prefer to carry a compact camera. The GPS is especially nice when traveling in Europe or areas in which I am not familiar. I really appreciate the addition of the RAW capability as the quality of the photos is much better.",

Its anti-shake mode is wonderful. On a recent vacation, I was on a tour bus, shooting one-handed and I still got some good shots. It also has a very fast start up and recovery time. At the same time, it is good for more artistic work. My only wish is that it had an external battery charger, so that I don't have to plug in the camera to charge the battery. (I did get three extra batteries for my trip and that worked well.)",

The 20x zoom was less than many of the others but it's plenty enough for most purposes. I wanted manual capability but thus far have not even used it as it does quite well in intelligent mode. I've only had it a month so I'm looking forward to learning how to use the more in-depth features over time. Bang for the buck - it Rocks!",

Personally, I don't think such a shutter is necessary, unless there's something I don't understand about its purpose. At any rate, the shutter should be improved so as not to malfunction. Having said this, I can unreservedly recommend the camera per se.",

This camera does it all and on top of that if you are a very experienced photographer the camera has great manual setups as well.",

The Leica lens on the Lumix is great, but I don't see much difference between 12 megapixels on the Canon and the 18 megapixels the Lumix is supposed to have. All of the wifi connectivity and other bells and whistles are more trouble than they're worth. without the Leica lens I'd only give it 1 star.",

    "title": "Panasonic DMC-ZS30K Lumix DMC-ZS30 Digital Camera, Compact (Black)",
    "description": "The Panasonic LUMIX DMC-ZS30 digital camera (Black) is a versatile, high-quality compact camera with a 20x optical zoom lens, manual exposure control, Wi-Fi connectivity and touch-control LCD screen. Its 18. 1MP MOS sensor and new Venus engine image processor provide low-noise images, accurate colors and fast performance and its 20x optical zoom lens stretches from ultra wide-angle to super-telephoto lengths for a wide range of shooting applications. This Leica DC VARIO-ELMAR lens offers the 35mm equivalent focal length of a 24-480mm lens with a maximum aperture of f/3. 3 at the wide-angle end. This aperture is wide enough to capture low light action and the camera's hybrid optical image stabilization will compensate for camera shake to provide clear photos and videos when shooting at the telephoto lengths that this lens offers. If you need to reach a bit further, a 40x intelligent digital zoom feature is also available. Aspherical and extra-low dispersion lens elements and Nano surface coating minimize aberrations and flaring for sharply rendered images. full HD 1080P video recording with built-in stereo sound is supported by the ZS30 and a dedicated one-touch button will take you instantly from photo mode to video. You can also shoot still images while recording a video without cutting the video. Slow- and fast-motion video and multiple lower resolution recording is also possible and 5-axis correction minimizes blurring across the entire shooting range. A 3. 0\" 920K-dot touch-control LCD screen is provided for composition and playback. You can control autofocus, zoom, shutter and playback with simple gestures on the touch-screen. It also features an auto level gauge to keep your images straight.",
