I feel like I wasted my money with this product, as I don't want my house smelling like cat pee... and even after washing it... and bringing it back in... still smells like cat pee and they just pee on it again.",

We had the box without a lid or mat for a while and often had to sweep. Ever since getting both, we haven't had issues with litter being everywhere. This may very much captures the littler the cats bring out, and I'm definitely glad we got it. It's far easier to pick it up and swish it in the trash than it is to sweep every day (which honestly defeats the purpose of a self cleaning letterbox a bit, huh?)",

      "text": "A wonderful \"catcher\" for inside the doggy door. No more gravel on my laminate flooring or on my bed. Even with the rain storms, no mud puppy feet or moisture. It is a perfect size even for my 65 lb dog and , unlike mats in the past, he doesn't feel the need to drag it out the door. This is a winner.",
