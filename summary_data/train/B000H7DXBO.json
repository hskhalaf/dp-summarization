Contacted manufacturer and was told that they do not stand behind the product if sold by Amazon, Ebay or Walmart, because they are not authorized dealers. They would not back the warranty and said that they have many problems with products not being rotated or charged soon enough if bought elsewhere. Luckily, Amazon is amazing and stood behind the product. Save your time, money and headaches and buy a different battery.",

It really is no big deal and the electrolyte comes in a plastic tube assembly that made filling easy. The tube assemble slides into the holes on top of the battery, press firmly down to break the seal and let drain. Remove the tubes, add the sealant strip and you are done.",

Just firmly click the container into place and it drains it perfectly for you. MAKE SURE TO INSPECT THE BATTERY FOR DAMAGE BEFORE PUTTING IN THE ACID. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because my first battery came damaged. They did not package it properly at all and I did not inspect it so it started leaking acid. So I had to call Amazon and they sent a free replacement. This battery is $130 at the dealer compared to the price here which is about half. Highly reccomend!",

Filled the battery, and charging it now. It's the exact same battery, and the OEM has lasted 7 years with a snow plow. I hope this one serves me as well as the OEM !!!!",
