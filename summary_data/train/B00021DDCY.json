However, the last two times I've purchased the Smudge Pots on Amazon (most recently from the seller: The Beauty Box), they have been dried out and flaky. That's no good. I'll have to buy these @ Sephora to make sure I'm getting a fresh product, because they do tend to dry out after a couple of months even if you do get a good/fresh batch.",

I use an flat tipped eyeliner brush to tap it on rather than using a stroking motion, then I use a cotton swab to smudge and blend the color.

As others have mentioned, it does dry out eventually, but it lasts for months so I just buy a new one when that happens.",

It looks sharp and clean all day, applies easily to both top and bottom lid, and glides on even more smoothly than the pen.

This is very hard to apply with the glitter in it. Unlike the black one, it doesn't just glide on. I was disappointed because the color looks so cool. If you have a good brush it will still work. Just take a lot of effort and not as sleek or crisp as the plain black colour from this company. In the future I won't buy this style but I still love this brand.",
