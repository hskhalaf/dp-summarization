HOWEVER, when I tried to put it close to a standardized radiation source with 3000 cpm (one typically used for industrial Geiger Counters), it did not even react to it!!! If the manufacturer will get to me and explain or direct me what I did wrong, I would be more than happy to change the review. Right now, I am not confident if the device really works.",

I feel better with this device sitting quietly in the corner, with its alarm set to five times normal background. Update: Here it is with my sister's Terra rad detector, both sitting on the same pack of radioactive TIG rods. At these low doses, radiation is inherently random, which is probably why the readings fluctuated by about ten percent over time. Nonetheless, the two machines agreed closely enough that I couldn't tell which one read consistently higher. The simplest explanation is that both detectors work properly.",

Meter subsequently shut off at 80% battery charge. Meter had recorded readings from 7 months ago. Perhaps it was previously used, charged to 80%, returned, stored 6 months, sold to me? The meter stopped working after recording 255 counts per minute, while sitting at my residence where previous readings averaged 26-36 com. Portable, rechargeable, inexpensive, recording accumulated counts/dose. If I could get it replaced with one that had a good manual and all the features worked I would be very happy!",

Although the case and general look do seem to be \"cheap\" the reality is that this just makes the unit light weight, and since you own a Geiger counter for that rare event, light weight means you'll have it with you. The menu is intuitive. Lots of options. No CPS mode, but CPM is fine for a unit like this. Will measure in all the popular units. Great backlight. The battery is rechargeable, but also looks like a standard AA in a clip inside, so I suspect it is readily replaceable should the need arise. Very satisfied.",

      "text": "We were extremely disappointed in both the geiger counter and the customer support to address a number of issues. The CD that accompanied the product would not load. The literature that accompanied the product referenced websites to obtain a user manual, none of the websites could be accessed. The home page for the product lacked any means to downloading a user manual. When we tried to contact the company by phone, we could not get anyone to answer - we made repeated calls and still no one answered. The product may be good, but with the lack of support and instructions, we would not recommend it. We returned it for a refund.",

There were a lot of scary reports floating around on the internet, so I ordered this to see for myself. I'm no expert in radioactive readings, but I found this meter to be east to use and well made. The clicking noise is eerie, like something straight out of a movie. I'm happy I bought it, because the readings never went crazy and neither did I.",
