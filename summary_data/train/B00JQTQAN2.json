It ran out of memory on a high quality scan but OK results with medium scan. I don't know why anyone hasn't thought of a scanner mouse before. The included software is OK but I found that some additional editing of the images was required using another software package.",

The choices are so clear. Finally I can scan old photos in albums and other items that would be difficult if not impossible to place in a scanner or run through a scanner. The hand motions in using the scanner take a little getting used to, but in no time, I felt comfortable using it.",
