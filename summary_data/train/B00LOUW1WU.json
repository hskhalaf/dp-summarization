      "text": "I recently purchased the Pure Pulse device as a means of alternative pain relief. I have fibromyalgia, as well as rotator cuff tendinitis and wanted something that wasn\u2019t a pill. I had purchased the Pure Enrichment heating pad for a relative and they really liked the quality so when I saw a well priced and portable TENS unit, I decided to try it. I have used it primarily on my shoulders and legs. It works! I like that there are specific programs and that I can adjust the intensity. The adhesive pads do not irritate and keep their stickiness. I highly recommend this product!",

Been using the IcyHot brand TENS unit for a while....although it works its just not strong enough and no control of it, just on/off. Well this one has plenty of settings and can work on 2 areas at the same time instead of one. Several different pulse settings and is very strong....only comes with 4 pads but plan on placing an order soon to get additional pads.....Satisfied with the purchase at a great price.",

I want to like this product but it's not a pleasant feeling at all. I bought some conductive gel so I will try that later.

Just two pieces of advice: Avoid repositioning the pads while the thing is turned on - fingertips are much too sensitive for contact with the \"live\" side of the pad. Also, if you feel a stinging sensation on your skin, it means that the pads aren't making proper contact. In that case simply reapply or add a tiny amount of conductive gel, or apply light pressure with your fingers.",
