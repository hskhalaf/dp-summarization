Battery life isn't great but the sound quality is, you can improve by turning off the lighting on the device. The biggest issue I have is that overall the volume is too low, you can hear too much external noise while using. Recommended, but the volume is too low gor general gaming. This is due to an EU directive rather than the manufacturer but it does mean that you can hear too much external noise.",

The battery lasts really long. The microphone is really good in my opinion. The headset does have some RGB, and if you want to reduce battery usage of your headset I suggest you turn the RGB off. There are also some buttons that you can use as macro keys, and there's a volume control on the back of the headset. Overall, a well-designed headset by Logitech.",

The keybindings for the buttons on Ghub is great and the mic quality is pretty good too never had complaints, its nice i can just lift the mic up to mute it instead of pressing a button. The wireless also doesn't affect the latency so no problems there. I recommend you turn the RGB off to save the battery as its pretty pointless on the back.",

Installed the drivers on a fresh windows install after upgrading my rig and it just stopped working. Every 10 minutes I'm having to restart my audio drivers- rendering it pointless for gaming or streaming. It would also emit a loud screeching noise whenever the driver crashed and caused damage to my ears. Do NOT recommend if you have sensitive ears or ASD like me. As I stream full time I need a reliable headset. Submitted a ticket but it seems a lot of people are having the same issue which Logitech doesn't seem to be addressing.",

Bottom line, Logitech have used some incredibly cheap components along with unshielded wiring which scrapes along a PCB as you move the microphone up and down. It's basically luck of the draw as to whether or not this will cause problems but in troubleshooting it seemed to be a common issue. It could all be avoided for about 10\u00a2 of better wire. Shame because they sound fantastic and they're really comfortable.",
