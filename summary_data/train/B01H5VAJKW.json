We were well within the weight limits for our airline (fully packed it weighed 45 lbs). We missed the return window by 1 day so now we're stuck with it. I thought I was buying a quality suitcase!

I do not speak to the quality of the bag, because I found another suitcase locally that fell within the limitations set by the airline.",
