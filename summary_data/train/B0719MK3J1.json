      "text": "This bakers rack was exactly what I was looking for to expand storage and counter space in my small kitchen. I am 6' 4\" so it was a little too short for me out of the box, but I purchased 2 of the the 2-pack Seville 72\" shelving poles (each pole is 2 x 36\" poles). This made the cutting board counter top height (36\") and put the top shelf right at 72\", which was a perfect height for me. I also added a magnetic knife strip to the left side of the hanging bar to keep my knives close but out of the way. I attached the knife strip using two small screws, lock nuts, and 30 mm washers.",

Better for storage or as a microwave stand due to the max height of the board. Very attractive, easy to assemble (takes a little time and a choice word or two if you're alone, but it's still easy), and the board is nice quality. Leveling feet are awesome! Definitely gonna get more hooks, and just might consider sacrificing actual counter space for the microwave because a decently-sized unit (1.6 cu ft) will take up the majority of a shelf, and I'd prefer not to stoop to use it on a lower shelf.
