To hold the water in, we have to prop something heavy against that one side. I wish I would've sent it back right away. I would not recommend this pool. One positive it has is that the drain valve is on the bottom, making for easy drainage.",

Kept air, drained fine, no issues. I drained it and cleaned it. It got over-filled once and it hasn't been right since. The bottom ring keeps deflating so before my kids can get in it I have to keep adding air and since I'm using a manual pump it's a bitch to do. I can't find a hole anywhere so I'm guessing a seam has a pinhole tear in it which means this pool will be going the way of Old Yeller after this summer.",

Don't keep this thing in one place for more than a day or two or it will kill the grass underneath. All in all a good value for the money & enjoyment.",

We cannot return it anymore since that window closed on June 19th so we're throwing it away. Please do not throw YOUR money away for this seriously inferior product.

Since the pool was bought before the swimming season started, by the time it was set up it was outside the Amazon return window. I was told to contact Intex, which I did. They informed me that there was NO warranty on this product. What kind of company offers no warranty for a defective product? I will never purchase anything from this company again.",

I can sit in it and lean on the edge without water pouring out over the edge. I have tried SO MANY inflatable pools, and this one is, by far, my favorite. This year's model also comes with a drain plug in the corner of the floor, which is a good addition. I highly recommend this pool for hot summer days!",

You lose that in the actual swim area of the pool. So the actual swim area is less 20 inches from the 103\u00d7 69 measurement. We purchased for my 2 yr old granddaughter who loves to swim, thinking she would be able to practice with her kick board. It is 22inches deep so she will have fun playing.
