But this particular shipment performed very poorly and uncharacteristically. I used it 5 times and in each case, the top coat cracked on top and you were able to peel most of the entire base/color/top coat off in every case. This has never happened before now. I ended up buying another one from a salon and I received the former result - a top coat that never once cracked or peeled and has stayed on now for over a week. The one I bought through Amazon is clearly counterfeit.",

Now when I use the top coat, every time I dip the brush in the bottle it leaves with a stringy residue. It like using a glue gun, that same kind of stringy residue that leaves the gun when you stop using it. It's too thick to paint an even coat. I tossed it in the trash. Not worth it.",

The Ridge Filler does create a protective layer on your nails so they feel less likely to bend and break but I don't think my nails ever ACTUALLY got thicker. The formula for this sheer, milky white polish is easily malleable and leaves a nice, glossy finish, which I like. Just wish it did what it says it does.",

I was able to do 1 drop per nail and got about 500 drops out of the bottle. I change my polish every 2 or 3 days, so I got 3 months use out of this bottle. But if you only do your nails once a week, this bottle will last you a whole year. So depends on the person. Stocked up on it while it was 4$ a bottle with free shipping. I would advise you to do the same if you change your polish and do nail art regularly. Very good product!",

Tired of having to touch up chips on your nails every other day, try OPI top coat. First after polishing with a solid color; then 2 thin coats of top coat; then one more coat next day.",

The days I have to do a lot of blood draws and end up with alcohol all over my hands a lot the top coat will ware away by the end of the day but the polish underneath stays intact and I'm able to go home and apply a fresh top coat. I used to have ruined nails after one day of being at work. Now I can keep the same manicure for a week or more!",

I did not have a top coat to compare so I bought this one to see if it is better then cheaper ones I have purchased. I find it to be the same, I do like the brush OPI uses but I'm not sure I would pay more money for a brush, I rather buy more polish lol, just saying",
