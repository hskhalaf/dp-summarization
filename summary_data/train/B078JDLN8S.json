And I wouldn't wear any other kind because it always rubbed off throughout the day, and I don't know I'm just not a huge fan of having mascara all over my face. But I bought this because I figured it was worth a shot, and even though it isn't water-proof, it STAYS. All day! And I have pretty long eyelashes, so usually I get black marks under my eyebrows, but not with this mascara! Plus my lashes are very soft! Not stiff at all. I highly recommend it!",

It only washes off about 50% and comes off in flakes when washing (using the same cleanser as I did before). I have to finish with an oily remover. It never did that before, so I'm assuming it was a change of formula. This is still a fantastic mascara in every other way, but the washability was one of the reasons I bought this over other products. They need to remove the \"washable\" labeling.

This happens a lot throughout the day and I need something that can stand up to that. The \"soft\" aspect of the mascara is not just in the name.
