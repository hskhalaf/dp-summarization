Alot of people are complaining that the unit burnt out after trying to crush frozen fruit or make cookie dough. It is important to note that on the first page of the manual it specifically says not to do this, along with some other things to avoid. Its unfortunate this product is receiving negative reviews for reasons it simply wasnt designed to do. So far ive used it to make kimchi marinade, worked great!",

It has a weird little knob on the TOP of the back of the machine that requires you to grip it with your fingers and/or palm. It was extremely difficult to control, because, and yes, I will admit this, I'm over 60 years. My hands do not work as good as they used to and I found the process to be painful and uncomfortable. There were no grip points, like a raised knob to control it. So much for a fashionable change in an old product. Give me a button to push!",

I couldn't find it at first and then it started showing up everywhere again! It's cone-shape makes it soooo easy and comfortable to hold on to lock and unlock the bowl and to operate right from the top instead of searching for buttons below (for us arthritis sufferers especially). The whole unit is more compact, lightweight, and easier to find a storage space for! It performs very well and I use it all the time. It makes life in the kitchen so much easier!",

It's a pain to clean like all the other processors (so I make my kid clean it), and yes...it will even shut itself off if I forget that I shouldn't open the lid while its running. It's a decent little food processor, nothing more. I've abused this thing for months, forgotten to clean it out for a day (or two), etc etc, and it's still odor and damage-free. I even use it to prep fermented hot sauces with all sorts of acids and chilies and the poor little appliance suffers from no staining. Would recommend to others.",

I chop nuts, shred lettuce, slice veggies... you name it. It is really easy to clean as well. The pieces pull off very easily and wipe clean without any hard to reach places.

Also the picture on the box showed measurement marks that we're not on the bowl. The only mark was max liquid mark which was at about 2 cups. Sending it back today.",

The on/off knob, as others have mentioned, is tricky to use unless it and your hands are completely dry. Slightly hazardous is the fact that there is only a very small piece of plastic (also slippery when wet) to hold onto in order to remove the slicing blade. Resorting to trying to get it off by holding it by the edges or sliding a fingernail under the slicing section (I do it but won't recommend it) or turning it upside down are about the only ways to remove it. Care must be taken to unlatch the bowl for removal.",

Overall, I enjoy it. Oh, the plastic cover is a little breakable. Someone dropped ours and it cracked, but supergluing it together did the trick and still works fine.",

Not worth it to me, I risk getting the same low quality product and doing this all over again. BAD PURCHASE.",

Hamilton Beach stepped up to plate and delivered. I have used it to grate and shred cheese, grind nuts and seeds, and make salsas. It did it all effortlessly. I only gave it four stars because it is still just a 30 dollar machine and I am sure it is limited as compared to the more expensive models, but if you need basic food processing (minus the expense) then this is your machine. It also cleans very easily without a hundred separate pieces to dismantle and wash.",
