My smoke alarm began blaring and I jumped up to find 6-foot high flames shooting up into the air from the air purifier location. I managed to grab my phone and a pair of pants, and run out into the yard to call 911. My house is not even habitable now. How ironic that this device says it gets rid of smoke odors. My whole house smells of smoke now, with soot everywhere. I should have just lived with the pet odors. :-(",

I usually have to dust at least every few days (usually only do it once a week though) and my room seems less dusty in general. I'm very impressed with this machine.

If a tiny piece of dust drifts within 2 or 3 inches, the cleaner will grab it, but it won't catch much of anything that's visible to the naked eye or that falls more than 5 inches away.

I don't think it's defective - just cheaply made. May just take it to work so they can use it in a louder environment, but in my opinion it certainly could not be used in rooms that require quiet (bedrooms, nurseries, TV rooms, etc).

Honestly, for the price of it, I am not impressed. However, if it ever goes to a half off, I may buy another just for peace of mind that something is better than nothing.

It is way quieter than I expected, especially after researching product reviews (videos) from other buyers. the air feels fresh in my room after leaving it on for even just a couple minutes. I wanted something to help with the dust and any bacteria/germs that may be floating around in the air in my small room. I often get sick and worry about possible mold in my old house and this has helped me tremendously. I wake up without a stuffy nose or a dry/scratchy throat.",
