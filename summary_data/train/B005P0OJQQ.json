      "text": "This is now my favorite knife! I love that it is a little more hefty than most commercial stamped knives. The blade is very, very sharp, so those that are used to a dull blade are going to need to be VERY careful at first. There handle is wide, and it has a great ribbed section where your thumb and fingers go (if you hold the knife the CORRECT way). I love the fact that it is so affordable--to the point that it is disposable when you drop it or if someone accidentally puts it in the sink. I absolutely recommend this knife! Questions? Let me know. Helpful? Let me know!",

I stumbled across this Mercer knife on Amazon. Its cost was less than $3, but it was very well reviewed. It turns out to be a small miracle. It's made of top-grade cutlery steel and is delivered literally razor sharp. It holds that edge quite well. Value, defined as quality divided by cost, is extremely high. I'd recommend Mercer knives without reservation if they're all like this little paring knife that was priced so low as to be almost free.",
