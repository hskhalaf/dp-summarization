      "text": "As other reviewers said, maybe not the most expensive quality stuff in bag, but really just what you need. I do not believe putting it together yourself makes it cheaper, certainly procrastinators will never get around to it. I really wanted the radio and phone charge and hope that works, cause its worth the price of admission. This was delivered quickly and will serve as a base for our needs. I will add our personal items, clothes etc. but I feel comfortable relying on this backpack and its contents if we are left \"out in the cold\" in an emergency.",

      "text": "Great beginner emergency kit. For the money you can't beat it. There are a few things I added to mine. IE. Knife, 2 crank 2-way radio's with full scanner, radio and light, extra MRE's (Meals ready to eat.) and water purification tablets as well as a basic EMT triage kit. This bag comes with plenty of room to add extra items. I recommend putting in anything bright RED or ORANGE to signal for help if needed (plastic bags work great). Also a signal mirror it a good item to add as well.",
