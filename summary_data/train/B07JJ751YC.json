First request from the kids was fries and they came out crispy on the outside and soft on the inside just like fries should be. We also tried the skewers with marinated vegetables - we had to read the manual to figure how to put the cage together, but we figured it out. All in all it was a great buy and I'm sure this air fryer will be used often in our kitchen.",
