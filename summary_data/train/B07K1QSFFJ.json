I have it set up with our Christmas tree and it\u2019s even on a schedule so it comes on in the evening and turns off when I go to bed! Or I can just say \u201cAlexa, turn off the Christmas Tree and within one second she does it!!",

The set up was very easy through the Smart Life app. Although i had to first turn off \"smart connect\" setting of my router so i can connect my phone to the 2.4ghz network. Added the devices to alexa app and now I can control the switches with my voice, YAY! The only gripe i have is the night light feature cannot be disabled, and it's actually not very sensitive. I had to take a flashlight and shine it directly at the sensor within 10\" for night light to turn off. So the light stays on 24/7--annoying, and a waste of electricity.",

Then I saw the box said to use Smart Life instead, which I downloaded, installed and registered for, which detected the switch. Then I realized there was no dawn or dusk function.

The nightlight is a great added bonus, turning off when light is detected and dimly lighting when it becomes dark. Additionally, it excels in functioning as a smart switch, giving amazing manual and distant control. The two buttons located on the face of the switch make it easy to control and the Smart Life App makes it accessible to control and to create schedules based on your needs. Overall, this switch is an amazing addition to any smart home, making it an amazing product for the future of tech.",

I have the plug in my garage under my miter saw so the light is blocked by the plugs, wires and legs of the saw.

I have four of these plugs and they all seem to re-connect easily after moving the plug or power outage. The power usage accuracy does vary from plug to plug with the same item plugged in.
