      "text": "After close to a year of nearly daily use (>500 cycles on the counter), the Jar developed an intermittent leak through the bottom seal. I submitted a Warranty Claim through Blendtec's user-friendly website and received a replacement Jar within about 10 business days. I would like to emphasize that this transpired HASSLE-FREE. This is how all companies should stand behind their warranties! In my opinion, this is a well-engineered, robustly constructed product. Blender Jar bottom seals are inherently a weak point - regardless of manufacturer. To their credit, Blendtec at least provides a long warranty period on their jars and blenders.",

Granted, I use it exclusively for smoothies, but it produces a drink that tastes like a milk shake it is so smooth. I used my friend's Blendtec recently and noted she is close to 5,000 smoothies.

Smoothies are so much better than with my old blender, great consistency and just plain easy to use and clean. The WildSide container appears to work better than the Four Side version that my sister has with her Blendtec. The last thing that I really appreciate about the Blendtec is that it fits under my cabinets, a huge advantage over some of the other units.",

In addition, the top did not fight tightly, and it would become lose and leak during blending. Didn't actually fly off, but only because I stood next to the blender with my hand on top.",
