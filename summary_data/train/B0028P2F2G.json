No matter how many times my husband tried to mount it on the wall it was not secure! We decided to cut out a small piece of wood (from the craft store), and cut it to fit the mounting bracket, then my husband mounted it on the wall, and then mounted the shelf bracket onto the wood, which gave the mounting a much firmer base. I bought three of these shelves, and will be mounting them all this same way! I hope this tip helps others who want the shelf to be mounted securely!",

So I went to Lowe's this morning & bought a shelf bracket for extra support (see 2nd pic).I was not confident when installed this shelf bcuz of the design flaw. There was not enough support and it was leaning down. But it lasted 3 yrs. First review 2016 Very nice shelves, I love the design but like other customer complaints... I don't like how it can't be screwed up against the wall, it leaves a gap on the top screws. I'm not comfortable putting too much weight on it.",
