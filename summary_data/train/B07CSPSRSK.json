I have neuropathy and making an effort to lose weight doing water aerobics but all the jumping and walking/running even in the water was painful and balance was hard to keep in the bare feet. Now that is over!!! The shoes give very excellent support to the foot along with softer shock to the foot. 5lbs gone since I got them. They stay on the foot no slipping off and NO PAIN!!!",

I had to return those because I felt they might slip off in the water. They were just a tad bit loose and I have wide feet. So if you get a slip on shoe I suggest going down a half size. Over all SO FAR they feel comfortable and I love how they look. I won\u2019t really test them out completely until July during our trip to Maui. I\u2019ll post more then.",

The redish rashes are in the area that covered by the top portion of the shoes. The skin is fine outside of the covered area. Obviously it's from the shoe material. A very useful product for the beach, but the material is not safe. I googled it, poor shoe materials can potentially give your rash and it's considering unsafe. Having said that, your skin might be thicker than my mother's... Still, be careful when you buy.",

No worries; they stretch just enough at the top to pull on to my feet. (I wear a 7M women's shoe, so can't say if someone with a very wide foot would have issues with this.) Seem well made, and the sole has good traction in the pool. I'll probably order another pair soon, though, because I like to rotate my swim shoes as I do swimsuits. (I work out in a public pool that gets heavy doses of chlorine, which is very hard on fabrics.)",

Small stones also get wedged in the holes in the bottom and you have to stop pick them until you can get them unstuck. My shoes still need to be dried overnight on the balcony of a hotel room. I dropped to a 4 rating only based on comfort level I experienced with these on. If I was rating for practical I would honestly drop to a 3.",

The shoes were comfortable for walking and climbing and transitioned well in water. Once out of the water, the shoes dried remarkably fast. I didn't even notice the wetness once I was out of the water, and actually forgot that they had been wet . Great shoe. The next day I wore them out walking and my feet were not sore at the end of the day. Very pleased!",

A lot of water shoes give absolutely no support and I needed something to keep my feet stable. I also needed a wide toe box or a roomy toe box. The shoes were inexpensive, but not cheap and provided the minimum amount of support I needed. The toe box was generous and the lacing part was comfortably snug and adjustable, which was also nice, really a great buy.",
