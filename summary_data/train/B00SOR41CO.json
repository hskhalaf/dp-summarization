      "text": "I'll agree with the other reviews on this item. The machines itself is decent and the xy table is great. The bits that come with the machine are horrible. They are poorly machined and make an incredible amount of noise, don't eject well and overheat quickly. I already broke one and was using it in a very reserved manner due to my concerns about the noise and overheating.... I would buy better bits immediately. Overall I'm happy with the machine as it meets my needs for now.",

If you are new to a mortiser like I was, I strongly recommend that you Google mortisers and watch a few of the videos on setting-up and using mortiser machines. There are some great ones out there. The documentation says nothing about how to make sure that the chisels are square and while it refers to spacing the chisel above the auger, neither the manual or email support is of any use in figuring out what spacing to use for hard or soft woods. There are resources out there that do that but you are left to your own devices to find them.",
