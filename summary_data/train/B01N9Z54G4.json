Just make sure to use a moisturiser after you use this. This is extremely drying to your skin! I only use this once every other week because of how powerful this stuff Is! It's not easy to mix with water either. It comes out clumpy. I mix it with a little olive oil and acv/water mix. Pure acv is way too strong for me and burns my eyes just having it close to my face.",

I did use it this week with a recipe for hair and another for my face. I was happy with the results, but it's a messy endeavor! Not fault of the product, beauty is just messy sometimes lol! Nice item, will buy again but this will last me awhile with the generous size.",

I also mix this with activated charcoal and it has dried out my pimples and zits within days. I usually do it twice a week and its a life saver. This bottle is pretty big so this will last you a while and since it's so much you can also use not just for the face. Really inexpensive for so much product that is always a plus for me. Overall great product, great price and I will definitely recommend and purchase again. Thank you for this product",

I normally don't have any problems with the skin on my face, but lately I have had breakouts and after just the first use it significantly reduced the swelling of a large pimple on my cheek. Please note that because of mixing it with vinegar it did irritate my eyes even though I didn't put the mask near my eyes. Afterwards, your face will be very red and blotchy, but this does go away after about 30 minutes. I wouldn't use this on your face everyday and feel free to just put it on problem areas. Definitely works quick and leaves your skin baby soft!",
