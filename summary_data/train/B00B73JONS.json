It was on my patio table, under a pergola during a little rain we had. Not immersed, just some rain. The right lens is totally ruined with water inside. Customer service and supposed warranty?? Who knows? Nobody at their customer service. On automation for 2 hours and still waiting. You can get your kicks on route 66. Total nonsense. Should have known, in spite of the accolades, this product is made in China and is a piece of garbage and there is no company to back it up.",

I wanted to replace my ageing binoculars, and Amazon's price for these was unbeatable--even a greater bargain than suggested by the Cornell Lab review. The review was correct. The images are the usual Celestron quality. The binoculars are relatively light-weight, the field of focus is excellent, especially for bird-watching, the adjustments are easily accomplished, and the lens covers and case are very utilitarian.

I didn't want to pay 2x what I paid for these for a stronger lens. I purchased a different brand that are 12x42 and they're not strong enough either. I also like the quality of Celestron very much. I keep checking for a really good pair with BAK4 and FMC lenses.",

The popular 8x42 model has a wide field of view, and there are other options in the Nature DX range. Waterproof construction with easy to grip surfaces. The hinged lens caps on the wider lenses is handy, and the case is decent. These are relatively heavy binoculars, but not outrageous. Good beginner binoculars, just don't expect stunning images.",

    "description": "Style:8x42| Configuration:BinocularProudly created with US engineering, the Nature DX 8x42 reveals image detail you won\u2019t find with other beginners\u2019 binoculars. The fully multi-coated lenses provide maximum light transmission through the entire optical path, resulting in brighter, sharper images even in low light conditions. The high-quality BaK-4 prisms are phase-coated to increase the contrast and resolution. Nearby subjects like plants and insects are easy to view with a close focus of just 6.5 feet. These binoculars also allow the pursuit of distant subjects with 8x magnification and 42 mm objective lenses to easily acquire and follow your subject, no matter the distance. The Nature DX 8x42 body has been specifically designed to endure your travels thanks to its lightweight polycarbonate housing, which protects the binocular from damage. The binocular is 100 percent waterproof and purged with nitrogen gas to prevent internal fogging of the lenses in wet conditions. Rubber armor ensures durability, and the twist-up eyecups with multi-stop function allow for proper positioning of the eyes, even for eyeglass wearers!
