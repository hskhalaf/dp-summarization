I'm using it personally to store VMs on for my macbook. So I'm running the VMs off the drive with Fusion and everything performs just fine in the regard. I picked it up because I believe it would perform well, but mostly because I wanted minimum bulk to carry around with my macbook and this definitely met both criteria.",

Installation was non-existent. I plugged it in and it worked. Nice and easy. Having tested both, I would not choose this drive over the Seagate Slim 500 ().
