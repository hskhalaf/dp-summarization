Eventually, the case will no longer fit snug with the iPhone and will begin disconnecting and reconnecting randomly. It really becomes unbearable at a point, which really sucks, and you basically need to get it replaced. There's a one year limited warranty and a 90 day warranty on the replacement case, but can't say it would last longer than my first. Love this case to death; I've never once drained both the battery and case in one day, but man the material just doesn't last.",

I probably would have kept it. however Amazon offered to send me a new one but decided that ill just return it fully since it was definitely a pricey piece. all i can say that the case was very well made construction the only thing i hate about it is the damn felt or whatever material they use cause its a dust lint magnet.",

My only slight negative is that it can be heavy for some when attached to the phone or bulky in your pocket.",
