The problem I have with it is the strap that goes over the back of the rim to hold up the net. It is very difficult to assemble, though I found that putting the hooks in both ends and then putting the pole together was easier. Also, after a year, that strap has snapped and net is hanging awkwardly. I believe this is from wear from the sun.",

It doesn\u2019t get in the way of the game, but it looks off. Also, my kids have a habit of throwing the sand bags when putting out, or picking up, and I had one tear already. They give you 2 bags per, so I filled one bag, then double bagged it, hoping to make it thicker, and not tear again. But it funsctions well, as far as catching the ball, and either drop straight down, or slightly roll back to you.",

It is so lopsided that I ended up just folding the extra 18\" underneath the sandbag so at least it was usable.
