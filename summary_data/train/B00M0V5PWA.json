I use it as a work bench when it's not carrying everything into the job site, and it comes fully built and folds very easily when the day is over. People always ask me where to get one . Highly recommended for those that can't haul a full size cart and need to move a bunch of tools around , or need a portable laptop table .",

Otherwise, it's a perfect solution for my mechanic, with low-friction wheels for a smooth transfer. It was already assembled, at least this one had nothing extra found inside the box it came in, if that's where the straps were supposed to be put. It's a shame because I would have given it 5 starts!",

Stability seems good, although there's more movement in the cart than I'd prefer while occasionally moving it. Still, very good overall. Really suited my needs and space.

It has proven so useful that I have kept it open and have not used the folding feature much. However, it does fold nicely and can be stored easily in a relatively small space. The only disadvantage is that the folding mechanism blocks one side so the lower shelves can only be loaded from the other side. But that is a minor price to pay for the easy storage aspect.
