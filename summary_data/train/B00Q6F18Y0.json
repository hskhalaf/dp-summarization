Look no further! These blankets did a decent job for me for such a cheap fix. I was guided here by a Reddit thread and I'm so glad I went with these over the foam wall squares. I didn't do anything fancy with mine I just bought some cheap clips from Dollar General that I could attach them to the wall with and there is a noticeable difference now in sound bouncing in and out of the room. Definitely give it a try if you don't mind the look!",

These blankets were just what we needed! One thing I suggest, is to order more than you think you might need. I thought that we would only need to pack the really nice furniture with these blankets, but now I wish that I had packed all of the furniture and larger appliances (like the W/D) with them too. Several items that were packet into the trailer without the blankets ended up getting scratched. At less than $5 per blanket, better safe than sorry.",

They were exactly what we were looking for and I'd buy them again if we needed more.
