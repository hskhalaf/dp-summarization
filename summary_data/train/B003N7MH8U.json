      "text": "Serious air volume attic fan. High quality product and easy to install. The only downside it that it has a metal fan, so it does make some noise when it is sunny. I can tell how sunny by the pitch of the noise. It is not loud, but it can be definitely heard throughout the upstairs of the house. Keeps the attic cool and well ventilated. Prior to this fan the attic smelled old and stale. Now it smells like fresh air up there. I live in CA, so the fan is on all year long when it is sunny.",

It was near ambient air temp. It was 93 degrees in southern Ohio today and our attic has been known to reach well above 135 degree, so there was a giant temp drop. We tried everything including 5 passive mounted roof vents with no real difference until today. If you put your hands near the ceiling, it was warm to the touch and radiated heat, but not today, and yes we do have insulation. This fan is awesome!!! Thanks, Natural Light",

My handyman swapped out the fans in just over 30 minutes. this fan keeps my house nice and cool during the hot California sun. Today was 86 degrees outside and it was a nice 72 degrees inside without using any AC. My AC finally kicked in around 6pm. Great product and i should save enough money in electricity after a year to pay for this thing. Solar attic fans are a must in sunny hot climates!",

Note that the top 3 drill holes will be covered by the shingles with no way to find them when screwing down into room, just make sure to caulk everything. The provided caulk is plenty for the job. I also bought the fire and temperature wiring, simple to install and worth it IMO. I live in the NE and have had the fan shut off as temp approached 70 and kick on again later the same sunny afternoon. Love this solution. Attic is cool and no stuffy smell.",

The moment you expose it to the sunlight, the fan kicks off right away. 2. Keep the fan in the box and transport it to the installation location then you can unbox it.",

If there are any clouds, the fan throttles back and slows down. Not what I expected for the 400+ price tag. On a positive note, when there is full sun and the unit runs at full capacity, it is extremely effective and works well at reducing indoor temperatures (and in turn decreases the need to run A/C). If you purchase, just be aware of the need for full direct sunlight as again, if it\u2019s cloudy or overcast... it doesn\u2019t run at full capacity",
