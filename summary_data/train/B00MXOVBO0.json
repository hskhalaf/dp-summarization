If this happens to me, I swab it with a little vasoline and leave it off for a few days and resume when nose heals.",

I still use Excedrin for headaches but I have seen reduced frequecy and less intensity with the dietary changes.",

This is the ONLY medicine that keeps me from having a miserable, pet free life. I would recommend it to anyone who has had trouble finding the right allergy med to work for them. This just might be the one for you too!",

    "description": "Flonase Non Drowsy Allergy Medicine for 24 Hour Allergy Relief relieves your worst allergy symptoms, including nasal congestion, all in an easy-to-use allergy nasal spray that outperforms the top non-drowsy allergy pill. Unlike over the counter allergy medicines that only block one inflammatory substance in the body, this nasal congestion relief spray helps block six allergic substances for powerful multi-symptom relief. Whether you're seeking relief during allergy season or dealing with year-round allergies, this allergy relief nasal spray helps you achieve more complete relief of allergy symptoms caused by pollen, mold, dust and pet dander. It works directly in your nose to relieve a variety of symptoms, including nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, itchy nose and itchy, watery eyes. Unlike Flonase allergy relief spray, most allergy pills don't finish the job because they don't relieve nasal congestion. Adults and children 12 years of age and older may use up to two sprays of Flonase nasal spray in each nostril daily. Satisfaction Guarantee If for any reason you are not satisfied with any GSK Consumer Healthcare product, GSK Consumer Healthcare will provide you with a reimbursement within 45 days of the date of purchase. Please note that because GSK is unable to control the quality of our products sold by unauthorized sellers, the Guarantee is not available for products purchased from unauthorized sellers due to potential quality issues outside GSK\u2019s control.
