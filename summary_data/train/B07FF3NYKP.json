This also fits my canon 80d, and did not tip over. I am unsure if I\u2019ll continue to use my camera on this tripod though.",

I would expect the tripod portion to be removable in order to even qualify as a selfie-stick. I didnt buy it for that purpose but if I did, I would be very disappointed. I will give 5 stars but wanted to warn others.",

And yesterday the remote totally died. not for lack of charge it just doesn't do that blink of blue even after a full few hours of charging. Cant return it sooo yeah just don't buy this product.",

I normally put something soft down when shooting in windy places to catch my phone just in case. I love the remote very great for selfies. All and all Im pretty impressed",

When using by itself like a tripod, the base seems to be not wide enough which can be easily knockout by strong winds. The base should be a little wider. There should be a better way to lock the angle of the direction when you are trying to take a picture. Currently, there's certain angles that the head locks into.",
