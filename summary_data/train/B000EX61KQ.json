An improvement would be to add a set of light brakes on the front that would allow you to be stationary while washing yourself; apparently the designers never tried showering with the chair or this would have been obvious. Nonetheless, it is a very useful product that I would buy again if there was the need.",

The locks on back legs don't keep it from moving but since it sits against the shower wall, it hasn't been a problem for us. I think the locks are ok, but the chair is so lightweight that it could move anyway if it was in an open area.",

      "text": "This chair ships in a compact box and is easy to put together. It does NOT come with a bucket, which wasn't a problem for me. It is different from the last chair in that the frame slants from the back instead of from the front. Again, not a problem. It does come with heavy duty wheels, which was a problem with the last chair. Seat is fixed, does not raise up. The fabric on the chair, like all show chairs I've ever seen, will not last very long. You will need to be able to sew your own. I would recommend this chair.",
