I found it difficult to latch onto the flat part of the zip ties and hold on. It takes more finagling to get the job done. It was less expensive than others, and had I had a continuous use for it I would have returned it for a better, more expensive version. I got what I paid for.",

But did have issue with fraying some shift cables when I wasn't paying attention to see if the cable was engaged in the puller. Overall great tool. Again, I think this is an exact copy of the park tool version just cheaper. Although I wouldn't trust a replica bike frame, I would trust a replica tool.",

If your on a budget or just dont want to spend lot's of your hard earned money then this is the tool for you. Dollar for dollar this is a winner.

When I was only replacing two cables? The other three times it shredded the cable and I had to try again with a fresh cable. It seems that under tension the cables pull behind the clamp, which is too small for it, so they shred. If the tool was assembled with less gap or play between the swinging arm and the main body, I bet this would be amazing. As it is, I\u2019m not pleased with this and don\u2019t recommend it.",

Things always are much easier to do when given the proper tools. Couldn't bet the price. Cheaper than Park Tool Fourth Hand Cable Puller. I would recommend this tool to a friend.",
