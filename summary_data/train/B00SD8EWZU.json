To say that this install was the most inattentive to detail oriented as per instructions would be a massive understatement. All this company needed to do was provide a simple piece of paper with a template assisting with anchor placement. Instead, you are holding up the mirror tracing, or deciding your own timestaking method of install, which can result in the most minor of offsets, which as a result an un-level mirror. This company should be ashamed of their instructions and I would never buy this mirror again.",

I fell in love with it when I saw and I love it now every time I walk into the bathroom. It's fairly large and has a sleek modern look that matches well with the other items in the bathroom. I only had a hard time installing it because I had to drill into large porcelain tiles but I'm certain it's an easy install on sheet rock or small tiles. I highly recommend this mirror.",
