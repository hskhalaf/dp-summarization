This thing is amazing. Just amazing. It holds my power cord, all my cables, it's so spacious, and neat looking,and a million times better than having a heap of cords laying on the floor next to my bed.",

This has a wood pattern on the top and so it's slightly less intrusive.It's still pretty cheap feeling and is definitely not good for value for the $30 I paid for it. Half of that would've been more reasonable. It's also enormous. You can get a 6way outlet adapter, laptop chargers and tablet chargers all inside. So you end up with one fat outlet cable going in, and all the skinny power cables coming out.",

I am very happy with this. 4* on durability instead of 5 is that it is plastic and if too rough with it, it might break but you would have to be really rough.",

So I just store the charger plug and cord inside the box and use when necessary. This organizer significantly cut down on all the charger cords and plugins clutter I had laying around the home office. Highly recommended!!",
