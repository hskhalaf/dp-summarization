The contractor was impressed by the build quality and the installation kit. There was a small issue on my Rinnai Tankless. The temperature control module was defective. I called Rinnai support and they sent out a new control board the next day. The great thing about this product was, I had hot water although the processing board was defective. 30 days after install I note my Utility bill was more than cut in half. Should have purchased alot sooner.",

No more scalding hot or ice cold showers. I love the remote thermostat so you can adjust the temperature, so no worries if little ones are going to pour a bath that is too hot. I can not say enough good about this product. We purchased this along with a value set for easy cleaning and maintenance, I suggest that you think about putting a inline prefilter system to maximize the life of the heater.",

Nineteen years is a good-run for a water heater. Only drawback. The new unit only allows settings of 115 & 120 Fahrenheit.

Our excellent experience with the Continuum has made us committed Rinnai customers, and we have every expectation that this current model, with its inevitable technological upgrades, will keep us entirely satisfied. We shall submit another review once the new unit has been installed and in operation for a few months. Incidentally, the V94EN was very well packed and arrived in pristine condition.",

Even though this unit has a low gpm it is more than my 12 v pump can deliver (5.5 gpm at 75 psi) so it is a good match. There is more than enough pressure at the shower head in fact it has to be backed off a bit. I like the remote temp sensors ability to be adjusted according to need and the fact that it holds this setting after power outages is an improvement over earlier models which would always default to the min temp after power interruptions",

This unit is more then twice the weight and when you remove the front panel you can easily see and know you got the good stuff. You can buy a cheaper unit and later regret not listening to this advice. If it's worth doing, it's worth doing right....but this thing, hook it up and you're there!!!",
