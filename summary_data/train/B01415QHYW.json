This product is not only cost friendly, it is easy to install, and you get a spare! I see it is also manufactured in the USA. So I gave it a 5 star rating for all these reasons.",

My 2nd glass attempt, the tabs started to come off and I used my fingers to align the glass with half-assed results.

Also, the last few screen updates protectors I\u2019ve bought from well-known companies have had to be returned because there was no sticky coating on the glass or film! This package com s with 2 protectors and worked the first time. Will definitely buy again. Other factors are clarity seems good, feels good, responsive touch.

It came with a kit for installation which includes a glass cleaner, a paper to dry the glass, a card to remove bubbles, even small stickers to remove the dust. I did find it difficult to align because it is exactly the same size as the screen. As one reviewer said, that may be because the screen is tempered glass and the iPhone screen is curved so can't be any wider. Because of this, I may go with plexiglass next time. So, 4 stars for width (sorry if that's not fair) and 5 stars for the accompanying install kit.",

Basically the way they work is that when (not IF! This happens to everyone :) you drop your phone, you will crack the cheap screen protector instead of your expensive screen. When you have this phone you really can't even tell it's on there except that you have a little less anxiety when holding your beloved device. :) Good, simple, high quality product with fast shipping!",

      "text": "I cracked my $40 Bodyguardz tempered glass screen protector I purchased at AT&T when I bought my iPhone 7. After months of people asking how I cracked my screen, I finally purchased these MUCH cheaper protectors. My coworker peeled off my old screen, used the screen cleaners included in this package, and placed my new screen protector on my phone. It took him about 5 minutes start to finish. I\u2019ve already dropped my phone several times since then, and neither the screen protector nor the phone screen is cracked. There has been no issues with the touch screen sensitivity or responsiveness with this protector.",

      "text": "The product arrived on-time, but all of the instructions were inside the sealed package. The product was clean and the enclosed wipes and instructions were very nice. Despite understanding the difficulty of aligning the screen and the well thought installation aids I still managed to place the screen protector about 3/64\" to the left which is OK but a lot worse than I thought I could do by bracing my arms and trying to carefully locate the phone so that I could easily see the whole screen. The rest of the install went pretty well with the ability to eliminate the bubbles particularly impressive.",
