      "text": "I wanted to love this bag but ultimately had to return it for two reasons. The biggest is it doesn\u2019t fit the Spectra S2 in the side pocket. You could fit it in the main pocket but doesn\u2019t that defeat the purpose? There\u2019s literally no way to get it in the side pocket... my husband and I were stumped because the description and reviews said it fits. The second reason is the zippers - they are extremely cheap and difficult to open. The first time I tried to open a side pocket, the zipper got stuck. Ultimately it\u2019s a beautiful bag so I\u2019m sad that it didn\u2019t work out.",

The trick to getting the Spectra in is to wiggle the pump sideways, and get the handle in and the rest of the pump will follow.",

      "text": "I recently purchased the Kaylaa Black bag to store my spectra pump and use during a businesss trip abroad. The sturdy and structured design made a huge difference as I traveled through the airport and during my business conference. The style and design is chic but subtle enough to not draw attention to its purpose as most bags that accompany breast pumps clearly do. The bag has lining to store my computer, makeup bag and other accessories. But it is much larger than I realized online which makes it easy to overpack ...this makes it quite heavy to carry so you will rely on the shoulder strap too. Overall very pleased and would recommend!",

The strap is much more sturdy and the color of the inside allows you to find things faster. I used it for another trip and it holds my pump and a many more things. Definitely recommend! ORIGINAL REVIEW: I purchase this bag for traveling so I could use it to carry my pump as well as the diaper bag contents. It's a really cute bag but it didn't even last me a trip. First the zipper broke so I couldn't zip it up, and then one side of the long strap broke, so I couldn't carry it. Very disappointing.",

After posting my original review Larry from Kaylaa bags contacted me right away with an apology and offer to replace the bag. I received the bag within a few days.

I was hoping to take this bag to work so I can pump, but know I will always be in a hurry when doing so, and think I might get too irritated trying to get things in and out of the bag. It would also be helpful if the interior wasn't such a dark color. It seems like it would be difficult to locate items in the bag. I'm still debating on if I'll keep it or not. I'm going to try to find something more functional.",

Unfortunately, after 4 days of use the large strap broke off on my walk into my building. Now, I have to use the small straps which is not comfortable for a 10 minute walk. Most likely, I will be returning. Such a pity since this is a great bag!!",
