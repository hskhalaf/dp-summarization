The ice is bullet shaped and we have it set for the medium sized ice cube. Last a long time (I even refill my water before the ice melts). I never turn off the machine. My office has power surges once in a while, but the machine powers itself off and only resets after I unplug it from the wall. Great safety feature so it doesn't burn up the motor.",

They sent a replacement ice maker, but unfortunately due to poor packaging and obviously poor handling the ice maker came with a large dent in the corner and won't even start. I'm now waiting for them to decide what to do. I have sent pictures of the machines. Haven't heard back yet. Frustrating.",
