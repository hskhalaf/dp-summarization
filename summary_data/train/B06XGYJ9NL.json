It made it much easier to feed my baby throughout the night after having a c-section. She is two months now and I noticed one morning that there was hair on the dockatot where her head lays and my baby had a bald spot on the back of her head. No matter if my baby moves her head sometimes I don\u2019t think anything should be so rough to rub her hair off. Especially something so expensive.",

When my baby was about 3 weeks old I bought the Dock and it was magic. He slept for 5 hours straight the first night and I panicked that something was wrong. Nothing was wrong, he was just comfortable and asleep. Then he slept for 6 hours. He's 5 months old now and will sleep for 8+ hours in this. I only wish I would have bought the bigger one and that it wasn't so insanely expensive.",

She had a really hard time sleeping because she always liked to be close to the edge (the net) or she would cry because she could not get comfortable. We put the dockatot in our bassinet for her to sleep in at night and it was a total game changer. She loved the feeling of being snuggled in the dockatot and it kept her stable and prevented her from tossing and turning. I would absolutely recommend for any parent. It will allow you to finally get some quality sleep and your baby too! And it\u2019s great because you can take it everywhere.",

Perhaps another cover would solve this problem but we just have been putting a burp cloth under her head and that helps",

      "title": "Not worth it",
      "text": "For the price tag, really disappointed in the product. Cover comes of easily, for washing, but while putting it back on you need two persons. Also, the 'breathable' material of pillow is so easy to get tangled in the zipper, rips off easily, and cotton comes out. So I would say it is terrible chocking hazard if you are not careful.",
