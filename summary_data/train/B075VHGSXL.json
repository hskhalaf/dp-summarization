We replaced a 3-light candelabra style light and I swear this one is much more bright. It looks lovely both off and on. As others have mentioned, the directions are not great. The problem is that there is no key to explain what parts they are referring to. The seller did email with revised installation instructions, but I never opened the email. I have replaced my fair share of light fixtures and this was pretty manageable, taking about 45 minutes.",

Plus, since the top is open, the light bulbs fill the ceiling with light which scatters around the kitchen. Having the flexibility to set the hanging length from 6 - 48\" is a bonus. All in all I recommend highly for those needing a fixture with a mid-century feel that is easy to hang and a joy to use.",

Took me and hubby about 2.5 hours, which was crazy, when all was said and done. Had to go back a few times as there is a lot left unsaid in the directions. Other than that great chandelier.

The most difficult part was connecting to the junction box with the parts supplied. The two screws that hold the fixture up to the ceiling are difficult to get just right. We did it several times before we were happy with it. Other than that, I would recommend waiting until the light is hung before attaching the diffuser and shade. Otherwise you risk breaking the diffuser since it's made of glass.",

Throw them away. Secondly, the instructions say to place the screws into the ceiling box facing down. This is not correct and will lead to a ton of wasted time! Install the mounting screws by screwing them into the installation plate, then take the light and push it to the ceiling letting the head of the screws come throw the top of the lighting fixture. You can then tighten the screws to get the light to sit flush against the ceiling. good luck !",
