I bought a lot of cute bibs (not on amazon) and it was a total waste and I had to throw them away since they would become soaking wet within 30 Min. I was literally going through 10 bibs a day and my baby\u2019s clothes would still become damp. These bibs help block the moisture from soaking baby\u2019s clothing because they are a nice thick material. I highly recommend !",

I bought these because of reviews about how absorbent they are and am so pleased with them. These are the softest, most absorbent, and cutest bibs that we have. We would go through up to 4 or 5 bibs a day at times, but with these 1-2 can last him all day. Highly recommend for anyone who wants a cute and absorbent bib for their messy baby!",

The only issue I have (and this is for all bandana bibs, not just this brand) is that the fabric folds up right under the chin so when he drools, it soaks the fabric and his chin/cheeks stay wet until I change the bib. I try and change it constantly of course, but it also means I've got to change it sooner for the bandana design. I do like that at least it's made of organic cotton since it's constantly touching his face.",

The backs snap really easily, and the bibs are tapered/folded/stitched so they wrap around the neck nicely. they are very soft on the bottom and gentle on the neck. the top is really absorbent as well. They hold a ton. My baby slobbers a massive amount, and will soak these bibs, but it soaks through the top, and keeps it dry on the bottom, which is just perfect, so it keeps the baby and outfit dry. I've ordered extra for myself and friends. These are fantastic.",

If you're primarily using for a drooling baby, be prepared for constantly changing out the bib and stinky bibs if you don't wash them right away. With my drooling 18month old, the bib is wet within a few minutes after I put it on. If you are still looking for cotton bandanna bibs, you can get the same quality for a little bit cheaper from other sellers.",

The fleece on the back of these bibs is not as thick/absorbent as the fleece used on the Matimati bibs. I've also noticed that the printed fabric gets kinda wrinkly (doesn't lay flat) after laundering. Overall, these are minor complaints, but I thought I would point them out for anyone wondering the differences between the brands.",

They aren't waterproof, but they are highly absorbent and the material that is up against his clothes doesn't tend to be soaking wet. This translates to his clothes staying pretty dry all day long!
