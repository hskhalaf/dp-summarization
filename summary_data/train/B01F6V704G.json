The frame itself is beautiful; the bezel is thin; the back is clean and bright meaning you can use this in a variety of settings and especially great in an open workplace.

At this size, I think 1440p is really the right resolution - 1080p is a stretch for text (especially if you're using a high dpi second screen). If you're watching videos, it doesn't really matter. And there's nothing on the market (except maybe for steep sale discounts) that gives that resolution at this size for this price. Viewing angles are good, and so is color. Would give 4.5/5 stars (decided which way to round on a coin flip).",
