The product in the image is three cans with straight sides, rolled lips, and gas-release tubes, which are suitable for use with other tops. The product delivered has curved sides, non-detachable tops, and no gas-release tubes like this one [...], and is useless to me. I ordered these specifically because the image matched the product I am replacing; there is no warning on the product page that the image is incorrect.",
