I will say one thing in defense of the \"not compatible\" answer, taking apart this particular laptop is not for a newb. I suspect this was the reason for the reply.

Throughput is 50-100% higher due to a big drop in IO wait (memory cache rather than swap on disk.) It works perfectly and was easy to do. If you are considering upgrading some hardware, and your research confirms that this DIMM will work, go for it. If you can get it installed, it should work for you. Very worthwhile.",

So when upgrading with this Kingston memory I was left with 12 gigabytes instead of 16 as there are just 2 sockets for RAM on the laptop. Nevertheless the laptop works much better, everything is smoother from desktop software to surfing the web. I am very surprised the difference that 4 gigs more can do.

      "text": "Bought this to upgrade the memory in my new Thinkpad 11e and it works perfectly with no hiccups. Have never had any problems with Kingston in the past and don't anticipate any with this either. There was a Crucial module for a few dollars less that said it could run at both 1.5V & 1.35V (the SODIMML standard). It left me wondering if it might be marginally approved for 1.35V operation so I went with one certified as SODIMML since it wasn't worth having any potential problems over a few bucks.",

Powered up the laptop and new memory card was recognized instantly. The difference with the added the memory (8GB now) was immediately noticeable, programs are running much faster and smoother now. Have tried other products from Kingston and never had any issue. Same for this RAM card. In fact this card is also recommended by Sony for its laptops. Running perfectly now.",
