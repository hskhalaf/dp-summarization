I did a little searching and found that they made softer baseballs and decided to give them a try. These are really good. They are the correct size but much softer so they are easier to hold while throwing and easier to catch because if you get hit it doesn't hurt. While they seem to be good quality I probably wouldn't use them for hitting. They are soft so I think they would probably not stand up well to being hit repeatedly.",

They'd had outgrown the soft T-Ball safety balls, tearing the seams with their metal bats (and/or landings on concrete) on the first time out, so I decided to try upgrading to these. They lasted about four sessions before the same thing happened. Until then, they were great, with a good feel in the glove and action off the bat. For reference, my boys are 9, but small for their age. If you're playing on grass or dirt, they may be fine. I couldn't tell if it was the hitting, or the landing on concrete, that caused the issue.",

I was using one to do infield practice but after a couple grounders the ball basically fell apart so I switched back to real baseball's.

These balls hurt way less when hit in the face than a normal baseball. Kids who are afraid of regular balls will learn bad form, and don't try to catch the tough ones. There are problems using these in batting (they break pretty quickly) and grounders (they bounce more than regular balls), so we use a mix of regular balls for batting/grounders and these safety balls for practicing catching. Every coach-pitch level of baseball should start the season with these softer balls for teaching how to throw and catch.",

A soft rubber exterior. These have been ideal in building his confidence both with batting and catching since it isn't a hard exterior that would hurt too much if it hits him or me at close range. I would buy more and recommend to friends and family.",
