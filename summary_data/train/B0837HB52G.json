      "text": "I bought thiss camera as I wanted a superzoom - I have a Nikon Z6 but there wasn't any lens available that got close to the zoom range of this plus even the longest zooms were incrrediibly heavy. So this is basically my wildlife camera. For that it does a good job, on a tripod its very good. Bit tricky to hold steady at maximum zoom but not impossible just need to make sure your stance is.stable . I've been able to take some great pictures of small birds that I could hardly see with the naked eye. So overall I'm glad I bought it.",

      "text": "It\u2019s a fun camera. Not for pro photographer, but prefect for birds watching and moon shooting. Imagine quality is very good between the zoom 24-800. Macro is also impressive. With this camera you can see and capture the stuff usually you can\u2019t with any other cameras or lens. At this point it\u2019s very worth of money. I own a few other cameras, most of them are very expensive ones, but this camera brings me a lot of joy. And it\u2019s not heavy at all. You can carry it with you all the time ;-)",

      "title": "Good for general photos but has it's limitations",
      "text": "Bought the P950 with the intention of upgrading from my old Panasonic FZ100 Bridge camera and was initially seduced by the optical zoom equivalent to 2000 mm. I found that the zoom worked well up to 1000 mm with good image stabilisation. The image quality dropped noticeably from 1000 mm upwards and the 16 megapixel sensor did not help + the exposure compensation control was limited. The LCD monitor and electronic viewfinder and macro photos taken on short zoom were good. I decided to try a light weight Nikon DSLR combined with a compact 18-300 zoom lens instead and still use my old FZ100 as a backup",

I was suprised with what the camera offered especially the 84x zoom, the quality of the photos was great, hides my shakes when taking photos at full zoom. And the extras are really great. If you are not sure about exposure and time, then the auto is great. I have to admit this is well worth the price. Thank you Nikon.",

Essentially this is no good for a pro has the lens is not switchable, it is aimed at the more ambitious consumer. My son had taken really excellent pictures of birds and the moon, which I'll try to post, but the magnification is extraordinary. Ideal for someone who want powerful magnification and to take good automatic photos, but doesn't want the freedom to change lenses. Basically it is a very powerfull all in one that is especially good at long ranged photos of wildlife and the moon.",
