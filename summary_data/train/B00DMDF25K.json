Before it was used I closed the drain plug with a very good hand \"snug.\" I filled it to ~1 inch above the drain with water. It started leaking. About 1 drop every 30 seconds. I then gave it my \"Popeye the Sailor\" hand tightening, and that stopped the leaking (for now). Now I have to see about ordering a replacement part....time I'd rather be doing something else. Until YETI fixes this problem, and then puts out some advertising specifically stating they fixed the leak problem, I'd NOT BUY this product.",
