The only thing I'll say is that if I had it to do over, I probably wouldn't get the controller with the display built in, because it's just a cheap android device. Definitely recommend getting the multi battery charger and getting at least one extra battery. (I bought a second battery after my first day with it).",

There is NO VIDEO support available currently so this $2,499.99 paper weight was a tremendous waste of time and money. I regret this purchase! Save your money!!!! I wish I could get mine back.",

But now I love it and can't wait for each opportunity I get to fly it. It shoots such smooth video while moving. Initially I was worried it might be shaky or choppy motion but it is SMOOTH when it flies. One reviewer almost scared me away saying it's not professional video camera, but I think all enthusiasts will be pleasantly surprised with the quality and it's just professional photographers who will be nit-picky. Battery life really is like 20 minutes. Had to buy a bunch of spares.",

There are firmware issues with this controller and you absolutely need to make sure all updates (download from DJI's website) are completed first.",

This drone is completely hobbled by the fact that it cannot have any apps installed or updated on it, and the firmware is several years out of date. DJI gave up on the support for this drone as soon as they released it. They moved on and left the owners of this very expensive paper weight high and dry.",

Cons: The downloadable maps are only for mainland China. Nothing for the USA or Europe. Some of the software has prompts in Chinese and could be more user friendly. The transmission system is not as robust as with the Mavic. Typically getting some signal drop out at 0.6 to 1 mile.",

This thing can practically fly itself. It comes with everything you need to get started. All that is needed is a charge of the batteries and an update of all the firmware. You should be flying in an hour. It'll take you that long to register with the FAA ($5), update the firmware, and look over the manual and controller.",
