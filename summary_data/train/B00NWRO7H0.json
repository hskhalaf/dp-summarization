      "text": "I've had these for a little over a month, and I'm generally disappointed. I had a pair of Yamaha eph-50s in the past that I loved so when I needed some new earbuds I thought I'd try these. Overall I'm disappointed in them. They have decent sound quality, but not much better than a $10 pair you could get anywhere. I love the design of the buds themselves and the in-line control, they're both very good looking. My biggest issue is that the cord itself is INSANELY FLIMSY. I feel like I'm going to break it just pushing it aside. The Jack also seems pretty shoddy too. Overall an okay pair of headphones not worth close to the price tag.",

      "text": "Great sound and very crisp, great noise cancellation, not the best for heavy bass though. They are much more emphasized with higher notes and I had to up the lows on my equalizer to even it out. Overall beautiful sound quality and I enjoyed using these. Unfortunately, the cord is not durable at all and I feared from the moment I first opened up these earbuds that the thin flimsy cord wouldn't last. Today after two months of everyday use they have stopped working in one ear. Severely disappointed as it's the most I've personally chosen to spend on earbuds and it was kind of a luxury item for me (low income household)",

      "text": "i dont agree with the reviewers saying that is has subtle/gentle base. the base is high level...! its good, but a little bit dominating the sound production. i listen to it using iPhone. the only equalizer i set is \"Reduce bass\" and the result is awesome...! i am going back and forth to say that the build is cheap. it feel really placticy but it makes it really light. so i guess i don't have a problem with that. i purchased this at $60 which i think how it really worth.",

      "text": "Christmas present! Great audio separation and clarity, perfect mids/highs; bass could be a tad more 'punchier' but is quite adequate. Probably best for jazz and blues, however rock and pop music still sounds great! Will expose the flaws in less than cd quality audio. Design of earbuds does require getting used to. I found pushing on the circle going in the ear canal and pushing the bottom of the earbud right to the bottom of your ear lobe works great. A superb deal for under $100! Highly recommended!",

Is it worth the $60 - absolutely yes!",
