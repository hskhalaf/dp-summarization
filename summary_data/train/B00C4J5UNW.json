I wanted a usable blanket, not a decorative throw and this is it! It's a heavy weight cotton in a simple knit pattern. I machine washed on cold, gentle, and dried on low. No wrinkles. I didn't measure for shrinkage but I can say it's not misshapen. In winter I'll add more pretty blankets. So tired of hauling comforters to the laundromat and coming back to the same tired pattern, etc. This cotton blanket is so versatile!",

But the king size provides for plenty of side coverage without hanging down onto the floor. Nice woven cotton blanket adds a comfy layer between sheets and bedspread for year round comfort. Good color. Quality product. Not super lightweight, which I liked. Doesn't shed too much lint in the dryer. All cottons shed some but it's not filling my dryer screen with each wash or anything like that.",

These blankets where stiffer than normal. Leading me to believe they were heavily treated with a preservative before storing or they didn't wash them after dying.

It gets cold here in winter when I will change my bedding out for flannel sheets a wool blanket and a comforter as opposed to cotton sheets this blanket and a quilt. And it stays bright white after washing. No yellowing or a dull gray. Comfortable bedclothes are important.",

If you live somewhere in Alaska or Canada it might not be a good choice. Sizing is a bit off. I have full size bed. Blanket itself is bigger so you gotta fold it a little bit on one size.",

The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is a few loose fibers popping up in one spot after pre-washing once on the gentle cycle, not noticeable enough to be a major complaint.",

My housemate immediately commented than the tighter, flatter weave would make it better for resisting accidental claw- pulling by cats (unlike traditional open-weave thermal, where cats can easily get their claws caught). So the rich color plus cat-resistant weave makes it a win-win for my bed.",
