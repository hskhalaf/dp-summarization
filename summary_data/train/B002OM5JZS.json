It appears to be of good quality and is sturdy, not wobbly at all as other reviews on other similar products had stated. So glad that I paid a little extra and got a rack that looks like it will last. The powder coating is really nice. Also want to mention that the wheels are substantial, not junk!! Would highly recommend!",

So we will only have 3 balls on top level of rack. Lower two levels don\u2019t have a bar in the way that allows for more space. However the rack is sturdy and was relatively easy to build. And I do imagine women\u2019s balls would fit on top level.",
