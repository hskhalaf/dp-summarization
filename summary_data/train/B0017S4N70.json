Probably not fair to deduct a star for that, I should have bought the cooler version. At least you can unzip from the bottom too so you can stick your feet out. I expect to have these for 10-15 years easily. BTW during the first use, a child peed overnight insight the sleeping bag - it happens. I handwashed and tried in the sun but it took days. Take extra caution around liquids with these. If you go tent camping in the rain, your tent best be 100% leak proof.",

Camped by the beach for a few nights in 40 weather and it was plenty warm. The outside of the bag has a damp feeling all the time though while camping. The rounded head area is nice & helps support a pillow. Worth the investment! Zipper works well. No complaints.",

The lining is nice as it provides a comfortable welcome to the bag on a cold night. Traditionally lined bags feel cold when you first enter them and this bag, with the lining, makes crawling in a warming experience. This is the second bag of this type that I have owned, and I highly recommend this bag if your looking for a warm bag with allot of space for your car camping/cabin expeditions.",

      "text": "First off, just a little side note, my bag was chocolate brown, not olive like in the picture which it's TOTALLY fine because the color was the only thing I was worried about(and yes it did say olive on the box). But the bag is super high quality, soft, and most importantly, super warm. Takes a second to warm up but the canvas does a awesome job of keeping the heat in and the cold out. I've used it a couple times already and it still looks brand new. I feel I'm going to get many many years out of this bag if not the rest of my life! Really happy with it, exactly what I was looking for",

So it wasn't too cold outside (maybe 50) but it performed as expected.",

I could see where you could get down to zero easily and still stay comfortable. I love canvas bags and flannel is always comfortable. All in all an awesome bag I would recommend it to anybody.

    "description": "Grizzly bags offer the most durable comfortable and warm bags on the market with all the features that you would expect from Black Pine Sports our bags are wider and longer than the competition with the choice of either a canvas shell or rip-stop shell an\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nFor couples camping, the Grizzly 2 Person -25 ripstop sleeping bag shares the same superior insulation and comfort features you'll find in the Grizzly one-person version, but with a larger sleeping area to accommodate two adult sleepers. Don't be surprised if a child or the family dog wants to climb in with you -- it's that big. It also zips from both sides, so you won't have to wake your sleeping partner to exit in the middle of the night. The durable ripstop nylon shell is sewn with a two-layer offset construction, ensuring the seams don't overlap to prevent cold spots. The super-large windstop walls along the zippers, thick chest baffles, and double-layer offset quilting will keep everyone toasty, while the giant built-in hood helps keep warmth from escaping at head level. Rated to -25 degrees F, this bag features a microfiber insulation fill as well as a flannel lining to add to the cozy factor. It measures 90 inches long and 65 inches wide (shoulder to foot), with a 9 pound fill weight and a 14.5 pound overall bag weight. Machine washable on the gentle cycle, it should be hung to dry. Stuff sack with compression straps included. Since 1999, Black Pine Sports has been offering the coziest sleeping bags, the best in family camping tents, backpacking gear, self-inflating air mattresses, and more with its Black Pine, The Backside, and Grizzly brands.",
