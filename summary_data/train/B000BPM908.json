      "text": "If you actually want to keep bread in this box, then you need to clean the entire interior regularly. The roll top covers about half the interior when you open the box so half the interior is not cleanable. The box does not come apart for cleaning. A bread box holding bread gets bread mold inside so it has to be thoroughly cleaned . So, the design is seriously flawed. If all you use the box for is decoration, then cleaning the inside doesn't matter. If you actually put bread inside, this is not a bread box to buy.",

Smooth sliding door, no fingerprints, and it matches all my stainless steel appliances and fixtures. No more messy counter. Well made, attractive, and roomy. What more could I ask for? Although the sides are black, this doesn\u2019t bother me at all. Our stove top is black, microwave is black, so this does not detract from the design. Perfect price point for what you get; I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t spend less or more. As Goldilocks would say, \u201cit\u2019s just right\u201d. Get it, as I don\u2019t think you will be disappointed.",

It's a quality item, seems very well constructed, is attractive. The door slides smoothly and silently. There's a good deal of space for a loaf and several biscuits, or even two loaves, I'd guess. Pleased with the purchase.",
