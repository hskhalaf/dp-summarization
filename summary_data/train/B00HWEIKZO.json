You need to use a plastic ziploc bag over the press to keep the dough from sticking and you cannot roll out the dough too thin. Also the dough must have the perfect consistency which you can learn from any Mexican Chef! : )",

Cast iron will shear if too much weight applied to the handle, although it's seems better built than it was in the picture of it broken. Remember it's not like steel. Enjoy!",

Making the tortillas looks A L-O-T easier on the TV shows but once I got the hang of it the quality and taste was much MUCH better than anything you can buy. Even my failures were good for taco salad or chili. Pati's Mexican Table web site has great recipes for corn and flour tortillas. (No relation, just a fan.)",

They need to either provide you a baggie full, or how about ONE that actually is strong and works. As for the press.... it was so-so. Being so fearful of bending the pin, we applied NO pressure. The weight of the lid pressed the tortilla down 'ok' and then I hand rolled to desired thinness. Disappointed. Good heavy cast iron.... cheap bendy handle pin.",

How anyone could break the handle I don't know, no strength is required beyond that of an 8 year old girl. The trick is to use a plastic produce bag on both sides of the dough.

I added a few drops of canola oil and let it rest about 20 minutes. The dough was soft and pliable. It took no effort at all to press the tortillas. I found a 30 gram ball of dough formed the size and thickness tortilla I was looking for. Most of the forming was done by the weight of the top plate with only a gentle press of the handle to finish forming. Very satisfied.",

Use pliers to bend the pin down once you are certain you have it put together correctly. It works well, but you need to put plastic or parchment down before pressing tortillas. I wish it came with that information and a good recipe for tortillas. It is heavier than I thought. The handle is too long. It takes a lot of space. I wish I had bought an electric press that presses and cooks.",

Best to cut a sandwich zipper type bag so you can put your dough ball between the two plastic pieces. This will keep the dough from sticking to the press. To press into a round tortilla, press the handle lightly and rotate. Others have stated that the handle would break if pressing too hard. One doesn\u2019t need to press hard in order to make a perfect, thin tortilla. I personally use it to make my KETO tortillas. Perfect every time! Enjoy!",
