Some people say that the pin at the front of the ricer doesn't hold the ricer together. If you turn the pin so that the hook of the pin faces forward the pin locks in place. There weren't any instructions with the ricer so you just had to observe this from what the ricer looked like on the packaging.",

You have to be sure the potatoes are cooked til tender. Wash it immediately after getting all the potatoes through (even before completing your dish), and you won't have a problem getting it clean....all those tiny holes will clog easily.",

I have to admit, they were the best mashed potatos that I have ever had. My 23 year old son is a great cook and he uses the ricer more than I do. Are you tired of lumpy mashed potatos? If so, a ricer is the solution. Once you use it, you will be hooked for life.",

The only thing I don't like about it is that if you're not careful the pin holding the parts together might slip out, this happened once for me. Overall it's really easy to assemble/disassemble and clean.",

Suffice it to say it's built better and more heavily, making it much more likely to be handed on to my son someday. If you've not had mashed potatoes made with a ricer, you've not had real mashed potatoes. They're simply better in both texture and taste.

      "text": "For years I've been peeling potatoes by hand whenever I made mashed potatoes. Not something I enjoyed. A friend recommended I get a ricer. I saw this Norpro Stainless Steel Commercial one on Amazon. It was a good price and free shipping - I decided to take a chance. I was surprised at how substantial and sturdy it felt. So many things you buy these days are so flimsy. I've used it a few times already and it works great and cleanup is a snap!",
