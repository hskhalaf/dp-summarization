Looks like it can't leak unless you step on it. Would have give the dispense 5 stars too, but its a could use a bigger thumb slot or lever in the top opener. So far so good.",

They are easy to fill and have never leaked in my bag. Sometimes I carry on, sometimes they are below the plane. I have dropped them numerous times. They still work great. They also dispense the shampoo and shower gel with ease. I even used my small tube for a facewash, which worked well. Highly recommend.",

I like that they feel strong, yet they're easy to squeeze so you don't waste anything like you do in the stiffer plastic bottles. I've ordered several sets and will be using them for lots of things including for portable lunch bag condiments. TIP: (If you're flying, don't fill them all the way up to the top as the pressure may expand them)",

Nothing opened up, the pour is very controlled and the changeable labels are brilliant. My only complaint is they don't sell these individually or in packs of 4.

To select the label, you have to remove a collar, which is inserted into the neck, and then pull the cap from the bottle, exposing the ability to select the proper label.
