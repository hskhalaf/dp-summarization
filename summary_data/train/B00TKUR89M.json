It does work fine once you get it hung, but it did require ironing which was a chore because of its size. For it to work well, you need to invest in good separate lighting for the green screen in addition to the lighting on you. It also needs to be wrinkle free and be stretched taunt which is why you will need those clamps. Overall, it does what it said it would do. I don't consider it professional quality, but great for amateurs like myself.",
