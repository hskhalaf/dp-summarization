Very strong built. My only gripes are that it came fairly dull. And the saw teeth could be better used if they were facing the other way. The saw teeth on the back of the blade are so thick that it is very hard to push away from you and still push hard enough to saw anything. However I bought it for its prying/chopping capabilities and not so much as a saw. All in all it's a good item for the money",

It's too short and heavy to swing like a machete. You can't really saw with it because the teeth are dull. Hard to chop with it because it's so top-heavy. Can't really classify it as a survival weapon. Pun intended, but there's really no point to this knife!",
