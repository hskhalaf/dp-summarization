At this price point this should not be happening. Aside from that completely unacceptable flaw the sound quality is meh at best. Clarity is poor, too much bass for my tastes but most will be fine with it. Never used the mic.",

I can only find one alternate size that fits in my ears without falling out and when they are in they hurt immediately and are very uncomfortable. I have tried all sorts of angles and switching ears but none of them work to relieve discomfort. They also fall out very easily, so they won't serve one of the key reasons I purchased them to make phone calls while walking somewhere. The only positive is that the sound quality does live up to its hype.",

The reason is pretty obvious - poor quality of materials which is common case of cheap headsets. Really I don't think that $70 is cheap. In most articles it's said that the reason is DEHP (google it) which also harmful for health. If you are going to use them a lot outside the buildings you might face the same problem much earlier.

Do yourself a favor and purchase the memory foam tips, you'll thank me later. Now my biggest gripe about these ear buds is the carrying case they come in. I noticed about a month ago I have a slight tear in my cable by the connector. I noticed that where the cable was torn was in the same area where the cable wraps around the case to secure the connector. I really feel that this is a manufacture error so buyer beware.

It's very narrow, so the width-to-thickness ratio means it's not actually that flat. It twists easily, and when it gets twisted or bent, the shape deforms and it becomes even less flat. Also the plastic piece that pulls the two cables together does not fit well, because of the way the cable deforms and stops being flat.",

The sound signature is surprisingly similar to my SE 215's and that's probably the best compliment I can give to a $99 earphone.

Very disappointed by this, they feel great and i only wish the feedback wasn\u2019t there and that extra noise wasn\u2019t a thing as well",

Almost every time I remove them from my ears at least one of the pads will stay in my ear. I nearly lost one the other day, which in my mind is a very large issue since once the pad is gone the headphones are no longer usable. So they should get a 3 star rating but due to being a great product overall I give them a 4 star.",
