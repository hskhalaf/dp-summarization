      "text": "I have been buying New Balance running and athletic shoes for many years. I am appalled by these lousy shoes, which the tags say were made in Vietnam. I have nothing against Vietnam, but these shoes are garbage. They don't have a tongue! They are slippers with laces. Who thought that was a good idea? The soles feel uneven and are very uncomfortable. Note to New Balance; I would gladly pat $120 or more for a good pair of shoes like you used to make in America than this crap you're pedaling for under $70.",
