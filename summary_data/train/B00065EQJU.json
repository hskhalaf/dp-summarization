Lots of folks don't seem to understand the balance beam portion of the weighing mechanism, you have to be still on the platform and use small movements if the weights. Once you understand that, you've mastered how to use this scale without any electricity .",

So I'd like for someone to come up with a design that makes us able to balance it to zero more easily when we move it, but that's a very minor issue.
