The software called Intilli-stuido isn't compatible with win 8. Without the software it's not possible to upgrade the firmware on the camera. However the camera can be used as a plug and play. You don't need a special driver download. I haven't used to camera for any photos yet. I do have it set up. The buttons and the camera body have a poor build quality feel. I'm going to return the camera and find one that is a little more up to date.",

The intention of buying this camera was for the size for easy carrying vs my larger Canon camera. I am a shopper and the price with Amazon was the best around...even with the sale price at best buy.

If we can take pictures or video and easily transfer to cell Phone and send to cloud or hosting site. Life will be much easier this way yet the transmittion is too slow especially video.
