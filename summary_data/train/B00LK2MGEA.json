This is a great little saw for cutting hair on trees, and clearing up brush. It also cuts some surprisingly large size logs. The battery last long enough to get a feeling of accomplishment. The self oiling chain, and easy tool-less bar adjustment are nice features. It is much less noisy than a gas saw, and no fumes, or cords to get tangled up. The saw is light enough and small enough to scurry up trees and trim branches. Things are looking alot better around my place since getting this saw.",

The battery doesn't last very long & maybe for 2 hours at time, but it does charge up very fast. The bar oiler quit working for a bit, but I think it was clogged up with sawdust. I cleaned it & works fine. The chain is a bit small & narrow, but works fine for pruning & limb cutting. This saw by no means will cut your firewood for the winter. Use a bigger Stihl/Husqvarna/Echo for that. As long as you keep it oiled, sharpened, & charged this saw will do small jobs just fine.",
