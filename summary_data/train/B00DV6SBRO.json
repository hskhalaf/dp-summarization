I bought the Celestron 94308 observers accessory kit and by using the blue planetary filter on the 10mm kellner with the 2x Barlow you can see Saturn just below the moon. Switch to the 6mm Plossl eyepiece with the blue filter and the 2x Barlow and you can see Saturn at the size of an eraser head with enough clarity to see the space between the rings and the planet. For the moon the 10mm kellner with the 2x Barlow and moon filter works best. You can very easily see individual craters and canyons. We sit in a city of 50k at 5000 feet.",

We did end up purchasing a finderscope which has made it even easier to use. I don't think this will be the last telescope we own, but I am glad that we chose this one as our first telescope!",

We were able to easily locate stars and planets with it though. The vertical hold is great so it won't move around when little ones fight to see inside it and bump the table it is on. Honestly, the lenses aren't really made for more then just locating. The best I can say is you can see objects closer but certainly not in detail. But again as a kids first telescope I think it's great.",

The 3-inch aperture diameter is good for a beginner's telescope, and for the low price. It comes with a decent finderscope and two Kellner eyepieces: 20 mm (15x) and 10 mm (30x). You can see the moon's craters even with the lower-power eyepiece. I tried to use a separate 3x Barlow lens, but I couldn't see anything. Perhaps it's a focal-length issue. Overall, I recommend this telescope. It makes for a better child's X'mas present than a similarly priced refractor.",

      "text": "This telescope was ready to roll right out of the box. Set up and locating the moon took just a minute or so. The magnification was much greater than the larger scope that I have and with the optics that are more of the standard sizes I am finally able to use my t-adapter for my camera. Waiting for the weather to clear to get some photos shot and had to buy a T-Adapter / Barlow Lens to get the camera to work. Cant wait for the next full moon to test this out. If you are looking for a starter telescope for a great price I highly recommend this.",

Our experience with with the Celestron telescope couldn't be more different. It is sturdy, and we had it focused and working within minutes of getting it out of the box. My daughter loves this telescope. I wish we had found this first!",

Though a little difficult to point to smaller objects other than the moon, you do get used to it. The moon ended up a little too bright for my taste on a winter night sky in Seattle. I would definitely say that the accessory kit with the scope finder and the moon filter would eliminate and other difficulties you would have with the scope. If you plan on bird watching, I would suggest another scope as the first scope being a reflector causes you to view things upside-down. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase.",

Your going to see these things but they will appear very small and hard to define. I would say this is a great beginner scope, or maybe a scope to buy to see if u really want to spend hundreds on a better scope. The moon looks incredible by the way, almost too bright.",

After trying to focus on many different stars and the moon, we weren't able to truly see anything. The best view we got was a blurry pinpoint of light. On the bright side, she loves to use it to look at faraway objects in our home.",

The very center is somewhat clear, but the majority of the image seems distorted.",
