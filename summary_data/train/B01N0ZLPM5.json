It came loose the first time I put it in my pocket. The first pen cartridge lasted about 15 words while I was in a corporate safety audit. I am on the second cartridge now. I hope it lasts longer than the first one. I am going to request new cartridges form the seller",

You can still use this as a writing pen as well it comes with a second ink refill cartage.",
