My kids took them to their doctors apt. to keep them busy while waiting and their doctor laughed because he has 5 children himself and said it's much hard than it looks. He has tried playing w/ his sons and it wasn't easy. It's amazing how the kids pick this stuff up. I think it is the perfect tool for a child that needs to work on eye and hand coordination!",
