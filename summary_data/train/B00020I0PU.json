If you happen to be someone who suffers from chronic pain conditions, I highly recommend that you try this, it is definitely better for your liver to try something like this rather than narcotics. Highly recommend this, in fact I even have my mom using it too.",

I read a book about the effects of magnesium (and magnesium with calcium) called \"The Magnesium Miracle\" and started taking this every morning with breakfast several years ago. I no longer have those painful episodes. Sometimes, rarely, during the day I might find my fingers cramping, but I immediately take one or two capsules (I keep them in my car, too) and within 20 minutes I'm continuing to carpenter or play tennis with no problem. Thank goodness for this supplement.",
