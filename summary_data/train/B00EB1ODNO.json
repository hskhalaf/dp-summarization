Great value for the money and a nice clear image, even during daylight hours. We do use blackout shades on the windows closest to where we project, but even with some ambient light in the room we can watch it no problem. We have no need for a TV again.",

      "text": "Ok I looked at a bunch of projectors and considered purchasing one for around 1000 bucks. But when I seen this one with good reviews and about 300 dollars cheaper than the Benq I was looking at. I decided to go with it and I'm glad I did. The only reason I almost hesitated and buy this projector was because it's rated at 720p. And to be honest I can't tell my led46 inch tv looks any better in 1080p then this projector does. I got sitting on a little table in my garage right beside my ps4 and play games for hours straight on, and I couldn't be happier.",

We hooked our Star Wars 360 up to it, and turned on black ops 3D zombies with DLP link glasses, flipped the conveinent 3D switch on the projector remote and boom, mind blown by the 3D. AWESOME... My only complaint is the picture quality isnt the best, but to be honest? it really does the trick...1080p looks fuzzy, but 720 looks fantastic, and since netflix streams at 720p this is perfect. Highly recommend. and I will be buying a 1080p version if they ever release it.",

Using my PC for the source 95% of the time it really works flawless. Its bright, its beautiful, and it gets the job done. On the downside it offers little to help you square the image up in adjustments, so you have to set it up perfectly if you're trying to fit the image into a fixed screen. Also, dont forget its 16:10, limits your screen choices. Look forward to hopefully another year out of this awesome product.",

The gt750e was the best projector for me and I would have gotten another one when mine broke if they weren't discontinued making sure nobody put them on sale anymore. I am the sadness only because after 2 years I lost the best item I've ever owned to bugs.",

Set up only took 3 minutes. Yes, I am serious ONLY 3 minutes. I put it through test after test. Picture quality is outstanding in low level lighting. It is a great movie and gaming projector. I have been more then happy with the optoma and quality and am planning on buying a second one.",

Picture is great, 3D functionality is really cool with the PS3 and it is nice not needing to have any additional converter boxes (3D-XL). It has been up and running for 2 days now. Awesome Product. Cons: I wish this projector had a Lens Shift to allow for more flexible mounting positions. I wish their were some more options for 3D glasses that Support DLP Link. Overall: Very Satisfied",
