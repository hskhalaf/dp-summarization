It's actually made well enough for the price, it's just very lightweight and can't handle larger or heavier displays (even though it expands to accommodate larger sizes). If you're planning on displaying a typical cardstock poster, you're good; you have my blessing (haha). If you're wanting to display something heavier than that, don't buy this. It will lose its balance too easily. Also, their customer service is exceptional--this is a company that truly cares.",

I'm not sure what rocket scientist thought it would be a good idea to make a portable, collapsible easel but require a screwdriver to set it up. I do like the upper clamp part, that is a nice touch, again very flimsy, but functional. I will continue to use it until I get something better but it is so wobbly it will probably not see the light of day too often.",
