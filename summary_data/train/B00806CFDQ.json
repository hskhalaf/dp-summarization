The adjustable release poundage, 20 degree head pivot (to reduce string torque), and the hook design all work flawlessly together. Well worth the money. I like the buckle so I can maintain consistency when wearing. Other releases with buckles usually \"wear out\" the hole in short order but not this one. I have over 5,000 shots with this release and is still going strong.",

So I needed a new release and started shooting this one. The micro adjustments are incredible. You can finesse this thing so it becomes part of your body. The trigger can be adjusted to a hair or a log. My buddy has a the wiseguy by spot hogg and he likes mine better.",

      "text": "This is a great release. Both my wife and I shoot it. You can adjust trigger travel and weight to suit your preference. The trigger gets super light which is what I want in a release. It has an anti-torque pivoting head which helps minimize torquing though it isn't as torque free as a strap connector. The fold-back feature is awesome because it allows you to get it out of your way for pulling arrows or adjusting your bow.",

But I soon got used to using the hook on the release to grab the strip loop and it is great. Definitely buy one.",
