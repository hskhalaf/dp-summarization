Padded in the right spots, durable, breathable (but warm), dry quickly enough, and somehow seem to avoid most of the stink associated with sweaty feet living in hiking boots for several days. I own several other brands of wool socks, but that number is dwindling as these are far and away my favorite. Highly recommend!",

I'm sure these are tough socks and would be great for someone that can easily wear a hole through their socks. But I'm just looking for a nice warm pair of winter socks that can keep me warm on my long winter walks. So I settled on Wigwam Women's Merino Wool Cushioned Quarter Socks instead.",
