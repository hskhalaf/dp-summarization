It rained on our trip the tent kept the moisture out but the rain fly was damp and water didn't seem to bead off the way something really waterproof does.

The fly comes all the way down to the ground, which will be a good thing if/when I get caught in the rain, and forms a reasonable sized vestibule (good enough to shield shoes....).

Inside, there is plenty of room for a queen size air mattress and space for gear. The tent also comes with a gear loft and two side wall pockets which are quite handy. Very waterproof during a 30 minute downpour with plenty of ventilation. Highly recommended.",

The one quibble: not a lot of privacy without the rain hood, with the large mesh sides of the tent. Fortunately the rainhood has ventilation slots, so we didn't feel hot with the hood on.

Although a few dollars more, this model with aluminum poles is lighter weight and I will assume more durable than other fiberglass pole tents I've owned in the past.

Our boys take care of their gear and it does not go into storage wet so I can only assume there is a problem with the quality of the vinyl. We are contacting Alps to see what they can do.

I bought this to replace an old 4-person tent as I was looking for one that had good ventilation but also included a rainfly that covered the entire tent. Not only was the rainfly exactly what I had envisioned but it connects to the ground far enough out that ventilation was never an issue. Additionally - and a pleasant surprise - this footprint is considerably more spacious than the 4-person tent I replaced. No complaints and truly satisfied with this product.",
