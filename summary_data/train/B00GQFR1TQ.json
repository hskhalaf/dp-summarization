      "text": "I love this! With state law requiring babies to stay rear facing until at least age 2, and the infant seat behind the drivers seat to have my older child behind the passenger seat, I could not see the baby well even using a mirror system. This camera is great for quickly glancing and seeing that she's awake or see her \"startle\" while sleeping to know she's ok back there. Only complaint is that sometimes the way the sunlight comes into the car the camera switches between regular and night vision repeatedly. We are going to add tint to the back windows to help keep the sunlight impact at a minimum. Overall great system!",

      "text": "We were excited to receive and install our video monitor to watch our rear-facing infant, ditching the mirror for technology. Sadly, we were extremely disappointed in the video quality of this camera/monitor setup. You can't tell if your baby is awake asleep or breathing based off the images, we tried it both day and night and were very unimpressed. At this price point ($130) this should be crystal clear video, not grainy and poor quality. If you do purchase this, I highly recommend plugging it in and testing it out before you go to the trouble of running wires and installing mounts. 2 stars because it does provide video, just not well.",

It would get bumped constantly with kids getting in and out. I'll be returning it and trying a different brand.",

It gives me a huge peace of mind and is far safer to glance at the screen than taking my eyes off the road to look at a mirror in a mirror. Installed in just a few minutes. Didn't have the plug problem, mostly because the wife's car is new enough to shut off the outlets when the car is turned off (2013 Chevy Cruze). For older vehicles I'd recommend a multi-plug outlet with a switch so you won't have to remove the plugs or risk draining the battery. Looking at buying another one for my car.",

It's so much better and safer than a backseat mirror since you don't have to try hard to look in the rear view mirror to then find the reflection on the backseat mirror which usually doesn't provide a great angle to see the baby anyway. Backseat mirrors don't allow you to see the baby when it's dark either. I'm glad I stumbled upon this.",
