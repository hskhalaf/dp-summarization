I haven't tried them for warmth yet but they seem like they will be good. Follow up for Warmth they are a C at best. Just a quick 10 min outdoor car scrape off and my finger tips were frozen. Sorry folks, took my 4 start rating to a 2.5 star rating. Use liners in these and they work better.",

They are warm, yet flexible as as such gloves could be. I don't know what they cost as they were a present, but I love them.

They\u2019re not that warm. I was looking for something a little less insulating, but this took it too far. They\u2019re not comfortable. From the pictures, you can see the numerous large seams on the fingers. They\u2019re also not stretchy at all.
