I know I have carpel tunnel but I doubt I will ever have surgery for it. This splint is AMAZING!!! It is SUPER comfortable and easy to put on and take off. And it keeps my wrist in a neutral position where my wrist is neither flexed nor extended, therefore, allowing me to sleep throughout the night without my hand falling asleep. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product.",

If you have average to large hands and wrists, this may be VERY tight. The problem is the elastic panel inside the \"tube\" which is much tighter than the velcro straps you see on the outside. For me (male), the velcro adjustments were useless since the panel was already too tight around my hand, wrist and forearm. They're very comfortable IF they fit you. If they're tight, you'll have pain wearing them. They should have two sizes of these things.",

      "text": "This brace helps me sleep through the night because it quells my carpel tunnel symptoms. And for what it's supposed to do, it does. The only issue I have with it is, the straps. They work, but you have to pull them rather tight to get them to latch correctly. So it squeezes your arm pretty tight. I've found myself wrestling with it in the middle of the night because it's too tight. If they would make the straps just a half an inch longer, it would be so much better.",
