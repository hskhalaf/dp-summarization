I\u2019ve been a runner for almost 7 years and never had an issue until this past June. I began feeling pain in each of my ankles on the inside and outside at random times on both ankles. I was forced to practically walk at the pace I needed to stay comfortable. So I bought these braces and for over 2 weeks I\u2019ve been getting my pace back up! I\u2019m not running with an injury, just weakness. But I highly recommend them!",

The main goal is to be able to wear it for pain relief no matter the clothes or shoes you wear. In my case it doesn't work. Therefore, I bought a different, less expensive one and it eases my pain.
