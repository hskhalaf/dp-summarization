      "text": "We bought this a few years back when we moved to the Denver, CO, area. We only used it a few times. It did well enough. But the real test came recently (Jan 2017) when we cleared 8\" that hit one day, and then another 11\" hit overnight. Yikes. Although the snow was sometimes tighter than the machine itself, it did a dutiful job of clearing our sidewalks, drive and front area, as well as the same for the neighbor. I am very happy with this machine. It is not a heavy duty machine, and we knew that when we bought it. However, it did a superb job on our 11\" morning surprise!",

      "text": "Pushing it through snow isn't a cakewalk, but it does make the job of moving snow slightly easier. Here's an interesting problem I noticed that only slightly bothered me. The handle you crank to direct the direction the snow is thrown needs to be turned slightly past the bottom most point in its rotation to get all the way to one side. So pushing it and gravity cause the handle to fall back down, and directing the snow slightly more towards center. I found myself having to keep turning it to keep it pointed where I wanted.",

It's nice just plugging the machine in and going without worrying about gas/fumes.

It didn't appear to affect how it functioned though - it slogged through about 6 inches of medium wet snow like nothing & the cinders & gravel on the drive weren't a problem either. Just be careful where you aim it if you have a gravel base! It certainly does shoot the snow out!",

      "text": "At around $150 the unit represents good value. There are some notable drawbacks to electric models that should be expected: 1) Cords are a pain. I have a 30ft driveway. So just flipping the cord around so I don't run over it is annoying, but something you know going into it. Just worth restating, but it's smaller than most gas-powered throwers and doesn't have the price or maintenance annoyances, so for me, a worthwhile trade. 2) Used it for 4 or so snowfalls this year. It's not a bad little guy. Seems to like the heavier snow versus the powder. I never let it build beyond 5\" so I couldn't say how it handles more than that.",

Cons: In the pictures it looks quite large but check that it is 18\" and is just that. As it's very light don't expect it to deal with great with snow higher than 8\" with one go. The start switch is a little awkward but I guess if you have kids you don't want them turning it on too easy. I found pushing it with the handle higher made it get lowed to the ground to compensate for the light weight and not ride over the top of the snow.",

Once you get used to the cord - it's similar to holding a cord while vacuuming - you're all set. Pushes through a good 8 inches of relatively heavy snow - even the stuff the plow dumps at the end of the driveway - with relative ease. Just remember, this isn't a behemoth gas blower - so, if you're getting a blizzard, don't wait til all of the snow has fallen. Take this out in stages -- every 4-6 inches at a time. Still beats shoveling!",

If you don't want to pay $600 for a larger, gas thrower, yet want to move up to (I'd say) 8\" of snow, this thrower will do the trick. The only downside in my opinion is that you have to mess with the extension cord; but that is true of any electric tool.At least you don't need fresh gas and a new plug every year!",
