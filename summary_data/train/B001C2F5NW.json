      "text": "It takes 3-5 tries to get the cutter to engage. Then when it runs, you have to hold the can the entire time. If you don't, the opener may or may not just drop the can. The way the base sticks out, it guarantees that when the can lands, it throws the contents across the countertop. And, I mean, ALL the contents. They just get slinged. Horrible can opener from what should be a good brand. Save your money and buy ANYTHING else.",

Also it was manual and turning the handle was becoming hard to do. I love this can opener and I recommend it to others who prefer the older technology.",

This one, you just plug in the cord, put the can in its place and press down on the lever. It automatically stops and there is a magnet that catches the lid so you don\u2019t have to fish for it and risk cutting a finger. Highly recommend!",

      "text": "I simply can't imagine not having an electric can opener. This one is a bit pricey but worth it. It's quiet, has a very even smooth cutting edge and does hold the can and lifts the lid with a magnet at the end of the process...even heavy cans. This opener is just about as perfect as it can get. I'm quite pleased and certainly highly recommend it. I was a bit hesistant due to the higher price, but it's worth it...and more! If you purchase, you won't be disappointed! Love it!",

Now, I have only tried it on \"normal\" cans -- not giant cans of lard, syrup, etc.... It worked well on my large-ish sized tuna cans, and with few parts, separation and cleanup is easy. So-- if the can fits under the machine, it will be opened in a timely and tidy manner. Great value.",

To add insult to injury, the three year limited warranty gives us the privilege of paying Cuisinart $10 to ship us a replacement. And then we get to pay to ship the broken one to them. USPS one cost shipper is $5.20. So that's $15 to replace a $20 can opener plus the hassle of messing with them.
