(The leather felt \"cheap\"--that's the best way I can describe it). It was \"okay\" but for the price I was expecting much better ($60.00). I also bought the spalding ball for $30 and this one has a way better feel--despite it being slightly lopsided as well.

Its also made in Mexico, whereas the black lettered one (I bought in the store) is made in China. Funny as it may seem, the one from China seemed to be better quality than the one made in Mexico. Being that my son is more in touch with his masculine side, I had to return the PINK one and keep the black one I bought in the local store.",

Other composite balls can be really tough on your hands and some balls can even scrape and cut your fingers. Not with the Evo, which is a pleasure to dribble and shoot with this beautiful blend of grip and accurate bounce characteristics. Your grip does change with additional sweating either, as the ball wicks moisture away from the seams. BTW, i love the way the seams are laid into this ball. It is perfect. This is a great ball and I highly recommend it even with the slightly higher cost.",

This basketball is a very good quality ball and feels nice to dribble and shoot. When I need to get a new basketball there is a very good chance I will buy this again, or another of the same brand. I recommend for players of any skill but suggest the use of it indoors for it to last a very long time.",

This is the ball everyone uses when playing pick up games, everyone who plays indoors knows about this specific ball. Sorry tf1000, during your hiatus in producing the original full leather ball, these have surpassed you as the preferable choice in basketball.",

I suggest this to the new Spalding TF 1000's by a long shot, and so do all my friends, as whenever I brought it to school, all the players on my team wanted to play with this for practice. I wouldn't suggest using it outside, as if dust gets onto it, it's impossible for you to grip the ball and dribble/shoot. Also it will wear down the materials faster. Great indoor ball, probably the best one, as it is always picked for game ball either in League games or Rec games.",

I have used several full-size Wilson Evolutions, and they are the ball of choice at almost all courts. They bounce well, have a good feel, and great grip. They don't have the \"plasticy\" feel of I/O balls. If you're looking to purchase your daughter (or young son) an inexpensive basketball, go get an I/O ball for $20.
