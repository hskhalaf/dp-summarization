      "text": "These turned out awesome! Unfortunately I didn\u2019t take pictures of the cars until after I wrote in them. Two of these cards took normal 49 cent postage/ forever stamps, the ones with the deer in the trees. The other five all cost 70 cents to post. So for the snowman, Christmas tree, Santa skating, Santa on motorcycle, and the house, make sure you either use 2 forever stamps or go to the post office and pay for stamps which make denominations of 70 cents for each.",

I know that the people I sent these to yesterday will be 100% blown away. A few things to know: 1) I received very well-designed and constructed cards--no flaws in the ones I received. 2) You need to seal the envelopes with tape--not a problem for me. 3) They will cost more to send (.70 to .90 each for me) because they are a non-standard size. Again, these are special cards so it does not phase me...Great product.",

I had to buy some Elmer's glue to seal them and hope it wouldn't leach onto the card itself. I wouldn't buy these again because of this. Also, all the cards are red outside, not sure if that is shown, although that's not a big deal. Finally, the envelopes should advise that extra postage will be needed since the cards are heavier than normal (one was 1.3 ounces).",

Still, they're really pretty; guess the reason the price is low is they didn't want to spring for decent glue to seal the envelopes; few things are perfect, as I am reminded yet again.",
