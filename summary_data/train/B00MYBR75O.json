For Hi Def viewing the refresh rate is more than sufficient. Most importantly the stand is stable and being a center column, offers some placement and swivel abilities that a \"double legged\" support limits. It has a slightly deeper case but when profile for wall mounting isn't of concern, the depth offers substance. I recommend this product.",

      "text": "I love this T.V but the first one I ordered was defective. It was supposed to be brand new but had a dead pixel that was black. It was quite annoying on white backgrounds. I got a replacement and believe it or not, it was on the replacement as well. This time it was white, a bit smaller, and in the middle bottom of the screen opposed to the black one which was near the middle. So it's practically unnoticeable, and sometimes I forget it's even there. I've had mines for around half a year now. PROS: Clear and quality looks great. T.V turns off by itself when not in use after some time. CONS: Only 2 HDMI ports.",
