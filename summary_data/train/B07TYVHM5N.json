A light wind sounds like a hurricane and and the background din in a restaurant resembles an angry mob. Yes, they are rechargeable, but you get four volume settings and no other controls. They are comfortable but after six weeks one aid has died completely. Guess what? Past the return date. Any way, if you're looking to simplify buying a hearing aid, don't spend $2300 on a unit that does the same things a a $500 unit does. These are sound amplifiers, NOT intelligent hearing aids. And I REALLY wanted them to work. Big disappointment.",

Comfort, performance a durability fell well below my Starkey BTE aids. I was really hoping for these to work, but the number of problems after a few weeks made me conclude that these would need to go back for multiple repairs and they lacked the sound quality, had an intolerable amount of squealing interference, and were just not a trustworthy and sufficiently durable design to meet my requirements, so I returned them.",

I hear better with Eargo than any of my old hearing aids. I can hear people talking crisp and clear and background noise is not a problem with these. You can also call their support team and they are very helpful and knowledgeable. Much easier than going to an audiologist!",
