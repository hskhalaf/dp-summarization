The weight is light, but similar to other top brand nailers. But I love the low maintenance feature of this nailer and the smart point tip makes it easy to locate nail locations for this part-time DIYer. The tip also prevents the surface you're working with from getting scratched/dented. 100% recommend this brad nailer. I also have the angled 15 ga. finish nailer that is awesome, so adding this to my tool chest was worth it.",

Great idea! This new technology works.............so far ;) You get one clean hole instead of big dents all around the hole as most of these 18g nail guns are famous for. The whole is clean enough that with a touch of filler you can fill the hole without having to worry about how to fix nearby dents. Buy it,, you will like it!",

The pointed tip makes it easy to set a brad exactly where you want it. The tool is fairly light-weight, which also help with the precision. Despite being light, it has a very solid and well-built feel to it. The nailer design is well thought-out. The way the top comes apart by just flipping up the top is a nice touch, as is the simple way nail depth is adjusted with a wheel near the trigger. Way nicer than the old interface.",
