It's always fun to watch little hands and minds design and build, and adults have just as much fun as the kids. This is one gift that I expect to be around for years. We recently added this one with windows, fences, doors or whatever the kids decide their purpose. I strongly recommend Picasso tiles! We've seen homes, parking garages, and castles made from tiles.",

We originally got a light board to build upon and it was great to see the lights shine through the blocks. Unfortunately, the light board was not as well built as the PicassoTiles so we had to return it, but we look forward to adding a light table to our repertoire soon so that we can build tall glowing buildings. In the meantime, we will build anywhere we can - even 3D sculptures on the fridge.",
