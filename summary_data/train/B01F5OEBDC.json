The only minor downside is that they're pretty slippery for wiggly sleepers. I had no trouble, but my 4-year-old nearly lost his over the side of the bed a few times each night. The bag slithered off as he rolled and resituated. Otherwise, we were all happy!",

It's really light weight, providing no warmth even in relatively warm summer mountain conditions. We also bought one for my four year old grandson, and it was okay. It will be fine for spreading on lawn for picnics.",

Okay if you need light and compact for backpacking, but for normal use, no thanks. Had to return all 4 that I bought for my grandkids for Christmas.",
