      "text": "Really like the design -- must of had input from seasoned ice-fishermen. However, need to keep in mind its made in China... when first erected one front rods popped out of its hub and kept popping out... (faulting hub). Also one of the ceiling hub rods blew through the top corner... (poor sewing at the stressed end -- requires better reinforcement). In my opinion this tent was NOT erected and checked to confirm it functions properly at the manufacturing site or in USA before sent off to retailer. In summary, great design, but lacked Quality Controls... After some frustrating emails, Eskimo is sending new hub and rod; and I re-sewed the ceiling corner...",

I would have to do a revamp on the sled. Other manufactures have much better sleds. I built steel runners with some flat stock and 1/4\" round. Big improvment on ice without snow.",
