      "text": "Love this product. Great for crafting with the kiddos. We used it as part of American Girl theme birthday party . My daughter and guests enjoyed the stamps and stencils . I enjoyed that it came with a shirt to decorate. helpful hint since it was for a party with multiple kids I also purchased 18 inch doll shirts to decorate which worked well with this kit. plenty left over and we can still use for future shirt decorating even decorating a kid size T (which we did as well)",

I am so glad I checked them before my dgt's bday, so off to the craft store I go to buy ink pads! UGH! The shirts r kinda small n not soft. I found some super soft colored ones here on Amazon instead. The stamps r crappy too, but some real ones at the craft store along w/ ink pads lol! All-in-all don't waste ur money on this. #SuperBummed",

It comes with the ink pads,stencils markers and 2 shirts for a DOLL. i bought my niece a plan white shirt to go with it and as soon as she got home she went to work making matching shirts for her and her doll. She couldn't wait to call me and tell me that she used it. Since then she's also designed her own book bag. Definitely the perfect gift for a little girl!",

      "text": "I'm a little disappointed with this kit. The doll shirts and stencils are nice, but the fabric paint and applicators are a challenge. The applicators are small, and the paint has to be rubbed quite a bit onto the fabric to show up. My great a granddaughter got a little frustrated with the process. You will definitely need a sturdy piece of cardboard to put inside the shirt while applying, and tape to hold the stencil in place. FYI, there is no child size shirt included in this set.",
