Its got great features and I love it more than any other Android or iPhone. Good processor with amazing RAM capabilities. Games are smooth, Camera is awesome, people say that its not sufficient, but trust me its more than sufficient for normal user. If you are photography enthusiast then probably taking pics with a phone is foolish. But it captures the moments perfectly. All in all Google Nexus 5 rules and Seller is trustworthy.",

This means I have the same functionality as a \"WiFi only\" Android tablet, i.e. I can connect via WiFi but cannot make any phone calls on it. Resetting to factory default didn't help at all. It is permanently stuck in Airplane mode. I cannot even make a 911 call. Since I didn't buy it through Google, I'm stuck with it and extremely disappointed.",

The phone was in Japanese upon startup and the phone had already 2 text messages (dated 26 Aug) from YMobile suggesting someone must have got it free from them and sold it off onto amazon resellers. So I am slighty taken aback by this. I thought the phone was supposed to be brand new?",

And with optical image stabilization, you can stop worrying about shaky hands and blurry pictures. Better colors by day, less noise at night. The new HDR+ mode automatically snaps a rapid burst of photos and combines them to give you the best possible shot. Daytime shots are vivid with clean shadows, and night time shots are sharp with less noise. Capture more of your big moments. Real life doesn't fit in 4\" x 6\", so Nexus 5 comes with Photo Sphere. Create the effect of an immersive 360\u00b0 view that no traditional camera can match. When you capture the full scene, you share the full story. Speed and power to spare on a stunning 5\" display. Slimmer, lighter design. Nexus 5 is precision-built from strong materials, and the intelligently simple design showcases more of what matters to you.
