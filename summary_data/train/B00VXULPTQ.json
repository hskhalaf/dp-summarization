      "text": "Like others, didn't want to spend this much on a trash can. However, it was going to be visible in the kitchen, and with two larger type dogs, needed something to keep them out. This trash can really does/is everything you could expect from a trash can. Solid, solid construction. Easy to clean and we have had trash in the can for 4-5 days and no odor. What else could you expect from a trash can?",

      "text": "Loved this trash can for about two weeks until I had to clean the lid from a spill. I used a soft plastic \u201cscrubber\u201d that is made for delicate products (ie crystal), and stainless steel cleaner that I use on all of my stainless products. The lid, which appears and feels like stainless, is obviously plastic and was DESTROYED by just trying to clean it. The coating was removed and there are scratches all over the lid now. It looks absolutely terrible. I went back and read nothing saying that the lid is not actually stainless. I have never been so disappointed in a product and am upset every time I see the ruined lid.",

Beyond that, it seems to be built out of decent quality materials with good workmanship and it has a nice slow-close feature so it doesn't clang shut. Would I buy it again if I had it to do over? I'm not sure. It's a lot of money for a thing that just holds the junk you are throwing away, but I like the convenience of the recycling bin, and it has some nice touches. Value here seems like a very subjective thing.",
