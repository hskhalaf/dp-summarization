The case itself had enough room in it for me to store some tweezers and wire cutters as well to help complete the kit for what I needed it for. The soldier pen is reusable allowing you to drop new coils of solder directly into it and continue using it. Good package great price. I definitely recommend this to anyone who needs a complete set or newer to soldering and doesn\u2019t have any of the items needed to begin.",
