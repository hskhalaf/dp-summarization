I removed stuffing and noticed that it was different than the stuffing used in his. This stiffing was ground in bigger chunks and of poor quality memory foam.

The shredded foam filling redistributes itself constantly so that you either have flip and rotate the pillow, throw it in the dryer, or unzip it and try to move the foam on a weekly basis. That last one is very messy, with tiny foam bits always escaping no matter how careful you are. This pillow needs more care than some of my houseplants. Based on the fact I can get an equivalent (or better) night\u2019s sleep with many standard hotel pillows, I\u2019d recommend focusing your memory foam efforts on the mattress, and just get a decent regular pillow.",

After looking at the reviews and how bamboo is very versatile I got these. I also bought bamboo pillow cases to seal the deal. The pillow material is so comfortable. It has some weight to it but that is something I will adjust to quickly. The pillow held its form all night. I may get 2 more so that I always have a pile of them to sleep on. I am allergenic and this is going to really help me breathe better in the morning.",
