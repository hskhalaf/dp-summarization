      "text": "I have tried 3 versions of full-face masks, and this is my favorite. Why? The comfort of the fit around the face. All designs put pressures on various parts of the face. It's different, odd, and takes getting used to. Most of the others put pressure on your high cheek bone. This one puts pressures on the lower jaw more than the cheek. I find this more comfy for longer periods. I also found the face gasket bigger and softer than others. Also, the snorkel is easier to attach and remove, but I hope it doesn't fall off! That's my only concern, since it seems less secure than others. Overall, this is my best pick of the litter...",

It doesn't fog at all, if any water leaks in the mask, which was rare it left with your breath out the bottom. Also didn't add the stress on your mouth holding onto a snorkel and clearing. We will definitely buy another one!",

      "text": "We purchased 3 different brands of masks for a recent snorkeling/scalloping trip - this mask by far was the family favorite. Easy to use, great visibility underwater, no distortion of depth or hindrance in diving to retrieve scallops in 6-8 foot of water. No leaking experienced, adjusted easily to various family member's head sizes (we ordered small - tried by 2 men, 2 women, no children) and the snorkel closed and cleared perfectly when diving under water. We will order 2 more of these for future use and recommend spending the few extra dollars for this quality mask. You do look goofy, but the ease and comfort of this mask allowed for extended time to enjoy the water and sea-life.",

Water pretty much stays out of your face and breathing without a mouthpiece is great. Snorkel doesn't let water in and I didn't have much of a problem with fogging either. These type masks are becoming very popular where we were (Akumal), as lots of people had them. A great buy, operates as designed. Very happy customer.",

The other problem with this kind of mask is that they can be very painful if you like to dive (squeeze over your forehead because of the trapped air).",

Try as I might, I could not get it leak. Very fast learning curve. Much easier that old style mask and snorkel. Biggest challenge for anyone might be deciding on fit/size. Clear field of vision.",

It felt like you were breathing through a straw that was too small to let enough air in. On top of that, the mask started fogging up, even after we applied an anti-fogging agent. Its too late to return the mask now. I regret buy it.",

As others have noted, these type of masks are really only for shallow water or surface snorkeling. You can't dive very far with them due to the large volume of the mask and pressure against the face. Even if you try to blow out to compensate, you can't get to your nose to equalize. The mask has tightening pull-straps at the bottom which need to be re-tightened periodically.",

Even with that being said, the mask is still 100x better than the traditional snorkelling mask.",

When surfacing you breath as normal, no clearing the snorkel. I just ordered another for my son and I highly recommend. Can't wait to use it in the gulf.",

    "description": "For snorkeling enthusiasts who don't like the traditional snorkels, you'll be able to breathe easy with the Ocean Reef Aria Full Face Snorkeling Mask. This ingenious mask covers your entire face and lets you breathe the way you do naturally, using both nose and mouth. Your breath, like the defroster function in your motor vehicle, will circulate to the mask lens, eliminating fogging. The mask offers a wide field of view so you can take in everything below the surface. Your whole face stays dry thanks to comprehensive coverage, and the snorkel tube is integrated into the top of the Ocean Reef Aria Full Face Snorkeling Mask, keeping water out.",
    "rating": 4.4,
    "feature_bullets": [
      "180 PANORAMIC VIEW - get a better view of life under the surface with a wider field of vision. The full face mask design sits further back on the face, allowing for unprecedented peripheral vision compared to traditional snorkel masks.",
      "DRY TOP SNORKEL - explore sea life with confidence knowing you won't be surprised by a gulp of water from a wave. The dry-top snorkel protects the airway from crashing waves, saving the snorkeler from distractions.",
      "PURGE VALVE - For the daring snorkeler that wants to go below the surface, easily clear excess water from the mask with a quick exhale",
      "UNRESTRICTED BREATHING - Internal ventilation allows for ease of breath while allowing everyone to breath through the nose, or mouth, or both.",
      "FOG FREE - the ability to both inhale and exhale within the mask naturally keeps the sight free of fog with the use for expensive defog."
