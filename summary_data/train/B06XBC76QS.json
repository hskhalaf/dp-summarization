I know it would mess with the nesting factor, which is excellent as is. And a can of fuel, the 230 gram size fits inside perfectly. All in all, I am very happy with my purchase. And recommend to all, add the lid for the pan and I would call it perfect. The price too, very good. Keep up the great work, and let me know if you make a lid, Sincerly,drkroft",
