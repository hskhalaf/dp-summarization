These are so fast it's a joke to go back to spindled drives. 128 went in my laptop...240 went in my desktop. Realized I want more space...so the 480 goes in the desktop, 240 goes to my laptop, and 128 goes into a new laptop I just purchased for my better half. Battery life went up significantly with my laptop as well as these draw so little power... Very fast. Very happy.",

I bought this as a replacement for Intel 320 series since I needed more disk space so i thought of moving to a newer model.There's not much noticeable performance difference to be honest (windows experience rating went from 7.6 to 7.9) and it may be too early to tell if the BSOD has been eliminated. I was having BSOD with Intel 320, about 3 occurrences in the past 10 months. Not entirely sure if it were a software issue or a HW (SSD?) problem. I've been using this 520 for about 3 weeks now and so far so good. I'm happy with my purchase!",

I am on a mac, startup times are about 10 seconds though and i like that",

By the end of 2 weeks the BSOD crashes were just 5-10 minutes apart and I had to have the 240 GB Intel 520 SSD removed. Now that the original 240 GB WD Scorpio HDD is back in the laptop there have been no crashes at all which is typical with this laptop.",
