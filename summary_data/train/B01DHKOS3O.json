      "text": "So far I'm finding that the multivitamin is giving me a sense that I have more energy and a focus. I've certainly experienced more desire to get up earlier, get more done, and even exercise. My sensitivity to the ingredients is causing me to divide the dose to twice a day, rather than once, but that's not a problem, unless I forget. Overall, I'm satisfied, and perhaps in time I'll want to try other products down the road. For Now, I'll say that I think most would find this multivitamin to be a good choice for them.",
