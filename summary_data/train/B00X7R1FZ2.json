      "text": "This vacuum picks up more dust than any other I have ever owned, including Orecks. My only complaint is that the swivel feature pulls a bit when turning direction. I was hoping for a completely smooth easy vacuuming experience, whereby the turning does require a bit of control. I am updating this as I was using the hose portion with the small brush attachment to vacuum my wood blinds. The hose is SO rigid and hard to use. EVERY TIME you pull the hose up, the vacuum falls over. SO ANNOYING!",

I love the LED lights on the front of the upright which makes seeing the crud on the floor a little easier. I have only had this for a little while. I'm sure I will have more information to offer once I use it more.",

The clear plastic dust container is great for seeing how much dirt was in your carpets & rugs. The cannister is fairly easy to carry around but has a tendency to topple; I really wish it had come with (or you could buy separately) the wheeled caddy that some of the other sharks have; this is my main reason for giving it 4 rather than 5 stars.",
