      "text": "For some reason, it's unbelievably hard to find a laptop backpack that both actually fits and actually protects a 17\" laptop. Of all the ones I tried, this was the most rugged and well padded. However, it's designed for a VERY beefy 17\" (gaming) rig, and it's a bit bulky and heavy. My HP Envy 17 is certainly not a small machine, but it was swimming inside this backpack, and there's no strap to hold it in place. So I'm returning it in favor of something a little more svelte. I did love the fact that it stands up by itself.",

The backpack is solidly armored and holds its shape wonderfully, it's got an well-thought-out internal design with tons of pockets of many different sizes that can accommodate pretty much any piece of technology or accessories. The zippers unzip really far down toward the bottom of the bag so it's extremely easy to access stuff you may have stored in the bottom of your bag. This backpack is solid and a great deal - I highly recommend it.",

Unlike other backpacks that aren't designed specifically for electronics, this backpack has relatively few places in which the bag can rip (something my other favorite bags: The North Face Recon have all done in one or more places). Finally, the backpack just seems \"well balanced\" when carrying heavy electronics (such as the namesake Legion laptop), thus reducing strain on your back and neck.",

Realistically how many of you sweat carrying a computer backpack? Usually the distances are not too fat away for carrying the computer. Usually office - home, home - coffee shop, home - library.

Upon looking at the backpack for the first time, I can confirm the aesthetic and the interior is amazing. Sometimes we see pictures of products online, and when they show up at our doorsteps they don't quite meet our expectations, but for this backpack, it even looks better in person! I haven't fallen on my board yet (knock on wood), but knowing that I have this backpack my laptop will have more chances to see another day. Overall, for the price, I think this was the best backpack purchase I've made--ever. Great design, quality and overall AFFORDABLE! Great job, Lenovo!",

I plan on requesting an RMA (once I can figure out where to do so) because I love how solid this can can be. It's good and stiff and stands on its own when you need to to, however the arm mesh has come free from the stitching, and I don't really have the skill set to repair it myself, otherwise I would. It's a great bag otherwise, but if it's falling apart after less than 5 months, that's a bit concerning. That being said, someone else's mileage may vary.",
