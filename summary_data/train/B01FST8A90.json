We (parents), played it with them, as well, and it was fun for us, too, although I think the kids liked playing their friends better (it is called not parent approved, after all).",

So yes, it may not be for the adults, but it's a clean and engaging game full of references to school and youth life that speaks to kids.",

We played this game with our family in Christmas Eve (our family of 5 and two set of Grandparents, so ages 5 to 73.). We had the best time and so many laughs when we played. the second time we played we were already getting some repeat cards, but worth different prompts, which was fine, but u can tell we will need some expansion cards and to use the blanks that came with the game to keep it fresh. there is lots and lots of potty humor in this game, so if you're kids love that kind of stuff like mine, they will definitely love this game.",

We played several rounds and went to dinner but all they could do was ask when we could play again. They were ages (13 and 14) boy and girl. Definitely recommend.",
