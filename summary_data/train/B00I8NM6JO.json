The print quality is great whether I'm printing D&D minis, or larger functional objects.

Really prompt responses to any question I've had, and the one issue I've run into (caused by improper installation of hotend) their support was very friendly & helpful.

The manual for the slicer says there is an option to transfer the files to the unit, but there is no option as such in the real software I purchased SIMPLY3D for the slicer, and it allows total control of the printer via USB The only complaint I have left, is that all the companies selling filament have a different type of spool; most will not work with the spool holders on the back of this unit",

Granted, I'm not a 3D printing expert, but I viewed many tutorials that just didn't result in what I'd hoped. Print quality was okay. Layers were visible sometimes. Nozzle seemed durable, and the dual heads are nice. I just think this might be a printer for someone with a little more experience, patience, or both.

Fortunately I had a guru that confirmed the FlashForge Creator Pro as a solid choice with many features only offered at higher price points. I still have a lot to learn about fine tuning my prints, and I do recommend grabbing slic3r to replace the included slicing software, but I'm very happy with the 8 prints I've done in abs already. It's also nice to know that Mr. Tang at FlashForge is ready to help based on the very nice email I received with the manual just after I placed my order.",

I have built another 3D printer in the past and getting things tuned just right was a worry of mine. This one was up and printing good quality prints right out of the box within about an hour. I had one small issue with the Z-axis making some noise. I emailed Tang and as other reviews have stated he emailed me back almost right away. I followed his instructions and everything was taken care of. Very pleased with the printer and the customer service.",

However, the printer works like a champ so far. (I'll update if this changes) Edit: 3 weeks of owning it, 190 hours of printing, almost 1km of filament! Keeps on printing!

It took me a while to get everything dialed in, but if you take notes on temps, bed surface prep, print speed, and the like, you'll soon figure out what works best for your machine (PLA is my favorite; for me, it prints best on blue painter's tape with an unheated bed and a really light layer of glue stick).",
