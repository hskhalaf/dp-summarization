I have noticed that my dark spots especially around my chin area have been lightly disappearing. My face looks way more moisturized and bouncy. I have been using the cream for a month now and using sunscreen during the day. It will leave you looking really oily but honestly it's worth it. I use it in the morning and when it's absorbed in I'll use a sunscreen (At night I'll put an eye cream and use the Belif too). Overall, I am beyond happy with this cream it's improved my texture beyond my expectations 10/10.",
