I liked that it was deeper as I needed the extra space and I do have an open space behind the wall. The only inconvenience was that I had to attach an extension to the 4 inch stud to attach the safe attachment bolts",

The keypad has a hidden lock to open the safe with a mechanical override key (2 included) . This key is used only when batteries are dead or keypad is damaged. Since this safe is 8\" deep we recommend hiring a contractor or a handyman for the installation. Made for deep walls 8\" or more.
