I don't even use it intensively, probably only charge it 3 - 4 times since I owned it. I couldn't charge the headset anymore. Every time when I plug in the charging cable, the charging indication light only flash red for 1 sec and all dead. Very disappointed about the quality of product from Sony. :(",

Also tested them in two transatlantic flights and did a pretty good job with the planes engines cutting off the low frequencies but leaving the mid-high ones. However it was super effective with voices and crying babies... Didnlt hear any of that. Comfortable to wear for hours and the voice call quality is much better than using your phone",

One more thought - these would be better if the ear cups could rotate further and fold flat. This takes up a large amount of space in my backpack and would not fit in a laptop bag. They may be wireless, but they are not very portable.",

The sound was good, no sound leak and the ANC was much more comfortable than the Bose Quiet Comfort 35s. The ears did get hot and a little sweaty after a few hours of listening to music but it was tolerable. I ended up returning them because they were uncomfortable on the crown of my head and because I disliked that it was mostly all plastic.",

In addition, the noise canceling feature on this headphone amazing. It really blocks a lot of noise. There is no hissing sound like the Beats Studio 2.0 makes. The sound quality is on par with some of the best and most expensive headphones out there. Its a little on the heavy side, but it fits just great. Best of all, for the price on amazon (~$230) I think its a steal!",

      "text": "The headphones are soling and they are extremely comfortable. They sync very easily and have an extremely long range ( I went to my kitchen which is downstairs and it remained linked. The noise cancellation is quite impressive and allows me to eliminate any noises that I like to avoid throughout the day. The battery life is also great and the controls are nice to use and feel solid although touch gesture controls on more expensive headphones are better.",
