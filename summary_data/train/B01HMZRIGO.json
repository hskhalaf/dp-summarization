      "text": "It's a good laptop, but at the time of writing the description is incorrect. It is NOT a quad core i7 7700, it is a dual core i7500U and that's quite a difference. With this in mind, it is still a good value laptop. In my opinion, the compromises have been made in the chassis - the screen has quite a lot of flex; and also the hard drive which seems a bit slow. When monitoring with Task Manager, I regularly see the disk usage stuck at 100% with correspondingly poor performance. Apart from that, it's very good - attractive, light, good performance and good value.",

With Windows 10 pre-installed, X Series is ideal for daily computing and entertainment tasks. \n\nTo ensure high quality images, ASUS Splendid Technology has colour temperature correction to reproduce richer, deeper colours. Most LED panels emit blue light - the main cause of macular degeneration and retinal problems. ASUS Eye Care mode effectively reduces blue light levels by up to 33 per cent to make reading comfortable, and to protect you from potential eye fatigue and other ailments.\n\nASUS X Series gives you a wide array of connectivity options that include USB 3.0 Type-C, HDMI and VGA ports, a 3-in-1 SD/SDHC/SDXC card reader, and more to ensure compatibility with various peripherals and devices. The reversible USB Type-C port ensures a proper connection every time, right-side up, or upside down. USB Type-C gives you data transmission speeds of up to 5 Gbit/s - almost 10 times that of USB 2.0. You can transfer photos, music and even large video files in a fraction of the time - transferring a movie with a file size of 2 GB takes less than two seconds.\n\n\n\n\nBOX CONTAINS\n1 x Asus X556UA Notebook\nConnection and Power Cables\nUser Documentation",
