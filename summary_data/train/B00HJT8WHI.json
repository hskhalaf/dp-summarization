There is absolutely no slippage at all. They were shipped flat and there are no ripples at all. I've only been using them for a few days, but they don't seem to mark easily. I would definitely recommend these mats.",

It also has good feel when writing on it and my optical mouse moves smoothly without the need for a mouse pad. The only negative is that the bottom is smooth so the pad can slide around on a smooth desk surface. This pad would be greatly improved if it had a slight tackiness to the underside, but overall I am pleased with my purchase.",
