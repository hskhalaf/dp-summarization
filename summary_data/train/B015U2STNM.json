If I keep this up he is going to have a better shop than me shortly :) This is worth every penny. Has enough power and wheel weight to sharpen everything we have thrown at it just as long as you don't bear down on it too hard.",

They deform immediately after touching the tool and leave a \"serrated\" edge that will never leave a good cut. I bought this to sharpen lathe tools and as a beginner I just could not figure out why I couldn't get a clean cut off ANY of my tools. I would buy the grinder again if I had to, but would never use these wheels again for anything requiring a fine edge.",

Go to a nut and bolt distributor and get four 9/16 NSS washers for each wheel, problem solved. I spent 25 cents for each. With that being said, you'll have a smooth, quiet machine with ample power.",

My suggestion would be to add an inside hex on the end of the shaft for an allen wrench or an outside hex for a wrench or to put the flats on the shaft like other grinders have.",
