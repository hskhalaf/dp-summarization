All the resources I've come upon have one thing in common: naming this brand and admonishing people not to buy. They all call it \"toxic\" and \"poisonous,\" which are the only words I can think of to describe it also. A healthy hedgehog should live up to around 7 years on a proper diet. Pets that eat this food average around 2. Please do not buy your pets this food!!",
