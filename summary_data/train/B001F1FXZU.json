Better yet, my LDL is down to 69 and my HDL is at 73, giving me a good ratio. I rarely write reviews, but the truth is, this can be a gift to those of us hoping to avoid statins.",

    "description": "A healthy cholesterol level is an important part of heart health.\u2021 CholestOff Original is made with Reducol, a proprietary blend of plant sterols and stanols (also called phytosterols) that can help lower LDL (\u201cbad\u201d) cholesterol by reducing the absorption of dietary cholesterol into the bloodstream.\u2021 The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Therapeutic Lifestyle Change Guidelines recommends 2,000 mg of plant sterols and stanols as part of a therapeutic diet to help lower cholesterol. However, many Americans only consume 200 mg through their diet. CholestOff Original provides the additional 1,800 mg of plant sterols and stanols needed to help meet what the NCEP recommends for cholesterol reduction. Products containing at least 400 mg per serving of plant sterols and stanols, eaten twice a day with meals for a daily intake of at least 800 mg as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol.\n\nBRAND STORY\nBy",
