That's the way it should be. Adjustment of the collar is simple and effective. And should I mention we also realized that not all bells are made alike. We have had several other brands and the volume and clarity of these bells are far superior to the others. Honestly, why have a collar with a bell you can't hear? Buy a couple, because just like cats, you can't have just one !!!",

The colors are so bright and the quality is far above the ones we normally buy at pet stores for 2-3X the price.

I wish they would place the bow at the very center back and only sew it to the outside part rather than through both sides of the strap. Otherwise, it is perfect!",

      "text": "I thought I would just highlight a few things since we really like these collars. First is the breakaway catch. Not too easy to open, yet easy enough if it hooks on something. That's the way it should be. Adjustment of the collar is simple and effective. And should I mention we also realized that not all bells are made alike. We have had several other brands and the volume and clarity of these bells are far superior to the others. Honestly, why have a collar with a bell you can't hear? Buy a couple, because just like cats, you can't have just one !!!",

This collar far exceeds my expectations in that department. My cat barely had to pull against the collar for it to pop open. Super happy with this purchase.",

The adjuster doesn\u2019t hold strong against wrangly kitties, so make sure you\u2019re willing to readjust if you need to remove it frequently! Still a cute product, and matches my kitties personalities :)",
