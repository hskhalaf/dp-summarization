Sooooo... as cute as this style is and as much as I wanted to be part of it, there's nowhere short of hand-made for $65 a pair that I could participate in this adorable fashion trend. I've looked for over a year. These were cheap enough, even though other reviews are these small feet and short folks, I decided to try it anyway since the mention it stretches. HALLELUJAH THEY FIT!!! They are so soft & they stretch plenty big for my giant's body. I could have been 6'2 and comfortably worn them. They are pretty thin, but very soft... and I am going to go buy several pairs.

I will say, though, having wide calves means these are just tight enough that I don't like to wear them mid-calf with lower boots. I could, but then the socks feel too tight.

They didn't make a mistake and sent me the wrong color because the label on the socks do in fact say burgundy. Enough about the color, the socks are also thin. Cute but thin. I'm keeping since I'm sure I'll end up using them just not this weekend like I intended...color doesnt go. Bummer....",
