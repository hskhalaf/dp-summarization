It also comes with a decent instruction guide and a few recipes. The only thing I do not like about it is I washed all the plates prior to using it and I've used mine about 3 times altogether so far, and it puts off a very foul smell. I believe it comes from the actual machine itself which you cannot submerge in water to clean. It doesn't seem to effect the taste of any of the treats but the smell from the machine lingers awhile.",

Unfortunately the shape only comes out well on one side- not both \ud83d\ude29 Here\u2019s my best tip: 1. After you bake halfway- flip it and fill the mold again to stick both halves together! 2. Less is more if using rising cake flour! 3. One and half tablespoons of cake mixture is enough to create the half shape- then one heaping tablespoon for the other half.",
