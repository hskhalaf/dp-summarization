If you are giving it away as favors and it is not staying in your home then by all means purchase this pack. If it is staying in your house then heaven help you because you will be waiting for it to dry to then peel/chip off after it is stuck all over EVERYTHING.",

But shipping was fast, considering I ordered last minute. Good quantity. The only down side were the ones that were dried out. But possible manufacturer issue. Other then that I would most likely order again.",
