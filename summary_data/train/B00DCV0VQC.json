After using it for nearly a year after a cleaning, teeth still looked pretty good. When I ran out of it for a few weeks, I noticed a build up of more staining and plaque. Dog doesn't seem to notice any change in taste of food. For a 16 pound dog, this small bottle lasts almost a year, so it's a great value too!",

I'm not suggesting that this would happen with your dog or that it isn't a good product, I'm just saying that it didn't work out for us. Her health is more important than using this for clean teeth and fresh breath. I'll just try brushing.",
