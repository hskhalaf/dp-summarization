The directions, although short and jammed, were understandable. I can see a scatter-minded builder getting frustrated though. Overall quality of the material is great. The cushion is a bit on the firm side, but the foam gives after a second or two of sitting on it. My only fear is the cushion breaking down quickly, but only time will tell.",

The screws and pre-drilled holes were not misaligned, but some of the screws refused to latch properly for some time. It was a frustrating 40ish minute project, that should've taken 15. Additionally, my bench arrived with a small tear, that is about a 1\u20442 inch long (pictured) on one side (I turned that side to the wall).",

It was difficult to get some of the holes lined up to get the screws to line up straight and needed to put some force to hold it all together and make it fit. Otherwise, once put together, useful product especially for the price point.",
