It's hardy, I've had it in sand, bumped on sidewalks, dropped while walking and it continues to shine. I'd get this camera again in a heartbeat.",

Also, get a 2GB or 4GB card when purchasing this camera or just lower the mega-pixels to 3 or 5. Pros: Price! Large screen Good movie mode Nice software Easy to Use Great photos Common batteries SD Card Cons: Uses batteries quickly No Image Stabilization",

I was uncertain whether or not a child of this age could use a digital camera, but she had no trouble at all (except for chopping off heads for the first hour). Very young children can really only point and shoot, and will need help with zoom and other features, but this camera is wonderful for small hands. Its many features will make it useful as the child grows and skills develop. We now have many puppy pictures, but we also have macros of violets growing in the woods as her view of the world expands. I highly recommend starting children with this camera.",

Macro capabilities are pretty nice and unexpected, which my mom loves so she'll be able to take pictures of her flowers this spring. For someone who needs a basic camera that \"just works\", this is it. If you need anything more than the basics, you'll need to look elsewhere.",

I don't even use the highest setting when I take pictures so 7.1 MP is more than enough for my use. For those who want to blow up to poster sizes, you should get an SLR, but for a normal everyday use camera this is the one to get. You could get more features for the price they are asking for but this one looks too cool.",

    "title": "Canon PowerShot A470 7.1MP Digital Camera with 3.4x Optical Zoom (Gray)",
    "description": "Color:GrayFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n Sleek and sensational, the PowerShot A470 comes in four eye-catching colors that will get you noticed. Plus, its got everything you need to make shooting fast and fun. Theres the 7.1-megapixel resolution, a 3.4x optical zoom lens, a large 2.5-inch LCD and a full range of performance features, including enhanced Face Detection technology and a DIGIC III Image Processor, to keep every image looking its best. Vertical Shooting has never been easier, either -- just press the Print/Share button. Its that simple! \n\nPowerShot A470 Highlights \n\n\n\n3.4x optical zoom in action Fully-automatic 7.1-megapixel digital camera with 3.4x optical zoom The PowerShot A470 has 7.1 megapixels of imaging power that make it easy for you to create stunning pictures of radiance and lush color. Even the tiniest details -- a drop of dew on a flower petal or a childs fleeting smile -- are captured with all the resolution you need to email, print, crop, and even enlarge. For close-ups that will impress you with their clarity and true-to-life brilliance, youve got a genuine Canon 3.4x optical zoom lens that brings distant images into focus with one press of a button. \n\nLarge, high-resolution 2.5-inch LCD makes on-camera viewing easy The cameras 2.5-inch LCD screen gives you the big picture, whether youre shooting, reviewing or showing off your images. This high-resolution screen offers a crisp, clear picture and bright, it also features Night Display for easy viewing in low light. \n\nPowered by AA batteries Conveniently, you dont need to worry about running out or recharging of batteries. Since AA-size batteries can be purchased at any store, simply get new ones locally. \n\nWith Canon's Face Detection WB (right), skin tones are not affected by overall lighting Enhanced Canon Face Detection Technology Canon's powerful Face Detection Technology delivers even better results with the new A470. The Face Detection Technology continues to recognize faces in a scene, and concentrate exposure (daylight or flash) and focus upon them. But the A470 adds more: Face Detection WB means the camera concentrates upon faces when calculating white balance for the best possible skin tones. Face Select and Track lets the A470 user highlight one face among several in a scene, and the camera concentrates on that person, even as they move around the scene. Face Detection Technology is a powerful contributing factor in Canon's new Motion Detection Technology. \n\nDIGIC III image processor With DIGIC III, your images boast superior quality, the camera operates at top efficiency and battery life is enhanced. Whats more, DIGIC III enables Canons Face Detection Technology and Red-eye Correction to give you better, more true-to-life people shots. Simply press the Shutter Button halfway down, and the camera automatically pinpoints the faces in the scene and chooses the ideal focus point. The camera controls exposure settings and flash to keep every face looking bright and natural. Red-eye Correction can be handled in-camera, in two ways. The entirely new Red-eye Correction during shooting uses the Face Detection Technology to recognize and remove red-eye from flash images as they're taken, before the file is written to the memory card. It's also possible to correct red-eye during image playback, using simple settings in the A470's menu. \n\niSAPS Technology is an entirely original scene-recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos, iSAPS works with the fast DIGIC III Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy, as well as exposure and white balance. \n\nRed-eye Correction Red-eye correction provides three options for removing red-eye from subjects in flash pictures.  * The new Red-eye Correction during shooting actually identifies and corrects red-eye in human subjects as pictures are taken. \n * The A470 can be set to automatically detect and correct red-eye during image playback. \n * The user can manually locate any red eyes in a scene during image playback on the LCD screen, and command the camera to remove them. \n\nCapture clear pictures, even when your subject is moving Motion Detection Technology automatically reduces blur Life doesnt stand still for picture-taking. Thats why Canon included its advanced Motion Detection Technology in the PowerShot A470. This sophisticated feature works in the background to instantly evaluate how fast your subject is moving. Then it automatically selects and sets the optimal exposure and ISO settings to keep everything looking sharp and clear. So whether youre shooting a bride walking down the aisle, a ballet recital or even a childs soccer game, you can relax and shoot with confidence knowing youve got the picture you intended. \n\nHigh ISO The PowerShot A470 features ISO 1600 and High ISO Auto settings that reduce the effects of camera shake and sharpen subjects in low-light situations, giving you greater shooting flexibility. \n\n14 Shooting Modes including 10 Special Scene Modes With 14 shooting modes to choose from, youre ready for whatever shot comes your way. \n\nVertical shooting is fast and easy The PowerShot A470 lets you shoot great Vertical Images -- everything from tall buildings to fun, family photos -- more conveniently. Turn the camera, then just press the Print/Share Button. Instantly, the camera displays your scene in the proper vertical orientation. You dont have to worry about re-arranging your hand position. Youre free to concentrate on setting your scene, composing your shot or coaxing subjects to smile. \n\nSleek, modern design in 4 bold colors The PowerShot A470 tells the world who you are. Its refined, distinctive design is a perfect reflection of your good taste and individual style. But it's just the beginning of what makes this camera so uniquely you. The PowerShot A470 is available in a choice of four exciting and dramatic colors. Choose the one that perfectly reveals your personality, your singular style or your point of view. There's Gray, Blue, Red or Orange. No matter which color you choose, the PowerShot A470 will keep the attention focused on you. \n\nThe Complete Print Solution \n\nThe PowerShot A470 features a convenient Print/Share Button for easy direct printing and downloading, plus ID Photo Print and Movie Print with select Pixma photo printers and Selphy compact photo printers. \n\nThe Print/Share button makes direct printing easier than ever. Simply connect the A470 to a Canon Pixma photo printer or Selphy compact photo printer or any PictBridge compatible photo printer, press the lighted Print/Share button and print! Also use the Print/Share button to transfer images to a computer (Windows and Macintosh). \n\nPrint your own ID photos in 28 different sizes or use the Movie Print function to output multiple stills from a recorded movie on a single sheet with a Canon Selphy compact photo printer.",
