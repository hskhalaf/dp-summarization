Instead of my cats walking out of the box and traipsing litter across the floor, they get out of the box walk toward the corner and by the time they walk around the box onto the floor - all of the litter is off their feet. So with the mat and just facing the box into the corner - my floor rarely has litter on it. The mat is easy to clean. I just hold it over the trash can and the litter just falls off.",

This design has little holes and the litter gets trapped in there so it doesn't spread it. It actually works. The pricepoint is very good, compared to some very expensive mats that get good reviews. But I'll stick with this one because it works and the price is very worth it. Will be getting two more for the other boxes in the house. It does take a little time for it to relax from being rolled up but if you put something heavy on the corners it will do so in a couple days.",

I've tried washing this thing in the bath as well as the washing machine probably 4 times now and it still reeks. The worst of it is the odor clings to whatever the mat makes contact with (the cats, the carpet, even walking nearby). This does not seem normal and this cannot be healthy. I'm tossing it because I'm tired of this toxic odor infecting my entire house.",

I thought it would be a little larger, but it's still a very good size. Much better than my old litter mat.",

The first mat did take a while to completely uncurl, but was great once it did. The second one has STILL got some curve in the corners despite our best efforts, and is made of a thinner, floppier plastic. Would be a 5 star product if not for the inconsistencies.",

Other types of mats will only trap the loose litter but difficult to clean thoroughly, or act as a placemat but not actually keeping litter ON the mat. This thing is awesome.

We have tried pretty much every other litter mat out there and they all fail to keep the litter on the mat and allow it to get tracked everywhere. This litter mat is awesome. It really does keep the litter in the little holes, and very very little gets onto my floor. I was actually quite surprised that it worked the way it was advertised since none of the others I've had ever really work. I would definitely recommend this litter mat. Great product.",

Nothing's 100% effective, but it's miles better than it was before.",
