I chopped 4 - 3 inch bush trees that were 7 feet high and then chopped them up. No constant chain adjustment like the ryobi. In fact, not one at all. Chopping them up became much easier as the saw comes apart from the pole so you don't have to stand 5 feet back and lose leverage on the ground. con- bit heavy. I had to go on a roof to reach some branches and the weight made it a bit scary. Very quick on cutting through though.",

It cuts okay as well, but with a chainsaw (whether gas or electric) you need to lubricate the chain/bar interface. Most saws use a metering valve that pumps oil to the bar and sprocket during use, but this saw does NOT have a pump; it is gravity-feed to the oil passage and the bar oil will strart leaking immediately and continue until the reservoir is empty. It detracts from the efficient use of the saw and is a pain to operated. Don't buy this junk!",

Be forewarned, it is also quite top heavy when the pole is extended, so wear a hard hat and be prepared to hold it upright when it cuts through the limb.",

      "text": "This saw is well made, except for the blade oiling setup. The operator is required to press a button periodically in order to keep the chain oiled. Before the first hour of use was over, the button perforated and I had to use an oil can to oil the chain from then on. Otherwise, I was pleased with the strength of the saw cut and the construction of the telescoping pole. Remington just needs to beef up the oiling system. That button needs to be made of tougher material.",

When I shopped the market the only other product that got my attention was the stihl 2-stroke extendable saw.($420.00)This Remington product, in my opinion, is directly comparable in quality, doesn't burn mixed gasoline and works with the push of a button.
