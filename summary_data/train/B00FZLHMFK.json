      "text": "Looks great, feels great. Screen clarity is excellent, and love the S Note functionality to do sketches or 'whiteboard' type brainstorming. Using the pen is amazing. The only feature I found a poor experience with was internet browsing. Both shipped browsers - Internet and Chrome - do not appear to perform consistently, requiring constant closing of the apps from the Task Manager. These crashes were more prevalent when viewing pages with embedded multi-media such as videos. For example, I view bloomberg.com on my Samsung Chromebook just fine, but on my Galaxy Note 10.1, not so nice. Perhaps I need to try a different browser like Opera or Dolphin HD.",

I like the continuous flat surface from side to side, without separate bezels. Very useful S - Pen that allows one to have very fine cursor selection and to produce drawings and hand written notes. It supports several Samsung functions that I find useful, if not every day. The multi - screen functionality is good, but it can result in very small font sizes.",

    "title": "Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1-inch Tablet (White) - (Quad Core 1.9GHz Processor, 3GB RAM, 16GB Storage, WLAN, BT, 2x Camera, Android 4.1 Jelly Bean) (New Edition for 2014)",
    "description": "Watch HD movies, read e-books, thumb through photos, and more using the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014 Edition). This tablet pairs a bright 10.1-inch, 2560x1600 resolution screen with Dolby Virtual 5.1 Surround Sound for immersive multimedia enjoyment. Front and rear-facing cameras let you take photos and HD videos or video-chat with friends. The included S Pen expands the tablet's functionality by offering shortcuts and translating your handwritten notes into text. Android 4.1, Jelly Bean offers an exceptionally smooth user experience, and an active battery life of up to nine hours lets you work and play longer.\n\nGALAXY NOTE 10.1 2014 EDITION\nAT A GLANCE:\n * 10.1-inch, 2560x1600 resolution display with over 4 million pixels\n * Exceptional performance with 1.9 GHz quad core processor and Android 4.1, Jelly Bean\n * 8 MP auto-focus rear camera and 2 MP front-facing camera\n * Dolby Virtual 5.1 surround sound for music, movies, and games\n * S Pen allows you to take handwritten notes and access shortcuts\n * Offers up to nine hours of active battery life\n * 16 GB onboard memory\n\nSHARP 10.1-INCH DISPLAY WITH OVER 4 MILLION PIXELS\nThe Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition features a 10.1-inch, 2560x1600 resolution display that has more than 4 million pixels--that's 2 million more pixels than a typical HDTV screen. The result is bright colors, vivid text, and clear graphics. Thanks to a pixel density of 299 pixels per inch (PPI), the tablet renders images fluidly and brilliantly.\n\nWATCH MOVIES, TV SHOWS, AND MORE IN HD\nMade for watching high-definition video, the Galaxy Note 10.1 has a 16:10 aspect ratio, so HD content fits perfectly.\n\nBUILT-IN CAMERAS FOR PHOTOS, VIDEO CHATS, AND MORE\nEquipped with an 8-megapixel auto-focus rear camera with an LED flash, the Galaxy Note 10.1 allows you to snap pristine photos and record 1080p HD video. The tablet also has a 2-megapixel front-facing camera for video chats with friends and family members.\n\nAnd like Samsung's Galaxy S4 smartphone and the Galaxy Camera, this tablet includes fun photo features. Eraser allows you to remove photo distractions with just a touch, Dual Camera lets you take front and back photos simultaneously, and Drama Shot captures every frame of subjects in motion.\n\nTHIN DESIGN AND FAST PERFORMANCE\nThis powerful tablet provides fast performance in a sleek design that's comfortable to hold. It features a powerful Samsung processor for fast Web browsing and multitasking and longer battery life.\n\nDOLBY VIRTUAL 5.1 SURROUND SOUND FOR RICH AUDIO\nFeaturing Dolby Virtual 5.1 surround sound, the Galaxy Note 10.1 allows you to hear audio exactly as it was recorded, making the tablet great for enjoying movies, video games, TV shows, and music.\n\nMy Magazine. Scrapbook. TAKE HANDWRITTEN NOTES AND MORE WITH THE S PEN\nIncluded with the Galaxy Note 10.1 is Samsung's S Pen, which is a digital pen that allows you to jot down notes, phone numbers, search terms, contact information, and more right on the display. Samsung's handwriting-to-text engine automatically converts your written notes to digital type. The S Pen offers precise control along with access to shortcuts to a wide range of S Pen functions via the Air Command feature.\n\nCURATED CONTENT WITH MY MAGAZINE\nBuilt into the Galaxy Note 10.1 is Samsung's My Magazine feature, which you can personalise with your favorite news sources, celebrities, sports teams, musical artists, and Twitter streams. Access it from the home screen by simply swiping up. My Magazine provides an easy, convenient way to keep track of everything that's important to you.\n\nMULTI WINDOW LETS YOU VIEW TWO APPS AT ONCE\nWith Samsung's Multi Window feature, you can place two applications side by side and use them both at once. You can drag content from one app to the other, or even open the same app twice--handy if you're writing two email messages at once, or you want to reference two websites side by side.\n\nFUNCTIONS AS A UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL\nWatching television just got simpler, thanks to the Galaxy Note 10.1's built-in IR blaster, which allows you to use the tablet as a universal remote control. The Samsung WatchON feature lets you type in your zip code and cable provider to browse and search current TV listings and get personalised recommendations based on your viewing history.\n\nFIND POPULAR APPS THROUGH GOOGLE PLAY\nThere you can find great apps for your Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet, including Instagram, Pinterest, and Facebook, along with special apps designed for the Samsung S Pen. If you like to doodle or draw, the pre-loaded Sketchbook app is the perfect creative outlet.\n\nEDIT WORK DOCUMENTS WITH POLARIS OFFICE AND SHARE WITH GROUP PLAY\nFinish up your presentation and enter data into your spreadsheet while on the go with Polaris Office. This productivity app lets you view and edit Word, Excel, PDF documents and more--wherever you are. And if you want to collaborate with a co-worker or share media, Group Play makes it easy to share presentations and photos over Wi-Fi.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 also offers a folder structure that will be familiar to PC users, making it easy to locate and organise important work files.\n\nSketchbook.
