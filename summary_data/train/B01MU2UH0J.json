They came clean straight out of the box, no issues, smudges, or creases. The gum sole is clean no discoloration or anything. Since I purchased these in white and unfortunately theyre not leather, I sprayed them 3x within 2 days with canvas water repellent before I wore them. They fit exactly how a 10.5US should. They werent too big or too tight. Great summer pickup.",
