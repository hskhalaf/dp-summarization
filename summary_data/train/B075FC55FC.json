However there is a lot of misinformation about this so my cat has a low phos, high protein diet. I tried to email the manufacturer from the website about this but got no response. On a high protein diet cats are already getting plenty of these amino acids. If you add this supplement it becomes too much, especially an overdose of L-Arginine is not good. My cat started stinking like ammonia until I took her off. Please be careful.",

Soon there seemed to be a slight improvement and I was cautiously optimistic. Now, one month later, she is so much better! She is alert, has a great appetite, has gained weight and seems much stronger and more vital. While there's no cure, this has drastically improved her quality of life and I am so grateful!!!",

Within two weeks of starting him on this and Enpatikin he improved . He is now eating (weruva cat food), drinking water, and much more active. He's even hanging out in our backyard like he used to. He is not back to normal but he has improved so much that this is now a staple in my house. This is the best thing I've done for him since he was diagnosed.",
