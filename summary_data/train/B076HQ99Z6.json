Fast load, very good fast forward & pause operations, no issues playing Blu-rays. (that's all I use it for). FYI I have a Samsung 4K smart TV, the Samsung Blu-ray conflicted with the smart TV kept waking up & changing ports, generally causing trouble. Bought 2 models of Sony Blu-rays both were not very good. Happy with my LG.",

      "text": "Kudos to those that were able to make this player work. I read really great reviews for this product, but I didn't get that experience at all. The player would not read multiple discs and would eject the disc almost immediately. After giving up because I wasn't going to get this player to work, I had the same experience when I tried to turn the player off as it would shut off, but the tray would eject after it turned off. Also, this player is not aesthetically pleasing to look at in its design.",

You should let people know the cables are no good, so they don't return the unit because it won't function. Not everybody would think to switch out the cables. It was advertised as coming with a new cable, which it did, and right out of the package the cable was bad.",
