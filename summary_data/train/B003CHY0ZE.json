The two screws on the top and bottom are really the aesthetic selling points here. I'm not a diver, and to be honest I bought this watch just because it looked awesome and I love G-Shocks, but I can tell you that this watch is incredible in person.",

Now can\u2019t keep it charged for more than a couple of days before low message comes on and then dies within an hour or so. Will be out of warranty within the week. Haven\u2019t had good luck with Casio\u2019s customer service. Wouldn\u2019t feel right selling it. So, now I have it hanging on my wall to remind me that 500.00 of unnecessary materialism can disappoint a lot sooner than manufacturer claims. Going back to Basic Rangeman. I have learned my lesson.",

The watch is big, well made, and has a strong presence on the wrist. Thanks to Casio making a US model, the price is more reasonable compared to the JP version. Retail price is $700 which I think is crazy. What I paid for this watch is probably the best deal for a brand new atomic solar Frogman. I'm sure the price will go up and down on Amazon but if you can get it for <450, you gotta pull the trigger on it!",

The band sucks. The tongue of the watch band falls out of the little slot that is suppose to hold in the slack. plus the extra band of the watch catches on everything as well. It should have a Velcro tight band that does not catch on clothes etc. The cost is too high for what the watch is G-Shock has too many great watches that are a lot cheaper with the size I like.",

G-SHOCK watches are the most durable digital and analog-digital watches in the industry, trusted by military personnel, law enforcement, surfers and outdoor enthusiasts around the world.
