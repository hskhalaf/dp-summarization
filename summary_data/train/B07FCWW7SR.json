      "text": "Let me start by saying, \"I read reviews good and bad\". My search included specific product details in the description so, it took quite a bit time and was well worth it.. After reviewing tons of baby boy swimsuits for my 8.5 month old, this one really exceeded my product expectations. The fit is perfect 6-12 months, nice quality, true to colors (rich & vibrant). I like the idea of no snaps on bottom ( no water access). This swimsuit looks so cute on...he didn't want me to take it off; for sure it will be a hit at the pool or beach. Hopefully, this review will save you a lot of search time.",
