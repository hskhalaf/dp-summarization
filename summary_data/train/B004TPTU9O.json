      "text": "This thing is awesome. Very easy to assemble and it's mobility is terrific. I'm working in a small garage and have to move things around a lot. This dust collector is incredibly easy to move around and works like a champ. The bag size is fine for most operations but will fill pretty fast when planing a bunch of boards. Good news is that it is easy to remove and put back. I looked a lot of different dust collectors by a number of different manufacturers and very glad that I chose this one. For my needs it was the best choice.",

      "text": "This is a VERY effective dust collector.I previously owned another brand; no comparison! I have used it now for six months and have encountered only one problem: It does not collect dust from the new Delta table saw I bought at the same time. The apparent reason is the intake of the dust collector. For some reason wood dust / shaving collect at the entry port to the collector. I don't know why as this does NOT happen when I attach the hose to my 15\" planer or 8\" jointer. Both machines are also Powermatic and create a LOT more dust and chips. Finally, do NOT let anyone tell you the machine is \"quiet\"! IT IS LOUD! Period!",
