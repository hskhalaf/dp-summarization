      "text": "This table was exactly what we wanted for our new condo. It's big enough to seat 4 people, but takes up minimal space in our smaller condo. The assembly was a breeze (a matter of inserting 8 bolts to fasten the legs then tightening a few others on the table to lock everything into place), and the packing for this table was really great. It's well protected by Styrofoam, but each piece of foam is individually wrapped in plastic so that it doesn't make a Styrofoam mess all over the house, which was great. It gives the place a nice industrial-modern look, and we will finally be able to host small dinner parties again.",

Based on the other reviews, I was worried this would be a real gamble, but it turned out just great. Seems like it's still risky to order, but I'm glad I did. It's the perfect height for my office desk and looks really great in our living room. Overall very pleased with the purchase.",

This is a good buy if you're looking for a dining table to fit a small family of 4. Assembly only took a couple minutes and 4 screws. attached a picture of the underside of the table during the short assembly time :) Product is sturdy and the wood table top is made of actual quality wood, not some composite materials that you might find with other furniture vendors.",
