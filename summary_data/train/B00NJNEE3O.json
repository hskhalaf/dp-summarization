Suddenly for no reason the screen would act as though it was being touched everywhere all at once for about 5 seconds. Sometimes the 'ghost touches' would end up closing programs, clicking links if you were on the internet, zoom in, etc. It just depends on what you happened to be working on at the time. It was very frustrating to use. Ended up returning this to Amazon.",

I, too, had the problem of \"ghosting\" on my touch screen, but it is possible to turn the touch screen off. I really didn't get this for the touch screen or tablet functions, so I just keep the screen off and the problem is solved. Overall, this was a great buy!",
