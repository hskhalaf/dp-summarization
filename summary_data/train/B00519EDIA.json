I open up the instructions and a paper falls out that reads \"this product contains a chemical known to the state of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm.\" After searching online I learned that there's bpa in this, which it's effects would be seen in babies and the heat would further aggravate. I'm so annoyed because this should've been clear in the description online instead of wasting my time. I don't feel comfortable prepping my child's food in something that could cause issues for them. Seriously just steer clear",

The base collects residue around the edges and must be cleaned by wiping it inside and out with paper towels each time it's used. The water container is small, holding only two cups of water so it may run out before the veggies are done. The whole system takes about 5 minutes to start putting out steam which increases the cooking time each time used. It's the worst one I've had in 30 years. Don't waste your money.",

I hope I never drop one, because it might just crack or break. Other than that, it works great, is easy to clean (use the top rack on the dishwasher for those baskets, the bottom one will obliterate them), and doesn\u2019t take up a ton of space while using it on the counter.

      "text": "We've only had this for a little while now, but we are very happy with our purchase. The Oster Steamer does exactly what it needs to do, it steams our vegetables, and is very convenient at that. Just pour some water in the bottom, fill the plastic containers with your choice of produce and turn the timer on. It does take longer to heat up than we expected, so we add an extra five minutes on the time now, easy peasy. It is easy to take apart and clean, easy to use and very light weight. Perfect.",

Check doneness with a fork and dinners ready.",

At least I don't think there is an auto shutoff. The plastic has also been cracking in the steamer trays and finally a piece of the cover broke off. It was small but luckily I noticed it and it didn't end up in any of my kid's foods.",

      "text": "Okay so this product is amazing however, there is one problem. So when you steam, you put the water at the bottom. Now because the fish makes its own water, the water tends to flow over the side. So you have to watch it but other than that, it's amazing. You put your own seasoning, veggies and it has a timer. It's a great, affordable steamer to have.",
