And they get a whole treat for \"lunch.\" I like the fact that there are no additives, it's just freeze-dried chicken breast, doesn't put on unwanted weight, is a healthy protein snack, and they get really excited and run to the kitchen when they hear me open the bag. My one objection is that they fill an inner bag with air that breaks down the whole pieces and I have more \"sprinkles\" and fewer snacks. I would prefer they keep the product in the original bag and just use better packing materials in the box. Then, I would hope, perhaps, to have more bite-size pieces.",

      "text": "Added from previous review - Unlike some other who have complained about the size of the pieces, I have squashed the pieces so that I can sprinkle it on top of the cat's food. It gets them both to eat the their wet better than with the food alone. My cats love this and according to the ingredient list it doesn't have anything bad for my furballs. I often give it to them as a mid-day treat or a late evening snack, and they gobble it up. HOWEVER, it used to come in a resealable pouch -- now it does not. I've downgraded my review one star because of that.",
