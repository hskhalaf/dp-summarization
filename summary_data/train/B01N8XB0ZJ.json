      "text": "I was a long-time Saucony Omni user (5 years or so) and really liked those shoes. But I felt that they were too stiff when running on pavement. I had tried Brooks when I first started running so I figured I'd give them a try. These shoes are definitely better than the Saucony. The stitching on the shoes is better, the laces are better, the fit is infinitely better, and they are far more comfortable to run in. I've put about 40 miles on them so far and really love how they feel. I can't say enough about how well they perform.",
