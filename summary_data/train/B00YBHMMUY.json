They felt that this versatile running shoe was durable, that its cushioning systems were comfortable, and that its pronation control feature was effective. Also, the accommodating width choices made it easy for consumers to get a more relaxed fit. Still, some complained that the coverage felt uncomfortable, and that the mid-sole felt unwieldy.",

        "Those who have tried the Brooks Adrenaline GTS 16 generally agreed that it felt lightweight",

        "Many testers appreciated the fact that this version came in different widths\u2014narrow, medium, wide and extra wide",
        "Some runners were able to use it on both the pavement and on light trails",
        "they didn\u2019t feel short-changed in terms of performance and durability",

I did find this version - 16 - a little hard to start with but that might be because the other 2 pairs I'm using are well broken in. They are fine after a few miles. I picked these up on Amazon for \u00a335 which is an absolute bargain - colour isn't that exciting but whose arguing for that price.",

Medium width. Probably not ideal to wear a brand new pair of trainers for 13.1miles but I did just that today and my feet feel great. No new blisters! They feel very stable and provide a good grip even on wet surface. Look forward to doing many more miles in them. So far so good!",

To say these shoes are hard on the heel is an understatement. I can press the inboard cushioning on the previous model but on these?. No way. They're really hard and I think suitable for very heavy runners not a 66kg person like me. Very disappointed and will look for a 15 version.",

Element mesh is a moisture-managing, breathable mesh upper. Adjustable saddle construction allows for a personalized and secure midfoot fit. The midsole dynamically adapts to every step thanks to the dna midsole, while your body is guided into it's natural alignment with the help of a supportive progressive diagonal rollbar. Plus, smooth heel-to-toe transitions are made possible by the full-length segmented crash pad. This sixteenth edition is more plush than ever - an updated v-groove folds deeper inward to absorb and disperse impact away from the foot.",
