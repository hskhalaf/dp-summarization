      "text": "I needed to lift a couple hundred pounds and thought this would work. After getting it, I noticd it said it was for pulling and NOT for lifing. I figured I'd keep it to pull trees in the direction I want them to fall from cutting them down. So I tested it with no directions that came with it. The cable hook spool when releasing the tension would get caught on the rachet mechanism and you would have to dangerously try to release the built up tension. I returned it easily with a quick refund. I LOVE Amazon!",
