I wrap furniture and paintings and anything that is stored in my basement. I find it very handy and easy to use. If you don\u2019t have large zip locks storage bags, use this to wrap your sheets and blankets for storage. Pulling it right will compress them for extra space. I wonder if it would work on my Gutt? Just kidding.",

( If needed, see my other review of shrink wrap to find brand I\u2019m referring to). It didn\u2019t had a handle so made it much harder to wrap boxes, objects,furniture on larger scale, definitely not if you\u2019re tackling single handily.
