These were priced so good and said to be authentic so I figured why not. They pictured with the leather piece in the middle which in my opinion makes the glasses stand out from a basic aviator style. The glasses I was sent are missing that piece in the middle. So not sure if they\u2019re authentic or what but was totally bummed i was not sent what I thought I was getting. I was offered 20 percent off to just keep the glasses which I did but still 100$ for glasses that don\u2019t look like the originals.",
