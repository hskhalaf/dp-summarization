The people in charge of the pool did not allow arm bands as they considered them unsafe. Instead they had jackets available for children to use freely. Although there was no defect, it seems this is simply not a product one should be using - something i was not aware of. It is rated 3 stars for meeting quality standards, while losing two stars for being an unusable product, and obviously if it cannot be used the value for money is zero.",

You have to stick the entire thing in your mouth and bite down in order to get air in there, but once you get that figured out it doesnt take much to fill them up. I would definitely recommend!!!",

      "title": "Great floaties!",
      "text": "Purchased the fabric floaties for my newly 6 year old son who has worn a puddle jumper since he was a little toddler. I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews, but these are awesome. There are 2 inflatable bladders on each one and the fabric doesn\u2019t pull or rip his skin. He was swimming for hours and didn\u2019t complain once and they kept him perfectly upright and safe. Awesome product, just ordered another set for my daughter for next summer when she outgrows her puddle jumper!",
