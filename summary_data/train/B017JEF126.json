I did mount it in the attic, which wasn't as good as the Radio Shack antenna we put up there when they were changing to digital. The worst part was couldn't see the direction it was pointing.",

I've been working with Ham antennas along with military antennas for years. This product exhibits some great enginuity. The idea of using plastic as a structural form, then lining it with lighter metals is genius. You could make any profile in this manner at a very low cost. It went together precisely. Everything slide together well, all holes were predrilled with precision for good power gain on radio signals.

I actually did not expect it to work well because it is so small and cheaply made but I was wrong. It pulls in 18 stations where the old \"large\" analog antenna pulled in 2. We are about 100 miles away from the stations so it most definitely works. Personally I would do away with the mechanical rotor part and put some of that money into making it a little sturdier.

      "text": "After using this antenna for a while I decided to update my review. I was not thrilled with quality when I received this antenna, but it was easy to assemble and INITIALLY it appeared to work fine. I installed the antenna outside on an old tower next to the house. The longer it is up, the worse things are getting. It does not do well with wind, or rain. I have constant pixelating on my TV. I noticed today that it was pointing more east, thus it is not staying tight on the pole. Going to find one more wind resistant.",

I'll follow up with more after I try my Dish Network set up. Which will be slightly more challenging, Straight to TV and DVR it's perfect.",

      "text": "All plastic and aluminum. Pretty flimsy, but it works well. Use 3/4\" EMT as a pole. 1\" EMT is just a hair too large to mount in the rotator. Coax is also low quality, but it works. I get 2 more channels than previous with indoor antennas. Picture is very clear. Having the indoor power box on may not be necessary unless some of your channels require the booster to pick up or you want to rotate the antenna. Overall, a decent buy at $35.",
