It comes with the standard set of 152 tiles plus 8 extra flowers plus 6 spare tiles (2 jokers and 4 blanks). The tiles appear to have good quality and have the same pictures we are used to playing with so that is a plus. The included directions are basic and have a few minor typos but are readable. The racks are not real sturdy but have a push extension but no pegs to hold chips which is not a big negative. Chips, bettor, spare tiles and dice are included and are found in the carrying case zipper compartment.",

Also, the dice are laughable - misshapen cubes, dots sloppily put on by hand, and ridiculously tiny (barely over 1/4 x 1/4 inch). The game can still be played, but I'm really disappointed in the quality. Unusual for Amazon.",

Easier, faster. The tiles are not exactly what is said in the description. There are not 10 jokers but 8. It's not an issue unless you lose one. There are no blank tiles either, so if you lose a tile you would have to buy additinal tiles. I have a set where I have not been able to find replacement tiles, so it could be an issue. But probably not an issue. It does have double the number of flowers and seasons.",

I highly recommend this set if you are a beginner and, if after getting some experience, you want to get a pretty set - investing the money is not a waste.",

Makes it so easy to carry the game and leaving your hands free of all that other stuff. Plus, being a soft bag it is so much easier to repack than the hard sided carry bags. Tiles are beautifully white and the racks are exactly as pictured. The padded wrap-around keeps the racks for banging together and getting cracked. Very good purchase. A friend loved mine so much she bought her own.",

It has the basics and even includes some examples of hands for practicing if you don't yet have your own card. The carrying case is good quality and fits the set nicely. It does have a handle large enough for over a shoulder if desired. One negative is the fabric lining of the case makes a loud crinkling sound when moved. I recommend this set.",

The dice are tiny but serviceable. The money chips are very, very thin--they would fly away on the wind if playing outdoors...play with painted pennies instead.
