The glass in the bottom of the carafe is extremely thin and will not stand up to even the most careful cleaning. I am abandoning the french press method as too expensive. It simply makes no sense that beakers cannot be made to withstand gentle and proper care.",

On this second item I made a single cut in the upper horizontal plastic frame immediately above the X cross brace. The carafe is still held securely but is now easy to remove and replace.",
