I have even emailed (week ago) and they have not responded. Usage is total usage and when you look at devices so far it just lumps everything as other. I know what some of the these devices are but it won't let me assign them myself. Long story short, there are options that are cheaper and I don't see how it is possible that they would work worse and support also couldn't be worse.",

If you have some electrical experience, it is an easy install.

A little electrical knowledge will certainly help. For example a fridge has a compressor, fan, defrost coil and a light bulb.
