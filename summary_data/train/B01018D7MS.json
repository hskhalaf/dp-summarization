You get a measuring wheel, calibrated in feet and a sturdy bag in which to store it. The wheel is collapsible and also comes with a stand. The stand is a nice touch but can really only be used on very level, hard ground. On grass the feet are small enough that the whole thing refuses to stand and will tip over.",
