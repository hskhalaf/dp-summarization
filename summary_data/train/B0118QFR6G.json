The phone can't use it's powerful processor as it overheats immediately 45-60\u00b0 C when doing anything remotely cpu intensive (every game). Battery life on standby is good, if you have a lot of apps going in the background it'll last 8 hours, assuming you don't turn the screen on. Screen on time using heavily, it'll last 3 hours, maybe. Metal back and super hot always makes my hands sweat.",

I turned off Arguis fit tracker to see If that helps. Update, phone e did reach 100% on second day. However continues to drain very rapidly. Aside from the battery issue, this phone is 5 stars.

Easy but takes about 1hr to download and install update. Battery life is excellent, about double the Galaxy S4 it replaced. I'm on Cricket, popped the SIM in and it just works, great LTE coverage. ALL data features work perfectly, but no wifi calling on Cricket's network (Cricket limitation, not phones fault).",

I own a Nexus 6 and 6P and although the size of this doesn't really compare, the manufacture seems great, the screen is clear and bright, the touch sensitivity is nicely responsive. We're still acclimating to a subtly different OS experience -- I'm assuming that has to do with factory installed differences -- and I'm still getting used to the fact that the 'back' and 'recent apps' keys are black-on-black and don't really stand out visually. I often forget they're there. I would definitely recommend this phone if you want a spacious (64 GB) Android smartphone without typical budget-breaking prices.",

The camera quality is good in daylight(as with most smartphone cameras) but in low light you might have to tweak the manual mode just to get the right setting. My gripes are this phone has lack of finger print scanner and lack of sd card slot.,and ZTE needs to push marshmallow ASAP!

No problems caused by the UI or any of their custom features. So why 3 stars? There's no way to enter the Bootloader. Can't unlock the device. Can't replace the Recovery. No root, no custom ROM. Complete lockdown. Not cool. I returned mine because of how locked down it is. Hopefully they open it up in the future. This *could be* an amazing phone, but at this moment it's crippled by the inability to control it the way I want.",
