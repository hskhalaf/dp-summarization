It wasn't painful, but I knew it would become uncomfortable after a day's worth of wear. I also noticed that there was no arch support. Very well made shoe, just not for me. This shoe would work well for someone with wide feet!",

They're still hard to get on because the leather around the top of the foot/lower leg is stiff. But I LOVE them! Stylish boots with support, these boots are roomy for my wide foot and I can wear them all day- with a skirt, dress pants, and jeans. Fashion meets function.",

It was painful. It would be impossible to wear anything but the thinnest of socks with these. Once I did get them on, I had to struggle to get out of them. Who has time to struggle to put their shoes and off? I returned them.",

Now they are so easy to wear it feels like the Birkenstock of the Winter.",

After getting a replacement a half size bigger than what I usually order (in the US), they fit perfectly, are comfortable, and are a great boot that looks a little fancier than a normal rain or snow/hiking boot.",

The leather is tight so getting your foot through the tight ankle part requires serious effort - taking them off is even harder. It does get easier over time as the shoes stretch out but big design flaw for me.",

They go with a variety of different ohtfits and are perfect for our climate in the PNW. My only beef with them so far is that they can be difficult to get on and off and they are more narrow than I expected. I have slightly wider feet and they squeeze my mid foot slightly which is uncomfortable. Right now I cannot wear thick socks with them. Other than that- great boots!",
