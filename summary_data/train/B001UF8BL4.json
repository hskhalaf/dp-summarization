It's easy for them to grab and helps with early dexterity, they enjoy rolling it around (and especially off the bed), and it's cute without being obnoxious. The lack of flashing lights and loud noises is pleasantly refreshing in an age where it seems every toy has to be electronic, and in some way dictate how it's played with instead of allowing natural observations and discovery.",

There is just one problem the way the toy is made the screws are exposed just inside the ball. This is only a minor issue as long as the heads of the screws are not sharp, and as long as the screws are in tightly. Since our little one chews everything I can't say that I am very comfortable with allowing him to play with this toy.",

It may seem on the small side for an adult, but if it was larger I don't think it would appeal as much to babies. I have given this ball to two friends for baby shower gifts. Instant hits!",

This one is fairly hard plastic, only slightly flexible. The plastic does not bend, but the ball flexes slightly because of the design. Seems hard for a baby. I hope he likes it - if I had seen it in person, I probably would have opted for something else.",

The beauty of this toy is that, while lightweight, it is still durable, it's easy for a baby to hold onto due to innumerable places to grip the ball, and it holds a baby's attention due to the various sounds the inner rattle ball makes when they shake the thing. My daughter usually keeps this close by, as opposed to most of her other toys which get flung aside, sometimes a surprising distance away. She really loves this ball, and i am glad to have purchased iot accordingly.",

This is just a fun, inexpensive ball/rattle. I'm sure she will get a lot of enjoyment out of this for some time.",
