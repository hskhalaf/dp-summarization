Even if day this crack doesn\u2019t make a difference in the overall function of the table, cosmetic negligence reflects overall quality. That being said, I will update with function quality once I\u2019ve actually put a huge heavy saw on top.",

      "text": "Title says \"Folding Table\". I would not necessarily call this a folding table, maybe a stow away table or something would be more accurate. Reason being is that the legs are secured into the base, you have to remove them and insert them into the table and turn them about a half turn to lock them in. After, remove legs and place them back into their location. Not a HUGE deal but I was expecting it to simply unfold and then fold up. The plus side is that it is very well made and sturdy. It is relatively light and the handle is well balanced and makes it easy to carry. Good table for the money for sure!",
