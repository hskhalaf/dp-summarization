      "text": "For the brief time I've owned this, I like it quite a bit. I was really hot for the retro look of the Olympus OM-D5, but after reading several online reviews, especially those that compared the bodies, I was convinced that I'd have a better grip on the camera with the G5. The specs were fairly close, and when I looked at paying $259 for the G5 body vs. $999 for the Olympus my mind, and wallet quickly chose the Panasonic.",

I especially love the level feature, so I can more easily obtain level in all directions on my tripod when I shoot landscapes. The various creative options also are fun exploring.",

The auto focus and picture quality is excellent upgrade to G2, and I REALLY like the silent shutter feature, as I take a lot of photos at rehearsals and performances where you do not want to make sound. Learning curve from G2 is not hard, but button placement (particularly the quick menu button) takes some finger retraining. If you do not ned to have bleeding edge latest greatest toy, this will get the job done for most people.",

    "description": "Style:Body OnlyPanasonic DMC-G5 16 MP Compact System Camera with 3-Inch LCD - Body Only (Black)\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n\nPANASONIC LUMIX DMC-G5 COMPACT DIGITAL SINGLE LENS MIRRORLESS (DSLM) CAMERA (BODY ONLY), 16MP DIGITAL LIVE MOS SENSOR, TOUCH LCD, FULL HD VIDEO, BLACK\n\nTHE G5 TRIPLE THREAT: 16 MEGAPIXEL SENSOR - VENUS ENGINE - SPOT-ON COLORS\n16 megapixel sensor, Venus Engine and Intelligent Resolution Technology reduce noise to produce crisp, clear gradations and true-to-life color.\n\n * The 16.05-megapixel Live MOS Sensor features Panasonic's original pixel-mix technology, designed exclusively to minimize noise generation. The fine wiring results in high resolution and quick processing.\n * \n * A redesigned Venus Engine produces clear, crisp photo and video images. Its MNR (Multi-process Noise Reduction) quickly detects brightness in every part of a shot and its HDR (High Dynamic Range) allows for several pictures taken at different exposure levels to turn into a single composite picture that eliminates over-or-under-exposure. The 3DNR reduces rough edges.\n * \n * Intelligent Resolution technology detects outlines, intricate texture, and gradation thus precisely processing pixel by pixel to render true-to-life color reproduction that is spot-on.\n\n\n\nLIGHTSPEED AUTO-FOCUS HELPS YOU NEVER MISS A SHOT\nContrast AF provides higher accuracy while Light Speed AF locks on to fast moving objects.With contrast AF (Auto Focus) the image sensor controls your focus giving you a greater range to create your crisp, clear images. This is great for recording fast moving subjects like your little leaguer, migrating birds, or your best friend who decided to bungee jump. Contrast AF boasts higher accuracy, especially when shooting with a bright lens. And since you have a full-area AF touch, you select your desired field of vision. Additionally, Light Speed AF quickly locks onto a subject, making it possible to capture even fast moving subjects like your son, the dirt bike rider.\n\nLATEST MICRO FOUR THIRDS MIRRORLESS TECHNOLOGY - SMALLER CAMERA SYSTEMS DELIVER BIG RESULTS\nThe mirrorless, compact, light weight SLR system yield professional results with half the weight and size.Based on the Micro Four-Thirds system, Panasonic eliminates the bulky mirror box and pentaprism found in conventional DSLRs without compromising sensor or optical performance. Camera bodies and lenses are now dramatically smaller and lighter than traditional SLRs, making them more portable so you can take them with you virtually anywhere.\n\nHAVE THE MAGIC TOUCH? GET MORE CREATIVE WITH G5\u2019S LCD SCREEN\nShoot and play back images simply by touching the DMC-G5's rotating LCD screen (Click for more Information)The 920K-dot high-resolution LCD rotates 180\u00b0 to the side and tilts 270\u00b0 up and down offers approx. 100% of field of view. This LCD enables dynamic, artistic framing with high-angle shots and low-angle shots. The time lag of image output is minimized by approximately 18% compared with the predecessor DMC-G3 making it easier to monitor the fast-moving subject.\n\n Plus, high-precision touch display immediately lets you to set focus to the subject by just touching it on the screen and you can even release the shutter.\n\n The Level Gauge lets the camera detect the horizontal / vertical angle of view with its internal level working with the acceleration sensor. Photos shot in a portrait aspect will be automatically displayed vertically whatever lens is used.\n\nSHOW OFF YOUR CREATIVE SIDE\nIntelligent Auto and Creative Control filters allow styles like Star Filter to be applied to your photos within the camera. (Click for more Examples)The Creative Control mode has been upgraded in the G5 with 14 creative filters that let you tell your photographic story. Choose from Soft Focus to Dynamic Monochrome to One Point Color or from the original filters like Expressive and Retro. With the new GUI and menu tabs, switching filter effect is extremely easy and is possible to preview via the Live View Switching. If you can't decide, your G5 will recommend the one that bet fits your scene in iA (Intelligent Auto) or iA Plus mode. While you're in iA Plus, adjust your defocusing area in the background, exposure, and white balance.\n\nNEW TO ADVANCED CAMERAS? SCENE GUIDE SHOWS YOU OFF, PRO-STYLE\nScene Guide can help you select the best settings for your subjects from city lights to rippling waves. (Click for more Information)If you're just learning how to maneuver the interchangeable lens system, don't worry.

This feature will also direct you with how-to pointers on shooting, technical advice, and recommended interchangeable lens options for your scene portfolio giving you a better understanding along the way as you learn new photographic techniques.\n\nMAKE MOVIES, MAKE MEMORIES & SHARE YOUR STORY IN HD\nCapture still images while recording video and compose them in PhotofunStudioNot only does the LUMIX G5 produce stunning still images, it also records high quality video in full-HD and with DolbyDigital Stereo sound, in MPEG-4, AVCHD Progressive.
