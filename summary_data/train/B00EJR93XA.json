The liners that come with the gloves are hard to use, the grip pads are too sticky and make it difficult to put the gloves on with the liners on. They were a little tight and it was hard to move my fingers for the first day, but after a day or so of use they loosened up and were pretty comfortable. The wrist strap is key, no worries about losing these on the lift!",

Alone, the liner gloves are cool for driving or keeping your hands warm when the temperature is around 30 degrees, but because of the rubber gripping, sheer vast oversized nature, and extremely tight opening it is nearly impossible to put the gloves on over the liners. Epic waste of product and money. Lucky for me it wasn't a total waste because I have Northface gloves to use the liner with. Throwing the external gloves in the trash. Don't waste your time or money.",

But again, to me they don't need the liners. Tested to -20F so far and stayed warm. I will definitely buy again.",
