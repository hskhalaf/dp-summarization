The masher cleans so easy , no longer will we have you waste ,like 20 mins, picking and scrubbing the potato carnage from it.

Until using this masher, she was using a rubber whisk! I have to say, this masher does exactly what it needs to do - great mashing ability with no frustrating build-ups of potato (or cauliflower) while you are mashing. Much better than our previous tool of choice. This masher is also very easy to clean by hand, as there are not any tight spaces that are hard-to-reach. Also, it's dishwasher safe if you prefer that. Overall, a great masher for the price, and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anybody.",

The metal grate is a squiggle so it does a great job mashing but it also super easy to rinse and wipe clean.

Nothing like working more ergonomically and efficiently as we get older.",

    "description": "The OXO Good Grips Potato Masher features a Cushioned Handle that absorbs pressure while you work, plus a sturdy stainless steel wire head. The Masher is great for potatoes, yams, carrots and other root vegetables. Or use it to mash apples and bananas for homemade baby food. Large in-handle hole for hanging storage. Dishwasher safe.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nIf you're the kind of cook who prefers \"mashed\" to \"whipped\" potatoes, this tool may very well become your next best friend. With a stainless-steel wire head, the masher tackles the task at hand, all the while reducing pressure on your hands due to the soft, rubber cushioned handle that is nonslip, wet or dry. The wire masher works as well with yams, carrots, apples, or bananas, in case you've had oral surgery or have a baby in the house. Good Grips products are moderately priced and have won the Tylenol/Arthritis Foundation Design Award. --Laurie Notaro",
