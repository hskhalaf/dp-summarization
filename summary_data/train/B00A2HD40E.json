Also, under our dim, incandescent colored lights, it was hard to differentiate blue from black virii, and blue from green meeples.

But, for us, that makes us want to play more and get better at it! If you want an easily winnable game, this might not be for you. However, if you want a fun and exciting challenge that allows you to plan and strategize with your friends, I definitely recommend this game!",

I would recommend the Pandemic legacy which can played as normal game and play campaign once adopted to the rules.",

I highly recommend finding some quick YouTube tutorials to get started, as it can be a bit difficult to figure out in the beginning. If you're looking for a new boardgame, you won't be disappointed with Pandemic! I should also add that the game was shipped within 3 days of ordering on Prime, which was much earlier than the expected delivery date. Thanks for the prompt shipping!",

We've lost against this game numerous times when playing on harder difficulties, but my family and my gamer group always re-setup and go again, win or lose. Lots of tension against those super viruses, but the feeling that you and your team will overcome those challenges to save the world against them is what truly makes this game shine. Work together, and you will conquer! Highly recommended for family game night!",

It's fun to talk through and debate options to make sure everyone's in agreement, but I would recommend giving everyone a chance to provide input (especially with folks who are new to Pandemic/cooperative games) instead of the more opinionated/vocal folks delegating everything.
