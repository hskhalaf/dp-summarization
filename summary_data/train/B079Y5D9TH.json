I tried to charge them, and nothing happened. If they stopped working because of sweat, that is not acceptable because they are supposed to be sweat proof. I do sweat a lot too. That\u2019s why I bought them. JBL is also supposed to be a great company with great products, WELL THESE ARE GARBAGE! I wish I could get my money back. Let me repeat, the only worked for 3 months.",
