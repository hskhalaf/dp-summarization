I unfortunately had to give them less than a perfect rating for the key issue that I've come across time and time again while on the mat. While training, the pads will begin to shift away from the middle of my shin. It's not a terrible issue, but in theory, shin pads shouldn't move when someone is kicked in the legs. I do have a thinner frame which could contribute to this, but I would venture to guess that even with thicker shins it may still happen.",

They have a small \"r\" on each foot and it was throwing me off a little. They do wiggle around a little, throughout practice, but I wonder if that's normal with all shin guards or perhaps it's because I had such chicken calves (working on it).
