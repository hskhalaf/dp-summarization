I work construction standing in concrete all day every day and these lasted me over 2 years (bought these April 2016). They are finally on about ready to fall apart so I will be buying another pair as soon as they come back in stock in my size. Most of the other guys I work with buy red wing's for $200+ and are lucky to get 1 year out of them.",

Arch support and the inner foot surface of these boots is not all that great, so I highly recommend getting a good insoles.",

The construction is a little uneven (stitching showing in places, different sized openings--see photos), but that gives a not unpleasant hand-made feel to them.

Did that with these boots too and they fit as expected or maybe just a bit larger, but since I intend to wear these with thick socks it worked out perfectly. I normally expect boots to hurt my sensitive feet. These do not. Very comfortable! 4 and a half stars.",

I am using new insoles. The insoles that came in the boots I did not remove, but I didn't try to do that very hard. They seem glued in pretty well. They look ok and make me 1\" taller.",

It'll darken them but they still look brown and they still look nice. It's a good balance between rugged and clean looking. Breaking them in with wool or thick socks is not advised. It will hurt. Takes about 2 weeks to break in. The only thing I'd change (other than the durability) is the insert. It doesn't have a removable insert unfortunately and laying one over top would make the inside too narrow.",

The fit is good enough to avoid looseness, but yet maintain firm support. I'm now aware of the SKECHERS band of footwear, to the point that I will first search for other styles available from that brand. I'm very happy with my purchase.",

      "text": "The back pull-strap broke the first time I used it, but I was thinking about cutting them off because they catch my pants, anyway. The boot itself looks really good. I usually wear a size 10 or 10.5 and went with the 10 here since they are slip-on and I wanted them to be snug. I wear a Dr. Sholl's Tri-Comfort insole with regular socks in these, and they fit well. On cold days I wear wool socks and they are a bit tight. I haven't worn them enough to know how well they will hold up through the winter, but I am happy with them so far.",
