      "text": "This a nice little incubator/hatcher, especially on sale. My one issue with it is the poor humidity control. Leaving the top askew to lower humidity didn't seem like a good idea and the temperature was unstable. To provide better control, I drilled 3/8 inch holes(3 on each side) around the edge of the top for better ventilation and control. To lower humidity, I leave the holes open. To increase humidity, I close the holes with adhesive tape. This won't receive any awards for attractiveness, but it is effective in managing the humidity issue. I incubate Chinese goose eggs and humidity control is essential. Hope this helps.",

You'd be lucky if you can squeeze 9 chicken eggs in it. 12 would be impossible. Unless you're hatching something really small like quail eggs. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase. ***Update Incubated 6 eggs - 6 chicks hatched. This incubator is definitely a keeper",

      "text": "So far, so good. I have placed 5 duck eggs in, they were abandoned in my yard by a Peking duck. The eggs were fertilized, I'm pretty sure, because witnessed the mating between the white Peking and the male black/white duck. The tray does turn the eggs all day long, slowly, steadily. You have to sit there and stare at it a long time if you want to see it move. Better to look at where it is and come back in an hour and see where it is. I will write another review after hatching. This was VERY EASY to set up and get going. Instructions were good. I think it's worth the money I paid.",

I watched the turning mechanism for almost 30 minutes and it did not move at all. Also, the temperature that the thermometer registered was consistently 2 degrees lower than the actual temperature. I just hate that we didn't have an opportunity to test this before the return window closed.",

You could use the lockdown tray if you had more eggs but as mentioned in previous comments, you would have to manually turn them.
