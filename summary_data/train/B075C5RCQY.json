      "text": "Amazing umbrella! Every other umbrella I had sort if just snaps and breaks down on me. But this umbrella really stood up to the test, it never flipped inside out even under super windy conditions and the alloy of rods stay pretty sturdy. I'm not sure about \"lightning resistance\" and hope to never test that out but its definitely good against rain and wind. Not only that, I dont have to lug it by carrying it, i just wrap it around my arm and go on my way and it drys pretty quickly. Although I have been teased at the office for bringing what looks like a sword instead of an umbrella. Definitely worthy of the 5 stars.",

The price for this umbrella isn't bad; be aware, though - the materials match it. The umbrella itself is comfortable, lightweight, and easy to open and close. The first heavy rain I experienced, I felt rain coming through the center. The sheath is cheap, flimsy, and a mess to use once the umbrella gets wet. I have a feeling mine will tear soon enough with enough use. Solid neutral for me. It's not the best umbrella, but I don't feel ripped off.",
