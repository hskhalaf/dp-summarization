      "text": "This is a good idea but executed poorly!!! Wheels way to small anything almost dust will stop it! It says holds 40 tools well maybe if they are all screw drivers but if loaded as pictured you will need to leave this in one spot and not try to move it. I have bought other Rubbermaid products in the past and have never been this disappointed. I have seen plastic packing heavier than these parts. Deluxe??? I could go on but as you can tell I would not buy again only keeping because packing was just as bad would be a mess to repack.",

      "text": "I bought this in June and did not open the box until Sept. To my surprise, I found there was only one pole in the box. Three poles that are crucial to hold upper and bottom pieces together were missing. How could the company do this to their customer? I usually open box immediately and never had an issue. This is the only time i didn't open the box due to hot weather and did not want to do assembly in my garage. Now i missed the window period to return /replace the item. Very bad vender! They did not check.",

The tool tower has never been outsid of the garage which is closed except when cars go in and out. Extremely disappointed. What would happen to it if used in a hot region.",
