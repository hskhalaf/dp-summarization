Brand new out of box, after just 12 reps the roll back point is short by 8 inches from the start point. You can't roll back pass that point. The more reps you do, the greater the gap gets. 2nd, very minimum lat workout. This is due to the handles' position, the further they are away from the center the more lat workout you'll get out of it. See photo, how Ab Slide has much longer handlebar. This one is going back to Amazon.",

Now, I also do occasional ab workouts at the gym with other exercise routines, but this has been a great supplemental tool to work on my core.

      "text": "I really like it. Having the spring helps returning to from stretched out and in doing so allows me to stretch much further than I would be able to otherwise - increasing the workout. The handles are comfortable and the wide base provides more stability - again letting you focus more on stretching out and working the abs. The beveled sides make for a nice transition to the sides to work my love handles. Glad I chose this one.",

      "text": "I was unsure of which \"Ab Ripper\" to purchase and came across this one in my search. The large wheels seemed like they would make this product easy to use and allow me for more range of motion. After receiving and using this product multiple times, I can say that I am extremely happy with my purchase. This \"Ab Carver\" is extremely easy to use, even for someone who might not have the strongest core. The large wheels make balancing easy and allow for a wide range of motion, working different muscles with each turn.",
