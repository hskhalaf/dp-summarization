The directions for using some of the additional features such as the USB ports for flash drives/external drives for file sharing are only found online and are a bit sparse.

So I'm satisfied, but not ecstatic. I was hoping to eliminate stalling completely. Still, it does seem to be better. Maybe I should have tossed in the next $50 for the better version...I'll keep that in mind for when 2022 rolls around and it's time to upgrade again. Unit looks really cool.",

The most frustrating thing is that, within several months, we started noticing speed dropoff on wireless devices (regardless of band) that would resolve itself after a few moments. Shortly after this wireless speeds would randomly degrade and not recover until the router was unplugged and rebooted. Restoring factory settings, updating firmware, changing security modes, adjusting channels, and all of the other suggestions from Linksys tech support do nothing to resolve the problem. For the price, find something else.",

The only fix is a physical cold reboot. For a deployed system, or one that needs to work at home while I am traveling, this is not acceptable.

I returned 2 NETGEAR Nighthawk AC1900 Dual Band Wi-Fi Gigabit Router (R7000) which was junk, never stayed up for more than a minute, dropped packets, etc... This Linksys router is AEWESOME!!!!!",
