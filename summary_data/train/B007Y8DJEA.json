I will be using this everyday and putting aside my desktop. So far I can do just about everything on this that I can do on my desktop without needing anti-virus software. I would recommend this to anyone frustrated with Microsoft. The really big plus is that operating system upgrades are automatically done without charge. Goodbye Microsoft!!",

      "text": "I have hooked up this Chromebox to my HDTV system and it works quite well. I purchased the DisplayPort to HDMI cable and the video is great in all it's 1080P goodness. I had to use the analog jack on the front of the box to hook it up to my Denon receiver since the DisplayPort does not pass along audio but the sound is quite good. I wish the analog audio jack was on the back of the unit but that's a small quibble. I purchased the Logitech K400 wireless keyboard / trackpad for this unit and it works flawlessly. The Logitech K400 is not a bluetooth unit. Very nice Chrome computer. Works very well as a HTPC.",

I called Samsung support and they had not even heard of this box, and told me to call Google for the issue. I called Google and their first level support, even though very nice and helpful, was at a loss. after a few hours of Googling the issue myself I did actually find a fix. My recommendation is to buy a newer model if you plan on giving this as a gift to someone that isn't computer savvy.",

I assumed Google would get things right but this is such a stupid error the ChromeBox is collecting dust now.
