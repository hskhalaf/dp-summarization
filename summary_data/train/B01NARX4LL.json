I had to knock a star because a couple weeks after I opened it, it started to smell like ammonia. Full strength, eye stinging ammonia. Even though I closed it tightly and kept it in a ziploc after every use it either went bad or was bad to begin with...I'm sad to throw out a huge container of shrimp but I don't want to poison my turtles. :( Will repurchase in a smaller oz container this time around.",

Therefore, I was going to leave 4 stars but the fish and turtle talked me out of it as it's possible my email was simply overlooked and the shrimp is so delicious!",

BUT the SMELL is an extreme smelly smell...that smells...smelly. Each time he went to the surface to eat it, he backed away in fear. SO, this is probably fine & dandy for turtles but possibly not your fish (coming from a fish that eats several types of shrimp). SO, I either got a defective/expired product, or the manufacturer needs to reduce the smell if it wants to target fish owners.",

      "text": "I just love watching my little red eared sliders go nuts over these treats! The shrimp are large enough for hand feeding. One great thing about this product is that the shrimp are largely intact, even after shipping. Other dried shrimp products I have tried have at least 1/4 crumbled shrimp at the bottom that is useless for big turtles and just makes the tank a mess. Highly recommend.",
