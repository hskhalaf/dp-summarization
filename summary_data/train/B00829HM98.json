I also keep a spare keg with sanitizer in it and run it thru the lines when finished with keg. I would recommend these and buy them again. Also the tail piece is permently attached to the shank and fits 3/16 ID beer lines.",

You can accidentally knock or nudge it lightly without realising and it will start flowing so, I wouldn't recommend it be used in a space with a lot of foot traffic passing by.
