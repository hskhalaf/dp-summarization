There's a layer of foam in the center, and it disintegrated in the dryer, getting over everything. This left the mat looking saggy and wrinkly. To be fair, the tag does indicate NO DRYER. This was a bummer because I ordered a Gorilla Grip Luxury Chanille mat in the same shipment, and for a dollar more, that mat looks and feels similar, but CAN be put in the dryer.",

I will probably go back to a cushy fabric mat with a grippy rubber back which doesn't skid or fail to drape over the tub.",

Atleast until I get sick of the color :) I got the gray and it is the true color that is shown in the picture.",
