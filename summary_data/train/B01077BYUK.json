I was looking for a good looking, colorful, bright, and relatively cheap pair of running shoes, and I am happy to say these are it :) Although these shoes are designed perfectly for trail running, I have been using them indoors at the gym, and the grip is amazing. I also don't feel the shoes are stiff and are very easy to break into. They are very comfortable and have not caused any pain so far. Highly recommend! I am very happy with this purchase!",

She says they are ultra \"bouncy.\" The price was perfect - I don't like to spend a lot of money on shoes that are going to be outgrown in 6 months. But the quality is very good. The color is great too - not so light that they will get dirty, but also not so dark that they look like boys shoes. She plays in the gym at the after-school center quite a bit and these soles will not mark up their floors either.",

They have an enlarged foot bed insert that extends slightly on each side and fits into my arch. The heel is nice and cushy and that is good for me since I am trying not to put much pressure on the front of my foot. These shoes have worked out exactly and I intended them to.",

I'm pretty sure they sent the grey/coral pair instead of what I ordered but they're definitely neon orange. Very bright. Not really the color I wanted but not worth it to send back.",

Born of the city and its traditions, Fila is inexorably derived from Biella's dedication to artistry, luxury and elegance. This is our birthright, it's in our soul, and it defines our future. We continue to enrich the athletic experience by improving comfort and performance with Italian design, quality craftsmanship and refined materials. There is no feeling quite as luxurious as that of playing in Fila, and that is the reason for our existence. We create what is desired, not what is necessary. Not just enough, but more than you need. This is Fila.",
