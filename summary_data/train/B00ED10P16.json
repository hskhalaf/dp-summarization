It held the following - two small sandwiches, maps, subway card, Kleenex, sunscreen, cell phone, a power pack, two 8 oz water bottles and a flattened, mostly gone roll of toilet paper. I was not comfortable keeping visible money, ID, or a cc in it so those things I kept in an inside coat pocket. It is strong, and allows your hands to be free. Totally recommend this if you need a clear small purse for security clearance reasons. It's not big enough or private enough for me except for special events though",

This one meets the size requirements and has a good bit of space. A small umbrella, poncho, wallet, etc would fit in the main compartment. The front pocket is great for a phone & tickets - closes with velcro. The strap is adjustable to whatever length you like. It's made of decent enough materials and should last. Go Dawgs!",

      "text": "I was planning to use this crossbody for the upcoming BTS World Tour so I was a little excited to receive it. The bag looked great and it arrived fast but upon further inspection,I noticed it was coming apart from the bottom corner... It also had a strong plastic smell when opened but I let it air out for a few days so it\u2019s okay now. I would\u2019ve rated 5 stars if it wasn\u2019t for the seams coming apart..",
