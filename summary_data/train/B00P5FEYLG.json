So this product is great because all you have to do is inflate and put it around your spout and you can turn it just in case your spout is longer in the front like mine. it is easy to clean and I would say the best product for the price as well. Other products that I've seen that are hard plastic with characters or animals on them end up getting black mold inside of them and they're very hard to clean.",
