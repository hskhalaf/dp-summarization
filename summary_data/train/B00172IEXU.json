I\u2019m a huge skin care junkie and have a few Mario products, but this one is a flunk. If your skin is like mine - Bioelements Moisture Positive Cleanser is a much better solution. Or for a more affordable cleanser, Skinfix foaming oil is great (DOESNT clog pores either!)",

      "text": "I love this cleanser. I was a little hesitant to purchase another Mario Badescu product online since I hated the scent of the last one so much that I cannot use it. This product, however, is amazing. It has a pleasant scent. The formula is lightweight and extremely hydrating. You apply the milk cleanser on a wet face and leave it on for a few minutes. Then you take a cotton pad and wipe it off. I would recommend this product to anyone who is like me and loathes washing their face at night. I have oily and have not had any problems with this cleanser. I use it at night time.",

But unfortunately for me the results are not worth the chemicals that I was putting on to my skin. I would definitely resume using Mario Badescu if they ever stopped using artificial dyes and parabens in their products.",
