This Tomtoc sleeve has protective corners and sides around the entire sleeve. The zippered outside pocket is roomy and will fit a iPad. The padding is raised top and bottom with firm circles of padding. The zipper runs down the long side of the laptop and opens very wide. You don't have to worry about scratches as you lay the laptop into the padding. I want to thank everyone that took the time to write a review, this was extremely helpful. Contact me if you need additional information.",

The main reason I chose this was the advertised \u201ccorner armor\u201d protection with \"rubber material\". I was very disappointed to see that the bottom has actually the thinnest padding out of all the surrounding edges with absolutely zero special corner protection and no armor or rubber material. On the inside, there is no insert as described by the Q&A and other reviews. Not sure if mine\u2019s was just missing or they no longer come with it.

The sleeve\u2019s quality and material are very good.

There is aproximately 0.5\" of wiggle room on the top and side when the laptop is pushed into the bottom corner. The sleeve has a about 3/16\" of padding to protect the laptop lid and bottom. The bottom corners (non-zipper side) have a firmer shell inside of the padding. The top corners (zipper side) do not have the extra corner protection. The zipper has padding on both sides that meet when zipped. The zipper does not touch the laptop and is unlikely to scratch the laptop.",

The newest versions of the MacBook Pro has keyboard issues causing keys to still that seem to happen while traveling so I needed a protective travel case with a good border cushion. This one is the only one I found that had any cushion around the outside edge at all. It works but fits a little too snugly making it difficult to zip up. It also has no strap. But for now it will have to do.",

This is a case that is easily worth twice its list price - I'm sure you'd much rather buy a $30 case now than buy another $2000 computer after one unprotected slip-up! The only complaint I can muster is that the dimple pattern of the inside fabric tends to leave non-permanent marks/spots on the aluminum surface of the computer that can be wiped away. A small annoyance, if anything.",

      "text": "I am using this for a Gigabyte Aero 15 and the fit is absolutely perfect. The internal dimensions given made me believe there would be some gaps when storing the laptop. It was still the best fit for the Aero so I tried it out. Glad I did. It fits snug. No extra space with the thick padding around the sides which is a nice touch. The reinforced bumpers are also a nice feature. I wish they put some smaller bumpers on the zipper side but understand the lack of feasibility for that. The extra pouch fits the cable and power brick for the Aero perfectly, but trying to squeeze a full sized mouse with that is a bit much.",
