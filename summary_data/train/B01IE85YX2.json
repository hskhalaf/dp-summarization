      "text": "overall good set very clean look. HOWEVER THE BED IS SUPER FLIMSY!!!!! I had to buy more slats and im really scared to move too much on it - it fell in when two of the slats broke in half. the metal inserts break off the side rails very easily and the original slats are very thin - will not hold heavy heavy weight unless reinforced. Another draw back for me the drawers do not extend out very far and they arent deep at all so when things fall behind the draws (no individual inside drawer levels) its hard to get back there. Plus though, all the drawers come assembled",

This furniture is solid. My only complaint is that the bed frame is 60 5/8ths inches wide so my old slats didnt fit. We did have to add some, but honestly still worth it. Luck of the draw if you receive damages goods. Our furniture was well protected and nicely packed. The company may have made improvements in this area.",

The chest has a scratch that's not caused by shipping. and the bed doesnt work well with our 8 inches memory foam mattress. I guess the \"no box spring needed\" are for regular mattress, just FYI. besides that, everything else are good, we love them even tho it they have the cons. All in all, money well spent, its very reasonable price for a whole set of bedroom furniture.",

The dressing table needs mirror to be fixed at your desirable height. Bed feels light and easily moveable. If you want a heavy sturdy bed don't go for this. I have used it only for 2-3 weeks and can't say about his durability. overall it gives a good look to the bed room for the money we paid. Happy with the purchase.",
