      "text": "This Jig is awesome. It was perfect for building our Farmhouse Table. Other options are not made for thicker pieces of wood like the 4x4 and we didn't want to risk not having a good solid pocket hole joint. The HD screws that come with this are thicker and longer than come with the other options. We used this device to attach the entire base (4x4 beams) and to attach the top together (2x8 boards). We used a clamp to hold this device to the wood. Worth the money!",

Make sure you check the Kreg web site for information on the load bearing capacity of pocket hole joints. They are strong enough for many applications, but the orientation of the joint (i.e. the direction of the screws) relative to the direction of the load can make a big difference in the strength of the joint, so if you're building something that will bear a load (like a shelf), check the data.",

I still used bar clamps but only to hold in place until I got the pocket hole screws in place, then I could pop the clamp off, glue the next board and tighten in place. Final product turned out great and is rock solid. Would highly recommend this for any project that requires neat/discreet joining of 2X materials. I used ipe for project. Harder than mahogany. Would recommend holding shopvac over the sawdust holes if using on hard wood and/or continuous use. Made a huge difference in heat dissipation.",

The whole screw is larger, and the washer head is larger, making a tightly pulled together joint. The Screw has what appears to be a quite durable coating. I would highly recommend this product.",
