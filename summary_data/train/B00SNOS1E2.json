      "text": "We love the versatility of the spinshot models of play. My wife and i practice several hours at a time. Typically, we set the machine to oscillate left to right, deep court balls with a little top spin. The bin is rated to hold 120 balls. But, we find that 90 - 100 balls is ideal to allow seemless feeding into the carousel.",

      "text": "I've had this machine for about 8 months. Works great, easy to transport, battery has never run down before I was done hitting - about 2.5 hours of use, and battery still going strong. I do wish you could select an option where it would just deliver the ball to one hand, but you have to do two-line mode. There are times I would like to just work on forehands, but you have to choose two widths for it to send balls to - and so I will choose the furthest setting for the left side so I can easily run around my backhand, to hit a forehand. That is a pain. Other than that, no complaints.",

Reached out to tech support and even sent them a video. Their solution proposal was to send me a whole new control panel and for me to install myself. At the $2k price point, this isn\u2019t acceptable. Shipping was delayed which caused an issue by missing an event, however, I can look past shipping delays based off Covid",
