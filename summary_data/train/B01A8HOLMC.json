Also, I didn't know this when I was trying on the sneaker at the retail store before buying online, that when you really get a good pace in walking in the sneaker over a long period of time, that your feet will slip/ move towards the front of the shoe itself. So keep that in mind. But maybe I will try a different type of sock so as to prevent my feet from shifting in the sneaker. Other than that, the product is snazzy. I love the quality and look.",
