Hopefully the pain will go away after more time in the shoes. They did take a couple days around the house to break them in a bit. He found he can't wear ankle socks with them.",

So I use them mostly during the summer, in the winter my feet get cold because the insulation is poor. I would say these shoes are quite heavy, but overall pretty comfortable, probably I will go for another model or brand on my next pair.",

      "text": "Bought these for my twenty-something son for farming. I bought his normal size and he says they fit perfectly. He wore them for a full day the first time and reported they were super comfortable. Update - 2 months later - he has worn them almost every day 8 to 12 hours and still loves em. He walks through a lot of wet fields and mud and says his feet stay dry even when the muck is up to his ankles. He likes the steel toe too. Stays they're still super comfortable and holding up really well. He would definitely choose this boot again.",

      "text": "Was delivered as expected. I wear an 8D and they fit true to that size. I was able to wear them all day the first day I wore them to work. Most comfortable steel toe shoes I have bought and didn't need to be broken in. Had them not quite a year and the soles fell apart. Ask a local shoe repair and was told they are not worth putting another sole on the shoes. The rest of the shoes are in good condition. Very disappointed. Waste of money.",

I should have spent the money and ordered something that is more durable for the work that these men put in.",

Unlike boots with a flat, generic shape, this boot is built with specific contours to support every step you take. The high-cut, 6-inch shaft is generously padded for support that lasts all day, and a steel toe lends extra strength.\n\nTo keep you protected in cold and wet weather, 200 grams of thermal insulation keeps your feet warm while nylon mesh lining keeps them dry and a waterproof, full-grain leather upper stops moisture from invading the interior. For added support, the Diagnostic has a removable, perforated EVA with gel technology to cushion impact and a high-performance, slip-resistant rubber outsole for a steady step.\n\nEDGEWORK PULL-ON BOOT: ROUGH, TOUGH, AND READY\nThe 10-inch Edgework is a pull-on, Wellington-style boot that's as rough and tough as it is stylish. This boot features SuperWelt construction for forefoot flexibility and years of reliable performance as well as a full-grain mahogany leather upper for classic good looks. Waterproofing from toe to heel makes the Edgework a trusted friend in fair or foul weather.\n\nTORSION: ATHLETIC SHOE STYLE WITH WORK BOOT DURABILITY\nA sporty, low-profile shoe that stands up to wet weather without sacrificing style or comfort, the Torsion looks like an athletic shoe but easily handles tough environments thanks to its steel shank and cement construction. The 100 percent waterproof suede uppers keep snow and rain from slowing you down, while soft nylon mesh lining and a shock-absorbing Poliyou sock liner work together to keep you treading in comfort. A long-lasting molded rubber outsole provides a steady grip on a variety of terrain.\n\nTHE ALASKA: CAT FOOTWEAR'S CLASSIC WORK BOOT--NOW WATERPROOF\nThe Alaska FX Boot takes the classic Cat work boot design and makes it waterproof for more versatility and reliable performance in all kinds of environments. This dependable style features TechniFlex construction for superior flexibility, Goodyear welt construction for comfort, and a steel toe for unbeatable strength. A tumbled full-grain leather upper combines nylon mesh lining and a removable polyurethane outsole for all-day comfort and breathability. To keep you safe on the job site, the Alaska is electrical hazard approved and has a nonslip outsole that also resists oil, water, heat, and abrasion.\n\nFLEXION GENERATOR AND MANIFOLD: HARD AT WORK, EASY ON YOU\nThe Flexion Generator and Flexion Manifold Work Boots feel as good on your feet at the end of a long shift as they did when you first put them on thanks to their ERGO comfort system. Flexion is designed to work with the natural movements of your feet, so that at the end of the day you are less fatigued. On top of that, these boots feature: a waterproof, high-tech abrasion leather upper to withstand the elements, a steel toe for extra strength, and comfort features like a removable EVA sock liner, PU mold midsole, and Flexion engineered construction to keep you going longer.\n\nThe Flexion Manifold is available in a 6-inch height, while the Flexion Generator comes in both a 6-inch and an 8-inch version.\n\nABOUT CAT FOOTWEAR\nCat Footwear is built on honest heritage and based on a strong work ethic.
