Don't worry about it feeling a little flimsy when you first unpack it, when it's put together it has adequate structural integrity. Our 45 pound dog loves it and she has plenty of room. And not a drop of water inside when we hosed it down. The roof unsnaps (you'll get better at this over time) for cleaning and blankie arranging.",

Maybe if you took the time to glue each part as you snapped it together it would do better but at $60 each I did not get what I paid for. By the time I got fed up with it, it was dirty and cracked and I was too mad to pay shipping to send them back. If you want to try a snap together then buy it local so you can take it back.",

For anyone with a medium sized dog, this would be a great little house. It's really easy to put together since it kind of snaps together. It's basically a Little Tyke house for dogs. I'm 5'4 and I actually crawled inside it just to see how roomy it was and it's quite roomy enough for a pooch.",
