Seems more like two comforters, with connecting zippers ... which is exactly what I wanted. Is grey with a hint of lightest blue on the inside, but steel grey on the outside. (I use it inside out, making it easy to slide on the sleeping surface.) The enclosed sheet is to me useless, but is a beautiful blue-green and will be useful for something. Always appreciate Coleman's zippers with the 'plow' feature. It is an actual 81\" long.",

The zippers work great and do not get stuck and being machine washable is a must since our dog jumps up on the bed leaving sand and fur everywhere. It also fit the bed perfectly so we had plenty of room.",
