I mounted it to a concrete stem wall with concrete anchors, which means you have to use a hammer drill and masonry bits. This reel is bullet proof. And if it ever starts to leak, just pop off the snap rings, and replace the o-rings. This thing will be around longer than I am. Just buy it already.",

Where it meets the actual reel is a bit loose, too; not machined to close tolerances so it isn't as tight as it should be.

      "text": "We got one of these last year for our back yard and loved it so much we bought another one this year for our front yard. This is a solid hose reel that doesn't leak and looks great with just about any house color. The reel/handle itself is smooth and makes wrapping up your hose an effortless task. I also love that it keeps your hose off the ground and under the eave (in our case), which protects it from the weather, dirt, pavement/dirt abrasion and the awful \"yeah that's gonna kink\" hose pile we had until we got this reel. Strongly recommend. The little shelf on the top is awesome for sprinklers and hose attachments too!",

Also the weld job and/or finish job on the metal is pretty disappointing (see pic). Overall the structure is sound but for the price, I am pretty disappointed in the quality of the finish.",

The installation was easy. It is of a solid construction and rolls up the hose easily. And, it looks GREAT! I couldn't be happier. I would definitely recommend this product.",

I really like the tray in top. The supplied leader hose is absolute junk. The attachments are not plastic, which is nice. The internals are plastic, so ill have to carefull blow out all water before winter.",
