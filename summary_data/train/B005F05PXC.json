I would have been very happy with them if the knives hadn't rusted on the very FIRST dishwasher cycle run. The rust was just a few spots near the serrated cutting edge. I didn't take a picture since others have uploaded some. I thought those other rust photos were maybe just a bad set, but whatever the reason, the same happened to ours. Too bad. For reference, I had another set I bought maybe 20 years ago that I've always dishwashed, and not a spot of rust on them.",

Quality seems good, and obviously they function like they should. Dish washing them has proven fine, but I did notice a few rust like spots appearing. I contributed that to the manufacturers recommendation that you need to use the heat dry setting which I normally don't, and so after having turned it on, the spots stopped appearing. Regardless, no evidence of permanent damage to the pieces and I'm still happy with them. A big recommend!",

Every wash there's at least one that has spots on it, although they come off with a little hand wiping and water generally. I'm not sure if that's on the flatware or on my dishwasher, though, so take with appropriate salt. Happy with this purchase.",
