This can easily be extended before any data is put on the other D (data) partition. I cannot really criticise this laptop for anything other than the higher price.",

Build quality it\u2019s good, definitely not perfect, there is a few squeaks here and there and especially around the display, which to my taste it\u2019s not rigid enough and you can see colours shifting as you move it or open and close the lid.

Battery life and display quality are great but the sound is veeery low. Even on top volume and without any background noises in the room I am struggling to hear people on meetings.

Someone at Huawei tech support informed me that they outright refuse to repair any damage from opening or closing the lid because this \"doesn't fit under the terms of normal laptop use\". The assistant said they see a lot of this sort of damage and head office always refuse to honour the warranty. It seems that there is a serious design flaw with the edge of the screen getting caught on the body of the laptop due to too much flex. this repair will cost you around 300 quid so consider that extra cost when choosing this laptop!",
