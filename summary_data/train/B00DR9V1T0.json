      "text": "Got this to use for my HTPC. It's a better than average keyboard and touchpad. Keys are naturally spaced, I don't have any problems typing on it. Touchpad is nice and big, supports multi-touch and isn't too jittery like some cheaper laptop touchpads. Biggest gripe is that it's not backlit, however I got this for less than half-price as an Amazon Deal of the Day. If not onsale, I'd spend the few extra dollars and get the newer Logitech K830 model which is backlit. I also don't mind the AA batteries, IMHO I'd rather have batteries that I can just swap than a dead keyboard that needs to be plugged in.",

I'm sure it would work ok on a desk but I am trying, patiently, to use this with a home theatre PC and the trackpad rarely does what I want. Also minus a star because the Logitech driver doesn't let you change scroll direction, so if you're used to using a Mac you have to deal with reverse scrolling and Logitech doesn't care to add a dead-simple software switch to their driver that would make this keyboard that much better.",

Also, the feel on the touchpad was just terrible. Anytime I pressed the pad down to \"click\" it would shift the touchpad around in it's casing. The accuracy and sensitivity of the touchpad was okay, but my god the plastic shell around this thing is just awful.",

This has finally done the trick. No more sore wrists. Obviously a keypad is slower than a mouse. But this is a small price to pay. I also had to buy a G-Combo number pad to enter numbers. I wish Logitech offered a similar keyboard with a number pad. But all in all it works well and I'd recommend this.

The keyboard, like any Logitech is fantastic. Great sensitivity and feel. The trackpad however, is awful. Worst I've ever had the displeasure of touching. It feels like someone in the 90s designed it with parts from the 80s. The tapping is awful, it regularly jumps my mouse when I tap. Clicking is even worse. It doesn't recognize when you click. The track-pad feels super loose, which makes unintentional clicking happen, and happen A LOT. Do yourself a favor and look at the many other Logitech products, get a wireless keyboard and mouse that is not this one.",

Using the trackpad on this device for gestures/scrolling/pinch to zoom and then a traditional mouse for work that requires more precision, you will have a wonderful Windows 8 experience. While most keyboards are too large for this type of setup, by eliminating the numpad, a trackpad was able to be fit. Thus, you can get the gesture control of a trackpad and buy an additional mouse for pointer precision. Give it a shot!",

It's not responsive enough, has a right-click detection which cannot be disabled. In fact, I couldn't find any way to customize the trackpad on a Mac (it may be different on Windows).

Mouse pointer is really laggy and in Chrome there isn't really any mouse adjustments you can make to speed up pointer movement. ( this may be a a feature they are working on).
