      "text": "I ordered this new tube to replace a slow leaking tube on my bicycle. Since it was Dec around the holidays, who would rush to change out the inner tube. I finally got to it last weekend, about 6-7 weeks after I received the new one and after filling with air, the tube would not hold the air. I thought maybe a loose stem. Nope, it is a hole in the new inner tube. This is where, sometimes you are better buying it from a local retailer, because it is easier to go and return it for another one. Not Happy",

      "text": "This worked great but is expensive for rubber. When I was a kid, bike tubes were bike tubes, we did not have Lance Armstrong and the other famous bikers boosting what used to be plain Jane products that all of us grew up with. Now because of the prestige the famous bikers brought to the sport, simple bike consumables like bike tubes costs have gone sky rocket high. Yes the quality of rubber matters like they do for cars tires. But these are tubes, how much science does a casual biker like me need to ride? Most of us are casual bikers if that. Most bikes collect dust in the garage. So why so much for rubber tubes?",
