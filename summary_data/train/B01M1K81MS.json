The jumbo\u2019s helped fix this with a nice feel. Now a lot of my older friends are looking to switch out to jumbos to improve their hand comfort after playing way too much golf!!! Lucky guys!",

Promoting less tension in the hands and more fluidity throughout the swing creates more power. \n\nMCC Plus4 has two uniquely formulated compounds to create the performance of two grips in one. The upper hand material is a soft compound with Brushed Cotton Cord for built-in stability. The lower hand contains a softer rubber compound ideal for enhanced feel.\n\nWith 80% of global Tour players trusting Golf Pride, nobody knows their grip preferences better than Golf Pride. The majority of Tour players build up their grips to reduce tension in their hands. With less tension comes more power and the most powerful swings in the game trust Golf Pride. Now we are bringing this performance preference to you with the new MCC Plus4. \n\nFeatures:\n\n\nLarger Lower HandComposed of soft brushed cotton and rubber",
