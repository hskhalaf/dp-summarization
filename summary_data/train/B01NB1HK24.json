Further Notes: In order for the LCD display to be in the correct orientation rather than upside down, you must edit your Config.txt file in the boot directory and add the following line: lcd_rotate=2 This will allow your device to boot up with the screen in the right orientation. For portable use, any battery pack used for charging cell phones or tablets will run the Pi and the display.",

Nothing changes the line, and it is visible at all points of the boot process, so definitely a bum screen. No worries, NeeGo states a \"peace of mind warranty\" on their website, so contacted them to have the screen swapped with another one. I've now contacted them 3 times over 15 days and had radio silence in return. Started the refund process through Amazon and will be buying from a different source. Very annoying to have to disassemble the whole kit and return it when only the screen was defective.",

I was a little worried the 7\" display would be too small but it works great in the gauge only view. It's a little tight in the tuning screens but workable.

I would recommend buying the kit vs the components separate, can't go wrong for the price anyhow.",
