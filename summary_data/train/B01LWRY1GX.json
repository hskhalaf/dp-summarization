      "text": "This is not typical Makita quality. Why? The torque selector is recessed into drill body and cannot be easily rotated. The speed selector on the top requires using screwdriver to pry into position. Generally, controls are very rigid and need force to switch. It's made out of hard plastic that does not feel \"right\" to touch, not like green or white and black Makitas. I also wasn't aware they make production in China. On a positive side, it has copious amounts of torque and is very light and super small, great for overhead and tight space work. Very strong LED illuminating work ahead.",

Motor is torquey enough to drive 6\" decking screws into pine without breaking a sweat. Battery is a 2.0Ahr unit, and it very good for most jobs around the house. My only complaint is there's only one battery, but that would drive up the cost. Is it a bulky bruiser for drilling 5/8th holes in hardened steel all day? Nope. It does great for majority of household jobs, but it's not a main-line drill for commercial or industrial jobs.",

Makita gets the job done I have had this drill for a few days now You who have complained about your tool are you sure you ordered a Makita I have used only this one since I got it All buttons knobs EVERYTHING about it works great Battery still showing half charge Couldn\u2019t be more satisfied with a tool THAT IS WHY I BUY MAKITA",

The Makita 18V LXT Lithium-Ion sub-compact Brushless cordless driver-drill (model XFD11ZB, tool only, battery sold separately) is an ultra-compact drilling and driving solution with significantly less weight. The 18V sub-compact driver-drill is part of a new class of compact, with the size and weight of lower voltage tools but with the performance, power and compatibility of 18-Volt. The expansive breadth-of-line of the Makita 18V LXT\u00ae Series means an 18V battery from any LXT tool will power the 18V sub-compact driver-drill. The XFD11ZB has an efficient Brushless motor with two speed settings and dual L.E.D. Lights to illuminate the work area. At only 6-3/8 in. And 2.8 lbs. (With battery, sold separately) it is an ultra-compact drilling and driving solution with superior comfort and handling. It's part of Makita\u2019s expanding 18V Lithium-Ion Series, the world\u2019s largest cordless tool line-up powered by 18V Lithium-Ion slide-style batteries.
