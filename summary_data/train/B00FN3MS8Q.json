Tried it out this morning and already had it filled and on my back and it will not pressurize. I had already read instructions once before filling it and took it off my back and came inside the house all dirty to read them again. No dice, it WILL NOT PRESSURIZE! UGGGGH. Going in the garbage.",

This is very frustrating since it was not a cheap product. This should be a very simple mechanism that doesn't break after just a few gallons of usage-won't buy again...",

For anybody wondering if a backpack sprayer is worth the cost, absolutely. No longer lug around a heavy sprayer with one hand, stopping repeatedly to forever pump and pump and pump. These units lets you mix up a good volume (4 gallons) and then hoist on your back for effortless carrying, and then casually pump with one hand while pointing & spraying with your other.

There are two things to note: a full sprayer (4 gallons) weighs about 38-42 lbs. I found filling the tank on a table or the tailgate of our truck makes it much easier strapping it on my back and this sprayer requires \"almost\" constant pumping while sprayer (doesn't hold a lot of pressure).
