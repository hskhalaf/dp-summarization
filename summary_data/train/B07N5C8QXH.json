The silicone pad is just like real, human skin with a variety of different cuts to practice on! Not to mention, the many stainless steel tools it comes with is going to last a long time, which is super helpful as I don\u2019t like constantly buying new tools to replace old, discolored ones. The leather case it comes in fits perfect in my purse/backpack and is discreet and durable. Highly recommend purchasing!!",

      "text": "I liked that this was a good deal on a variety of practice tools that come in a nice case; however, the skin simulation tears easily (especially the subcutaneous layer) and one of the needles broke while I was using it. Unfortunately, it disappeared and my fear is if found, it will likely be located in someone's actual skin. I will update this review if I have better success with the kit in the future (I am learning, so I accept some of the fault), but I have not had such a poor experience with the actual thing. That being said, you can look for other suture kits, but I don't think there are many out there. Just be careful!",
