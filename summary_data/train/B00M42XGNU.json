I would definitely recommend for baby or other.",

In addition to this, the wood pieces for the drawers do not interlock making it impossible to piece together the drawers. I made several attempts to contact the manufacturer via email and phone and I never heard back from anyone. I may have agreed to replacement parts but it\u2019s obvious customer satisfaction is unimportant to StorkCraft. This is unacceptable!!!",

I guess this is expected since the manufacturer has a phone number you can call to get replacements. We started the project then had to wait a week for replacements to show up. The dresser is cute but don't use it too much as it won't hold up. I have the gray bed and changing table and it matches then perfectly. I wish I had used the $200 towards a quality piece of furniture.",
