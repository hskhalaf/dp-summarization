Also the hood and pattern are so adorable. I got my first one about a year ago and my dog wears it every day during the winter months, its held up and I haven't had to wash it yet (my dog has hair not fur). Wash in cold water and air dry if needed! Wool is so fussy",

I'm not sure if it's just our broad chested, knucklehead or if it's a flaw, but the neck of the sweater has stretched out and started to unravel a bit in the front. It's gotten to the point that it's un-wearable for her as it's just too loose and she ends up wearing it like a skirt!",

I was willing to look past this, but then I kept getting pricked as I touched the sweater. I took a closer look and noticed twigs stuck in the thread. I removed 6 of them before giving up because they are everywhere! Will be returning. I can't imagine how itchy a dog would be wearing this.",
