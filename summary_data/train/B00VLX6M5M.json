Using up my cell-phone minutes, I discovered after almost an hour that I have to pay $40 shipping to get a replacement base. I am very disappointed in Cuisinart. I have 6-7 of their appliances, but will consider carefully before buying another one. Their customer service is terrible.",

The top has a removable gasket (so you can clean under it) that provides a tight seal, keeping liquids from leaking out when the bowl is full. I'm really happy with this purchase.",

It is more east to saute that way. No tangling. We also own the classical inspired DFP-14. Between these most popular Cuisinart Food Processors, my mom prefers the new FP-12. It has more power, takes less space with the adjustable discs. It also has a smaller bowl for more versatile use.",

Blades are very sharp - take extreme care when handling or you\u2019ll end up getting stitches... I learned that the hard way.",

    "title": "Cuisinart FP-14DCN Elite Collection 2.0 14 Cup Food Processor, Die Cast",
    "description": "Color:Die CastEquipped with a 1300-watt peak-power induction motor, this convenient food processor quickly and easily slices, dices, chops, and purees, helping to reduce prep time in the kitchen. It supplies a 4-1/2-cup small work bowl that nest inside a 14-cup large work bowl--a versatile two-in-one design that can handle multiple-size batches. All the bowls feature durable polycarbonate construction, measurement marks up the side, and drip-free pour spouts. An exclusive SealTight Advantage System seals the bowls and locks the blades for clean, safe processing and pouring. In addition, the unit's wide-mouth feed tube accommodates larger ingredients, which reduces the need for cutting food into smaller pieces first, and its electronic touchpad control panel offers four selections for on, off, dough, and pulse. Accessories include a stainless-steel adjustable slicing disc (0 to 10 mm), a stainless-steel reversible shredding disc (fine/medium), a large and small stainless-steel chopping/mixing blade, and a dough blade. Thoughtfully designed, the food-prep appliance also provides blue LED indicator lights, a simple on/off locking system with push-button release, a retractable cord, and dishwasher-safe removable parts for quick cleanup. A lockable accessory storage case, spatula, and recipe/instruction book come included. The food processor measures 7-4/5 by 10-1/5 by 17 inches and carries a three-year limited warranty with a 10-year warranty on the motor.",
