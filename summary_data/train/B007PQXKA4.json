It's lighter than I expected but that's a good thing when cleaning the floor underneath. No wrinkles out of the box. The Mocha color is great, it's modern and discreet and fits in better that I think a black or white one would. If you stand on one heel it will make an indent in the mat but it goes away once you move. At this early stage I'm very pleased with this item!",

If you spend a lot of time in the kitchen (for me, that means at least several hours a day), you might consider treating yourself to one of these matts. If you do, this is the one to buy.",
