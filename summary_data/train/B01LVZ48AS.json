Either A) the lightning cable doesn't reach the charging port with a case on it, or B) it doesn't have any back support so that the phone is being held up by the lightning cable alone. This dock is exactly what I was hoping for. Between the height adjustable lightning plug and the angle being adjustable as well, I couldn't be happier. A+ in my book!",

The height of the lightning connector is screw-adjustable to compensate for the thickness of any case you might have on your phone, and it's not so rigidly mounted that it completely supports the phone. Instead, the phone leans against a plastic backstop that keeps it at a viewable angle. I like this dock so much that when I discontinued my office landline and replaced it with another phone, I ordered a second one for that phone. Works great for me.",
