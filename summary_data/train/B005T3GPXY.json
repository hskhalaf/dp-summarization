I followed a video posted by samsung on youtube on how to clone and install this on my mid 2012 i5 13inch macbook pro. The only problem was that the video provided by samsung is not going to be exactly the same on a new macbook with mountain lion. Just be aware of that. Also, after everything was installed and the ssd was working I noticed a slow startup but everything else was super fast. To fix this problem go to system preferences- startup disk and choose the sad. Boot up time went from 45 sec to 12 sec. Hope this helped! Good luck.",

The disk arrived on time with all the materials as advertised. The instructions were sparse and in different files, but when I followed them everything went well. The product was installed in my wife's laptop which has just started getting disk errors. So far she is really happy with how fast the laptop boots and initiates programs. I will definitely be purchasing another of these SSDs for my laptop.",

The second reason I purchased this was due to the perceived reliability from a laptop that will get moved around and no moving parts to go bad in the hard drive. It's too soon to comment on the reliability factor, but the speed factor alone is the first time I can truly call a notebook a viable desktop replacement. I look forward to tax season 2012!",
