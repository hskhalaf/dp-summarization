      "verdict": "Reebok Fury Adapt UC is adored for its aesthetics appeal and overall comfort it gives to the feet. Its uniquely built midfoot caging system does its function as it helps secure the feet. The cushiony bed inside shoe offers good padding for the feet while keeping it dry most of the time. Although its cleatie construction and no-fuss lacing system provides the convenience of slipping in and out of this shoe, some had issues with its ability to stretch.",
      "pros": [
        "Most of the reviewers found the Reebok Fury Adapt UC comfortable after picking a half-size higher than their natural size",
        "A wear tester with a wide foot thought the plastic cage would get in the way of comfort but surprised that it is bendable enough providing a secure fit for enhanced stability",
        "The Fury Adapt UC is built with a shiny TPU cage that reinforces the shape of the shoe, according to several users",
        "The midfoot caging system averts the foot from slipping to the edges of the shoe, described by one buyer",
        "The pull tabs do good work as help in putting this shoe on with ease, according to quite a lot of wearers",
        "The removable Ortholite insole is cushiony and keeps feet from getting too sweaty, described in several reviews",
        "Its Hexalite technology which is visible on the heel when the shoe is flipped over offers remarkable shock-absorption, as mentioned by more than a few wearers",
        "The EVA foam midsole offers plenty of comfort, especially when using this sneaker for a lengthy time",
        "The rubber on the outsole is tough yet allows the feet to bend with ease"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "The mesh upper creases when tightening up its quick-pull lacing system",
        "Several reviewers mentioned having difficulty sliding their feet into this shoe",
        "Those with high instep feel that this sneaker is squeezing their foot too tight",
        "A nice looking shoe but a number of those with wide feet had issues squeezing their foot through the cleatie upper",
        "Not an ideal shoe for summer as its upper can get too warm for the feet"

They have laces, but it only looses the shoe up a small amount since it doesn't have a tongue flap like other shoes. They look good, but what use is that if you can't get them on without a shoe spoon and a lot of effort?",

But it's not for hot summer - really)) And i agree that it's better to order half size or size bigger. They are small fit. My size is 10 but i bought 10.5 which is strange for reeebok. 10.5 fit nice. Yes, it's very comfortable, very stylish but as already noted, you will not be able to dress them on without shoe spoon! First time the finger rested then trampled",

Since these shoes are kinda tight. They do look beautiful tho, and have awesome comfort, again order one size up or 1/2 or your toes will suffer since the thin design needs breaking in but still a tight fit. Again, please... I cannot stress this enough for new customers... one up or 1/2 your original size. The shoes are worth it.",

Like others have said, order a half size larger than normal. Especially if you plan to be active in these.",
