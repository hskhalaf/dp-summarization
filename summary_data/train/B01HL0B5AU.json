Speaking of battery, there where 2 extras for the screen and also extra zip ties in the box in case you need. Only issue I had so farm with first one is that it was out in the sun and screen blacked out, but once I was able to cool it down, it went back to normal. Good quality for the price!",

Tried adjusting the magnet on the spokes, nothing. So after 3 months, it is junk. Work great while it worked. I put 480 miles on it. Would not recommend.",

      "text": "UPDATE: After changing both batteries, it seems to work fine now. It registers MPH and logs my miles fine, and now it even turns off (at least goes into standby mode) on its own. All the issues I had with it fixed themselves by swapping to Brand name batteries. We'll see how long it lasts from here. Dead after a little over 1 year. It was never able to turn off, so I'm surprised the battery lasted as long as it did. However, the functions were dicey at best. Some days it would register, some days it wouldn't. Sometimes the speedometer would just get stuck at some arbitrary speed, even when the bike wasn't in motion.",

The ties do not allow for much precision, and yet the clearance between the rotating magnet & sending unit (max 3 mm) is very important to the accuracy of the computer. A different type of attachment is needed, so that the unit can be set with precision. The speedometer became sporadically inaccurate after only about a week of use. I would never buy a product from this company again.",

The second one I have is okay so far, but I just bought another one to put on my second bike and it is acting erratically from the start. I suspect that the electronics are very cheaply made and that may be why. The current speed doesn't show up consistantly. It sometimes reads 0 mph, sometimes it varies between 2-14 mph. It bounces all around and goes to zero like there is a short circuit in the system. It is very annoying!",
