This food contains pea flour which is a plant based protein and causes bladder stones! I am currently waiting for a call from my vets office to pick up my poor ferret. He has so many bladder stones and they are lined up throughout his urethra. Around $1000 I\u2019m paying for his surgery and not to mention I just wasted $20 on a bag of this food the other day. I will be getting a refund! This is ridiculous. DO NOT PURCHASE IF YOU LOVE YOUR FERRETS!",
