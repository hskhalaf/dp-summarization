      "text": "These trays create very large cubes which is their positive draw. But this is only an average product. The plastic is very thin and flimsy which leads to two issues. The cubes don't come out as cubes but irregular blobs that in my experience get more weirdly shaped as the plastic loosens. And the flimsy plastic means you need to be careful carrying them when they're full of water. I have a few different molds that create 2\" cubes which are sturdy and great. I don't think the problems with these is worth it to get just slightly larger cubes. Wouldn't buy again.",

The only thing is the size is very large. Larger than most I saw which I thought that was a good thing. They actually are so big they don\u2019t fit in the glasses we have unless I run them under water a few seconds to shrink them down just a tiny bit.

If you allow them to set for a couple of minutes after removal from the freezer it is easier to remove the cubes and less stressful to the silicone. I probably muscled my cubes out too many times damaging the silicone.",
