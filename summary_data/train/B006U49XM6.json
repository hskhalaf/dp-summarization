Pricey at first and finally manageable for the wallet. I love the speed, the weight, and it feels so natural upright and on verticle grip. It offers ISO for any situation. Only complaint is this new card slot. I have all CF cards. Other than that, worth every penny. Bought mine used with over 200K shots but still running like a true champ. FPS is sweet.",

    "title": "Nikon D4 16.2 MP CMOS FX Digital SLR with Full 1080p HD Video (Body Only) (OLD MODEL)",
    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n\nThis new flagship D-SLR offers speed and accuracy with a 16.2 MP FX-format CMOS sensor, 10/11 fps continuous shooting, a 91,000-Pixel RGB sensor and Advanced SRS, improved 51 point AF System, ISO expanded to 204,800 and 1080p video at 30p with stereo sound.\n\n\nCATCH MOMENTS OTHERS MISS\nSPEED AND ACCURACY IN TOTAL HARMONY\nD4 offers a level of speed and accuracy that will redefine your notion of the fleeting moment. A carefully selected FX-format 16.2 Megapixel CMOS sensor is paired with Nikon\u2019s powerful EXPEED3 image processor for stunning stills up to 11 fps. A 91,000-Pixel RGB 3D Color Matrix Metering III sensor partners with Nikon\u2019s Advanced SRS to deliver unmatched accuracy in every frame. Add a faster, more responsive 51-point AF system for a camera that can keep pace with you.\n\nSTUNNING IMAGES EVERY TIME\nSUPERIOR QUALITY YOU EXPECT FROM NIKON\nWhat are speed and accuracy without image quality? Nikon\u2019s FX-format (36.0mm x 23.9mm) CMOS image sensor delivers 16.2 effective megapixels of resolution for exquisite detail. Each of this remarkable sensor\u2019s 7.3-micron pixels is designed to collect maximum light to produce stunning images and video across D4\u2019s broad ISO range of 100 to 12,800 (expandable down to 50 and up to 204,800). Expect the highest image quality in bright and dark shooting. Plus, EXPEED3 image processing yields the most faithful colors, tones and a wide dynamic range.\n\nENHANCE STORIES WITH HD VIDEO\nBROADCAST-QUALITY AND OUTSTANDING CONTROL\nWhen an assignment calls for broadcast-quality video and audio, D4 is ready. Choose from three Multi-area mode Full HD D-Movie (1080p) video formats: FX, DX or the new 2.7x Crop mode\u2014all at 16:9 aspect ratio. Manual exposure control helps keep the same look from start to finish. Built-in HDMI lets you view footage on an external monitor or record uncompressed 8-bit 4.2.2 footage directly to an external recording device. Even take 2MP stills simultaneously while filming. Attach the ME-1 Stereo Microphone and record high fidelity audio with minimal camera noise. On-screen audio level indicators and a headphone jack help you monitor and adjust audio in 20 incremental steps. D4 takes you from inspiring still to amazing videos with ease.\n\n\n\nCOMPLETE CONTROL AND COMFORT\nDESIGNED FOR AN EFFICIENT WORKFLOW\nD4\u2019s remarkable design is the culmination of photographer feedback and Nikon innovation. Adjust AF and AF Area modes without moving your eye from the viewfinder. Quickly select AF points with a new joystick style sub-selector\u2014positioned for both horizontal and vertical shooting. In low-light, all operation buttons and dials are beautifully backlit. Two media card slots offer flexibility and control. Built-in wired LAN and the optional WT-5A Wireless Transmitter enable secure, high-speed file transmission as well as remote camera functionality. Simply put, D4 was built to meet professional demands.\n\nEXPAND YOUR OPPORTUNITIES\nNIKON IMAGING SYSTEM COMPATIBILITY\nDraw on the full potential of D4: world-renowned NIKKOR lenses, the Nikon Creative Lighting System, Speedlights, accessories and software. Each impressive FX and DX lens in the NIKKOR lineup is fully tested to deliver sharpness, accuracy and reliability. Bring studio quality lighting to assignments with Nikon Speedlights. Only Nikon offers i-TTL (Intelligent Through The Lens) flash control, which allows Nikon Speedlights to access extensive exposure and metering data from D4 to provide unprecedented levels of flash precision and performance. Nikon\u2019s professional imaging software, and a robust line of compatible accessories will help you expand your capabilities.\n\n\n\nNEVER MISS A DEADLINE\nTHE WT-5A WIRELESS TRANSMITTER\nWhen the world is waiting, being the first to publish makes all the difference. Nikon\u2019s powerful new wireless transmitter, WT-5A, attaches directly to D4 to securely and quickly transfer files.\n\nHTTP Mode: Now you can use the web browser on your iPhone\u00ae and/or iPad\u00ae** to operate camera controls or begin Live View shooting, including starting and stopping HD video and more.\n\nImage Transmission Mode: Transmit images to an FTP server or computer two times faster than the Nikon WT-4A.\n\nOperate the D4 via Camera Control Pro 2. From one master camera, simultaneously release up to ten remote D4/WT-5A combinations.\n\n**iPhone\u00ae and iPad\u00ae are are registered trademarks of Apple Inc.\n\n\n\nNEW 51-POINT AF SYSTEM\nNikon\u2019s new advanced AF sensor uses 51 strategically placed AF points for faster focus operation by working together like a net to capture moving subjects or individually for pinpoint accuracy. Each of the 51 selectable AF points delivers fast and accurate AF detection to a low light level of -2 EV (ISO 100, 20\u00b0 C) with every compatible AF NIKKOR lens.\n\nRICH IMAGE PREVIEWING\nD4\u2019s beautiful 3.2-inch, 921,000-dot LCD includes an ambient brightness sensor for maximum visibility and crisp playback, menu adjustment and Live View shooting. Quickly enlarge images and videos up to 46x for spot focus confirmation\u2014crucial for high-resolution shooting.\n\n\n\nOUR MOST RUGGED BODY YET\nTo sustain peak performance in the most demanding environments, D4\u2019s body, exterior and mirror box are comprised of strong yet lightweight magnesium alloy. Thorough measures are taken to seal and protect against invasive moisture, dust and electromagnetic interference.\n\nDUAL MEMORY CARD SLOTS (CF AND XQD)\nDual memory card slots (one CF and one XQD) Record two full cards of data, the same still image data on both cards for instant backup, RAW on one card and JPEG on the other or transfer data from one card to another. You can even designate one slot for data-heavy HD video recording.\n\n\n\nAF DETECTION UP TO F/8\nD4 aligns its 15 cross-type sensors in the center to detect contrast for both vertical and horizontal lines with lenses f/5.6 or faster. The five central points and three points to the left and right of them in the middle line are compatible with f/8.\n\nMULTI-AREA FULL HD D-MOVIE VIDEO RECORDING MODES\nFX-format renders exquisitely shallow depth of field and wide-angle shooting. DX-format offers a 1.5x crop of the lens focal length, and 1920x1080 Crop format gives you a 2.7x angle of view\u2014ideal for extending lens reach when you can\u2019t get close enough.\n\n91,000-PIXEL RGB 3D COLOR MATRIX METERING III WITH ADVANCED SRS\nFace detection using the optical viewfinder and detailed scene analysis using the 91,000-pixel RGB sensor enables superior auto exposure, auto white balance, AF performance and i-TTL flash exposure.\n\nBUILT-IN HDR\nCombine two exposures at up to 3EV to create a single image revealing an extremely wide dynamic range but with less noise and richer color gradation than ever before.\n\nTWO-AXIS VIRTUAL HORIZON INDICATOR\nDetermine if the camera is level\u2014horizontally or forward\u2014through the viewfinder or LCD monitor.\n\nNEW MIRROR BALANCER\nMinimizes the bounce of the mirror\u2019s down movement, extending viewing time and allowing more time for AF operation\u2014one reason D4 achieves AF and focus tracking even during high-speed continuous shooting.\n\nINTELLIGENT POWER MANAGEMENT\nExpect greater operating efficiency thanks to a new, small, high-capacity EN-EL 18 rechargeable Li-ion battery that can deliver up to approximately 2,600 images* per charge.\n*Based on CIPA Standard.\n\nVIEW SIMULTANEOUS LIVE VIEW OUTPUT ON EXTERNAL MONITORS AND RECORD UNCOMPRESSED VIDEO VIA HDMI TERMINAL\nCheck video recording on the camera\u2019s LCD and external monitor simultaneously; ideal for focus pullers and camera operators. When the highest possible image quality is required, you can bypass memory cards and record uncompressed footage directly from the image sensor onto an external recording device.\n\nTIME LAPSE SHOOTING\nSet intervals and frame rates in order to dramatically relay slow-moving activity at dramatic speeds. D4 lets you shoot time-lapse photography with replay rates from 24 to 36,000 times faster than normal and save them as movie files.\n\nTWO LIVE VIEW SHOOTING MODES\nPhotography Live View and Movie Live View modes add flexibility; exposure, white balance, monitor hue, histogram, focus mode, AF area mode and focusing accuracy are easily confirmed.\n\nDEDICATED NIKON PICTURE CONTROL BUTTON\nQuickly access six preset picture control options\u2014Standard, Neutral, Vivid, Monochrome, Landscape and Portrait\u2014and up to nine customizable settings with a single button.\n\n400,000-CYCLE TESTED SHUTTER\nFor the utmost reliability and rigorous performance, D4\u2019s shutter has been tested on fully assembled cameras for 400,000 cycles at extreme continuous burst rates.\n\nSELF-DIAGNOSTIC SHUTTER MONITOR\nShould any shutter variance be detected, D4 automatically corrects and adjusts between the actual shutter speed and correct shutter speed to sustain precision shutter operation throughout the mechanism\u2019s lifespan.\n\nSUPPLIED ACCESSORIES\n * AN-DC7 strap\n * EN-EL18 Rechargeable Li-ion Battery\n * MH-26 Battery Charger\n * UC-E15 USB Cable\n * USB Cable Clip\n * BF-1B Body Cap\n * UF-2 Connector cover for stereo mini plug cable\n * UF-1 Connector cover for USB cable\n * Nikon View NX2 CD ROM\n * Transmitter Utility CD\n * BS-2 Accessory Shoe Cover",
