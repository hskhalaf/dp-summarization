I've used it in a pinch when the power went. This unit is fairly loud but it works. I've had over 100 hours on it and it is running fine. It is stored inside a shed with ethanol free gas and the gas line closed. It starts on the first pull with the choke on. Happy with my purchase. I would hope that they would include better nuts and bolts as the vibration has rattled many of them out.",

Shipping company was very helpful in delivering the unit by providing a power tailgate lift (this weighs about 190 lbs). it was delivered before promised date, and assembly took just a few minutes. Oil was provided for the engine. While I hope I don't need this too often, I believe it will work as advertised.",

In the second hour I noticed a gas smell and upon investigation I saw gas leaking out of the carb and all over my patio. While fixing that myself I noticed the lousy quality of cast parts typical of being made in China. A month later the pull cord broke and I returned the unit for another brand. Generac has gone down the dumper.",

This has performed well through one big storm, and in NJ we're expecting more, so hopefully it will continue.",

Look at some pics, the gp5500 has the same engine found in all the cheap chinease generators that cost half as much. I am really upset that i spent $780.00 w/tax for this generator from GENERAC! only to find out later its a cheap generator like a chicago, champion, homelite etc. I bought it because it was a generac and it was suppossed to be made in america = quality. I could have spent half the money and gotten the same product that was not hiding behind a name that used to be known for amarican quality.",

I call the company customer service, who told me i'd have to go buy one myself, even after I explained that mine never had one. The supervisor said she would check with headquarters to see what they could do, and call me back. Of course i never heard back from her. If they balk over a 5 dollar filter, I can imagine what their response would be if something more expensive failed. I just bought two Honda EU2000's and I will NEVER never purchase anything again from generac.",

Generac's model 5939, GP5500 is ideal for tailgating, camping, power tool use, and emergency home backup power. It has a low-tone muffler for quieter operation and an hour meter that tracks usage between maintenance sessions. The low oil shutdown feature detects low oil levels and if found, shuts down the engine to prevent any damage. The unique fold down hands and never flat wheels allow for extreme portability, and the heavy duty hardened steel tube cradle gives the generator extra strength and durability. The new covered circuit breaker protected outlets provide added protection from the environment and rugged working conditions. Affordable reliability and features not usually found on basic portable models makes these units a favorite for home use, camping, job sites or outdoor events. Model 5939 is not CARB (can not ship to state of California) or CSA compliant.",
