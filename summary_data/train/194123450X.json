The questions are exactly like the ones on the test, especially for reading and math. I remember doing a math problem in the book, and seeing that same problem, VERBATIM, on the test. Just use this book wisely and you will do well. I tore out a few pages at a time and completed them day by day to practice, practice, practice. I highly recommend this book for anyone. I wouldn't have scored a 34 on the ACT without it.",

This is an excellent resource to use with a tutor, or if the student is already aware of what concepts they are struggling with, but the evaluations are rather limited, which make it difficult for someone to use this book to its full potential on their own. The fact that the topics are broken up into large practice sets is invaluable to me as an academic coach, and I would suggest this to any student or tutor to supplement work with full test sets. Great value at cost. I've bought several already for my tutoring company.",
