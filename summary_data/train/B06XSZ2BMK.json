The color did run. Then I put all 4 colors in the washing machine and ran it through the cycle without detergent and added 1 cup vinegar and NO fabric softener!! They came out perfect with no more running colors and super soft. If I hadn't had to pre-wash, I would've gave this 5 stars. I like them. They are a decent size for cleaning at a good price.",

      "text": "I was SUPER excited to receive these because you get so many for a good price. They are soft, and easy to wash. they are a decent size, about the size of a normal handtowel. However, once you start cleaning, and add a cleaning solution to them they become sticky. They absorb water well BUT not any cleaning products. They are a nightmare to clean with. They get stuck on the counters/table- its like it creates a sticky cling. Buy the more expensive brand where you get less, they are worth it.",
