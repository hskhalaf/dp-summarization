They finally started to get too worn out to wear anymore so i started shopping for new black flats. Purchased SEVEN different pairs and they all suck in comparison. finally found these on amazon and ordered. oh man i've missed these flats and am so happy to have a new pair. They are a bit snug & uncomfortable the first day or so but once they stretch out a bit they're PERFECT.",
