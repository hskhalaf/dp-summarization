Step two, pack it back up and return it all or call the manufacturer. Step three, buy a different set. Super disappointing that the very first piece out of the box is wrong. If you can't see the picture well, the arm should click in so it swings horizontally but the base pieces included in the set are vertically oriented. This is the base for everything, so no part of this can be assembled to create the robot with moving limbs. Not a great gift unless you just want to bulk buy some legos.",
