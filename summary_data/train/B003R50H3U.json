There is no padding, it's small for any ski that is not a 70s style Slamon ski, that are essentially straight narrow boads. The material is flimsy, and close to wrapping your ski in a plastic bag. Looking for an alternative now.",

Just make sure to buy the right size for your skis. Not a lot to say about this bag other than it is inexpensive and it works. I always buy High Sierra stuff.",
