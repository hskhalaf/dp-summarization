      "text": "I own these, Grado SR325's and AKG K712's. All similarly priced open back headphones and all purchased through Amazon. I have tried all 3 with digital and analog sources and with old fashioned MOSFET amplification as well as modern Op-Amp amplification. Compared to the Grado and AKG counterparts, I do not prefer the sound of these. The most distinct area these are lacking is in the treble, which lacks the clarity of the AKG's or smoothness of the Grado's. They are however built sturdily and quite comfortable, especially compared to the Grados. Thus the \"It's okay.\" 3 star rating.",

      "text": "After comparing the HD 600, 650, 660S for a week, I actually went with the HD600s. There was something magical about these, not to mention they are the best value of the bunch. The HD 650 were darker, and the HD 660S were brighter. The vocals were best on the HD 600s imo. The HD660S pushes the vocals back a tad to make room for some treble, if that makes sense. It sounded more balanced overall, but I found myself loving the HD 600 more on most tracks. It was a tough choice, but my ears and wallet are happy.",

Comfort is huge for me, as the HE 500s made my neck sore to the point where I didn't want to use them for fear of the pain coming back. I am using the HD 600 with a Schitt Jotunheim amp/dac and the combo has been excellent. The HD 600 will always be in my possession.",

Upgraded from my tried and true HD 595s, which are still going strong after many years\u2014a testament to Sennheiser's quality for these kinds of headphones. Definitely worth the upgrade if you have the money to spare as the difference in overall quality is profound. And that's saying something, because the HD 595s are excellent cans as well. If this pair lasts anywhere near as long as my HD 595s, Sennheiser will probably be getting more of my money down the line.",
