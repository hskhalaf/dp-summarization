      "text": "This is only for people who don't know how a real mortar and pestle are supposed to work. They are both supposed to have similar curvatures so that there is good contact between the two pieces. In this set, the pestle has a curved end (as it should), but the mortar has straight sides and a flat bottom, making for minimal contact between it and the pestle. So this might be okay for simply smashing something small (like a pill), but it's pretty useless for grinding something (like spices).",

I love the finish of it as well, we are very picky about our kitchen utensils and we want everything to be a plain ceramic white. This fits in perfectly. *On a side note, if you have turmeric stains just set it in the sunlight, the sunlight will remove turmeric stains.",

    "description": "Size:3.5-Inches\n\nHIC\u2019s Mortar and Pestle Set is the perfect tool to grind items into a fine paste or powder. The mortar bowl and pestle work together to grind and break down ingredients quickly. It\u2019s a helpful addition to kitchen items for speeding up food preparation with minimum effort. Quickly grind fresh ingredients, like cloves of garlic, herbs and spices, peppercorns or cinnamon, nuts, grains, and seeds, into a fine paste or powder. Make aromatic dry rubs, curry pastes, pestos, nut butters, spreads, and so much more. Even use it as a pill crusher to pulverize harder-to-swallow pills! Essential tools for those practicing homeopathy, the art of healing through natural remedies, HIC\u2019s Mortar and Pestle Set offers effortless preparation of herbal and homeopathic remedies. So easy to use. Simply place an item into the mortar bowl. Hold the pestle by the handle and, using a firm pressure, make a circular stirring-like motion to grind your item into a paste or powder. Harder items, like peppercorns, may need the surface cracked before they can be ground. Firmly, but gently, tap the item with the pestle, then grind into the desired consistency. Pestle and mortar are both made from fine-quality porcelain to complement kitchen countertops and any home decor. Dishwasher safe for easy cleanup.",
