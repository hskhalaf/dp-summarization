The latter is a physiological issue, not product quality. If there was a way to cinch the legs, I am sure they would be outstanding.",

    "title": "Prevail Incontinence Protective Underwear, Extra Absorbency, Youth/Small Adult, 88 Count",
    "description": "Size:Youth/Small Adult (88 Count)Designed for extra leakage protection, Prevail Underwear features Comfort-Shape Plus with gentle elastics that shape to your body for a more comfortable and discreet fit than standard adult diapers. The cloth-like outer cover is soft and comfortable for all-day wear while ventilated waist panels allow air to pass through, reducing heat buildup and promoting healthy skin. Prevail Underwear is the #1 rated brand in the healthcare industry. Each product is constructed with a discreet core technology that allows for thinner, highly-absorbent material that enables the user to move more freely and confidently. Combined with a super absorbent polymer for dual protection, Odor Guard technology is proven to reduce the total amount of odor-causing ammonia formed during and after use. Moisture is quickly locked in upon contact for added leakage protection while the soft outer fabric provides additional all-day comfort. Youth/Small Adult size fits waist sizes 20 to 34 inches for a snug and comfortable fit. Each Prevail incontinence product features a proprietary Quick Wick layer of material with MaxSoft Technology that provides advanced softness with rapid liquid absorption for optimal product performance. This package includes four packs of underwear with 22 pairs per package for a total of 88 individual pairs of disposable underwear. Prevail adult care products are manufactured in Pennsylvania with attention to quality, safety, sustainability, and responsible sourcing practices by First Quality, a family-owned company.
