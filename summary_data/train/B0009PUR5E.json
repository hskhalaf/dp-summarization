The problem is that it sits VERY close to your pot and combined with problem (1) above, you get a superhot spot in the middle of your pot rather than a more diffuse flame evenly distributing the heat. Fine for boiling water, but for cooking food at something other than full blast, it's hard to control.",

We'll see if problem continues. Functioned fine, once bottle was on. For simple meals or to boil water, it's a no brainer. I was on a five day solo car camping trip and only used my double burner stove once. A single burner was all I needed most times. My old stove konked out after I got home. I can't complain, it was twenty years of light use old. This Coleman is a replacement for the old one.",

The stove is pretty unstable unless you are able to sit it on a flat concrete surface and even then the CG is pretty high so it easily tips over. Also the gas control valve is pretty flaky. Protrudes out quite a bit and could easily get broken off or damaged when carried in a back pack. No igniter. Other than that the price was right but there are better stoves available.",

If the design had been though out just a little bit better the plastic \"stable base\" would pack more closely with the burner-reflector assemble to make a smaller package. I may try cutting 4 slots in the base to allow that. It wouldn't be a big thing. The alternate might be to have some form of fold-up feet that would allow the base to pack inside the reflector. You can buy aftermarket \"stable bases\" that have swivel feet to reduce the diameter for storage.",

That is the one I'd probably take for when solo camping and packing lite. shipped super fast - ordered on friday and arrived on sunday",

I used to use only my charcoal grill which left us waiting a while for our meal. Now, we eat in no time after a long day of hiking.
