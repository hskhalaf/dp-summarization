The only issue is the connector, which is a little bit weak. It holds into the pole slightly less solid than I'd prefer, but it's never come off during any sweeping.

After years of pool cleaning I finally got it...bristles would fall out and clog up my skimmer and filter and metal corroded! that was because I left the brush out in the Sun and did not rinse chlorine out of it. So now that I rinse the brush with clean water and store out of sunlight the brush lasts much longer and there are no bristles breaking off and clogging pool equipment! not to mention not having to replace your brush all the time! brushes are not Cheap!",

At its inception, Swimline was the largest manufacturer of in-ground and above-ground pool liners, covers, and all related accessories. In 1990, Swimline founded International Leisure Products, which expanded the product line to pool toys, games, fun floats and accessories. With this vast array of pool products, Swimline continued to deliver on the needs of its reputable business partners to provide quality products. Four years later, in 1994, Swimline acquired United Leisure Industries HydroTools , which allowed the company to manufacture traditional pool accessories such as leaf skimmers, pool filters, and a wide range of maintenance equipment to keep pools in top shape. HydroTools furthers our commitment to supplying quality products to the pool trade.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nReinforced aluminum construction with nylon bristles. Curved design.",
