The way it is made allows it to move way to much, which is annoying and means you have to check that the cover is actually on the seat before you allow the dog to get in each time.",

This hammock doesn't budge when my dog is moving around, and it was very easy to install. This hammock also fits better than any other I've tried, and I attribute it to the adjustable straps for the headrests so you can custom fit it to your car. It fits like a glove in my Honda CRV, and I would highly recommend this product to anyone. The company is also wonderful, and sent me an email for my lifetime warranty within days after it arrived.",
