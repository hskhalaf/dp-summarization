Max water pressure is your line pressure, so the spray from the main handle isn't tremendous.

We have butcher block countertops and try to keep water off of the wood so we have to watch that. We typically use the sprayer instead.

Very easy to install, took me about 30 minutes including taking off the old faucet (which was the most difficult part). The only thing I wish it had was a diverter valve to allow you to keep water going to the sprayer when the water is on. This would keep the water from running through the main faucet when doing dishes allowing you to control when you want the water on/off by squeeze of the handle. Overall, a great faucet, great quality, and fraction of the price of others!",

That has been a come and go issue. Most recently the flow rate on the sprayer side has markedly dropped off while the faucet head maintains full flow, I'm trying to figure out how to correct that. There is no evidence of calcium build up, etc, and our water is good quality so I'm not sure what that is about.",

The metal on the sprayer will get quite warm as you use it with hot water so be sure your hands are on the protective grip when using. I also suggest the buyer also make sure they have a sturdy sink before purchasing because it does weigh a bit and will wobble on a cheap metal sink. We reinforced under the sink but still have wobble and are purchasing a replacement well-built sink to compensate. The faucet's on lever is normally full-on each time; very touchy; it will splash but I don't mind that.",

With it being so top heavy, it produces a lot of leverage on the places where the parts are put together, and where it is mounted to the sink. Looks great, not so useful.",

      "text": "Beautiful faucet. Easier to install than it was to remove the old one! Installation was easy because I had to do only two things under the sink: secure the faucet to the sink and hook up the water. The rest of the installation was topside. Not sure why people are not satisfied with the flow rate. It's no high pressure fire hose, but it's certainly adequate. I'd been looking at this faucet for a couple of years. Wish I'd bought it sooner.",

Not to mention the staff was very apologetic and polite. I was in a better mood after I called than before. This is a rare situation as we all know all too well! I highly recommend this product.",

No plumbing store had anything that matched (3/8 npt is NOT the same as 10mm bsp!)
