This was my first mattress that came in a box so I was skeptical, but was pleasantly surprised. The reviews stating that bedbugs definitely got my attention, however, I didnt understand how they were being introduced during the manufacturing or shipping process so I called the linenspa to get my answer from the horses mouth. Needless to say, I ordered a total of 6 mattresses and all of them came very well packaged and sealed with zero signs of ANY bugs. Do your own research and I believe you will also put those fears to rest.",

I generally like a softer mattress and I find it to be noticeably firm, but the memory foam on top gives it a nice bit of squish. A friend who likes super firm mattresses said she thought it was a bit too soft. So, medium firm like the description says. The pic is right after I unrolled it. No issues with decompression, it popped up and completely inflated itself within an hour at most, (it was a hot day) and it arrived clean and in great condition. Ignore the crazy bug reviews.",

This product seems very good especially for such a low price.",

Might be worth a try for a child's mattress or a lightweight guest bed but, even then I don't think it will last long.",

Bought the metal frame, and his empty luggage stores beautifully underneath.",

I regret buying this for it was only a temporary solution.",

Yet it still feels supportive. I would say it's soft to lightly firm. My son loves it and now I have to figure out how to swipe it from him. One last thing: The Twin XL is a little short. My son is 6'6\" and his feet still stick out to his ankles.",
