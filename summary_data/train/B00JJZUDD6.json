      "text": "This thing works great. Puts out more air than a similar fan I have the same size but uses less power overnight on my powerbank than that other fan too! Can't go wrong with this. Only thing is the blade guard is a little big and you can easily manage to accidently slip a finger tip in the blade if grabbed just right.",

I've had the first one for about 3 months, so fingers crossed that it continues to work for years to come. Why didn't I think of getting this sooner??",
