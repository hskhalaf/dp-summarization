Even the LED is a stylish bar instead of a little LED dot. It initially didn't work but after I took the soap reservoir off and dunked the tube end into a sink full of water and activated it a few times it started squirting out water like it should. After that it worked with the soap too.",

We have bought about 8 different brands of these dispensers in the last 3 years and all of them only last between 2 weeks to 3 months. The only brand that has been reliable that we purchased on Amazon is the the ones we have in our bathrooms so I am going to purchase another one like that brand to use in the kitchen (Me Sugar brand soap dispenser if anyone interested)",

No drips, looks clean and sleek. I don't know about battery life or longevity of the product as I've only used it for a couple of weeks. I use it in the kitchen with regular dish soap. It has happened where the IR sensor didn't seem to recognize a plastic bowl underneath and wouldn't dispense. I had to put my hand in place to get it to \"fire\". I'm pleased, and will get one for the bathroom if it continues to operate well.",

You\u2019ll really enjoy having this item in your home! ***update**** After 8 months stopped working. The lights come on and seems to have power but the sensor no longer works the soap is no longer dispensed. Seems like you should get more than 8 months.",
