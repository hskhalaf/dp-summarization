Easy to mix if you follow directions. I mix with water in a small blender (made for smoothies). The foam eventually is gone. Use in my veggie meals. I store what's left in the blender bottle in the refrigerator to use for 3 more days. I was a little concerned about the taste since I don't eat red meat. If anything, my meals taste better!

Some products had a lot of additives that I didn't want. This protein powder has worked well for me. I heat up a cup of water in my microwave and then pour it over the powder already in a separate cup. I mix it up and then pour it into my NutriBullet large cup and it gets all mixed up with my other ingredients. It's a bit expensive but the high quality is worth it to me.",

I am able to go along with the flavor, and I should know if this product is doing me good things later on, since results take time to show itself. Their customer service is quick, honest, and reliable which leaves me a great feeling. Thank you.",

It dissolves the best when in hot liquid, in my experience. This is not meant to be eaten in powder or by itself, it will not have good taste, people, so don't complain about the taste when it is not meant to be eaten alone. I feel healthy when I eat it, knowing that it is certified organic and grass fed. Hopefully it gets so popular that it drives the price down.",

Does have a slight flavor with water but easily masked and/or tolerated. We are monthly subscribers. Also mixes well with other protein powders. My husband uses it more and he definitely has noticed a difference in his joints (works construction and is in his 40's) and I have noticed a difference in his skin (more youthful).",

This product can be made into a broth or mixed into a smoothie, but either way, it tastes so bad that I find it unusable. I hate to give it such a low rating because for those without taste buds, it might be very beneficial. Unfortunately, I'll never know because I am going to throw it out. For a smoothie, it definitely requires a blender.",

I love that you get a substantial serving of bone broth protein, (which is also excellent for your gut), and it blends so well with my smoothie or any other drink. There isn\u2019t an aftertaste like some other products and it adds a creamy consistency that bubbles up like a latte. I have also enjoyed it blended with just almond milk, over ice. I am on my second order, and I highly recommend this product!!",

I feel a lot better using this knowing that it comes from grass fed cows, and it\u2019s helped my digestion, and allowed me to maintain lean muscle mass.",
