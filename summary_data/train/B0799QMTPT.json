      "verdict": "Being one of the silos in the Magista series, a lot is expected from the Nike Magista Obra II DF Pro FG. Indeed, the cleat\u2019s comfort and performance passed the majority expectations. Many users were in awe of\u00a0its\u00a0snug fit and great traction. For players who are looking for an excellent cleat quality with likes of Magista Obra II DF Elite but on a relatively lower budget then this is the better choice.",
      "pros": [
        "Many users have attested to the cleats comfort",
        "they were impressed with the snug sensation that the synthetic leather offers",
        "Several reviewers were glad that the cleat is not as expensive as the Magista Obra II DF Elite (formerly the\u00a0Magista Orden II FG) but still delivers the same quality as the said silo in the same series",
        "The stud pattern performance was described as excellent by some players as it provided them better rotational traction",
        "Some players find the overall design to be stylish particularly the dimpled texture that is found in the upper",
        "The second version of the Nike Magista Obra DF Pro FG had a great touch on the ball as told by some players"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "A few reviews noted the tight grip of the synthetic leather to the socks that made the cleat uncomfortable to put on",
        "A couple of players stated that Nike Magista Obra II DF Pro FG is not the best option for the wide-footed as it provided an extra snug feel overall",
        "Some testers have experienced durability issues with the sole",
        "It snapped after a few sessions, according to some players",
        "Some users experienced painful blisters while breaking in with the Nike Magista Obra II DF Pro FG"
