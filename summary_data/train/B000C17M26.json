Yes, you can turn at an intersection without having to glance back, with 100 percent certainty you are safe. That's pretty cool. The handlebar end mounted mirror btw was crummy in all aspects. You'd need to stare REAL hard to see anything because it's so far way, and the vibration makes it worthless.",

Initially I didn't think the Compact version would give me enough depth of field, but surprisingly I much prefer the Compact version and will be ordering a second one as a back up. Don't get me wrong, the Original is also nice, but I don't need that large of a mirror blocking part of my field of vision. The Compact version is now my \"go to\" mirror. Nice to be able to take a quick glance and see if anyone is coming up behind me. Great product!",

It took a bit to get it mounted right and fitted on the glasses, but seems to fit tightly.",
