The shoe\u2019s ability to accommodate custom orthotics also resonated well with the purchasers. However, despite being marked as true to size and fit, there were complaints that it ran short and narrow. Other issues included poor construction and insoles. But in the end, the trainer came highly recommended because it was supportive and comfortable to wear.",

        "The Propet Connelly was described as one of the most comfortable walking shoes by almost all of the owners",

        "The available width options delighted many reviewers because they were able to find a snug and comfortable fit",
        "The footgear was reasonably priced, according to plenty of consumers",
        "Despite its bulky construction, a lot of individuals stated that it felt light on their feet",

        "the outsole wore out and seams unraveled",

The first ones were a lighter and had a thinner sole. These are built more like a hiking boot but still have the comfort and support of my older ones. I like the brown color so I can wear them to work with khakis. They do take a couple of days to break in but after that they feel even better.",
