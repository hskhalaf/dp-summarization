It is expensive at around a hundred dollars, but if you think about it, a regular diaper changer is about $20, and you then buy 4 sets of covers for it because poop will get on the cover and you'll have to wash the covers, and you're looking at about a hundred dollars and a lot of extra work. Just get this one. The only down side is poop will stain the foam. I've been using this for just a month and the foam is already stained yellow where my baby's butt lies.",

The Keekaroo helps keep her contained so I don't have to worry about her rolling off the changing table. It is bigger than I imagined, but I know she will growth with it. It is a breeze to clean too - just wipes clean. Baby does seem to not like how it is cold on her back during diaper changes, so I lay a little cloth under her back as a little barrier.",

After opening up my daughter's diaper before she was finished around her fifth day of life I was able to test the \"easy to clean\" claim on the product description. While the changer is easy to wipe down, I noticed a bit of staining right away that wouldn't come out even with significant scrubbing. I still think I prefer this changer to any traditional changing pad though. The number of liquid accidents that have occurred and have been easily cleaned up more than make up for the staining, but I think it's unfortunate that the changer will slowly start looking dirty over time if more colorful accidents occur.",

Also I usually put a prefold cloth diaper down under him when I change him.

      "text": "I was a little hesitant about purchasing a changer with this price tag, but I'm so glad I did. If you're on the fence about this or one of the more common changing pads with the cloth covers, keep in mind it WILL get diaper contents on it. Sometimes more than once a day if it just happens to be one of those days. And this is so easy to wipe down with a disinfectant wipe and go on. No need to have multiple changing pad covers and extra laundry to do. Anything you can make easier with a newborn, I consider that worth it.",

We've had a few times where waste got on the changing pad, it's easy to wipe or wash and doesn't require a cover. It also looks really nice in the nursery, it's pricey but totally worth it.",

The sides are very high and can\u2019t be squished down easily, reducing the fear of a rolling Baby falling. Of course you still need to be careful, but babies get so squirmy and it adds price of mind.",

However, after he peed/pooped on the changer the first couple of times I knew I had made the right choice. This certainly beats washing changing pad covers, and baby is not bothered by the temperature/texture, etc. We simply wipe away the mess. Even though it was $98.00, it sure beats doing loads of laundry, especially in the middle of the night. I will say the Vanilla is not a white color, but more of a light grey, but it still looks nice and complements a white dresser well.",
