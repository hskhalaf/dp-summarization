The buttons don't work very well so I have just given up trying to play/stop or adjust volume because it's incredibly laggy or just doesn't do what it's supposed to do. This is my first pair of bluetooth headphones and I don't know if maybe you have to pay over 100 to get really good ones? The bass doesn't come through very clearly, nothing is very clear to be honest. I don't know if I'm keeping them. 75 is a lot for me to be like 'meh' ya know? That great review from the top contributor is what made me buy and honestly I don't know why he's so jazzed.",
