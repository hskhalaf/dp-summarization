These are sturdy with a beautiful shine. I've washed them many times since getting them, but they look as good today as when they were new! Great purchase.",

As grapefruit spoons they are completely useless, but they are still handy for de-seeding things like spaghetti squash or butternut squash (which is the only reason I\u2019m giving them 2 stars instead of 1).",
