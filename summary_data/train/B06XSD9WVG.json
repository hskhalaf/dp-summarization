      "text": "I have version 1 of the Fresh Foam Gobi and looked forward to version 2. The tongue in version 2 is attached to the rest of the shoe with elastic, embracing the foot and making the shoe feel like it's part of the foot. The Fresh Foam and the studs on the bottom of the shoe make it very comfortable and secure for walking or running on cement and dirt trails. Some of the reviews claim the shoe runs narrow but I think the snugness they feel is due to the attached tongue, which holds the shoe to the foot more snugly. In any case, my usual size and width fit fine.",

This one is way too hard! Small toe-box too. I always say, unless you spend at least 100-150$ for shoes, you get what you pay for. More expensive shoes usually mean better materials and design and comfort. I usually look for shoes in the 120-150 range and it always rings true! GO to a shoe store and try on the 150$ pair and tell me if I am wrong!",

These in 10.5 2E seem a bit narrower than other 2E's I've tried, but with the laces tied rather loose they fit like a glove. They are light at 273g/9.6oz per shoe. The black/bolt colorway is bold and bright, and I've received some compliments on them after only a few uses. They've been good on gravel and easy dirt trail walks, but I think they'll prompt me to start running soon. The material seems to breathe better than some other NB's I've tried, so I have no complaints. Time will tell on durability.",
