Picked up the sound of my clothes rustling when brushing against myself. It could be used indoors as well but the sound protection isnt top notch inside, you definitely hear the gun more than other ear protection, but they do the job. Overall theyre comfortable and performs superbly outdoors. I would recommend.",

We wanted something that he could wear while shooting, but could still hear us and anything around him (without having to take them off all the time). He wears these while he's practicing and he wears these on hunts. He loves them and so do we! His Grandfather liked them so much he asked for them for Christmas this year! He's hard of hearing and finds these are a huge help while he's out in the woods. These pick up the sounds around you and you can set the volume where you are comfortable. Would recommend these for all ages!",

I like how you can adjust the hearing sensitivity to amplify speaker's voices. My complaint is that I expected more sound dampening from these headsets (I used to have the traditional big earmuffs meant for construction). However, I will admit that's a personal preference and I may just double up with some foam ear protection as well. Otherwise, at least I can get used to the sound and work on my flinch response?
