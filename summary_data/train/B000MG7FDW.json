      "text": "I searched for several pocket knives on Amazon before arriving at this purchase. Glad I did my research, especially in dimensions and Brand, because this knife is excellent! I looked for a smaller pocket knife, merely for the fact that existing items were going to accompany the very pocket this knife shared. Sleek design, very slim width, good grip: this little, efficient pocket knife was so nice I ended up buying four more for family members as gifts. Definitely recommend this knife for pockets, so far it's come in handy in all sorts of situations: clipping postal cord, slitting plastic packaging, resetting a ISP modem with its point, and more.",

After wanting a meatier blade that the mini Swiss Army knife that I've carried on my key ring for years, I came across this Gerber (see attached picture for comparison). The knife is VERY light and thin, looks great, and handles all of the urban tasks that I need it to without being intimidating to others. If you were like me, and were looking for a lightweight, practical blade that won't raise eyebrows every time you pull it out of your pocket in the office - don't hesitate to get this knife. It is an excellent blade.",

It is minor inconvenience but I no longer consider something to drop a star. I would rather have the lock be over secure that under secure.",

      "text": "Comparing Gerber Paraframe Mini with Gerber STL 2.0 Both blades are nearly identical. The blade length (excluding the Ricasso, the unsharpened part) is 2.12\". When closed, both knifes have nearly the same profile size (the Paraframe being slightly larger). The STL is black and the Paraframe is unpainted stainless. Which knife is better comes down to how you want to carry it. The Paraframe is a little thicker but also has a belt clip, which effectively doubles the thickness and would be uncomfortable in a pocket. If you want to clip the knife, get the Paraframe. If you want to carry it in your pocket, get the STL, which is thin and smooth and not noticeable.",

Compared to my Gerber LST Ultralight, the STL is physically smaller even though it's a few more grams. I don't notice the tiny difference in weight, but I do notice the STL's smaller size. Smaller and a MUCH better slicer than my old Buck MiniBuck. There's only two negative for the STL 2.0 1) Low-quality steel - not for anything heavy duty, but it is only a 2\" anyway. I'd love it in something like 440C. 2) The frame-lock is awkward to disengage and it's easiest to two-hand it",

I will cut salami and cheese, paracord or string, open packages, and if necessary, make tinder, and all for just an ounce or so. It came with a nice edge, and I was able to dress it a little and get it the way I like it, and it took the edge easily and seems to hold it well so far. I got the silver skeletal one too, since they were so inexpensive. I do like the clip that came on the silver one, that this one does not have.",

You have to hold the knife with the handle in your right hand, blade facing up. Then with your thumb pull toward you the side of the frame facing you.That allows the knife blade to unlock from its locked position and fold up into the handle.

I guess that's the price you pay for having such a thin knife. And the price is pretty low for such a good quality knife.",
