But as for storage I give it 10/10, and protection I happily give this a 9/10. If you have saya for your knives (sheathes that actually protect the entire blade) then you have absolutlely NOTHING to worry about. Do yourself the favor and buy one; I'm honestly planning to buy another one or two of these for my fellow chefs in the kitchen just because every chef should have one without question.",

Lots of room, very durable and well made, except for the strap. Just get a high quality strap from the hardware store or salvage one from an old knife bag. Seriously, this is the most well made knife bag I've owned in my life. It fits so much stuff, and you never feel like your expensive knives are getting banged around or abused. Highly recommended.",

I returned that bag and ordered another, the next bag had the zipper pulls on, but upon pulling the zipper closed it came right off. I'm not that hard to please, but this is not acceptable quality for the $100 cost",

It's almost impossible for to store a whisk in there of any size without impeding on available closing-space. (Full disclosure: I have two whisks, a 7\" and a 12\" balloon.
