It has helped save him from sun-burns and brings a smile to almost every persons face. The fit it pretty true to size, our son is a small fry so the arms are a little long but other than that it fits great. I love the hood and how covered it keeps him. We put sunscreen on under his suit as a pre-caution but I feel like the UV protection of the suit itself is very strong. It's a great suit and we highly recommend it.",
