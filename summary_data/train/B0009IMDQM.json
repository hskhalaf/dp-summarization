Everything checked out. Back in business, sure enough the next one stops spinning I too check that one everything was OK.. So both start working...AND guess what now they both stopped spinning... Those wheels are a Gimmick.... Either I received defective bio wheels or this entire thing doesn't work...",

I have a Penguin Biowheel 200 thats been going strong for a year and I love it. I bought the 350's because of my positive experience with that one. Big mistake. Within a month of using the 350's they started making an awful rattling noise. I learned I needed a new impeller in BOTH but the cost of an impeller is only $5 less than the whole freaking filter! Aside from the noise, they don't even do a great job filtering. I will never buy Marineland filters again.",

It works, but I added my own bio media in the bottom. I also and not a fan of the filters compared to Fluval thick filters. They are paper thin, with minute carbon in them. Over all despite all my dislikes....it does work.....I just need to learn- don't fray from what works.",

This does not affect functionality though so I'm still very pleased with this unit and would definitely be ordering it again for my other tank.",

I've been able to take apart and put back together in most cases other filters to repair them but this one not the case. I contacted the products customer service and was told I need to expect to buy parts to repair it on average once a year which cost almost as much as the product itself. This is very disappointing as it did work well before it died. I cannot recommend this product.",
