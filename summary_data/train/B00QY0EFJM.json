We bought one and almost immediately the pain had dissipated so whenever the pain returns she puts it on and it does what it was meant to do provide support and get rid of the pain. I guess you can say this is like a commercial *DOCTOR RECOMMENDED* but this one actually works",

The extra two small ones don't even fit around my wrist. With the extensions you can make it work - but you need help to get it on the Velcro properly as the bands are stiff and don't bend in the right place to do it one handed. Velcro is not located where needed. Poorly designed and not comfortable. Just a stiff strap with Velcro slapped on. Doesn't offer any relief when you do get it on. Would not recommend.",

It's much smaller than the \"old school\" one and is extremely comfortable. I often check to see if it's on because it's really that comfortable. I no longer have unnerving nerve pain.

After reading reviews on Amazon I decided to try the Simien brace. This one is easy to adjust and put on. And I was surprised that I had no pain or stiffness after hitting balls on the driving range or after golf. It is less expensive than most of the braces that I have used. The only downside is that it is a little bulky and sometimes rubs against my body on the golf swing. On the other hand, it is a signal that the club is too close to my body.",

Unfortunately, the velcro isn't very strong, and if I strap it too tight (which I sometimes need to in order to quell my arm pain) the band comes undone.",

You may have to experiment with different placements of the brace - higher or lower on your forearm, rotated towards the inside or outside of your arm - however once you find the right spot for you, it provides complete relief.",
