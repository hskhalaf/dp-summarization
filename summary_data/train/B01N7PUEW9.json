Extremely easy to \"put together\".. I wouldn't say it for older kids.. maybe ages 2/5 tops? My 2yr old toddler is taller then this lol. But, it's cute and will work as a little corner for sitting. The color isn't gold though.. it's more of a mustard gold color if that makes sense... pictures added. I do think it's overpriced though.",
