      "text": "I searched long and hard through 144hz monitors and their reviews, this model had the least complaints and issues, and was an excellent price in comparison to its competition which can be hundreds of pounds more expensive. The screen sharpness is excelent, with strong colour capabilities and fancy gimmicks for equalising darkness, blue light and such. My only issue is that anything above 10% brightness is waaaay too bright for me. It would be better to have the ability to go lower in brightness than the currant lowest. You will likely need to tweak the colours as I have since the default \"profiles\" provided are a bit strange, but its easy to do and the choice is great.",

HDMI 1.4 and 2.0 can support 1080p at 120hz, which is what I was wanting. This monitor is capped at 60hz via hdmi. So all in all very unhappy that a gaming monitor would not come with high refresh rate options via hdmi. Monitor is bog standard gaming monitor, I have owned several different branded high refresh rate monitors including Acer, Asus and veiwsonic. Would recommend Asus or Acer over this brand for looks and quality. Ok for budgets.",

With a 1080ti I am able to get 240fps on most games however some more recent games like Battlefield 1 you will struggle to reach the full potential unless you lower graphics settings or overclock. I came from a 120hz screen and I can see and feel the difference that the higher refresh rate provides, just seems instant and allows you to aim very smoothly at moving targets etc. I also use this for working on, while the colour reproduction is a bit crap for photoshop or design work its not what the monitor is designed for. It's designed for one thing - gaming. Highly recommend if you want a edge on other players.",

Even by looking at other reviews and copying settings they suggested it still gives off very poor pictures. Ignoring the colour, the picture itself is very clear with very sharp images and a nice size and refresh rate. The price itself is great for a cheap monitor with these specs so if you dont mind the faint colour then this is a great monitor.",

The colours are REALLY bad but it is a TN panel so it is expected but the GHOSTING on this is really bad. A \u00a380 monitor beat this monitor when it comes to ghosting. It's just horrible. Buy if you really don't mind the ghosting.",
