I plugged the headset via the Xbox as instructed however very quiet, not impressed. So had to avoid the amp and go via headset! Mine cracked a tad at times as well, not expected of a \u00a3200+ headset. Unfortunately I am returning them after 1 hour of use... Wouldn\u2019t waste your money on them, I\u2019ve now brought the previous elite version that is due to arrive, hopefully have better luck with these.",

Where the headset clings back to you head was on the edge of my jaw giving me jaw ache almost instantly . For the cost of the headset I would have expected something more comfortable The microphone was constant grief , where other people could not hear me well despite the mic being practically in my mouth. Sometimes people could not hear me at all. The Bluetooth set up was a pain every time you go to play the game",

Much better sound than my last pair (Turtle Beach XO One). The headset is pretty comfortable, a little heavier than expected. Bad parts: 1. Cables - long and become tangled. Only an annoyance. 2. turtle beach audio app for android- it worked for me (unlike others I've read about), but it's not ideal. I'm a turtle beach fan and I'm not regretting this purchase (@ $100 off retail), but I wonder if I would have been happier with wireless.",

They sound better, my voice sounds MUCH clearer to those listening on the other end, and the amp has some awesome bluetooth features that allow you to answer phone calls, play music and make sound adjustments. 10/10 would recommend!",

The right ear speaker just completely disconnected and stopped working. So if anyone who is a gamer knows of any better headsets out there please feel free to inform me.
