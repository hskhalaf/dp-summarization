      "text": "I like to invest in headphones that are durable and these have lasted me a year before one of the sides has started to go silent. So they're better than your cheap ones that break in a week and the sound quality is otherwise good for the cost. The hook keeps the buds in well (which is a fear of mine with in ear headphones which often fall out) but the disadvantages of the in ear design are still very apparant (ear wax impaction)",

The Pioneer SE-E721-K may have been a better choice although this is only splashproof I think.  although a bit too expensive at the moment.",

Switching to standard pieces fixed the issue and this is noted in the leaflet that comes with the headphones. Good product for the price.",

It's a little tiny bit big although I can fit it in my ear. For the price it's good. I would recommend. They do returns so worth the purchase to try.",

I have tried every combination of earbud size and every position of the collar and they still keep falling out. because there is a joint to enable them to be short or long they are unneccessarily heavy and pull on the buds, even with the clip attached it still pendulums annoyingly. The pause button works on my ipod but the extra weight of it makes it not a worthwhile addition. Unfortunately I am still looking for a sports headphone which will actually stay in my ear.",
