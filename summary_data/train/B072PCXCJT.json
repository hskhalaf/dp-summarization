As for the clicking noise others have mentioned, it's really not that loud and my son doesn't even notice it. I highly recommend this and am excited that he'll continue to use his even when he gets to be mobile.",

I was so delighted that the music in this new one is the same as the first one I bought 3 years ago because this is being used at my house. The baby recognizes the music.

The music is a little bit too energetic sometimes, so we silence it using the volume toggle. The lights are a little brighter than we expected and sometimes seem to distract from sleeping. Overall though, we think this product will be useful. Its great as an attention grabber when we have him in his crib while we get ready for work or just need to set him somewhere fun and safe for a few minutes. Also, the little characters are very cute and brightly colored.",

Let me say that the music/sound options are great and pleasant, and the variety of options is nice. The characters are cute and the colors are vibrant. My dissatisfaction lies in the position of the arm and the motor that spins the characters around. Instead of being flat (completely horizontal over the crib) it is at a strange angle which causes the characters to independently rotate oddly and therefore makes a clicking noise and rocks the whole mobile. For the price, I was pretty disappointed.",

Also, while the mobile is spinning, the animals get \"stuck\" and make a loud clicking noise and the whole mobile jerks. Messes up the soothing motion. Wish I could return it. Maybe this is just a faulty one? I waited too long to use it and am now, unfortunately, out of the return window.",

Some one posted a fix for the clicking so I'm going to try that and will probably be happy with it for the most part but frustrating that these simple design flaws were not address before manufacturing.",

The way the animals spins around when it rotates keeps my 9 week old's attention until he's asleep. It was easy to assemble and the mounting is a no-brainier. For the price, this mobile has it all!",

Now that my baby is older, I have moved the mobile to be facing out of her crib. This is a bummer because when she wakes up from naps, she can\u2019t play with the mobile. But the lights are just way too bright to be used during the night.",

It gave baby something to look at, played a variety of songs/genres and quickly became a part of our bedtime routine. 5 months after purchasing, the animals stopped spinning. I thought it might be the batteries, but brand new batteries didnt really help. It was perfect other than that. For $50 I expected it to last a little longer",

It is angled so there is a very slight jerking movement but it seems to draw my sons attention to the animals. The songs are nice and clear with a variety of options. The heartbeat sound is a little creepy. I liked that the volume can go from soft to louder without sounding weird. Overall a good buy. Just wish my son liked it more.",

There are upbeat music options for daytime (at least that\u2019s what I use it for) while she watches it spin around and then softer music at night for when you just want it to soothe. Only small complaint is I wish there was an option to just play the music and not make the mobile move without taking it apart.",

    "description": "Color:Meadow Days\n\nStimulate your child's love of music with the Tiny Love Meadow Days Soothe 'n Groove Mobile. This mobile's versatile design grows with your baby, beginning as a crib mobile and then transitioning to a stand-alone music box that a toddler can carry on their own. Entertain and engage your child with the baby mobile's motion, activating and changing the music via the colorful buttons. The baby mobile plays 18 different tunes in six different musical categories, for 40 minutes of continuous play and features two high-quality speakers with adjustable volume. Help comfort your baby during quiet times or nap time with the baby mobile's soft, glowing night light. This JPMA-certified baby mobile meets ASTM safety standards. Requires three size C batteries (not included). Tiny Love strives to identify the latest discoveries in child development and translate them into engaging, interactive baby toys that nurture skills and delight the senses. Recommend attaching toy to a crib side that is fixed which cannot move up or down. Attach all provided fasteners tightly to the crib or playpen according to the instructions. Check frequently. Remove the mobile portion from the crib or playpen when the baby begins to push up on his hands and knees. The mobile is suitable for babies from birth to five months. Five plus months as music box\n\nThese are the key Developmental Wonders that this product can encourage in your baby:\n\nCognition The mobile\u2019s cute Meadow Days characters appear and disappear above baby\u2019s head. This creates a sort of peek-a-boo game that helps baby grasp the idea of object permanence. As baby grows and begins to press the music box\u2019s various buttons, your little one learns about the wonders of cause (pressing a button) and effect (music and lights). Language & Communication As babies lie in their crib or bed, cooing at the mobile characters, smiling and practicing some baby talk, they hone their communication and language skills. Senses The smiling characters\u2019 large eyes and the mobile\u2019s slow motion along with the diverse musical selection stimulate baby\u2019s sense of sight and sound. EQ The soothing music and steady movement create an atmosphere that calms babies and helps them through the process of going to sleep.",
