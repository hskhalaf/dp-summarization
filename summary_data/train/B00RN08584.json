Advice: do a cost per page search for printer in the price range you want to spend. I just replaced the Canon with a Brother. The Brother installed more easily, cartridges are much less expensive, and the unit is sturdier, etc., and the cost per page is MUCH better. For Canon's $39 you get what you pay for, which is not much, but worse, it's an ink trap.",

The only complaint I have is that if your eyesight is not as good as it once was, this is a difficult printer to operate. the printer and button labels are dark and the small screen is almost unreadable and not bright enough to make the text legible.

You have to keep adjusting the tray. Very undependable. I will be getting another printer, but not sure about another Pixma. Additional info: I got a replacement for the previous one that didn't work and it doesn't work properly either. It says there is an error but none show up. So I cannot use this printer either. Awful product, I will never buy again.",

I tried for 3 hours (including 1 hour with Canon technical support). I even watched a Youtube video specifically about setting up an MX492 on a Mac but no dice. I returned it today and will purchase an HP instead. Very disappointed!",

Maybe people like all the extras the cd has, for me I just want the drivers to get the printer working. Excellent print quality, if anyone says it's not, they need glasses! The other nice thing, none of that ridiculous multi ink tank cartridges! Just one for color (3 colors in one package) and 1 black. Again, I like simplicity..",

The menus can be aggravating, and at times it will simply refuse me and print a blank page. It is also considerably inefficient on ink as well. However, for a $50 printer, it is remarkable. A lot of issues were avoided whenever I installed all of the software related to the printer. I would not spend more than $60 on this, and would encourage people to look elsewhere for that kind of price, however.",

The printer can print noise less and the black color is subtle. It can hold 20 sheets. The print quality is nice. One thing i don't like about it is that it can use a little more amount of ink than other brands maybe to produce that high quality prints. But overall a very reliable printer which can be wirelessly used thru AIRPRINT, Google print, and canon print app. This is also energy star certified. Highly recommended product!!!",

The set-up was a tad time-consuming but the instructions were easy to follow. It is not the fastest printer ever, but it's perfectly fine for my needs. If you need a printer for personal use, or perhaps some not-too-strenuous home business concerns, this is a good choice. However, if you do a lot of high-volume printing and need something that churns out printed pages quickly, I'd recommend spending a bit more money on a higher-end printer.",

If you want to close the machine up, you have to remove the paper supply, as it cannot fit inside. However, it prints well and reproduces electronic photos with remarkable color and clarity. The instructions for assembly were a royal pain, with some information apparently missing and some information difficult to decipher. But I got through it and all is forgiven.",
