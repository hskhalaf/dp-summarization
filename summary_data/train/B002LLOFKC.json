Well today I was making enchilada sauce, and noticed after cleaning the blender that there were still food particles below where the blender container is (see pics). I really can't see any way to clean it out without dismantling it, and even then it's almost assured to leak again. $150 down the drain!",

Besides the leaking, it's also ridiculously difficult to clean. Pick something else. Update: I got the Ninja Professional Blender 1000 (BL610) to replace this cuisinart, and I like it MUCH better. Cheaper, easier to use, easier to clean. Get the Ninja!",

Clearly it's reached the end of its rather easy life, and we will not buy another Cuisinart blender.

      "text": "I have not had a lot of experience with blenders. I did however read hundreds of reviews on every type of blender out there before purchasing this item. All I have to say is WOW! I love this blender. When I make a smoothie I just put in all of the ingredients, push the smoothie button & walk away. The blender is self programmed to do the rest & beeps when it has completed it's blending cycle. It's quiet, so easy to use, so easy to clean, fits under the cabinets nicely, and & 64-oz jar is a huge plus! Love it! Love it! Love it!!",

      "title": "Hard to Disassemble for Cleaning",
      "text": "Returned it immediately. Very difficult to take apart for cleaning. The problem is that it leaks unless you tighten the blade housing VERY tight. But because the blade housing is inset (encircled with plastic), there is very little room to get your hand inside and get a good grip to loosen the VERY tight blade housing to clean it. Seems like a very poor design. The blender itself may be fantastic, but not being able to disassemble it easily for cleaning is a deal-breaker.",

      "text": "I would recommend this blender to anyone needing a really good, often used blender. The only annoying feature I have found is the beeping that sounds once it finishes making a smoothie. It won't stop until I go turn it off. I think the cessation of blending would be sufficient to tell anyone \"I'm all finished\". But, that is a minor annoyance. It cleans easily if you use a spray nozzle. It was definitely worth the money in my opinion.",
