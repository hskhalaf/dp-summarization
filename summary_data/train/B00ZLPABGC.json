It sticks on easily and strong, it does not appear that it will come off easily. I have been looking for something this good for a long time & this certainly does the job. Thank you for a great product.",

I was a bit skeptical when I got these mirrors that it would be effective. But it works. Approaching cars do look that they are further away in the small mirror but those cars are seen on my sideview mirror as they always have. But when I can't see those cars in my sideview mirror, that's when I can see those cars in the blind spot mirror.",
