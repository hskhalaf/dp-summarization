I bought this for my dad, who has neuropathy in his hands, which also shake, but I thought he would have adequate muscle strength to push the buttons. Essentially, the remote works, and the large buttons are nice, but instead of enhancing his independence, he cannot push the buttons down hard enough to change a channel, so he just asks my mother to do it. Sort of defeats the purpose.",

The only con I've found is that the buttons can be little hard to push depending on your position - but then again, in the long run this feature may prove to be the key to the products longevity too.
