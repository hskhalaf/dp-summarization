      "text": "Two weeks ago I bought my 2 1/2 year old some Crayola markers because I knew she would love them. They are washable right? What a mess. Yes they cleaned up but she is just not ready for markers. We ordered these pencils because her crayons were starting to look pretty beat up. Crayons can just be too fragile for a toddler. She was frequently breaking them in half. These pencils have great vibrant color. They are very durable and easy for a 2 1/2 year old to hold. They should last years at this rate.",
