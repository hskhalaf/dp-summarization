She\u2019s a skilled artist and we needed a tablet that was durable and creatively expansive. Not another tech tool to gather dust!! She sold me on the tablet and the price, which was more than fair. She\u2019s been drawing daily since we got the tablet months ago. It\u2019s amazing!! And her drawings are blowing my mind!!",

I had to un install my old wacom tablet driver before I was able to use this one but that took only 10 mins to do. And after getting use to the way this one works everything seems to be fine and actually works better for me now. My digital art has become very stylish and sexy. I absolutely love this tablet I highly recommend any new artist to invest in this. Because for that price and how much you get you wont beat that deal anywhere around!",

The tablet was very easy to use, even for a newbie like me, and I got comfortable with using it in no time. Though this was my first drawing tablet, I felt that it was definitely high-quality for the price. Also, all the little bonuses were quite nice. I would highly recommend this tablet to all you artists out there.",

In terms of drawing, it's not as smooth and sensitive as the traditional Wacom; the actual quality of the tablet really just doesn't compare. However, if you're a student, it's preferable to buy this instead of a similarly-priced tiny Wacom tablet. Huion's tablet is certainly usable, and having the extra space is so much better for large screens and detail work.",

I had to use the force quit option on my Mac to close out the program. Another issue, is that there is no documentation on how to set up the program keys. It tells you how to enable the keys, but not how to load them with instructions. I intend to return the unit and try another brand.",

You can adjust the onscreen work area to the same ratio as the tablet, leaving some nice side space for reference or other windows, BUT the X axis will be far more sensitive than the Y (drawn circles will become ovals) and there's nothing to remedy this unlike on higher end tablets. The ONLY solution to fix this axis sensitivity issue is an option in the settings which disables about a 3rd of the tablet's drawing space. So basically have an overly sensitive X axis or lose the use of a 3rd of your tablet.",

I would definitely recommend this to beginners, and non beginners. Simply a great product.",

I was planning on using this for digital paining which I'll still do, but that's one less type of dynamic control handled by the tablet that the competition has. That said, I've owned competing products that were much more expensive and this suits my needs very well. Also great for photo touch-ups for fine work.",

It\u2019s a larger tablet than some I have seen but I enjoy a larger surface to work with.
