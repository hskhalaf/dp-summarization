We bought this one and I don't know if we just got a lemon but the thing doesn't work. We press the button to cook, sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. For us we eat rice for breakfast. There is nothing more frustrating then waking up early, getting your rice started. Going for a walk, coming back and discovering the rice cooker has gone through its cycle and beeped to say its done but all it has done is just warm up the water a little bit! What am I supposed to eat for breakfast?! Very sad.",

Rice was cooked perfectly. And of course, I cook rice everyday. Then, it just died. The rice stopped cooking. It keeps raw rice warm. That is it. I am so disappointed.

One thing to watch out for is when steaming vegetables along with the rice will usually be done in about 12 minutes, however that is not the case if steaming vegetables by themselves. The rice will attenuate the steam and if you steam vegetables by themselves, the time required is less than half that time. Precise timing of the cooker is what will yield crispy vegetables and fluffy rice.",

Overall it is a great item that makes perfect rice. It also does soups and steams vegetables. The water needs to be measured according to the instructions.

I would\u2019ve returned it if I could but of course it died after the window. I absolutely do not recommend this rice cooker. Such a waste and a disappointment.",

They are sending a complementary inner pot. My first unit may have same issue and I just trowed it away. Support said that replacing the inner pot will fix most of the heating issues.",

      "text": "We have only had the rice maker since February and 1/2 of the black bottom has melted into the metal portion so cooker has to be propped up to cook. Additionally it is very hard to clean. The top portion/seal collects moisture and needs to be carefully wiped out and the top insert is hard to clean as well. The warranty requires that you pay to ship it back and include a check for $14.95 for them to send you a new one. That whole transaction amounts to as much or more as the cooker. It is a very disappointing appliance",

It holds a maximum of 4 cups of rice uncooked (deceiving that it is described as 8 cups cooked). Overall it looks clean. I wish the rice scooper would fit all the way in the holder so that it doesn\u2019t stick all the way up and keep from compactly storing.",

The 7 minute thing is AFTER it heats up and that takes like 15-20. Often it doesn't cook my brown rice completely and I have to run it a 2nd time. In side lid is a pain to clean. Not like its totally useless but its kind of unpredictable when I was hoping it would be like a mini one-pot. It's not.",

I did not give a five star because I feel the latch mechanism is a bit flimsy and I foresee future problems with it.
