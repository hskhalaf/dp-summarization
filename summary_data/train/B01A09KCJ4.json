Other ones have flaws here and there with the design but this one is perfect. It doesn't ruin the top padded part of the headphones, and have a convenient tray for cable. The size is perfect too as long as your headphones are not enormous. I bought a second stand as soon as I opened the first one. The picture shows my two headphones on the stand: Sennheiser HD 800s and Sennheiser GAME ZERO. Both headbands are not pushed all the way in, so the stand should be able to hold much bigger headphones.",

      "text": "Best headset stand I have found thus far. It could be a bit heavier but it\u2019s heavy enough to prevent it from moving/tipping when grabbing your headset from it. My favorite part is the headband rest. IT IS PERFECT!!! Unlike every other headset stand that creeses the headband this one offers a curved, silicone headband rest that allows the headset to sit without putting pressure on your headset. I\u2019ve tested it with various headsets for different amounts of hours and it was a perfect fit for all. Definitely will be buying multiples of this headset stand to accommodate all my headsets.",

      "text": "I got this thing to hold some high-end headphones, ZMF Atticus and/or Sennheiser HD800/650/600 (yes, I have too many headphones). It is too short to hold any of these without taking the cables off (which I don't want to do every time) since the cable connectors don't clear the bottom tray. Rather than send it back and get something larger, I decided to take it into my office with me where it holds my ZMF Classics with plenty of clearance... but the headband on the Classics is too large to fit around the rubber groove in the top. The quality is okay, I feel like the rubber parts are prone to coming loose from the metal fittings.",

The base is like a large ashtray so you can put stuff in it with a high lip to keep whatever you put in there from rolling out. Very stable simple and elegant. 5 stars on the stand as a whole. If your debating which headset stand to get this one is legit. I would not hesitate to suggest buying this.",

But because it is silicon instead of a hard plastic, I can only assumed that is done to keep cost done. The headphone rest is silicone too. It's perfect. It folders the contour of the head band resulting in not having an indent in the middle of the Bottom of the head band like other stands leave. Overall this is a good product. It looks great and I am using it to display an old headset that I had boxed in a closet.",

Having tried lots of different headphones over the years, these are by far my husband's favorite when it comes to sound and comfort. Highly recommend them if you have a young child or teen at home, are computer/internet literate, or can bribe someone to help.",

There's a notch on the underside of the front of the rubbery part, which seems to not be cut deep enough. I took my pocket knife and knocked it out a TINY bit more and now it lays completely flat.",

I have two of these now, and I'll always buy one with any set of headphones I buy.",
