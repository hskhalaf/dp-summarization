The foxtail stickers on the overgrown weeds just stuck thru the bag with some shooting at me. The bag is cloth and with air holes, allowing all this mess to shoot at you while trying to mow. I had to cover my face with a towel to breathe, and then take off my clothes (thank god it was my private back yard) to come in the house. I was covered in dirt, grass bits, and just a mess! Awful - I returned it!",

Keeping the long cord out of your way while you're mowing is a pain in the butt, but that wasn't a surprise, and it's hankable. What I DON'T like about this mower is the handle, which controls the off/on. To keep it running you have to continually squeeze the handle, and my hand gets tired. If you let up on it even a little bit, the mower slows down or turns off. If not for that, I'd give it five stars.",

I should have listened to the negative reviews and not purchaced it. I drove an hour away just to take it to the black and decker manufacturer/ support place, only for them to tell me there is no warrenty that covers it to be fixed. Im just out of $120.

There are 3 pieces, that flex, and are held in place with several tabs, but the tabs don't have enough bite to stay in place. So after I used it, put some weight in it, it fell apart and grass went everywhere. Now it won't go back together. Since it flexes, you can't force it. I'm curious to know how many people will result in bungees or ratchet straps for the basket after a few months.",
