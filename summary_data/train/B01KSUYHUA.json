Gets up in the middle of the night to reset the timer. Thats my main complaint...does it NEED to be on a timer? Also, it is a little flimsy. The outer dome doesnt click firmly into the lamp. But i dont use it anyway. I keep it off to project the stars. Oh...another con, its not strong enough to show up if the overhead light is on.",

Second, the \"stars\" were so blurry they were basically just blobs floating around on the ceiling - no matter how close it was to the ceiling. Third, it kept falling apart every time you touched it.

His room is not very big and even in pitch black, anything on the ceiling (especially the moon) is blurred. Third, there aren\u2019t nearly as many stars and moons as in the advertisement.

There are still a few bits that give a decent recent idea what it looks like.",

      "text": "I bought this projector for my 2 year old. He is amazed by it. What I really love is the timer setting. We can set the timer in 5 minute increments for as long as we choose so it doesn\u2019t stay on all night when we put him to bed. This product can use both battries or be plugged in. You can set to move, stay still and a wide variety of colors.",

The center (white) bulb is practically burnt out and the anodes and cathodes on the LED bulbs are all rusted and the rust is flaking off... I already threw the box away, and It does work good enough for my 18 month old daughter, so I will still use it until it dies and then buy a different one for sure",
