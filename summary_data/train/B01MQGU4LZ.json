If you screw the screws in all the way, the little caps fall right off, because the top of the screw is not flush with the shelf. If you loosen the screw slightluly to make them flush, the entire shelf gets wobbly and not at all sturdy. I may just glue the caps on to keep them in place, but either fix the pre-drilled screw holes, lengthen the little stems of the plastic covers, or send longer screws.",

I read some review Ls with people stating that shelved fell down after install. My suggestion with any of these shelves is to go to Home Depot and buy a set of a 100 or more of dry wall screws that made with better quality for like $7-10 bucks and they will hold more weight then any of the dry wall studs provided.",

      "text": "I LOVE this little shelf! I needed someplace up and out of my children\u2019s reach for little precious moments statues. This is the perfect size and utilizes space I never even realized we had available. Would not recommend for pic frames 5x7 and larger, as each shelf is not very tall. But for little Knick knacks and things you\u2019d like to display, it is absolutely perfect! And so cheap. Assembly was very easy- don\u2019t overthink it lol. And installation was even easier.",

Other than the holes being too small and the directions not being that clear, this corner wall shelf is absolutely adorable and just what I was looking for. The color is amazing as well.

It was off by a couple of millimeters when we installed it. In the picture it's able to hold books if it's leaned sideways. The shelves are to small in order to stack the books straight up.
