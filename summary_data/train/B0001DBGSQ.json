Canon offers a replacement head for $65. Next the ink cleaning reservoir with normal use will fill up in about a year. To replace it will cost $120 and is only available through Canon.

If you buy a refill kit from say, \"[...]\", you can refill your own for pennies each.

    "title": "Canon i80 Color Bubble Jet Printer",
    "description": "In conventional print heads, the temperature and viscosity of the ink when it leaves the nozzle can produce slight fluctuations in the amount and direction of ink discharged. To overcome this fundamental problem, Canon attached a heater, which heats and vaporizes the ink inside the nozzle to form microbubbles, in an ideal position closer to the nozzle outlet. Under the pressure of these bubbles, ink is ejected out of the outlet in microfine droplets.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nSophisticated yet incredibly easy to use, the Canon i80 Color Bubble Jet Printer delivers a remarkable combination of high performance and portability. It's capable of printing up to 14 ppm in black and up to 10 ppm in color, while achieving a resolution of up to 4,800 x 1,200 color dpi. The result? Impressive resolution and dramatic detail on graphics and photos, along with clean, crisp text.\n\n Microfine Droplet Technology\nIn conventional print heads, the temperature and viscosity of the ink when it leaves the nozzle can produce slight fluctuations in the amount and direction of ink discharged. To overcome this fundamental problem, Canon attached a heater, which heats and vaporizes the ink inside the nozzle to form microbubbles, in an ideal position closer to the nozzle outlet. Under the pressure of these bubbles, ink is ejected out of the outlet in microfine droplets. \n\n The nozzle is designed to limit the amount of ink to the space between the heater and the outlet so when bubbles form, all the ink under the heater is forced outwards, and not even temperature variations can affect the droplet size. Pressure only needs to be applied to the discharged ink, a task that is efficiently carried out by microbubbles. The result is accurate discharge to the printed surface with almost no air resistance. \n\n The powerful, compact i80 printer features wireless operation, both with IrDA compatibility and an optional Bluetooth interface, which enables it to receive wireless transmissions from popular handheld devices. To ensure maximum portability, Canon developed several optional accessories, such as a car adapter and a rechargeable battery kit\u2014providing power on the go. Now with the purchase of these optional accessories, you can print a photo or document from a job site to your vehicle\u2014or from your den to your home office. For added printing flexibility, you can connect any Bubble Jet Direct or PictBridge-compatible digital camera or DV camcorder directly to the i80 printer and print photos\u2014no PC required! With the optional accessories you can shoot a picture on the go and print it immediately, which is ideal for both work and play.\n\n At home or on the road, the i80 printer enables you to produce 4-by-6, 5-by-7 and 8.5-by-11-inch borderless prints, with stunning edge-to-edge quality, razor-sharp detail, and the look and feel of a traditional photograph. You'll speed through photos with the i80 printer\u2014this mobile photo lab prints 4-by-6-inch photos in approximately 82 seconds. The included Easy-PhotoPrint 2.0/Easy-PhotoPrint Plus software makes it simple to print professional-looking digital photos through your computer, even enabling you to reduce red-eye problems and smooth out facial imperfections\u2014all in just a few easy steps. Canon developed Easy-WebPrint (Windows only) software to help eliminate the hassles of web printing. Web pages are automatically formatted so they'll print properly with full color and without trimming off the right hand margin.\n\n What's in the Box\nCanon i80, CD-ROM with drivers and photo editing/management software, two ink cartridges (one black, one color), setup poster; printer cable not included",
