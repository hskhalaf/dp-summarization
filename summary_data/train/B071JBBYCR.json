      "text": "I recently purchased this pair of Soundbuds Slim because the first pair, which I gave my wife for Mother's Day, worked so well that I ended up borrowing them too often. When they arrived today, I first noticed that the flap covering the USB charging port wouldn't stay on no matter what I did. The first pair wasn't like this. As I looked further, I noticed a earwax looking substance inside the earbuds themselves. I took the rubber pieces off each one and confirmed that they were covered in this unknown substance. I've attached pictures. I'm very surprised because I've purchased many different Anker products in the past and haven't had any issues even close to this.",

Update: one star as the new headphones died in less than 2 weeks and will not hold a charge, i'm at the end of my patience. I can't recommend this product. .",

My original review was poor. However the follow up from Anker made a big difference. Customer service was outstanding to follow up and resolve the issue. They did send me a replacement but what keeps me as a loyal customer to continue buying their products was the great customer service. The replacement by the way is working great, no issues. I also own a few of the Anker USB wall chargers, by far better than other brands that I\u2019ve purchased. Highly recommend Anker products!!",

Sound quality is decent for this price point, but nothing great. Highs are tiny and bass is shallow. No low battery indicator. This is really annoying, since battery life is already short. The headphones just shut off when battery is low, no pending indication of beeps or low battery voice prompts. The ear fit is ok, but never seem to get perfect, even with a assortment of sizes.

After spending some time using those, I would recommend them over the Slims. These are great, but the bass on the Surge is much better. If you are looking for a cheaper \"backup\" pair, definitely get these. But if you are looking for an affordable daily driver, get the Surge. tl;dr these are good, Surge is better, Anker customer retention is the best.",

And now after a couple months of using it, it just died with no warning (there's a sound warning when you're running on low battery) and stayed dead. Doesn't charge, doesn't light up. Was good while it lasted, but if you want something that lasts, I wouldn't bet on this.",

They provide clear, reasonable sound for those uses at this price. The only con is the buttons aren't as pronounced as the Taos, I like having buttons that I can tell very easily what they do.

      "text": "These headphones are very comfortable, and compact for travel. But I'm surprised at the reviews that mention good sound quality from these headphones. I am not super picky about sound quality, which is why I didn't want to spend a lot on headphones. But I am actually missing some of the ranges of the music with these headphones, especially bass. These headphones are fine for podcasts, but are simply unacceptable for music. Also very quiet- I have to turn the volume almost all the way up to hear anything. Very disappointed, will definitely be looking for a new pair.",

The product is designed so well but the core function (audio) is poor. Treble and mid-highs are clear, but drums, bass even lows of a cello are lost.

      "text": "Loving these that I just bought. Sound quality is good, especially for the price. I wear these around the back of my neck, so the cord tends to pull towards the right side (because it's heavier from the controls) but not really a big deal. The only issue I have is the short battery life - It's advertised at 7 hours of playtime, but I'm only seeing roughly 2.5 hours of playback. It's just enough if i were to use it for an exercise session, but not nearly long enough to use while working a full shift. I think it takes about 1-1.5 hours to fully charge again.",

I like the price. $36 for full price and $26 on sale (I wanted the blue ones). These are cheaper and more comfortable than my Skullcandy wireless ones and way better than the JayBirds I had earlier than that. A solid pair of headphones and I would buy them again at this price and quality. I love Anker's charging bricks, but they also make great headphones with everything I want in them: easy to pair, easy to wear, lightweight, and they come with a variety of tips to get the fit right for your ears.",
