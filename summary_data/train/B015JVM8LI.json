There is a 30 pound maximum so all is good. It's the cutest carriage ever and I literally got it in THREE days! Awesome. The price is great to compared to others. My dog was good in it, but a little nervous... it might take a little time for her to get used to.",

      "text": "Love this stroller. We have a darling little french bulldog that is black/brindle and gets hot very easily. In the summertime we have to limit her walks due to how easily she can overheat. She loves riding in her stroller and then we will take her out and walk awhile. After ten or fifteen minutes, she will just stop and wait to be put back in the stroller. The wheels are very strudy and go up over curbs and through the grass with ease. Our Frenchie weighs around 18 pounds so this stroller is plenty big and holds up well for her size. She often looks through the mesh opening or can easily look around over the top in front.",

I like that there are 2 collar clips for security as well as different access points with the multiple zippers (tabs are foldable when unzipped and peeled back). Very clean looking, no stains or rips found as with other customers. My pup ( 5lb Yorkie) loves it and can easily hop in and out of it on her own. 2 cupholders (standard sizes). The only issue I have is the GIANT contrasting logo right at the top of the canopy. It would be nice if it was smaller and/or not so obvious. (Maybe a more muted color combination.)",

The stroller is well made and we have taken it over some pretty rough terrain with no issues. Its easy to push and collapse to load up in the car.

Sometimes she stands up with two front feet on basket rim, looking out to see what's going on. It also works great to keep her in while we are out working the lawn. She can stand up and watch us or when she chooses, she lays down and looks out the screens or takes a nap. We put a folded blanket in bottom for her comfort.
