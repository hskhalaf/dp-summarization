It's a very quiet vacuum, you can still hear phone and TV. I bought the white color. This is the perfect vacuum for disabled at an affordable price. Refreshing! 5*",

The Parquet Twister lays about flat so you can maneuver under beds, dressers, and cabinets. Suction is adjustable and very good. After years of lugging around the old upright the Miele is a breeze to handle. Again, I only ask myself, what took me so long to purchase a good vacuum!!! Well worth the money.",

Also, the light is at the handle where you hold it. Doesn\u2019t light extremely well, but it\u2019s not bad. If the hose had a power line for a power head, then the light could be on the head itself, and that would be much more functional. That\u2019s why 4 stars and not 5.",

Also, the head pivots to go around furniture legs and makes vacuum as pleasurable as it possibly can be (which is still awful, but slightly less awful). I wasn't crazy about the color of the vacuum, but what I really care about is functionality and the Miele excels there. One thing I really like about this model is the heppa filter and light on the handle area of the vacuum. The light is great because it puts light into corners and under furniture that would otherwise be dark. Good feature!",

      "text": "A high quality and versatile vacuum cleaner. Used it for cleaning up after a recent major remodeling job (lots of fine dust from tile removal and wall sanding). The unit worked very well in vacuuming various surfaces, including curtain, lamp shades, blinds, bed, furniture, rug, and hard floor. It was highly effective in vacuuming fine dust (has built in HEPA filter) and made the clean up process much easier than we anticipated. The SUB 20 universal brush is highly recommended.",

The floor attachment works great; I had to turn-down the suction control to allow better sweeping control. I've tried the turbo carpet a little; too early to really know how it performs, but seems to be considerably better than the two-position, floor attachment that came with the Alize. Rather than buy the Alize, I would look for the Complete C3 model that comes with the two separate floor heads; but not the models that have the electric power-head.",

    "description": "Color:PetrolThe Miele C3 Alize is a perfect synergy of design and functionality, Miele's C3 series sets new standards in floor care. Superior engineering is balanced with carefully-selected, fine quality materials such as a durable stainless steel wand and specialized ABS plastic with a hard, impact-resistant surface. The C3 series features innovative skeleton construction. Other conveniences include a 36-foot operating radius and foot pedal controls for quick and effective cleaning. C3 also features a silence motor to maintain a quiet environment, and an AirClean Sealed System that not only vacuums your floors - but also cleans the air your family breathes. Miele's C3 Alize vacuum cleaner features an AirTeQ Combination floor tool ideal for cleaning low pile carpeting, rugs and smooth flooring. The AirTeQ has streamlined airflow for uninterrupted floor contact as you switch from smooth flooring to carpeting. Alize offers a savvy, self-adjusting Automatic setting. As you transition from hardwoods to carpeting, the Alize automatically decreases suction, then increases suction when you return to smooth, solid flooring - saving you both time and energy. A telescopic, stainless steel wand and long electrical cord, with one-touch automatic rewind, provide a total cleaning radius of 36 feet. The C3 Alize is also equipped with a Deluxe Comfort Grip handle with LED headlight and six-stage suction controls, plus Automatic setting, via a +/- foot switch. Other conveniences include three integrated accessories - a dusting brush, upholstery tool and crevice nozzle - and a 3D bumper. For especially comfortable handling-With lever action: The floorhead can be easily manoeuvred thanks to the flexible hose connector. Practical locking system-Nothing comes loose: Floorhead, Telescopic Suction Wand and handle lock into each other with an acoustic fit. Comfort cable rewind with single-touch control-Extra quick and convenient: The entire cable can be rewound by simply tapping the footswitch.
