      "title": "Solid NAS",
      "text": "Mainly used as a centralised backup for phone photos it performs perfectly. As with other reviews, I upgraded the RAM (which was very straightforward) to give it a bit more breathing room. The fans are acceptable and not too loud. The sound of the hard drives and vibration will probably be more of a concern than the fans. The system feels solidly build and haven't had any problems so far. Deciding between this and QNAP I went with Synology. I think you get slightly better specs for a similarly priced QNAP but the operating system of the Synology won me over in the end.",

I am very confident having read the excellent documentation that the disk drive upgrade process will be a smooth one. The software is excellent also. I am using the NAS to replace an old Windows server which will cease to be supported by MS in January 2020. The NAS will act as the main storage device, suitably backed up of course.",

I love the apps - audio player, video player and surveillance station are what I use most and they are excellent. Having your own \"cloud \" storage is great and it is fairly simple to access all your data from anywhere. Its brilliant as a plex server too and here are some great and flexible backup apps. Superb device.",
