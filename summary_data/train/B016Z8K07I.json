The results are very helpful in discovering who my ancestors were as a people group - not just their names. The whole process from ordering, collecting a sample, and receiving results was quick and easy. The support you get after you receive your results is also helpful and they will work with you one-on-one if you so desire. Good company and would recommend them to anyone. I especially like the privacy that comes with your results.",

My European matches were right on as well along with our Jewish ancestry from my mothers side of the family.

    "description": "Our exclusive, best-selling DNA Fingerprint Plus Test examines standard locations on your whole-genome DNA and gives you a comprehensive picture of your ancestry based on mother\u2019s side, father\u2019s side and all your ancestral lines. The time depth is historical, not ancient. The matches should make sense in the light of recent genealogy (200 - 500 years). The report lists your top 50 world populations (including a limited number of American Indian tribes, Sephardic, Ashkenazi and other Jewish matches, Romani/Gypsy and other exotic groups), top 10 countries of Europe and top 10 \u201cmegapopulations\u201d mixture (broad ethnic categories such as Northern European, African and American Indian). Additionally, it tells you if your profile contains any of 18 newly discovered ethnic markers: 2 are Native American, 4 are Jewish, others are European, African and Asian. The process is easy. Amazon sends you a package with a collection kit and instructions. You collect a sample by rubbing two swabs inside your mouth and return them via a prepaid envelope. Your sample is analyzed according to 16 standard STR markers, also called CODIS markers, your individual DNA profile. Your comprehensive report with matches, world ancestry map and certificate is emailed to you in a pdf within two weeks of receipt of your sample by our lab. Hard copies, upgrades and follow-up testing available, along with open-ended customer service to answer all your questions, M-F 10am-6pm Mountain Time,",
