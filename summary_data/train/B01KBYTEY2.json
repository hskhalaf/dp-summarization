You have to properly prepare the soil and top dress with peat moss to have nice even germination which takes work but it's worth it! I sprayed my original lawn and killed it and waited a month to make sure the chemical was fully gone. Skimmed the whole top layer of soil/dead grass off. Then hand tilled the soil and added a very think layer or new top soil. Spread the seed and then threw peat moss on top and within 5 days there was amazing growth.",

If you are really set on this seed\u2014buy it in a store so you can view the label and check the % of weed seed\u2014you will more than likely still be planting 1000\u2019s of weeds in your lawn.

When the roots are deep you can water heavily (1.5 inch/week) but infrequently. That way the very top of the soil layer dries out (goodbye weeds) but the deep roots stay moist (hello dark green lawn). It took a full two weeks to germinate, so make sure you have some protection if you get wind. The color is EXCELLENT....came in a little bluer than I wanted, but greened up as it filled it.
