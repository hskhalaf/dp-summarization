I have been working at color coding my home, camping, beach, etc accessories and these colors fit perfectly! Red for my family's emergency vehicle supplies, green for my RV and blue for my beach outtings. There were only 2 colors missing (orange - for home use and black - for my personal vehicle). It was tiresome transporting one bottle opener for various reasons/outtings; they were small (easy to misplace) and just old, rusty and dull. These are large and colors vibrant! Thank you!",
