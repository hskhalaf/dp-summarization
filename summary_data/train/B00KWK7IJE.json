I don't wear any extra-wide shoes nor is it necessary. My feet bulged over the sides of the shoe and it felt like walking in them would have been agony let alone hiking in them. Promptly returning these. Aesthetically they're beautiful shoes, they seem well-made, but they just won't work for me. I got 11.5 and My toe runs right up to the end of them. My Asic Kayano 19's I've had 4 years are 11.5 and fit just right. I'll be getting Asic Gel Venture 5's in the mail shortly.",

The cleats really grab terrain, but slid a bit on wet cement at the beach. I was shocked the first time I doffed them to find that no sand had weaseled its way inside the shoes. They breath, but don't let in debris. I was skeptical of the lock laces when I first put them on. They are a lot different than the other ones I have used, but they do work well and do not seem to loosen through use. These are my first pair of Solomon shoes, and I am impressed.",

I was never concerned about the durability of their construction and the speed lacing system is a nice touch. These shoes kicked ass on OCRs.

That's a big change for me as my knees or heels start paining after 3-4 miles run or hike. The only thing I don't like is that once the water/mud goes inside the shoes become even heavier.

When trail running or hiking on steep, loose terrain having confidence in your footing is key. Worry not with these. The Speedcross 3 & 4's provide you with the grippy performance of a veteran mountain goat. They are like cleats for the trail! I have not slipped nor fallen once due to poor traction with these strapped to my feet. The only drawback of all that grippy goodness is the sole is made of soft rubber that wears out fairly quickly on rocky terrain.

They run a little small and narrow so read reviews and size carefully.",

I would order the wide size if you take a medium width like me just for a little extra room. They did loosen up. Just in case you want to wear an extra pair of socks. I use them in the cold Wisconsin winters so they will be great just about anywhere!",

When you run through heavy water, mud pits, etc. they remain squishy for a while. The shoe does fit a little snug, so if you have wider feet I would recommend going up a half size.

The sole grips well and your foot will not slip on rough terrain and boulders. Note though that they fit snugly and so do not order too small. I wear 8.5 E lace shoes, 8E loafers, and 9.5 Mizuno running shoes. Ordered these in 9.5 and they fit but more snugly than the Mizunos. I will order another though in a cool color. Great shoe.",
