This controller plugs into the bottom of a WiiMote, so, while there is a cord (non-wireless), you can take the WiiMote+Controller tether anywhere within range of the Wii's bluetooth. I've enjoyed playing old SNES games (which I think the controller is designed the most for). N64, NES, and Genesis games are also ported well with this controller, and I was able to adjust for these button setups quickly. I recommend this controller for anyone with a Nintendo Wii that enjoys playing older games (NES, SNES, SEGA Gensis/Master System, MAME, Neo-Geo, N64, etc).",
