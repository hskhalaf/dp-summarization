      "text": "Extremely complete reference. Well organized. This is not a textbook to learn from (it is not organized like that). This is a reference book for someone who already knows a lot of CSS. Why pay for this book when you can just look up stuff on the web? Good question. The answer is the material is explained here in a way that provides more depth, context, and completeness than it is on the best websites I use (HTML5Doctor, MDN, W3C, and W3Schools.) And while sites like CSS Tricks are great, they only work if the question you have has been covered by them. This book covers everything CSS.",

It covers the latest CSS spec completely. If you don't need a full overview of CSS, consider getting his various themed books on positioning, layout, floating, etc. But this is the most recent version of the granddaddy of all CSS tomes, and you really can't go wrong, here.",

      "text": "Yes, it's worth the wait. With this book sitting here, I don't need anything more. Very complete, hugely expanded over the previous edition. I could use a better - longer, more complete - index, and cheat-sheet tearout cards, but that isn't the writer's fault. The author is, as is well known, a good, clear, thorough, accurate, experienced writer. I use it as a reference book and it excels because of its completeness. But it's written in a plain but conversational tone so it could also be used for learning CSS. I was suffering waiting for this to come out!",

The book generally doesn't show examples using existing websites and is more theoretical. I would not recommend the book for beginers but rather for intermediate learners.",
