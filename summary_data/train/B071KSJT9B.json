Then I ordered another different type of Food Saver, same thing, so I sent that one back. I finally thought about buying the Hamilton Beach Sealer machine. OMG, I loved it! It stores the roll, it has a pulse, so you can suction cookies and bread with smashing it. The other thing is that it seals without suctioning. It's the best! It has a permanent space on my counter!",

However if you are packaging up dried beans or rice or the like for waterproof/airtight storage or camping or whatever be aware after about 20 uses or so in a row it stops vacuuming until it has rested for about 30 minutes or so. Even so after about 8 months it became even more inconsistent. Now after 10 months it has about 7 uses before a rest is required. Not very viable for a prepper or for a do it yourself camper type.",

I make my own \"T.V. dinners!\" I just wish I had this when I was a nursing mother. It is absolutely great for moms who want to make their own baby food and even pet owners who would like to store some of their leftovers to share with their pets at a later time. It's going to be fantastic for holiday leftovers!",
