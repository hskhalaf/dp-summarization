Very comfortable with good arch support. I also have heel bumps (probably from growing up in hockey skates), also known as Haglund's deformity. It's not easy to find a comfortable pair of shoes with these goofy heal bumps, but these are absolutely perfect!",

Just returned from a couple mile walk, fresh out of the box, and I don\u2019t want to take them off. And Goretex! I am set for colder temps and rain now.

Have been wearing them for walking and running and these shoes never make my feet hurt, even after walking an entire day around Boston. Will take them on my summer vacation to Italy. As for the GoreTex, it works great. Wore them out on a rainy day with yoga pants and no umbrella and my feet stayed completely dry!",

I think this Japanese company needs to go back to the drawing board on this one. Its a great shoe and with gore-tex, which is hard to find in running shoes. Plus its NAVY (yaay) and not loud ridiculous colors. But the fact that this shoe is pinched in the toe box making it 2 sizes too small, makes it a returned item. I had high hopes for this rare find, but was truly disappointed. -Mrs. Risen",
