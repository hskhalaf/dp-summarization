(never needed to use them). I have been pleasantly surprised at the torque power. The battery lasted over 4 hours, and was going strong when I had finished my project. This drill is not meant to build a house, but it sure is an excellent tool to have to do jobs around the house. The added bits are nice too. You won't be disappointed.",

It is also more compact and lighter than the 18V Black & Decker I owned before. Yet outperforms that old 18V by a wide margin. Update: It has now been a year and this drill still performs like it did right out of the box. The battery keeps a charge for a long time too.",

This was intended to carry me through until someone bought me the DeWalt. But this drill has really impressed me. I have used it thus far to build and mount a headboard, dog bowl stand, and finishing up some urban gardens for our apartment porch. I have charged it once to do all of those projects -- a significant improvement over my 12v model. If you're looking for a cheaper drill that can handle a wide variety of wood projects with relative ease, this is the drill for you.",

This is right in the sweet spot for someone who wants a drill for medium sized projects or minor cabinetry. It's powerful enough to do pretty much anything a non-professional would want to do, and the battery life isn't bad (though if you're using it a lot an extra pack would be wonderful). One very minor point: the bits that come with it are just OK - a great set to start with but you're probably going to want to replace/buy nicer of the most common bits eventually.",
