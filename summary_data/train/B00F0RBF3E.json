Man, it's amazing how well this works considering what it is and what it costs. I really can't see why anyone would have ANYTHING negative to say about it. No, it's not a Traeger Grill and clearly has its limits but take a look at the photos of the first two meals I cooked on it... they looked fantastic and tasted even better. Seriously, if you've been on the fence about this grill get off and just buy it. You won't be disappointed.",

Fine for two people but not large enough to handle a cookout with guests. Cleanup is amazing but still might be forced to buy the MUCH more expensive electric weber ;-( P.S. used a Laser Infrared Thermometer Temperature Gun and the stated temps on the dial are very accurate!",

      "text": "Been using it for a while and it's still functioning great. Easy to use and seems to cook the food pretty evenly. We like the sear effect and food comes out good. To some of the reviewers, you may think this is too simple and without much other function such as timer. But for a simple indoor grill, it's doing its job fairly well and it takes less than 10 minutes to reach the max heat. After cooking, cleaning is easy as well. I like the fact that all parts can come apart and you can wash/clean everything. It may not be the cheapest option out on the market, but I think it's worth the investment.",

I love that it heats up quickly, puts on a great sear, lid closes to stop splatter or to keep warm at lower temp, and it breaks down easily to wash/soak. It can fit about 6 avg size burgers, 3 ribeyes/strips, or 4-5 breasts. Perfect for our family of 3.",

It did not sear the steak and took 35 minutes or more to get the steak medium well turning once. Cleaning in hot soapy dish water isn't as easy as they claim either. I'll keep trying the grill on different foods but I'm not anticipating better results. Not worth the price. Very disappointed.",

The only thing I would recommend is when you are grilling have the grill next to the exhaust fan so the smoke from the grill can escape. I put water in the pan as suggested but it still got smoky in my kitchen. Buy other than that very pleased with it. Can't wait to grill chicken next.",

Also we always kept the grill on patio during rain, ice, and snow. Today it finally gave up. Not bad life for an electric appliance run through in a dishwasher.
