Our kids vary in height so we have a carabiner that slides along the top line that our younger children can use for balance since they can't reach as high as our older children. Highly recommend!",

The instructions could be so much better. Also, should include the tip to leave slack (not taught) when not using as to maintain the integrity of the line. Tree protectors are way too short. We had to use carpet for our mature trees. Belt straps on tree protection broke first hour. They are non-essential fortunately.",

      "text": "Trail Blaze slackline was hit for my boys (6 and 4). It was a great addition to the yard. We tend to leave the slack line installed for days/weeks. It has rained a lot and has held up really well. I will wrap the metal in some sort of plastic wrap to prevent it from rusting. My only issue is with the tree protectors . They are made for skinny trees and will not go around the entire trunk. Overall, I would recommend this for people with kids and novice slackliners.",
