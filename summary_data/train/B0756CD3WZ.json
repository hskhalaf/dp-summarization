I bought this set mainly for the corrector and the other tools are just an added bonus. At first, it was a little awkward placing the corrector, but it stayed put once placed. I soaked my foot with it on and just tightened every few minutes. There was absolutely no pain!",

      "text": "Easy to use toenail kit. I have 1 toe that the nail grows down under the skin and attaches to it and wanted to see if this would help solve my issue because when it comes to clipping it it is extremely painful and usually ends up with my toe bleeding and very sore for a few days, but I have no choice but to cut it. Since using this I've been able to get the toenail up from the skin and no longer have issues cutting it. Painting them is a lot easier too. It's a nice kit, well made and seem to be pretty sturdy. Not having to deal with that pain anymore is worth every penny.",
