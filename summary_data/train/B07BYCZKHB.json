It doesn\u2019t stick like my old antigravity case did. It does ok on glass but not just a flat surface. Not sure if it\u2019s the weight or the rounded corners.",

I failed structural and caused me to drop my phone and crack the screen since it doesn\u2019t offer much in the way of protection. A nice novelty but it ended up costing me $140 since my camera a mic broke as a result.",

However, after three months, the plastic around the side of the case separated from the back. So I can't recommend it. I think a phone case should last longer than three months.",

This case has protected my phone and prevented scratches/ breaks in the glass and it\u2019s been dropped many times. It\u2019s cool that it can stick to things but it\u2019s limited what it can stick to and it\u2019s not going to stay on very long stick to the mirror. I find I really like the stickiness when I put the phone down on a table It won\u2019t get knocked off as easily. I guess for the price I shouldn\u2019t have expected much better quality.",

I walked around the house testing it on everything and it really did stick to everything!!! (except the interior walls of course) Everything smooth like mirrors, doors, cabinets, windows, ovens, etc... it sticks to. Highly recommend if you cook, do makeup, or take selfies!!! The print on the case is very clear too. Not all pixilated like most are. The edges are also a bit larger than most other cases, but it feels like if I dropped it from any angle it would survive the fall!",
