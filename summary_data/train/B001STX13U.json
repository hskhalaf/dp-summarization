I'm also happy because the cans have individual openers on the top, so I don't need to fuss with the can opener. I could probably say this is her favorite cat food that I give her, and I'm glad that I can find this bundle on Amazon, since it is definitely worth the money over buying individual cans.",

Read the ingredients on these \"grilled\" cans and note those not good for a cat's diet: wheat gluten, soy protein, corn starch and corn oil. Besides which, the \"food\" looks like bits of rubber.
