      "text": "I bought this as a Christmas present for my 5-year-old nephew. Of all the gifts he received on Christmas Morning, this one got the most play. He and the adults in the family spend hours in the front yard stomping on the launcher, having contests to see who could launch one farther, higher, or with the most spins. It was absolutely a blast. That's pretty impressive for a non-electronic, fairly inexpensive toy. I didn't think kids these days would play with something that didn't hook to the internet or have electronic games on it. This toy definitely proved me wrong. I'm glad I bought it.",

These things turned out to be more fun than I had expected.",

Each took turns using it. The darts are so soft you don't have to be afraid it would hurt anyone. The 3 year old really shot the dart up high and screamed after each shot but the 2 year old would jump on the cushion and his little dart only went about a foot from where he stood. He was so happy, clapping his hands and laughing you would have thought it went as high as the 3 year old. I love this toy.",

They fly about 1/5 of the distance of the \"rockets\" and usually nose dive into the ground. Trying to reshape the wings helped slightly. But to call these \"stunt planes\" is a misnomer. They are closer to \"really really bad gliders\". After playing with them once, my grand kids have put them away -- preferring much more to use the original rockets.",

We tried different planes and different angles, and the result was the same.

The orange \"glider\" plane in particular just does not glide, but instead has an erratic behavior. I tried slightly bending the foam wings to adjust the behavior, without success. The plane doing loopings has been working better. The \"stunt\" plane is also so-so. Kids still like it and want to play with it though, so that's good. I just wish the \"glider\" plane would work, and generally that all planes would fly a bit further.",

It would be great if they offered a replacement set of just the planes because I see this as an issue with the foam products. The base though has been vastly improved over older products and is much much sturdier. Our rocket launcher base would constantly break and had to be taped up, but this seems like it will last.",

The three planes are foam so they are not overly sturdy, but with practice they loop, go straight up and another is a glider.
