Based on our history with the product line--we went ahead and ordered the RW3-WU. It's even better than it's predecessor. It automatically straightens what you've scanned. Scanned documents are easily saved in PDF format. Instructions for set up and use are pretty easy to understand. The scanner comes with a storage pouch & cleaning cloth.",

It works the first time, but when I plug in the USB cable later, it says \"Scanner not found\" most of the time and the computer never finds it. Visioneer supposedly has updated its software to allow for better connections with Windows 8, but it doesn't work and I've given up on these mobile scanners. It's useless when the computer can't find it.",
