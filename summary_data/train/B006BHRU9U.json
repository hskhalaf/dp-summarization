In fact dried cane sugar is the second ingredient and fig paste is actually third. Then, there are additional sweeteners as sub-ingredients afterwards.",

This time, a strong disinfectant has permeated each bar so that I am unable to eat them. I'm very disappointed and will probably - reluctantly - not order again.
