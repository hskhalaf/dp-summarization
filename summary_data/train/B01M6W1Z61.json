      "text": "I was looking for a new rug for my patio & somehow clicked on RV rugs, had never known about these. As usual, I sifted thru tons of reviews and customer pictures & decided to try it. I was already prepared for the creases in the rug thanks to several reviews mentioning it but I wasn't prepared for how large it was am extremely happy about that. We had a 5\u00d78 out here before but the rug offers so much more coverage and I'm walking on it now without shoes & it's so comfortable underfoot. It cleans up easily and is very lightweight but stays put if that makes sense. I'm going to purchase another for the front porch.",

When it arrived all folded up (not sure why it doesn't come rolled) I immediately rolled it up and let it sit over night. This helped a bit with the creases. It also has some loops on each end to tack it down. I got a different one from another seller that was only 4 X 6 and almost the same price. Not sure how long it will hold up but, for the price it was so worth it.",

We wanted something inexpensive and easy to clean. This is perfect. It is a beautiful, large outdoor material designed to withstand activity. It does have wrinkles which take time to flatten out because we do not have it staked to the ground as it might have been intended. It would move and slide if we did not have heavy furniture and pots on it. But that is okay! Being a dog and kid family, we needed something to make our space livable and attractive. Thank you, this is perfect!",

There is enough room to generously pull out all of the chairs away from the table and still be comfortably on the mat. Not to mention, this plastic material is ideal wood decks. The quick dry ensures that no wood rot will occur as it can with traditional outdoor rugs. We attached each corner to the wood deck to secure it and so far, it has held up in some windy, rainy summer storms.",

We have a pool, so it gets wet a lot and so far it has not stayed damp. Great purchase.",

Gives your RV that \"welcome\" feel and helps to keep you and your RV cleaner. Corners of mat have tabs that can be used to \"spike\" it down on those windy days, better than placing rocks on the corners only to trip over.
