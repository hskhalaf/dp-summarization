I appreciated that it mixed better with water than the Baby's Only brand when I tried that, plus it is organic but not an insane price and it can be found at local stores (i.e., Target) if needed quicker than Amazon could deliver.

First time I tried it, I was really worried that my son will not take it as he is so used to breastmilk. Luckily, I was wrong! My son absolutely did not notice a difference and keeps taking this formula on regular basis. I like that this formula does not contain a bunch of junk that you cannot pronounce and is organic. A bonus is that it contains iron. Overall, I love buying products from Earth's Best and feel like the ingredients are worth paying a little extra.",
