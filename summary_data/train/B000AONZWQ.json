Highly recommended as a daily go-to timepiece.",

I\u2019m too hard on wristwatches to ever spend thousands of dollars on one, so for the price, this is a great value. I love every aspect of this watch, from the color scheme to the day/date display, crystal back, second hand arrow, leather band etc. I wear it daily, and am noticing small s ratchets on the case around the crystal, proof that I\u2019m too clumsy to own a high-priced luxury watch, so this is it for me. I refer to it often during the day because looking at it makes me happy - what else could I want?",

The size takes some getting used to if you normally wear larger watches. The face is made smaller by the bezel around the dial. But once you get used to it, its hard to wear anything larger. Best way to own a swiss automatic movement with a sapphire crystal. And yes the sapphire crystal holds up well against most dings and scratches. Wearing this watch everyday for the past 10 months means its been subjected to some normal and sometimes intense dings. But the crystal has remained spotless.",

Nice hacking movement with tons of reserve. Quality strap. Honestly you can't go wrong with this watch. BTW it looks better than the picture. The picture looks to me like the whole case is brushed stainless but actually the top of the case surrounding the crystal is highly polished. This is my second Hamilton. My other is the Kahki Field Mechanical -- different movement (ETA) but it too has superb accuracy at 4 seconds per week.",

The attention to detail is excellent, and much of it is difficult to capture in a photo, even with a macro lens. I have fairly small wrists, and this watch fits me comfortably. The stock band is very nice and breaks in quickly. I also sometimes use a black nato strap, which looks great too. You can't go wrong with this thing.

However, there are two things that surprised me: (1) Out of the box, it lost about 10-15 seconds per day. That's understandable, considering it's an automatic. But, I would have expected a bit more accuracy. (2) About four months after receiving it, I accidentally dropped it on a hard surface, cracking the crystal. After getting it back from Hamilton, the watch ran far more efficiently than before. Now, it loses only about 8-10 seconds a WEEK. Overall, I'm satisfied and would recommend it, considering the relatively low price-point.",

There is enough information on the net for the cons and prons of Powermatic 80 caliber Vs the ETA 2834. After more than a month, additional feedback - the orginal strap is very stiff, so I replaced with softer one. The watch is very accurate, is loosing about 2 seconds/day.

      "text": "This watch is a great addition to a timepiece collection. It is affordable, stylish and can be \"dressed up\" or \"dressed down\" depending on the occasion. The numbers are easy to read for those of us creeping up on the need for reading glasses and the black dial with white numbers provides a nice contrast. The band is comfortable, though it does take a few days to break in. The last loop is a bit loose and does not seem to stay where placed. You should also note this is a \"self winding\" watch, so having it on your night stand for a couple of days will require it to be reset with the time and date.",
