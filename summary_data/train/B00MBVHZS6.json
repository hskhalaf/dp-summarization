      "text": "Structurally the unit is sound. The problem lies with the multi-ball head. The balls don't seem to be rotating witthin a ball bearing enclosure. When weight is applied to the balls they bind. I've applied lubricant to them but that doesn't really help. For light duty work they are fine. Any substantial weight ( a few pounds) will cause them to seize up and not rotate. When this happens during lateral movement of the load the legs lift off the ground and stability of the stand is compromised. The roller is supported by ball bearings. It would have been nice to have the multi-ball support designed the same.",
