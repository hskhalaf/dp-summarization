      "text": "I love this watch and actually own two of them--the design is feminine and I like the simple, easy to read face. In general, leather watch bands tend to deteriorate after around a year and the watchband for the Georgia design is unique to it. The deterioration of a leather watchband should not render the watch obsolete! I believe that Fossil should offer replacement watch bands on its website for around $25. There is a clear code number on the back of the watch: ES3077. We should be able to enter it into the Fossil website dialogue box and buy the replacement!",

I have not had this watch for more than a few months which is another disappointment. Evidently me thinking I had bought a quality piece I could enjoy for years is no longer true with Fossil. Darn it! I liked this watch and got many compliments on it for the first couple of months I had it.",

I teach school so there wasn't any hard wear and tear on this watch. Any watch at a cost of over $50.00-$100.00 should last longer than that. Amazon suggested I contact the Fossil Company direct, which I did. Not only would they not replace the watch, but also estimated a $70.00 watch to repair it. This isn't good customer service, and I am very disappointed. I had a Fossil watch years and years ago and it lasted for many years. Problems with production and parts these days perhaps? I wouldn't recommend this watch as a purchase.",
