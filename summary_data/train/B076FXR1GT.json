      "text": "When I initially turned the TV on I was not happy with the picture quality at all. I'm not sure if the screen needed to warm up or have a break in type of period but the picture improved overwhelmingly throughout the first night of use. Overall I'm very happy with the picture quality and TV overall. It was odd that I needed to have an internet connection in order to get started (setup) and actually begin using the TV. I see how that could be an issue for someone. I guess that's what you get for buying a \"smart\" TV.",
