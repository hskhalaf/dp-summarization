Used 2x/month for 40min/session. 3 stars for a solid product for the first year (it would start to grind and pop but still work since then) but don't expect the last epilator you'll ever have to buy. Fyi: Unit comes with a brush, but there is NO way to clean behind the head easily, so it's kind of a joke. Video: noise the epilator started making (loud) with proof that it no longer works at all.",

Otherwise this thing works great. if you use it only loose skin or wrinkly skin (you know where I'm talking about) then you have to pull the skin taut. then it won't pinch. It's scary to put those teeth on your \"sensitive parts\" but it doesn't pinch me. Follow directions and open the pores up first and then spray some aftertreatment (witchhazel and rubbing alcohol) and you'll be fine.",

It has 2 tiny little plastic gears, one in the head and one in the body, and eventually one of the teeth on the plastic gear will break. I estimate used my epilator less than 20 times before it broke. While it does work, it does its job very well. No complaints there.",

The low price made me nervous.. (More expensive is better, right??) I can safely say I won't go back to the Philips Epilator again. It was a great epilator, but this one is far superior. The Emjoi AP-18 is the most effective and comfortable epilator I've ever used. The dual heads are extremely efficient and my skin isn't piched or pulled. One pass yields as much hair as 2 or 3 passes on my old epilator. It's also somewhat quiet. (Comparatively speaking)",
