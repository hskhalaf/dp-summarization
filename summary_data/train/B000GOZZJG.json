Also, if you do not quite have the mechanism lined up right, you will think you have it locked, but SURPRISE you picked it up and now all your cash is laying on the ground! If you have the revenue, muster up the extra money, for a box that has the appropriate cash dividers & hinge designs to keep your money better organized and secure.",

The trays for money are nice and the space inside fits letter size paper unfolded which is great for tally sheets and booth control sheets. It has ample room for pens and pencils also as well as banded money or coins when the top compartments become too full for making change. I'm sure we will get many years of use out of this box.",

My son had bought this one & showed it to me after I told him what happened. This safe is JUST as sturdy, if not more then the other one. I wish I had seen this first. It's about 1/3 of the other ones size, but I don't need a huge one. You just can't beat this. Don't let the low price fool you. It's AWESOME for the price. I was asked to price this after seeing it, I would have guessed 40-50.00.",

However it does mean that the box is always locked, and the lock is much more secure that those of most varieties.",
