However I don\u2019t like the quality of crayon in it. It\u2019s very hard and waxy so I don\u2019t think it colors easily or well. My kid has to push down really hard to see color, me too, which sometimes makes the color pieces snap apart while holding and using. I bought as party favors but I wouldn\u2019t recommend. Great idea but needs better crayon in it",

I think the kids will like this.",

It doesn't mark toddlers' hands or other items around the house but colours quite decently on paper. My daughter also loved the stacking aspect of this and played with it more than coloured with it. After a while, the colour pieces do come out of the plastic casing so be careful of handing this to a younger baby that doesn't know not to eat it. Overall, I am pleased and they were a hit with most kids.",

Received Huji Stackable Crayons exactly as ordered and in great shape. Loved that they were bagged together yet in two 24 Packs. Perfect for my daughter\u02bbs 2nd birthday party diy coloring books I made for her treat bags. On top of that, they had the products delivered, undamaged, 4 days later. Super happy customer. Would definately order from Huji again and recommend to others. Thank you",
