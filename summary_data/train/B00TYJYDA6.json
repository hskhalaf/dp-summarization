All around me those who wore running shoes, particularly the low-profile \"barefoot\" style, slipped on the dusty surface and fell on their behinds. But my feet never budged. Each step was as firm and secure as anyone would want. Second test: the black, jagged lava field inside Kilauea Iki Crater on Hawaii Island, reminiscent of an asphalt parking that giants have attacked with jackhammers. Four hours later, my feet were the most comfortable of any in our group. Would definitely recommend these shoes, particularly if they last the 20 years that another reviewer mentioned.",

The leather on these is suede or \u201copen grain\u201d leather, which is ok, just not what I was expecting. I wear a 8&1/2 or 9, and wanted a 9&1/2 wide but they were out of stock. Tried a 9 wide. I had them shipped to my workplace, when they were too small, a co-worker LOVED them and bought them from me! Now I\u2019m going to buy 10 wide, which is a ridiculously large size for me normally, but it seems that is what I need in this boot.",

I wore them a few times before going backpacking, and the side of the boot where the tongue attaches at the top rubbed the front of my ankle. I loosened the ties and they were okay, so I went backpacking in them. With the extra weight of the backpack, the tongue area again rubbed my ankles almost raw. I wish I could return them, but they are scuffed after the backpacking trip. I am ordering a Vasque Breeze instead.",

These boots are high-quality, look great, and are incredibly comfortable. I appreciate that they do not have a lot of weight to them, which will be great for both hiking and backpacking endeavors.

I've had the boots for a couple months now, wear them as much as possible--to work, on city walks, on hikes, building up for a big backpacking trip this month.
