There is nothing on the frame to lock the armrests in position. (2.) The headrest portion that sticks up just flops over if you try to use it as a headrest. I wonder why it was made that high. If you are shorter, like me, you can scoot forwards and lay back to use the back as a headrest but your back will not have any support.",

      "text": "Gotta be honest, and my wife and I have had six of these over the years, I'm convinced there is a manufacturing defect in these chairs. Others have (correctly) pointed-out they're not meant to bear weight like a cane. I'm big (almost 250 pounds), and all of mine have broken at the right side joint, right below the armrest. However, my tiny wife (who weighs less than 120, and who is LEFT handed) had had two of hers break, too, in the exact same place -- the right side (even though she never applies pressure on the right).",

The carry bag is of course tight, could be a little bigger but I'm able to get them back into the carry bag with just a little effort. Also the back of the chair where your neck would be has extra material so it gives, you can actually lean your head back and rest your neck comfortably if you are not too tall. Love the dark blue!",

Use: I purchased this folding chair after having gotten rid of all of my regular furniture in preparation for a move. I used this chair on a daily basis for over a month. Although no folding chair could ever be as comfortable as a couch, I actually did not miss my couch.",

I also usually travel with a Nalgene bottle of water which doesn't fit into most cup holders. The insulated pouch for cans of soda or beer also works great for giant water bottles! :) The only downside is trying to stuff everything into the little travel bag.",
