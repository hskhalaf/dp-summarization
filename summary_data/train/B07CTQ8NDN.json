Because I wear custom orthotics, I picked the Sonic b/c they are the only ones in the HOVR line (per Under Armour customer service) with removable insoles. Unfortunately, the shoe's heel design is such that the orthotics don't fit properly and they place my heel too high at the back of the shoe. I have a set of low \"running\" orthotics and they are fine but customs won't work. Short version, if you can wear these as is, they're fine but if you are looking for something that you can use your orthotics, they are a no go.",

The only thing I dont like is the heel is slightly uncomfortable and tight. I would recommend wearing socks that cover your whole ankle. I read plenty of reviews on multiple underarmour shoes and they were all correct on the size. They run small. On every other shoe I own, I wear 9.5, but I ordered 10s and they fit perfectly.",

I will say, the women's version of this shoe in white and gold is a tiny bit more cushiony for some reason but I wanted them in black for work. The women's HOVR are just a tad more comfy for longer runs but overall I'm very happy with this shoe. I've gotten a lot of compliments on how they look. The bluetooth feature is really awesome. Had no problem syncing them to my phone and the MapMyRun app. It tracks workouts and gives you training tips that help you with your run. Great product!",

NEUTRAL: for those looking for the right balance between flexibility, cushioning and versatility DIGITAL CONNECTION: Under Armour's Record Sensor technology monitors and stores practically every data related to the race so you know exactly what you need to do to improve Under Armour HOVR technology provides a \"weightlessness\" feeling, favouring the return of energy and reducing the force of the impact of each step The Energy Web compression network contains the Under Armour HOVR foam that returns all the energy of your steps Micro thread upper with tone-on-tone wave pattern for a snug, breathable fit that guarantees lightness combined with directional strength and unparalleled comfort to cover long distances The ventilated panel in the central part of the foot increases breathability The particular structure of the tongue is fixed to the insole by means of flexible support tabs to maintain an enveloping fit over the whole foot External TPU counter for greater support and structure The removable Orthoclase antimicrobial midsole is modelled on the shape of the foot to ensure personalized comfort and cushioning The rubber blown under the forefoot is light but at the same time incredibly reactive The highly abrasion-resistant rubber positioned under the heel helps absorb the contact with the ground Differential: 8 mm",
