I like to cross train when possible and like to dabble in different forms of fitness and found parallette workouts to be extremely tough, yet extremely beneficial as you get older. It strengthens your core, arms and back; giving you functional strength. The quality of the device is awesome. I can definitely hold someone that is 300 pounds plus. The only downside is that I wish the bottom supporting beams were lower to the ground. I've stubbed my toe a couple times rushing through a workout, but I guess it teaches me to be in better control of my body.",

The joints were neatly welded and the paint job was fine, with no chipping or peeling observed. They're a little pricey but based on my research, they are a good value for the money.",

I have had friends and family try them and they they seem to work for people even as tall as 6\"3!! It is ideal for anyone wanting to do their own calisthenics at home or anywhere else as they are quite simple to carry around. Anyone at any level interested in calisthenics should buy this product. Very impressed with this product :)",
