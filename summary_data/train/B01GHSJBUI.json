After I mounted my tv outside under my patio I thought it would be nice to have a cover to help my tv withstand the weather. The first order I received the cover was to large, the company was nice enough to refund me my money and I ordered the correct size. The fit is perfect. Easy to take off and put back on with the Velcro installed",

I figured I would buy the cheaper one and make a cover out of something waterproof, That would probably look cheap as crap. Then I found out these people make one that looks professional and does a great job of protecting my TV from the elements and for 25 bucks, what a deal",

The only issue I have with the cover is that it is very hard to get on the TV due to the flaps on the back that have Velcro on all sides.

The cover still encloses the TV sufficiently.",
