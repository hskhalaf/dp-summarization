Bought for my upcoming vacation, allowed my 2 youngest children to test it out. Video quality is great. App/WiFi feature makes downloading videos super easy, you will have to try both recommended apps though. Sound quality through water proof case isn't horrible. Did notice a tiny bit of fogging in waterproof case which means there is a bit of leakage somewhere. Overall though for $50 this is a fantastic purchase!! In fact I just ordered 3 more for our family to use on vacation and out doing charters",

They come with a ton of mounts, a waterproof case (and it has worked to 100 feet in frigid New England waters), extra battery, etc. You can pay more for a similar product, then cringe when you lose it in the surf at high tide (true story), or when you slam a drone into a brick building (also a true story).

One thing I really loathe is that the seller offers free accessories in change for positive reviews. I have to admit that the free gifts are very attempting.

      "text": "It's not going to cook you supper or walk your dog, but you could clip this little bugger onto your dog and get some pretty great footage! The still camera footage is so/so, but my mom wants something little she can strap to her walker and get some action shots of her walks around the block and of Lake Michigan without breaking the bank. At less than $50, you can't ask for much more. This thing has a zillion attachments and if Mom ever decided she needs to try parasailing, it comes with a waterproof case. Slick!",
