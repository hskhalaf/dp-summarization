However, after using this several times it has successfully electrically shocked me on 3 separate occasions. I read all of the warnings and instructions before ever using the product. I gave it many chances hoping that it would not shock me again... but no luck. This is worthless now because I am terrified to use it :(",

The heat feature, which you can choose to use or not, helps to workout the knots. It has helped me a lot and it was a decent price for something this soothing. The cushion is fairly comfortable and it has a nice covering on it. I would recommend this item for back and shoulder relief. For me, it has really helped. I would definitely buy this again.",

The heat is a great addition, but beware that cats think the red lights (that turns on when the heat option is on) are red dot laser toys and may try to attack it! LOL!",

This is the second one of these devices I have bought. The first (from a different manufacturer) actually worked better and was cheaper but it was much worse quality (motor wasn't strong enough). This one would get five stars except for two things: One is that I know it could be better and two, the buttons are poorly placed. The buttons are on the front of the device and can be easily depressed accidentally. Annoying.",

I\u2019d still buy it but get frustrated trying to adjust it across my back. If your muscles are extremely tight, it works but can be painful. That\u2019s because it\u2019s breaking up the tenseness.

The movement and additional vibration plus heat features are incredibly nice when you need to change up the options depending on how bad your back is. It is definitely worth getting this upgrade especially if you have bad back problems. The massagers can dig deep or be gentle depending on how much pressure you put on it. Fits great in all chairs. Not extremely bulky like the full size chair massagers so it great to take to work and utilize as needed. Not extremely loud either.",
