Apparently, Robins like hanging out on the doors of cars and looking at their selves in the mirrors, all the while doing their business all down the side of your freshly washed car. These covers are good quality, easy to put on and take off, haven't faded all year, and keep the birds off. I can't speak for how well they would do in the winter with snow, which is their intended purpose, but I couldn't be happier with my purchase.",
