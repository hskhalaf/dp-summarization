The vaccum itself is good,but the hose that is connected to the vaccum keeps breaking off, and it's so anotying that you have to keep snapping it back on and it's really time consumming. In the past 3 years I've used 5 of this vaccum with the same problem ( same brand but different models). It seems as if the company has ignored the costumers reviews and I've decided to go with a different brand.(I have pictures to prove) I'm disappointed because I loved the brand.",

      "text": "The vacuum itself works great, however, there is a flaw in the end of the telescoping wand that holds the tools on in that it does not \"grab\" the tool and allow you to screw it on tightly, which means tools fall off a lot. I kinda figured out how to use suction to keep them on and then I ordered two more wands to keep in different locations as they are a pain to move around when not vacuuming, and lo and behold one of the two extra telescoping wands I purchased works as it should (world of difference) and the other one does not. So 2 out of 3 telescoping wands don't hold the tools on.",

      "text": "For the amount of money paid, I would have expected more. The hose that connects to the wand is not secure and keeps falling off when vacuuming. Why isn't the connection secure like the connection for the attachments. Also, the floor/carpet head should swivel as I have to bend down in order to have the vacuum head sit flush on the floor. If I stand up straight, the head as at too much of an angle to effectively pick up dirt, etc. Not much to a vacuum from a mechanical perspective, so these little things make the difference. I am not very happy. Should have purchased the ULine vacuum.",
