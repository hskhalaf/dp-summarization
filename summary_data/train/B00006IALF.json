I popped the mesh into place and although the dent is still apparent, it will be hidden under the computer desk. Surprised it's not sturdy like my other one. Older one in student's room is shorter and quite sturdy. It is NOT a 'Rolodex Wastebasket, and was purchased on Amazon about 2-3 years ago. I cannot recommend this new model. Amazon shippers were not careful this time.",

However, because of its incredibly sturdy, yet flexible, construction, I was able to simply pop out the dent with no adverse effects whatsoever, which shows just how reliable this product is. Its also the perfect size for an office or bedroom, as it is big enough to not require constant emptying, while small enough to be barely noticeable in the room. I would highly recommend this product at twice the price, but luckily I don't have to :) You really can't go wrong with this one.",

It holds way more trash so I hardly have to empty it, and it isn't an eyesore in my apartment any more. I dented it once by dropping it but the mesh was easily reshaped back into place. Only downside is that sometimes small items get stuck in the mesh, but it is worth it for the look and feel. High quality",
