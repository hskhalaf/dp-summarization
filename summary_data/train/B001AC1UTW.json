Although the amount in the container seems rather small, it lasts for months and months. Therefore, it is also very economical. Finally, it does not cake and is very sheer, but still covers any discoloration on the face very well.",

Oily skinned people might have to reapply more frequently This is heavy makeup and I only use it occasionally for spot treatment. I find their body makeup covers better. If you have very pale skin, you will have a hard time finding a match. I would not recommend this brand if you are acne prone. The ingredient list could be better.",

I only have to use a tiny bit of Dermablend for my whole face.

The reason for 3 stars is because the color selection can be tricky. I purchased yellow beige which was described as for light skin with yellow undertones, in my opinion this would be for medium skin. The color range is not extensive and the difference between one shade to the next is quite a jump. The ideal shade for a given individual would be a mix, which I think professionals do all the time.

I\u2019m really excited about this foundation. I have dry skin, so I use a little oil primer with it. For me, it has a dewy glow. However, I did put on too much the first time and felt oily. I use 80W. It definitely can be worn all day.",
