Unfortunately, I lost them (their magnetic quality caused them to stick to metal things and come off me without me realizing). This one was different in style so I thought it would prevent that from happening. It was rated Editor's Choice, so I ordered it. It was disappointing. It has done NOTHING to help with the pain/stiffness over the month or so where I wore it daily. Unfortunately, my return window has closed so I cannot return it.",

It also is pretty rugged, my father is a carpenter so this definitely takes a beating through the day and it hasn't shown any signs of weakening.",

    "description": "Simple Minimalist High Quality Copper Magnetic Bracelet This bracelet is perfect for anyone looking to help relieve pain from arthritis, RSI, carpal tunnel, migraines, fatigue and more. Whether you live a calm and relaxing life or a very active lifestyle, many people find copper bracelets help reduce some of their aches and pains as they grow older. The minimalist style design is perfect for blending in with the rest of your accessories. Why Magnets & Copper? Magnets worn close to your joints are believed to help increase blood flow to these joints, bringing healing nutrients such as iron and vitamin C to them.
