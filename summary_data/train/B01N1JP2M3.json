Kind of disappointed because they\u2019re very comfortable and they look good. But they don\u2019t seem like they\u2019re going to last much longer.",

I have fallen arches and these shoes offer great support and don\u2019t deform with the extra pressure on the sides. I have been using these for work and exercise and could not be more pleased with how they feel. There is however some slight wear on the top mesh that could potentially get bigger. This showed up after a wash in the washing machine so I would recommend washing these by hand. I will say that I have been pretty rough on these so I would expect them to be showing some signs of wear.",
