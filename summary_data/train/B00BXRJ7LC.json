Good color combination, nice slim size like I've been seeking, and I like the design for opening the bladder to fill/clean. My issue with it is the shoulder straps being too close together at the top, so the seam rubs against your neck. I know that will irritate my neck over the course of a hike (and will surely just pick up all the sunscreen in that area). Other slim packs I've tried have the straps wider and/or direct outwards more, so they stay away from the neck.",

The back of the bag which keeps contact with your back doesn't have any webbing in the center or spacing to keep it from making direct contact with you because of this you will start feeling pretty hot on your back from wearing it all day. the bladder looks cheaply made and I question how long it will last before I buy a nicer one. for the price it works well though and I think I went into it with the right expectation. Also the bite valve has no dedicated on off like the nicer ones just a stand alone bite value.",
