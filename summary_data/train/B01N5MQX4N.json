Great sound, dependent on the music it sometimes has too much bass but more is better because you can always reign it in, the app that you can get with it is useless, but the headphones themselves are very comfortable, have great sound and the noise cancelling is actually decent(just don't use it indoor if you don't need to). Im happy with my purchase and would definitely reccomend.",

It only becomes slightly punchy as you crank the volume up to max. The highs are very recessed and its just low and mids. I really thought it would be a neutral sound with emphasis on bass but its more of a drop curve. Noise cancelling is better than i thought it would be and so is the battery life. The build seems nice but the pads are already getting white streaks from the stiches. So the pads are bad. Overall its a pretty \"meh\" product.",

General reviews online seemed to endorse these headphones so I took the plunge and got them, and it's fair to say I haven't looked back. They're very comfortable, they look great, battery life is really good, and most importantly sound quality is decent and you can really feel the difference in bass with the effect turned on. For casual listening and general wear I would really recommend these headphones.",
