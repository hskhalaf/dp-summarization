Even though the lens does not focus as the native lens when you set the camera at continuous autofocus, I still think this is a great lens. The photos I've taken with it on a6000 are really sharp. It doesn't have OSS like the native lens so I do use a tripod in windy conditions. The beach photo taken below is with a tripod and I'm pleased with the image quality for a lens at this price. The second photo shows how the lens performs in low light/handheld condition and it wasn't that great but this is expected.",

One thing I did notice (and consist with some of the other reviews) is the feeling of moving parts inside the lens when it is off. Nevertheless, the lens works perfectly.",

Slightly longer start up time with this lens on a Nex-7 but that's a software issue. Overall, a good walk around lens if f/2.8 is fast enough for your purposes.",

That said, I can only give it 4 stars because of how it's built. When the camera is powered off, the internals slide around inside the barrel and rattle a LOT and sound like the're broken. I fear that too much movement over time would damage the internals from all that banging around against the barrel ends.",

Thus this is at 45mm with crop factor which makes it slightly wide-angle. The lens performs very well and is very sharp, being the sharpest at about f4 to f8. The f2.8 is still very good but at this focal length it is harder to achieve a real shallow depth of field. The better lens would be a 32mm f/1.4 or f/1.8 lens, but the money spent is somewhat more. For the \"normal\" prime I would recommend this lens highly.",

The linear motor focusing mechanism does have one position where it won't start up properly without a bit of a rotation, but you'll be hard-pressed to find this position very easily. And shooting raw does leave you with a bit of barrel distortion on the edges of the image... but I shoot JPEG. For a great lens at this price point, there has to be some drawback. I guess the slight barrel distortion (corrected in software for JPEG only) is its only drawback.",

Especially if you don't shoot much video, so the lack of image stabilization is not a big deal. The other reason to opt for the $450 Sony 35 mm lens is its faster at f1.4, but I think a better buy would be this Sigma lens followed by the Sony 50 mm f1.4 portrait lens, since their combined cost is just a little more.",

But, got this to supplement my main lens, voigtlander 35mm 1.2, when i want a smaller form factor and autofocus and when crop factor isn't an issue. basically, i use this lens when i want a point and shoot. pq compared to my 1.2 is apparent. pictures lack \"soul\" if lack for a better description. focus is not as tack sharp but it doesn't take me 5-10 seconds to get the focus just right as i would with the 1.2.",

      "text": "Quite clear, little distortion but moderate vignetting in certain conditions. I shoot wide open most of the time, and I'm quite pleased. That being said, with the widest aperture being f/2.8 this lens isn't particularly fast. Don't expect to see in the dark or luscious bokeh. AF is quick, the build quality is nice and I like operating the focus ring. It's also extremely quiet. For the price, you really can't go wrong. At the time of writing, however, the Sony 50mm f1.8 is only $50 more and if you want a lens with more purpose I would go with that.",

Couldn't care less about the 2.8 max-aperture. Real street shooters hardly EVER shoot small format lens' wide open! This lens packs a tremendous amount of bang for the buck! The fit, finish, quality are all right for the price. Would purchase again.",

It works well for macro and street photography, but it's pretty awful for landscapes. Sharpness is an issue here. My iPhone 5S takes better landscape photos. The colors do not pop at all. I have to edit the heck out of the photos I shoot to make the colors look like they do in nature. If it were more expensive, I'd have returned it.",
