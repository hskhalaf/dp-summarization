The only way to attach this phone to your existing phone is using the little cord pictured and then through the handset (see diagram). Be forewarned.",

      "text": "Everything works great, fine headset and I've worked with many over the years...but one strange annoying quality about this one is that I keep this mounted on the base when I'm not using, and it's particularly difficult to seat this in the base, takes about 30 seconds or more to return the headset to the base. The fit of the earpiece on the headset strangely doesn't conform with the shape of the base charging rest unless it's angled just right. With future designs, the manufacturer should adjust the design so the headset quickly reseats in the base for charging. Otherwise, it's a great unit!",

I chose this model because the reviews looked great and it was the closest to my old unit. I love it! It is clear, fits well on my head and ear (better than the old version), and call quality seems good. Don't forget to adjust the speaker volume - I did a test with my husband before using it for work so I'd get the best outside sound volume. It was very easy to set up. I hope it lasts as long as my last one - it seems like a quality unit.",
