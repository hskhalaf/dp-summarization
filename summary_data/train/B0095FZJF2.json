It is a Beautiful bed! I also love how it can be taken apart if we need to move it again. It was packed extremely well with no damage to be seen. The wrench to tighten down the side rails didn't last too long though...as it bends. It took me about 2 hours to unpack and setup. We also purchased a steel box spring that is 9 inches and it fit perfectly and ends right before the top of the side rails.",

It looks much more expensive than it was. I would recommend it to anyone! There is a gap between the end of the mattress and the footboard, but it doesn't bother me because I have a very thick comforter that hides it. I think it's done that way to accommodate either a king or a CA king mattress.",

      "text": "Lasted exactly 5 years, then collapsed. I weigh 200#, my partner far less. The greatest load bearing happens at the join between the headboard and the sideboards. Unfortunately the sideboards are made of particleboard and the headboard bolts on the right side ripped right through the thinnest sidewall that contains them inside the sideboard. In the previous 12 months the supports under the mattress had simply fallen out, weakening the load bearing in the slats, but I had replaced them with carefully-leveled stacks of books that provided better support. While this was inexpensive for a sleigh-like bed, 5 years is not a reasonable life.",

The wood is gorgeous (and smells great!). It was pretty straightforward to assemble. I did notice a tiny nick in the headboard but I will probably just color it in with a wood pen. The frame is quite large and the bed sits high but it's fun to climb in and out of. Overall very happy with the purchase and glad to have an option other than the local furniture store where the frames were $200-400 more expensive.",
