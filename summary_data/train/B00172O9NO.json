But, after doing some research and noticing some changes to my skin, we realized that some of the ingredients can be very harmful. Mainly, fragrance/parfum and phenoxyethanol, *a potential neurotoxin and common allergen, were of great concern. Maybe if it was more natural and eco friendly, I would give it 5 stars. Before learning about the harsh chemicals found in this product, I was very pleased with it.",

Not something you should be putting on your face. I used it on my face after a shower, and it immediately started stinging. I decided I wanted to try it again after applying a great moisturizer and it once again made my skin sting, and start to dry it out. I can see how if you don't have sensitive or dry skin this could be a decent product. For me personally I don't also want to spray my face with red and blue dyes.",

      "text": "I've only used this product twice, but really love it and believe it to be excellent. It seems similar to an ancient cosmetic wash called \"Hungarian Water\". However, the \"spray\" part of the bottle is useless, as it drips, sputters and runs down the side. I purchased some wonderful, amber colored glass cosmetic spray bottles from Amazon, which solved this problem. The product is wonderful both as a freshener after moisturizing and as a finishing spray, after makeup! The rose water smells so fresh and the aloe and other herbs are very good for the skin and leave a healthy sheen. Excellent product, which would be dramatically improved by using a glass spray bottle that actually worked!",

Either way, if you're going to purchase this item, do yourself a favor and go find it at your nearest Ulta or beauty store.",

I actually noticed a change in my skin very quickly. It felt more glowy and moisturized. I love it, I bought some more for myself and my parents who are obsessed now as well. Rose is so good for your skin and this version of it is affordable and just kinda lovely. And for $7 it's a smart purchase!",
