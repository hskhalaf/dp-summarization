USB Cable, Video Cable, SD Card and Solutions Disk Not Included.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nTHE MARK OF POWERSHOT EXCELLENCE\nThe all-new PowerShot flagship, the PowerShot G1 X Mark II raises performance and quality to new heights in a compact, brilliant design. Featuring a huge, 1.5-inch 12.8 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor, a powerful DIGIC 6 Image Processor and an all-new 5x wide-angle optical zoom lens with Optical Image Stabilizer and a circular, 9-blade aperture for stunning blurred backgrounds, the PowerShot G1 X Mark II delivers the outstanding image quality you would expect with a digital SLR camera but in a portable, Wi-Fi\u00ae and NFC enabled package. It can capture 14-bit RAW plus JPEG images, features a staggering 31 focus points for speedy and accurate AF, a capacitive 3.0-inch tilt-type touch panel LCD and has newly developed Dual Control Rings on the lens barrel for fast control of exposure and focus. An optional high-resolution electronic viewfinder adds to the camera's professional feel and functionality. Whether being used as a companion to an EOS digital SLR or as a standalone camera, the PowerShot G1 X Mark II has the power to handle most any photographic situation it encounters.\n\nOPTIMAL IMAGE CAPTURE IN A COMPACT CAMERA\nCANON 1.5-INCH, 12.8 MEGAPIXEL HIGH-SENSITIVITY CMOS SENSOR\nAlmost as large as the APS-C CMOS sensor found in many EOS digital SLRs, and bigger than those found in 4/3 system cameras, the PowerShot G1 X Mark II's sensor sets the standard for sensitivity and resolving power in compact cameras. Each cell area is 4.5x the size of those found in 1/1.7 type sensors and is thus able to capture more light at the pixel level. This means better detail, even at higher ISOs, with minimal noise and distortion and, thanks to the sensor's wide cell pitch, breathtaking dynamic range. The PowerShot G1 X Mark II camera natively captures images in the 3:2 aspect ratio, which is the same as Canon EOS SLR cameras. The PowerShot G1 X Mark II also features a new Aspect Ratio function, enabling RAW image capture in both 3:2 and 4:3 aspect ratios while maintaining the same angle of view.\n\nCANON DIGIC 6 IMAGE PROCESSOR\nThe PowerShot G1 X Mark II camera is equipped with the very latest Canon proprietary processor, the DIGIC 6 Image Processor, which makes several important advancements to image quality both in stills and video. Improved light sensitivity allows for higher resolution with less noise when shooting in dark conditions, and Dynamic IS now detects and compensates for tilt and parallel movement (shift blur) to create video that's exceptionally free of distortion. The DIGIC 6 Image Processor also enhances the performance capabilities of the PowerShot G1 X Mark II, powering full resolution high-speed continuous still shooting and the advanced Star shooting modes. Video recording has also been improved with MP4 recording for better compatibility with mobile devices and tablets. Highly compressed MP4 video not only preserves space on your memory card but also improves playback on mobile devices. Plus, with MF Peaking possible thanks to the new processor, you'll have a pro-level focusing tool at your disposal.\n\nCANON HS SYSTEM\nThe Canon HS SYSTEM lets you take bright, clear photos in an even wider range of shooting situations. Beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas. The system is the result of two technologies in the PowerShot G1 X Mark II: the amazing 1.5-inch High-Sensitivity CMOS imaging sensor, which is able to capture more light; and the DIGIC 6 Image Processor, which actively reduces noise at high ISO speeds and processes images at high speed, even at full resolution. Thus, the Canon HS SYSTEM allows you to use higher shutter speeds to capture clearer images with reduced noise and blur in more situations.\n\nWIDE, BRIGHT AND FAST OPTICS FOR SUPERIOR IMAGE CAPTURE\n5X OPTICAL ZOOM PLUS A NEW F/2.0 \u2013 F/3.9, 24MM WIDE-ANGLE LENS WITH OPTICAL IMAGE STABILIZER\nDeveloped specifically for the PowerShot G1 X Mark II, this large aperture lens offers the highest specifications for any camera in this class, and incorporates dramatic improvements on all fronts based upon the feedback of PowerShot G1 X users. It offers a 5x zoom factor with a 24\u2013120mm equivalent range that's perfect for any number of shooting scenarios, and it has an incredibly bright aperture value of f/2.0 at wide angle and f/3.9 fully zoomed. It has a newly designed inner focusing system which enables fast AF speed with minimal lens movement, a reduced focusing distance of 5cm, features 14 elements in 11 groups and has a 9-blade aperture diaphragm for beautiful background blur. Engineered to perform and deliver gorgeous images every time, it's the perfect lens for the PowerShot G1 X Mark II camera's amazing sensor. And, in response to the overwhelming requests from PowerShot G1 X users, it has an integral lens cap.\n\nOPTICAL IMAGE STABILIZER\nHandheld shooting can often lead to camera shake, making photos and videos blurry. Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer is a sophisticated system that uses lens-shift technology to correct for unwanted camera movement. It makes handheld photography more practical in more shooting situations, providing excellent image quality in many difficult situations: outdoors at dusk, inside without a flash, and even at the telephoto end of the zoom range without a tripod. For still photos, it enables shooting at slower shutter speeds, accommodating more low-light shooting situations than ever before without having to boost ISO sensitivity. With camera shake and vibration reduced, you get a sharper, steadier image. And because it is an optical system, there is none of the image degradation typical with electronic image stabilizers.\n\nSHARE IMAGES AND VIDEO WHEREVER AND WHENEVER\nBUILT-IN WI-FI\u00ae\nThe PowerShot G1 X Mark II is equipped with built-in Wi-Fi\u00ae technology for convenient sharing and transferring of your still images and video. Easily post your images to social networking and media sites \u2013 Facebook\u00ae, Twitter\u00ae, YouTube\u2122, Flickr\u00ae and now Google Drive\u2122 \u2013 through CANON iMAGE GATEWAY# directly from your PowerShot camera, or save them to the online photo album to share anytime, anywhere. The camera can also connect directly to both iOS\u00ae and Android\u2122 devices*, and upload images via the free Canon CameraWindow app** without a computer. You can control the destination of your uploads to share with everyone or to selected groups, and even add comments. Sharing video is also easy with the PowerShot G1 X Mark II, which records video using the MP4 format with minimal file size. Enhanced Wi-Fi\u00ae makes posting in real time possible, so you can keep everyone up to date with amazing photos and video even as events unfold. The built-in Wi-Fi\u00ae technology on the PowerShot G1 X Mark II also allows you to transfer images to other Wi-Fi\u00ae equipped PowerShot cameras or print your photos directly to a PictBridge (Wireless LAN) certified printer.\n\nOne-touch connection to your mobile device or computer is also made possible on the PowerShot G1 X Mark II with the camera's dedicated Mobile Device Connect Button. You can choose to transfer images to your smartphone or tablet for immediate sharing with the CameraWindow app**, or to your computer on the same network with Image Sync to make saving and organizing your images easier. When the camera finds a linked computer on the same wireless network, images are sent directly to it. Otherwise, images are temporarily stored on CANON iMAGE GATEWAY# then transferred once a connection is made, eliminating the need for cables.\n\nREMOTE SHOOTING\nWith the built-in Wi-Fi\u00ae on the PowerShot G1 X Mark II, you can use your smartphone or tablet* to remotely control the camera. Simply connect wirelessly to your device and access the free Canon CameraWindow app**.

With the camera's advanced DIGIC 6 Image Processor, the camera records Full HD video in MP4 that is breathtaking even when played back on a large-screen HDTV via the camera's HDMI output. Video is recorded at 30 frames per second* with stereo sound and because clips are recorded in MP4, you can fit more on a single memory card. The smaller file size also makes it easier to download to a computer and share with family and friends.\n\nAdditionally, the PowerShot G1 X Mark II also records video in the Apple iFrame\u00ae format, which is a computer-friendly standard that speeds up importing and editing of videos. It keeps file sizes small, making it more convenient to upload or e-mail high-quality videos. The iFrame format enjoys native support in compatible Mac and Windows video applications, making it unnecessary to perform time-consuming and often quality-degrading conversions. \n\n* Actual frame rate is 29.97 fps.\n\nADJUSTABLE PERFORMANCE AT YOUR FINGERTIPS\nBRIGHT, CAPACITIVE 3.0-INCH TILT-TYPE TOUCH PANEL LCD\nThe PowerShot G1 X Mark II features an entirely new 1.04 million pixel capacitive screen that can tilt up 180 degrees and down 45 degrees for flexible shooting in any number of situations and angles. Touch-sensitive, it delivers intuitive touch panel operation and review. Menu and quick control settings can be accessed, and focus point and shutter release can be activated with the touch of a fingertip using Touch AF. Displaying fine detail, it's the perfect screen for composing and reviewing images. The screen is designed so that reflections are minimized and colors are realistically reproduced, and the display can be viewed, without glare, from any number of angles. And because the aspect ratio of recording has been set to 3:2, the aspect ratio of the LCD monitor has also been set to 3:2.\n\nMORE CONTROL IN HAND\nDUAL CONTROL RINGS\nThe PowerShot G1 X Mark II camera's lens features two control rings on the lens barrel designed to enhance operability with quick, intuitive customizable functions. The inner ring is stepped and can be directed to set aperture value, shutter speed and exposure compensation. The outer, continuous ring has an easily recognizable different texture and makes fine tune adjustments simple, even enabling full-time manual focus that operates similarly to the focus rings found on typical SLR lenses. Working in tandem with the PowerShot G1 X Mark II camera's rear-mounted control dial, virtually every shooting function can be accessed and customized to any photographer's favorite specifications.\n\n9-BLADE APERTURE\nThanks to the combination of its large sensor and large aperture lens, the PowerShot G1 X Mark II can easily be directed to capture images with great or very shallow depth-of-field. And thanks to the PowerShot G1 X Mark II's new 9-blade aperture diaphragm, blurred areas are particularly gorgeous, with subtle detail and blurred forms that appear almost completely circular.\n\nCONTINUOUS SHOOTING GIVES YOU EXACTLY THE SHOT YOU WANT\nFULL RESOLUTION CONTINUOUS SHOOTING AND HIGH SPEED AF\nPowered by the DIGIC 6 Image Processor, the PowerShot G1 X Mark II camera gives you a seamless, pro-like continuous shooting experience that's fully available in P, Tv, Av, M and Auto modes. Shooting and processing are now performed in tandem, eliminating buffering time to deliver high shooting speeds. With the significantly higher AF speed due to the newly improved Canon 1.5-inch CMOS sensor, streamlined processing also makes the camera's High Speed AF the fastest in Canon compact camera history, achieving focus nearly the instant the camera is aimed. With no separate mode setting and no reduction in image quality, you can freeze brilliant action shots with ease.\n\nEOS-LEVEL CREATIVE CONTROL\nSHOOTING AND RECORDING MODES INCLUDING 14-BIT RAW + JPEG\nThe PowerShot G1 X Mark II offers a host of shooting and recording modes ranging from fully automatic to fully manual, plus Full HD movies and full-resolution high speed continuous shooting. The camera recognizes 58 shooting situations, automatically optimizing settings for achieving the highest quality shots on the go. Alternatively, you can exert complete creative control over the look and feel of your images. 14-bit signal processing, just as in EOS-series cameras, gives images notably rich detail and smooth gradation, and RAW images are available in a choice of 3:2 or 4:3 aspect ratios. Compared with 12-bit processing, 14-bit offers a 4x increase in RAW data for a visible impact, giving images rich detail in both highlights and shadows as well as smoother, more natural tonal gradation for outstanding image quality.\n\nCAPTURE THE NIGHT SKY LIKE NEVER BEFORE\nSTAR SHOOTING MODES\nStarry skies were formerly out of reach to all but experienced SLR camera users, but star shooting modes on the PowerShot G1 X Mark II camera make these wonderfully impressive images accessible to all. With just a tripod and simple settings, you can capture exquisite Star Nightscapes, Star Trails, Star Time-Lapse Movies and Star Portrait. The new Star Portrait mode, which consecutively takes two shots of the subject plus one of the night sky and then merges them into a single image, enables beautiful portraits with a starry background. The modes can be performed fully automatic or with manual controls for extra versatility. Support functions including Night Display, Color Adjustment and Star Emphasis make any starry sky easier to capture.\n\nEASILY ATTACHED, ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE\nOPTIONAL ELECTRONIC VIEWFINDER EVF-DC1\nNew for the PowerShot G1 X Mark II, the optional Electronic Viewfinder EVF-DC1 offers a high-resolution view and displays all shooting information in a brilliant and easily attached accessory. Mounted on the accessory shoe, the electronic viewfinder has a high eyepoint \u2013 perfect for those wearing glasses \u2013 and has a high precision XGA resolution LCD with 2.36 Million dots and displays the exact information found on the camera's LCD screen. It offers a dioptric adjustment range of -3.0 to +1.0 and can tilt up to 90\u00c2\u00b0, helping to enable steady shooting even on an angle. The camera can be directed to switch automatically between the LCD and the viewfinder with an eyepiece sensor, or can be set manually with a dedicated button. Brightness can be set independently from the camera's screen, perfect for discreet operation.\n\n\nADDITIONAL FEATURES\n31 AF POINTS\nWith 31 easily selectable focus points arranged in an expanded, wide pattern across the image plane, the PowerShot G1 X Mark II focuses with admirable speed and precision. With smaller focus frame sizes, AiAF focus is more accurate, and with an expanded focus area, the camera has the ability to track focus, accurately and quickly, even when subjects are off center. The PowerShot G1 X Mark II also supports 1-point and Touch AF.\n\nNEW SELECTABLE MULTIPLE ASPECT RATIO\nWhereas the original PowerShot G1 X was only able to record RAW images in the 4:3 aspect ratio, the PowerShot G1 X Mark II is equipped with a new Aspect Ratio Function that can switch between 3:2 and 4:3 aspect ratios. When shooting in ratios of 3:2 and 16:9, the PowerShot G1 X Mark II will record a RAW file in a 3:2 ratio, and when shooting in 4:3, 1:1 and 4:5, the camera will record a RAW in 4:3.\n\nINTELLIGENT IS\nIt's easy to capture clear, steady images with the PowerShot G1 X Mark II, even in low light without using a tripod. That's because the camera is equipped with Canon's innovative Intelligent IS. The system automatically analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation \u2013 allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. For stills, the system selects from Normal IS, Panning IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Tripod modes. When shooting video, the system selects from Dynamic IS, Powered IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and active Tripod IS modes. New icons clearly mark the image stabilization mode, whether you're shooting still images or video.\n\nStill Image Shooting Normal IS Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills. Panning IS Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement. Macro (Hybrid) IS Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting. Tripod When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed. Video Recording Dynamic IS Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking. Powered IS Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified. Macro (Hybrid) IS Corrects for motion blur that is likely to occur when shooting video while walking. Also compensates for the shift-type camera shake common in macro shooting. Active Tripod IS When shooting video while using a tripod, the image stabilization is active to compensate for slight camera shake. COMPATIBLE WITH CANON SPEEDLITE FLASHES\nThe PowerShot G1 X Mark II digital camera gives you access to exciting EOS accessories including all of the Canon Speedlite flashes, long revered by professional photographers. The high output of Speedlite flashes brings out the depth and texture of your images in full, natural beauty. The ultra-lightweight Canon Speedlite 270EX II is a compact, high-performance flash unit that's fun and easy to use, with adjustable illumination angle and guide number; the versatile Speedlite 320EX features an LED light on the front of the flash body that can be used to illuminate nearby subjects in dim light, ideal for shooting video.\n\nHIGH DYNAMIC RANGE SCENE MODE\nShooting in high contrast environments can often result in photos with overexposed and underexposed sections. In order to tackle this problem, Canon developed the High Dynamic Range shooting mode to make shooting even more intuitive. Under High Dynamic Range the camera will shoot three different exposures in succession (underexposed, overexposed and normal) and then merge them into a single image. Underexposed areas are combined with the overexposed and vice versa, resulting in an evenly detailed image with flattering shadows and highlights. The PowerShot G1 X Mark II allows you to use this mode without a tripod and features four sub-modes in addition to Natural \u2013 Art Standard, Art Vivid, Art Bold and Art Embossed \u2013 which provide striking effects that add to the creativity of your compositions.",
