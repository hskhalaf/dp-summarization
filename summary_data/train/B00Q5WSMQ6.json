      "verdict": "The Adidas Response Trail Boost runs and works as intended. While it may have a rather unique design, the upper delivers the kind of support, flexibility, and structure that trail runners usually look for in their neutral trail shoes. The Response Boost has decent arch support, cushioning, and unbelievable grip on almost all kinds of surfaces, including the road despite the heavily-lugged outsole.",
      "pros": [
        "The superb comfort of the Response Trail Boost begins right out of the box, according to a large number of comments",
        "Some runners believe the durability is better than average trail shoes",
        "A good number of reviews consider the shoe as an excellent investment",
        "The traction provided by the Continental rubber compound is a proven commodity in the business",
        "The multi-directional lugs make uphill and downhill running a little easier",
        "It is quite nimble and quick on technical trail, as noted by a couple of testers",
        "Many users raved about its ability to tackle the trail and road",
        "Several reviews appreciated the wide toe box",
        "Adidas uses a very breathable mesh in the Response Boost"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "The shoe could use some weight reduction, observed some runners",
        "Others noted that the design looks strange because of the seatbelt-like overlays"

I went on a 6 mile walk and felt like my shoes had been broken in, they are super comfortable!! Highly recommend these shoes! I didn't give five stars only because they run a bit large. I was going to exchange them, but they didn't have a size 9 in stock so I decided to keep them. Plus, it's always better to have a hiking shoe a bit larger then too small when he comes to hiking shoes from my experience.",

People often think I put on two different shoes , but I love telling them I bought them that way. I ran a 5K in them right out the box( usually a no-no in the world of running), but I had no issues. It cushions your feet protects your ankles really well. I would've given a 5 but I originally bought a 8.5, I returned for a 8 . The shoe does run a little large so be careful with the sizing.",

Normal summer day - no socks, no problem! The sole is the secret weapon against fatigue! It cushions each step regardless of the surface, wet or dry.. I luv the comfort, support and looks of this shoe. I purchased a second pair of Adidas that I also wear. However, I will need to order a new pair of these shoes to have when I need them.",

In fact, I have to say that this is the most comfortable athletic shoe that I have ever worn.",
