The cold weather model does indeed have flexible cables which stay flexible - they feel like 8mm plug wires. I've used it in 5 degree F weather with ease. CTEK recommends 20Ah as a line of delineation between small battery charge rate and larger ones, so I use the car (large) setting. Also, can choose between standard lead-acid and AGMrates, mine being AGM. Great.",

Only gripe is all cable stay flexible when cold except the pigtails that attaches to the battery. For the price they need to use the same flexible wire for the battery pigtails as they use for the rest of it. Have to watch where you set the unit while in use as it can get rather hot, don\u2019t set on anything plastic or painted.

Little note that makes no difference, when reconditioning mode is used, depending on the car you drive, in my case BMW sedan, the computer does not understand the battery charge drop and may shut off some of the electronics like gps tracker plugged in the obd2 port (if you have one) granted that most people may not have one. It may also shut off other components that may be on stand by. It seems to me it does not cause any harm but you be the judge of it depending on the kind of gadget you may believe you need on 24/7.",

I bought the accessory kit for the first one, which has a cigarette lighter plug adapter - works great for the car. No need to use alligator clamps on the battery.
