      "text": "I purchased my first Klipsch Heresy speakers in the mid 1970's. They are hands down some of the very best speakers on the planet. The Groove is no exception. It sounds absolutely magnificent. It packs a wallop on the clear and crisp lows. The higher end of the spectrum is better than OK although it could stand a bit beefing up. I hooked my iPod 160GB classic to my new Groove and it sounds spectacular. It's small in stature but kind of heavy. I'm very happy with my new purchase and would not hesitate recommending it to my friends.",

      "text": "Update 10/11/19 - The speaker is still going strong and I still love it! This speaker packs a lot of sound into a little package. The highs are crisp and clear, the midrange isn't muddy - the only possible complaint is that the bass isn't really heavy, which you shouldn't really expect for a small portable speaker. It's nice and sturdy, holds a charge a good long time, and sounds great. I bounce the speaker back and forth between my home office (where it's played very clearly at low volumes) and my kitchen (*turns to 11*). Sounds awesome in both places, at all volumes.

Bought one for my wife since her oontz angle broke. A few $$ more but god what a difference. She linked hers to Bluetooth in the next room and I couldn\u2019t believe the fullness and quality of sound. The oontz is a nice portable device but it\u2019s not in the same league.

Only thing that might be an issue is that while this is a rechargable Bluetooth speaker, that would make most people assume this speaker is very portable. It is definitely portable, but it does have a bit of weight to it and that might not be as good for some. Especially backpackers that need to think of both weight and size for their packs. Id look elsewhere if that is what you are concerned with. Otherwise, this is going to be a nice shelf speaker for me.",

Has a nice rubber band going around it to stop it from sliding. Pairing is quick and easy after the first time. I turn it on and within about 10 seconds it's paired itself to my phone.
