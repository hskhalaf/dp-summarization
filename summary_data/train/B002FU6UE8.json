Blue lens looks amazing, but the colors are not as vibrant as with the grey lens, there is a slight blue hue at the bottom of the lens in certain light, and also I noticed the blue lens scratches a little easier. Overall still great glasses that I would recommend to anybody. 4 star only because they scratch easily, and I only use the Maui Jim case to clean them.",

If I have a complaint, I can't say I love the new foldable case - it's a cool idea but in execution, it's harder to use.. but.. if you're travelling really light, I could see it be nice so when not in use ,you can fold it flat and throw it in a pretty tight packed bag.

I really like the rubberish nose clamps - they are soft and make the sunglasses feel weightless. They look good, don't scratch easily, and store neatly. I used to buy Oakley A Frames but traded to these when a friend showed them to me. It's been 3 years now and the only reason I have to replace them now is because I lost them in the surf at the beach.",

Starts 'loosening up' around 1.5 years so that you start thinking its getting close to time to replace or send to Maui Jim's for maintenance. It costs me $85 to get a replacement once before and they had pretty good customer service. I haven't needed it for awhile but I have heard that their customer service has declined. I'll see (hopefully no sooner than a few years) if that is true. For now, pleased enough with these to get another pair (after my last pair was stolen at the airport)",

Other than that I just love them and they protect my eyes very well. I need superb protection in sunny Texas with macular enema in one eye.",

I tried lens wipes and specialty sunglass cleaner but they were impossible to keep clean. I've previously worn Oakleys for years and have never had this problem so I know it wasn't something I was doing wrong. Alas, one sunny day, I accidentally dropped them 2 feet and the pavement dented the lens so bad that they are not wearable. Expensive sunglassss should be able to withstand gentle drops without too much physical damage.",
