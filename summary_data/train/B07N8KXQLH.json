The screen is clear, bright and it's easy to use with one hand. The camera performance was better than expected with good colour on the outdoor shots and the indoor shots taken with good light were also good. Shots in low light were better than expected but not as good as more expensive phones with some visible grain. Both photos were taken indoors one in day light and the other in artificial light with HDR on. As for the battery I've been getting an average 2 days from a single charge with average use.",

I wasnt expecting a massive gain in specification from the Nokia, more a gentle evolution but versus the 7 plus, this is a regression of build exterior build quality, processor performance, battery life and terrible camera quality.

The battery life was a big concern at first but I realised that it just needed a few charging cycles before performance was as advertised. Great screen and sound performance. The design is nice and modern. In fact it often gets mistaken for an IPhone X which I guess is a complement considering it costs 10x less! All in all very happy and can see me having this easily for the next couple years.",
