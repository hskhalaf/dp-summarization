With forty years of veganism, and fifty of Organic gardening and enthusiasm, my product choices have evolved with regard to standards of excellence. For this sort of product, freshness, rawness and palatability are paramount. Organic sourcing is important, but I've had more than my share of 100% Organic-sourced products that were not fresh and showed significant signs of questionable quality control. This mix is partly Organically sourced, is delicious, is fresh, is raw and is priced right. And my mouth is watering thinking about it.",

I'd never had goji berries and had no idea what to expect, but they are a superfood, and delicious as well; not as tart as cranberries, so they sort of \"take up the middle\" in taste. It's a little expensive for a trail mix, but not for raw nuts. The raw nuts have a different feeling in the mouth, which I prefer, and unlike nut mixes, spares the salt.

Perfect taste and fresh. I tried so hard to put it back to the shelf. Don't miss it if you're looking for healthy food for after-workout supplements.",
