In the 35th week I see very light few tiny marks around my belly bottom but it\u2019s very hard to see for others and I believe by keep using this product even after delivery those small marks will be gone.

This lotion does not have a strong smell and you can feel it stays on and it is quickly absorbed onto the skin.

One suggestion - Always keep the bottle upside down so that you don\u2019t have to put a lot of pressure on the bottle to squeeze the lotion out once it\u2019s close to finish. Thank you COS Naturals ! I would like to surely try the cellulite cream as a part of postnatal repair.",
