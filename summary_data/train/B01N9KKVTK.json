This product appeared to cause the acne to get worse just for a week or so because it pulls all the crap out of your pores and brings them to the surface. I told him to hang in there and not give up, that it WILL work...and it did! He is completely cleared up!! He looks great! The only thing, out of almost 20 products we tried, that worked. Well worth the money.",
