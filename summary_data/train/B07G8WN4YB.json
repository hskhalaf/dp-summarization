What\u2019s great about this mop is that you can make your own solution which I\u2019m thankful for as I have a very active and mobile 8 month old. I wanted something I could use my own, baby safe, cleaning solution. What\u2019s a plus is that there\u2019s a spray bottle attached! That\u2019s what sold me on this one. Plus the mop comes with two pads that are washable! Perfect!",

Mopping floor has never been so easy, as I can just pick up the mop with pre-filled cleaning solution and mop as I spray.",
