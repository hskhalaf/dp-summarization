I went with gray because I'm one of those people that doesn't like pairing black and brown so grey seems like a good compromise. The boots don't look true to color on amazon's site but in person they are a medium-dark standard grey which I was pleased with. Some people said the ankle was not roomy enough or that they were too narrow, which concerned me, but they fit perfectly! So happy I went with these boots. I didn't see a pic of the boot bottom on here so I've included one so you can see it has substantial traction.",

The shoes feel like they are made from cardboard and the toes are so hard that it's like they are made for construction work except that they would NEVER withstand the rigors of working, not even walking. I don't think these were really made my Timberland. Seem like mock-ups to me. :-(",

I don't know why a reputable company would put such cheap insoles into their boots.

My last pair, which lasted me a decade of common wear, was the exact same size and color, except the inside was white, thick fleece instead of the thin black layer in these. The inside feels noticeably thinner and therefore does not feel as cushiony as I hoped--which is one of the main reasons I love them. Despite this, the boots are still so nice that I am still giving it 5 stars. Also, the last boots came with a leather tag that dangled. The fleece roll down boots listed in the official Timberland website all had them too. I thought it was adorable. Why didn't I get it with this pair?",

They're also flexible enough to drive a car normally, unlike some of the other more traditional snow boots. I do agree, if you're going to walk a fair distance, you might want to add a cushiony sole insert; the inside sole isn't uncomfortable, just somewhat stiff which might be bothersome for a long walk. For the time being, they're just fine for me; very happy with this purchase.",

I think if only I could have loosened the laces a bit more (which wasn't possible), to allow some extra room to slide my feet in then it wouldn't be a problem.

      "text": "Very nice, warm brown boot that I like to wear fully laced up. Haha, I have such a thing for brown shoes. My first time wearing a chunkier shoe and it is great for traversing rain puddle days and for December when I travelled to Washington D.C. Also my first time wearing a lace-up boot and I don't mind tying them up or loosening them. My feet are wide due to bunions from running (I got the wide size), so walking around in these boots in D.C. every night for a week, my feet got sore. They are more broken in by now and I am satisfied with these boots. Good job, Timberland.",

The only thing to watch out for is that the suede on the top is not easy to clean-- so make sure to get any mud off them straight away!",

Stain on the fur inside of the same boot. Also what look like grass or mulch pieces. Other boots tongue looks work, and there are already creases on the boot where it looks like it's been turned down several time. Very odd too see such poor craftsmanship from Timberland, and poor quality control from amazon. These should have been checked before sent to a customer. Time to only order shoes from Zappos",
