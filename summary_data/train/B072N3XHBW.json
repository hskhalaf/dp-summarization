The unit is very sturdy though I wish the floor leveling system were the more traditional screw type - the one provided works, but is limited in adjustment. Truthfully, if you need to adjust things that much, you should find a more level place to put the pedestal. The three head option is nice, though I've only used the roller and flat stand. Easy to put together once you decipher the instructions. Overall, I recommend this unit and have purchased two for my shop.",
