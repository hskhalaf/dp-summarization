The instructions say I could have sat it on top of the snow/ice and let it melt through but I didn\u2019t want to wait for that since the top had a couple inches of ice and I was trying to save the fish from dying. So far, so good. The fish are alive and like to hang out near the de-icer. I also like that the cord is really long!",
