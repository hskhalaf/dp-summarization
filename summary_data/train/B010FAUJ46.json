And, it was only halfway decent at the lowest of the zooms (20x). When I moved it to 60x zoom, the field gets so small that it's difficult to look through for long. It does magnify, but, not with good clarity. So, not happy with the overall design. It's not bad, it's not great. Returned it.",

      "text": "I've seen scopes that cost several hundred dollars, and they don't seem to have anything on this spotter. I can look across the city from my deck and read store signs that are several miles away. The moon, stars, etc., all easy to look at in detail. On the range you can check your hits at 100 yds easy. And it has a case, lens covers, tripod, locks into place in every direction just like the high-dollar scopes. And if I drop it off the balcony I didn't lose my whole paycheck. :-) Highly recommend",

I focused in on an old weathered picket fence at the back of the range. I could make out the locations of the nails in the pickets at 100 yards. I'm sure there are better spotting scopes out there, but this scope is well worth the price and then some. No wonder it's Amazon's best seller!",

Target 150 yards out and on maximum magnification view was perfect. Was able to see all my hits easily.

We could very easily see vapor trails even with high winds and busy mirages. The eye relief is a bit close at 60x, so I needed to remove my eye-protection to use it, but that was a minor issue.",

Don\u2019t expect pic resolution to stay strong out at 60x...it\u2019s scientifically impossible without the glass used in the units that cost several hundred dollars. Very good in the 20-40x range.",

The 45 degree angle made sighting very comfortable once on a good tripod, I had to get a taller one versus what came with the package. The most prominent feedback was the brightness of the view versus other spotting telescopes. I haven't tried it on wet conditions to test how waterproof it is. We'll update should those conditions be needed. I don't think I'll dip it just to test it. :)",
