My boys LOVE the different colors of the board. They\u2019ve had drawing boards before, but they were just black and white. The four color sections really enhanced their creativity with the scenes they were drawing. They also thought the magnets were so much fun. I love the ability to stand it up on a table as well. I highly recommend this product. I will be buying 3 more so that all three of my boys can have one and we can give one as a gift.",
