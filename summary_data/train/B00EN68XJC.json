The first problem I have is that the period button is somewhat close the the home button, so sometimes you accidentally activate the home button in the middle of typing a text message. It can get kind of annoying, but it isn't a huge deal. I LOVE the little infrared controller in this device that allows me to control my tv. It's unique in that manner. The second problem I have is that it takes a long time to charge. Everything else in this phone is perfect.",

The camera takes quality pictures in good light and does pretty well in the dark. I've dropped it a thousand times and it still looks great, the screen has resisted scratching. Even after 2 years the battery stays charged all day even with regular and sometimes heavy use. I really can't say anything bad about this phone, it's far exceeded my expectations. I'd highly recommend it (or the newer version) to anyone considering it.",

I cannot get the GPS to be functionally useful and Google maps works very poorly despite having the proper settings turned on. Also I've had issues when speaking on the phone - if I don't remember to shut the screen off, I inadvertently end up switching on the mute button, or even worse the speaker function which then blasts my eardrum. The latter issue I can cope with, but am really bummed about the poor navigation as I've really relied on this feature with previous smartphones. Given all the other good reviews, I suspect it's just an issue with my phone. Nonetheless would not purchase again.",

    "description": "The HTC One (M7) is ready to reshape your smartphone experience with a live home screen that streams all of your favorite content, a photo gallery that comes to life, and dual frontal stereo speakers. This 4G LTE-enabled Android smartphone also features an UltraPixel 4MP camera with enhanced low-light performance. The HTC One's full metal body features a slim, solid construction with tapered edges for a satisfying grip, and it's complemented by a brilliant 4.7-inch Full HD 1080p display that resists scratches and reduces glare. It's powered by a 1.7 GHz quad-core processor, and it's packed with 32GB of storage and 2GB of RAM for excellent multitasking. This device is also equipped with quadband GSM and WCDMA modes for international use. \n\n\n\n\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\nCrafted with a distinct zero-gap aluminum unibody, the HTC One is ready to reshape your smartphone experience with a live home screen that streams all of your favorite content, a photo gallery that comes to life, and dual frontal stereo speakers. This 4G LTE-enabled smartphone runs Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean), which combines with HTC Sense to create an amazing mobile experience that's been re-imagined from the ground up.\n\nThe HTC One ensures you're never out of touch with your world (view larger). The HTC One's full metal body features a slim, solid construction with tapered edges for a satisfying grip, and it's complemented by a brilliant 4.7-inch Full HD 1080p display that resists scratches and reduces glare. It's powered by a 1.7 GHz quad-core processor, and it's packed with 32 GB of storage and 2 GB of RAM for excellent multitasking. \n\nHTC ULTRAPIXEL CAMERA WITH HTC ZOE: YOUR PHOTOS BROUGHT TO LIFE\nThe HTC UltraPixel Camera redefines how you capture, relive, and share your most precious moments. With this innovative camera technology, you'll be able to quickly shoot vivid, true-to-life images with a wide range of colors, even in low light conditions -- it lets in 300 percent more light, enabling you to take photos indoors without a flash. And this is accomplished not by increasing the number of megapixels in the camera, but by engineering a more advanced CMOS Sensor, ISP, and optical lens system that captures significantly more light than most 8 or 13 megapixel cameras.\n\nWith HTC Zoe mode, press the shutter and the HTC One automatically captures up to 20 photos and a 3-second video -- including the last second of images before you tapped the picture button. It can also create a 30-second Zoe Highlight film from each event comprised of Zoes, photos, and videos with professionally designed cuts, transitions, and effects -- just ad your choice of pre-loaded soundtrack. These highlight videos can be remixed or set to different themes, and can be easily shared on social networks, email, and other services.\n\nMulti-axis optical image stabilization for the rear camera also helps ensure video footage smoother whether stationary or on the move. Other features and effects include enhanced 360-degree panorama, time sequencing, and object removal. Self portraits and video are also easily captured via the front-facing camera, which supports 1080p video capture.\n\nHTC BLINKFEED: A PERSONAL LIVE STREAM ON YOUR HOME SCREEN\nAt the heart of the HTC One experience is HTC BlinkFeed, which transforms your home screen into a single live stream of the things that are most important to you --from sports and technology to games and fashion and even your favorite social network feeds.
