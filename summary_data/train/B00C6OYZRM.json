I would definitely recommend this phone because the size is not too small and not too large. It is extremely lightweight until you put a cover on it.",

For the money, it would be hard to beat. I really wish it was rooted so I could delete the Verizon thrash apps but, I won't risk doing that as it would be only a convenience.",
