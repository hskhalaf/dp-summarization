Unit ships with 1080i as the default resolution, and when it is changed to 1080p the display pops, flashes and eventually the unit powers off. 1080p with the older BD370 works fine on TV1, but not with the BD550, so I know it's not a TV or cable problem. LG customer service suggested I leave it at 720p, but no thanks, I want a machine that dos what it says it will do.",

I use the pass through feature for my HDMI connection to the TV so that the audio output goes directly to the digital input of my dolby receiver without extra wiring. Menus are pretty simple and setup is a snap. Cons: Network features are fine theoretically, but the processor in the player is underpowered for this function. There is a tendency to lock up if the internet feature you are using has the slightest delay or glitch in the signal. All in all a great BD Player and the selection of widgets is generous but don't expect the same internet efficiency you would from a PC.",

The streaming video from Netflix is very useful and easy to use (I'm using a wired FIOS connection), with good but not great video quality. I've seen the same stutter viewing streaming Netflix, but even more so. I chalk up the Netflix artifacts to the challenges of video over the Internet.",

I haven't played Blu-ray movies on it, but with regular DVDs I have noticed that it hesitates slightly before reacting. Ex. If I push \"Menu\" it will not smoothly transition to the menu screen but instead play sound for about a second while the screen pauses before transitioning to the menu screen.

This player will rarely play a disc from start to finish without some sort of a hiccup or an all out freeze. Very frustrating. It's going back to Amazon and I really don't recommend this player unless you are playing a brand-new disc every single time.",

I have no problem with the update now. One little issue, the player does not remeber when the disc was stopped last. So, after each time you stop and eject the disc, the next time it will play from the beginning. You can't beat the price as well.",
