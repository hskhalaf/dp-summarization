As an adult, I can figure this out and mitigate any issues but the pack is pretty small and it is being used by a brand new Boy Scout. He didn't understand as much how to line up the zipper correctly before opening and closing...so the material ripped. With that said, it still shouldn't be that difficult to open and close a zippered pouch. [...]",

The stitching.. not so much. also the adjustments do not hold on most of the straps. In my experience it isnt worth bringing on real backpacking trips.. only for quick couple miles in type of thing.

Most of the opening is sewn down with the straps so the entrance is very narrow. Only other real complaint is the water bottle pockets at the bottom are limited by the side pockets. So 1 liter bottles can't fit in there because they hit the side pockets in the middle.",

The straps where you adjust the back starts to make noise just after 1 day hiking. The straps stretched to a point where when they rub they make an annoying noise. Other than that, it's a great bag",

The padded section is 27\" long and doesn't cover the points of your hips in front if you are an average teen or adult. Due to the thickness of the padding, which is fine, the belt barely covered a 22\" distance from hip point to hip point measured around the back, wearing only a T shirt. Heavier, cold weather clothing would make this fit situation worse. Back to the drawing board!",
