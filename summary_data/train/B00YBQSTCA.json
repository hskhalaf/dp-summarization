I shredded just a little of the roast to see how the claws handled the job. Very efficient and faster than using two forks. The fact they can go in the dishwasher and never rust or corrode is great. Would highly recommend the Grillaholics Meat Claws, they are perfect for lifting meat out of the roaster or off the grill and the tines are sharp and sturdy for shredding.",
