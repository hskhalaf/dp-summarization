      "text": "This trash bag is perfect for my 2001 Honda CRV. It is large enough to hold plenty of trash, stays in place thanks to the velcro on the bottom and has a nice, sturdy cover. Fits perfect in front of the tray console. My only suggestion would be to make the lid 4 sided. It does have velcro on the flap that overlaps, but the sides peak out. The little bungie bag on the front is perfect for holding my garage door opener. Overall very happy with this. Would but again, recommend if you are looking for something besides a tiny little trash can/bag.",

Riding in the passenger side of the vehicle, it has cut down on some of the legroom but not enough that makes it uncomfortable for me. It's worked out very well so far and it appears to be a good-quality item. Very happy with this purchase!",

The reason it isn't 5 stars is because the flap doesn't really close. A minor gripe since the lid doesn't flap around or anything. And because the little metal struts that hold it in place (they snap in, it's hard to explain) push out through the fabric sheaths. Again, not a deal breaker. Bottom line: works well, big enough, stays put.",

It Velcros to the floor so it doesn't move around, it contains any liquid or damp trash if it gets in there, it collapses for easy storage, and it holds a surprising amount of stuff. It's certainly better than my previous grocery store bag and throw it in the back seat approaches. I have a 2012 Sonic and put it in the back between the two seats, but in such a way that I don't have to turn around and look at it in case I'm putting a fast food wrapper in there or something.",

If your wanting ease of tossing something away check out the High road stable mate large trash can that has support at the top and bottom with a magnet lid. Its also bigger and the price is almost the same as this one.",

With 2 sons (3&4)I was always ending up with leaky sippy cups on my floor mats. Now, we throw all of our trash in it, as well as, plates, cups, and anything else that has crumbs, food, drinks, etc. that used to clutter my car! At the end of each day when we get home, I simply grab the litterbag and empty it in the household trash and rinse it out. It's completely leak proof! The velcro at the bottom ensures that it doesn't flip over...LOVE IT!",
