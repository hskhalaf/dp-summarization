The updates routinely crash the system and support is nonexistent. Live chat never works. The newest app update is horrible. Just installed the new Arlo doorbell which also does not work. Battery life in the cameras is down to 5 days tops. Just a useless product at this point.",

My wife leaves in the morning it will pick up her car leaving. Mine sits right next to it and nothing. She gets home it only picks up after she gets out of the car. EXTREMELY DIS-APPOINTED in this product. Suggested it to four of my co-workers and they purchased it right after I did. Now I have nothing but a bunch of crap that works once in a while.

The camera can't really capture any license plates from 60~80ft away, and it can't really capture faces from 20~30ft away. A real shame because the rest of the concept of the camera is great. There is a significant picture and audio delay though, this is not ideal as well... almost 2 seconds. Makes having a conversation over camera not good... and therefore cannot really be a substitute for a ring doorbell or anything like that.",

Once WiFi goes out, cameras stop working but as long as you have WiFi... you have cameras! Good over all... would buy again!",

But these cameras have pleasantly surprised me. They are definitely clear, respond well when they detect motion, and are VERY easy to setup. My gripe with these is that although they are clear, you can't really see someone's face as clearly as you'd like. It doesn't bother me that much, but if that's something critical to you, I'd suggest going with the Arlo Pro 2 cameras instead.",
