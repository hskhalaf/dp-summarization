Though, not surprising, the slide was assembled backwards, the instrument came with trumpet valve oil, which is not going to work well for a trombone slide, and the case doesn't seem to fit the slide quite right. Every time I close it, the spit valve is smashed against the hard opposite side of the case. There is no cut-out for it. My solution is to open the flap for the mouthpiece compartment and close it that way, keeping the mouthpiece in the outside pocket. I don't want to damage the spit valve spring over time.",

      "text": "Yes, it's inexpensive. But it was WAY better quality than what was expected. Purchased this for six-grader in their 3rd year in band. It sounds great, and case is light and very nice quality. And yes, slide needs to be greased prior to playing. Tuning is fine, and easy to do (as it should be tuned every time it is pulled out of case to play, like every other trombone). All-in-all a great purchase for a student instrument.",
