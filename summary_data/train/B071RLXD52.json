      "text": "I was replacing an age-old egg-beater of which the casting had finally given out on the handle. Probably 40 years old used weekly at a minimum. This device, while seemingly really efficient, does not seem to have internals which are going to hold up. When I try to beat a dozen eggs or so, I can hear and feel slippage in the internal gears, The viscosity seems to overwhelm the beater. Chose this one on reviews, and the fact that all the beaters of similar design to my old one have horrible reviews. Can't anyone make a decent egg beater any more?",

However it is very difficult use on thick batters, the beaters themselves are of thinner composition than most electric mixers.",
