This product is comfortable for both of us. I can give her the extra support she needs (especially squating to do her buisness and on stairs) without hurting my back and she can still do some so she\u2019s not loosing all of her muscle mass! Update 1/6/2019 We\u2019ve used this 2-3 times a day for a year and it\u2019s still amazing. The Velcro is slightly worn but otherwise it\u2019s still as good as it was a year ago.",

This works good for walks in order to keep the dog somewhat active. If your looking for something to lift the dog then I would recommend something that supports the front and hind legs. I can use the sling to lift his hind legs and then use my other arm to lift him from the front and that seems to work.",
