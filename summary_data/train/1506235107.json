      "text": "I bought this SAT & the Kaplan ACT books for my grandson who is graduating next year & needed a study guide for these two separate test. We are not sure what college he'll be attending we thought best to buy both study guides. What I did like upon reviewing each of the guides is comprehensive study for subjects that he would be tested on. Additionally, that there is also online tutorial & tutoring if needed. I am sure that tutoring is a additional price. But, overall I think that the book could assist my grandson in scoring high on either test",
