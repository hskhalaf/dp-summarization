Granted, I was nervous at first and although, through my healthy diet, I could probably find some flavor in cardboard, this protein was a pleasant surprise. This is thicker than proteins like whey, but I liked the taste. I was worried that I would be eating the equivalent of a bowl of peas splashed with vanilla flavor. Not so, this was pretty good. I actually bought the chocolate flavor recently as well. Certainly worth a try!",
