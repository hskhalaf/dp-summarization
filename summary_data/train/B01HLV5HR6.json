      "text": "I am so impressed by these goggles! I just went skiing in Vermont on one of the coldest days of the year and my friends-who all had Oakley or other more expensive goggles-had problems with extreme fogging or even icing over of their goggles. Mine were crystal clear the whole time and not foggy at all! Also I was worried about the blue reflective lens casting a weird blue color over everything but the color from the inside is pretty much no different from the real world! Recommended to my friends and would 100% recommend to anyone looking for a good deal that is worth it. Also they look super cool which is an added bonus!",

Now I don't have to spend a fortune on getting special prescription inserts that would be typically needed to fit inside standard ski goggles. I like these goggles!",

They have UV protection and clear visibility. These are the perfect goggles for beginners or the occasional skier.",

That is true, but ... my glasses have smaller lenses with narrow frames. They do fit inside the goggles, but it is a somewhat snug fit, and the glasses stay in the goggles on removal.

After peeling the lining off and trying them on, the product fit PERFECT and if you are worried that they may look large on your face, they won't. Perfect size in my opinion. Goggles band is also comfortable and not too restricting. Adjustable band. If you are new to snowboarding/skiing, grab these. You wont regret it!",

I wore them for a whole day of skiing at Crystal Mountain, WA and I\u2019m very happy with them: - Cushioning is good for the surrounding areas of your eye - Size is a little tight at the front if you have a face cover on. I tried to adjust the length and the back but never got it to fit perfectly - Sun protection is really good considering it was a very sunny day (no clouds). I hadn\u2019t realized how good it was until I took them off outside and my eyes hurt when I was talking to my friend. Would definitely recommend!",

One more issue is the very strong, and very unpleasant, chemical smell from the plastic frame when I first opened the package (I hate to think what the factory floor must be like).
