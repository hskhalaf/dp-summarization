But I having used binoculars all my life I question the focus range because I thought images would be closer when using these binoculars. I was told through customer comments these were excellent for bird-watching which meant you needed binoculars for close-up viewing. I shall enjoy these binoculars very much but I think they fail me as far as surveillance use.",
