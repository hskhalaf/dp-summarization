I attached the large hard fish (it\u2019s wrapped in thick twine) to it and it\u2019s even better...It\u2019s been a month and the wand did break in half, but that\u2019s probably my fault for tying something to it and also being pretty rough with it. I also like that there are a lot of toys to rotate every few days. Maya also likes the little rainbow colored ball and the big roly ball with the mouse attached to it.",

However, there are many items like the balls that I can leave in their cage. I\u2019ve had these almost a week and the toys have held up well to 3 six week old kittens.

One will run in the tunnel and another will pounce on the one inside and that cat will launch out like a cannon ball and another will run in. Also the kitty snake wand might as well be kitty crack. It shimmies on the the ground and my kitten will pounce and take the entire toy from me as her \"kill.\" Enough toys for three cats to share and rotate. I might have to invest in a second tunnel though....",

There are so many I have spares which is good for when she bats something somewhere impossible to recover it or the dog steals something. Has made her a very happy cat.",

Some of these toys would cost 3 to 4 dollars by themselves in a pet shop or grocery store, so these are a real bargain. The little tunnel is pretty nice also, it is lightweight and a bit small, but our cats like it as much as any other they have had. An extra feature that this tunnel has is a toy hanging from the top of one end, they like to play with it when they are in the tunnel. This is an adorable set and a great deal! I highly recommend it!",
