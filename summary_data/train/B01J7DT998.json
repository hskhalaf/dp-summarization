There is a rubber backing which I thought was strange when I opened them yesterday, but I went off the description and put them out. THESE ARE NOT OUTSIDE CARPETS. Don't be fooled!!",

If it gets wet, it needs to be hung to dry as it has a rubber back. Or when rain is predicted, I just roll it up in front of my door so it is protected. I think if it laid there wet on the concrete, it would start to deteriorate. Anyway, still a beautiful color and I get compliments on it.",

    "description": "Size:7'6x10'The traditional stripe gets and update in this artist rendition that features bold color and blurred strokes. Perfect for a festive outdoor space, this design is sure to make a splash. These rugs are made from synthetic fibers that resist staining, fading, mold and mildew. Our outdoor rugs are made from nylon that resists staining, fading, and mold/mildew. Our unique marine backing application on our nylon outdoor rugs allows the water to pass through the rug instead of absorbing it, much like the carpet you find on boats. Printed on the same machines that manufacture one of the world\u2019s leading brands of printed carpet, this rug is extremely durable and vibrant. This technology allows the use of multiple colors to create a rug that is wonderfully designed and applicable to any room in your home. Crafted completely in the USA, this rug is made from durable stain resistant nylon.",

Vacuum your rug regularly to remove loose soil, taking special care when vacuuming fringe and edges. Some throw rugs, especially for bathrooms, can be washed in your home washing machine.
