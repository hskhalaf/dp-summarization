It seems to be good quality and the lettering shouldn\u2019t fade or wear soon, but will update the review if that changes.",

I now feel better knowing he has a warning on him pertaining to his medical problem, and I know he does too! I feel anyone with a medical problem should wear one. It was inexpensive and totally worth the minimal cost. Highly recommend......",
