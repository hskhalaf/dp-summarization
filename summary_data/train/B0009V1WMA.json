I have to hold the 1 to set the 8, then hold the 1and 8 to set the 5 and finally have to hold the 185 to set the 6. Otherwise they move together. I received the lock in Jan 18.",

I tried to spray some WD40 in the lock to help free up any possible corrosion which didn\u2019t help at all. The lock tries to lock but it never engages and opens right back up when you touch it. I do not recommend this lock at all.",

I like that I can reset the dial. CAUTION - Mine came in packaging that described the default combo ask \"LOCK\", but the dial is numbers. I googled, and also it was 0000 I believe, but that kept me from using it for like 3 minutes when it first arrived.",

The one and only issue is that it tends to freeze up in the winter. Water gets in, freezes, and the lock will not open. I have to pour hot water on/in it, and then it opens up. If you plan to use this lock in an area where it will be exposed to weather, and you need access in the winter, you may want to consider a different lock with some sort of cover or sheath. Otherwise this one works nicely.",

      "text": "Bought two for a farm gate. Quickly discovered it freezes when temps get even just below freezing with no rain or snow as the cause. If frozen and locked, the dials won\u2019t turn. If frozen and unlocked, it won\u2019t latch. Both corroded on the number wheels in a matter of weeks. They are now hard to turn even above freezing. I don\u2019t trust Master Lock anymore after this false advertising. Not for outdoor use. I gave it three stars because it probably works indoors and I like that you can set your own combination.",

As far as the actual padlocked goes, it's great! Holding up really well, even in the rain and next to salt water (no signs of rust yet). This padlock didn't come with the pin tool as described in the instructions so that I can set my own combination. That means it's defaulted to 0-0-0-0 and I can't change it!!!! Amazon won't take it back, either! So now I'm stuck with this $13 piece of paper weight!",
