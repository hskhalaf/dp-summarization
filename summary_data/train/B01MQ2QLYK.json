They are a step between a level one ball (Macgregor level one balls) and a light soft foam baseball. These are great because they are the similar weight to a real hard baseball (also similar weight to the Macgregor level one baseballs) but they are much softer. My son got hit in face after missing a catch and it did not faze him. It keeps him from being scared of the ball. I would highly recommend as a safe practice ball for any kid, especially a beginner.",

They are a good compromise. If your child is still a novice and wants a good ball for easing into \"big kid\" baseball, this is a good ball. Very throwable. Very hittable. Not soft like a Nerf, but also not so hard as to put a kid down if he/she gets inadvertently hit while playing. I plan to buy more of these.",

The official Tee-Balls you can buy at a Sporting Goods shop have a little squish to them, but still a descent weight for hitting and throwing. These are really soft and light. They might be good for a complete beginner, if you're more worried about them getting hurt. They might be good for backyard practice if you are worried about breaking windows. They are a step up from completely squishy sponge balls that you use with a toddler. But I don't think they are adequate enough for Tee-Ball.",

It was that message that gave me that old feeling of home town business. In a day and age where everything is anonymous and impersonal, the message felt close to home. I look forward to teaching my son to play ball (hopefully better than me) and the qualities of being prideful and humble. If he does become the next Griffey or Ted Williams I will certainly update this review. Stay tuned",

They came in quickly, they are packaged nicely, and they seem to have good quality. I have not noticed if the kids have played with these baseballs yet so I am not able to give any testimony as to how well they hold up but they appear to be a good deal.",

      "SAFETY AND PLAYER CONFIDENCE: Training correctly and working hard is key to any beginner's development, but we believe that having FUN and being INJURY FREE is even more important. With Precision Impact's Flex-Balls, kids ages 4-7 can develop the ability to throw and catch baseballs with more confidence with less fear of injury.",
      "REALISTIC FEEL: Besides the \"flexibility\" of the ball, every other aspect of the ball is nearly identical to a real baseball including weight, size, surface feel, and raised seams. They're great for playing Tee Ball also!",
      "HOW FLEXIBLE ARE THE BALLS? By no means are Flex-Balls \"soft\"; a direct hit to the groin will no doubt send even the toughest down to their knees, but they do compress more than a standard baseball. They are similar in firmness to a toned, flexed muscle.",
      "PREMIUM QUALITY & ODOR FREE: Precision Impact Flex-Balls are made of a rubber core with a polyurethane (PU) cover which is of much higher durability than typical PVC leather that most other manufacturers use. Further, our processes do not coat the leather with dangerous and awful smelling chemicals which exists on other brands. Keep your team and loved ones safe from dangerous and toxic materials.",
      "100% SATISFACTION GUARANTEE: Precision Impact Flex-Balls come with a 100% Satisfaction Guarantee. Our customer service is dedicated to addressing any product/service issues and is committed to delivering a 5 star experience for all buyers. If you're not happy with our product, simply return it for a full refund. You really have nothing to lose!"
