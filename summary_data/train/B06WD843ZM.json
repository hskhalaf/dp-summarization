The zoom button has five presets. Press the button once to cycle through them. There is no graduation for zoom. 3. The software needs to be set up properly. (size of photo, length of video, where to store shots on your computer, etc.) in settings. 4. Double-click the 'Snap' button to take a picture. 5. Focus using the thumb-wheel. 6. Replace the cap to keep dust out when not in use. This unit is awesome for the price! The pictures are of a 1878 Silver Dollar, hand held.",

The difficulty is that to get the maximum zoom, you have to have the object right up against the lens cover thing - as close as possible.

This is easier when you use the stand, but if you are using it by hand (say, to magnify things on your dog), it gets very tough to get the right zoom at the right distance. Once you do, though, the images are clear and sharp. Oh, the things you can see close up!!",

In the past I have done this with a handheld loupe which did a fair job but with limited magnification. This USB camera provides far better magnification and the added benefit of providing a picture to the customer. It comes with or you can download various tools from the sellers website but for my use a simple image capture does surfice. Note: Focusing at high levels of magnification will take some patience but it can be done. Very happy with the USB camera and the seller is very responsive to email support.",

Image quality IMO is good enough to justify buying their adjustable stand if an application wants better control of scope position.",

      "text": "I'm waiting for this to break. Not because of appearance but because of how nice it actually is for such a low price! The scope itself is nice in appearance and feel and the stand that comes with it as well. The cord is neat with it's little flip up usb/mini usb connections. I am a little disappointed because anything near the 1000x seems useless. Once you zoom in a certain amount it's just a blurry mess so you don't really get the full capability. It could be user error I suppose but it didn't seem to be. Still happy with it",
