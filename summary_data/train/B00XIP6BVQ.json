The fact that it accepts a micro SD card is important to me because I take so many photos! The phone is actually Platinum Silver, though, not Black. (This model did not come in Black.) It does get very warm when charging, but not an issue so far. I took it to AT&T and they got me up & running in no time. I recommend the H950.",

Not sure if ever get to removing it or if it is even possible without rooting (which is too much hassle for me). i bought it for use with T-Mobile prepaid, it needs T-Mobile APN settings in order for data to work (google it around), but it does seem to show 4G LTE sign after that (which i guess means that it does run at LTE or at least 4G speeds after all, not just 3G). Can't see how anything else can beat it at this price.",

This was resolved by the HIBERNATION MANAGER application. It also seems that several battery charges up to 100% strengthen the battery capacity. The battery now lasts for 2 days with moderate use which is acceptable",
