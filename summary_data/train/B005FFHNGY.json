The dial is extremely easy to read, and the leather band is very comfortable on the wrist. I did receive the watch with the hands misaligned, however, after researching on the web, I was able to reset the watch and it works perfectly. I have included a few pictures with my review so you can see it in person. The last shot was taken with a UV light so you can see the lume (the blue color is from the UV light). I highly recommend this watch to anyone looking for a high quality Swiss made timepiece.",

      "text": "Beautiful watch, hate to part with it, but after a week, it is losing about 20 minutes per day overnight, around midnight, it looks like. Looks like it might have to go back... Update: it turns out the watch came with a weak/fading battery. After replacing it, no more overnight loss of time. [In the hours before & after midnight, when the date switches, the watch uses the most energy. A week battery would slow down operation, resulting in lost time.] Now the watch isn't just beautiful, but it is keeping time beautifully, so I'm switching my rating to four stars (would be five if this seller sold watches after checking battery atrength).",

      "text": "Really like it, would be five stars if not for the useless instructions. They cover so many different watches it is impossible to figure out how this one works. Anyone know how the chronograph functions are activated? Is there a stopwatch function? How about an alarm? I did manage to get time and date set after some fiddling. Had to return it it was losing about a minute per day. To get it fixed on amazon warranty would take three weeks! Reordering and hope the new one will be more accurate. Lowering my rating to three stars meanwhile.",

I tried bigger pins and soldering the pins, no luck. It is supposed to be kind of an outdoor sportsmans timepiece and it is really a delicate paperweight. It goes keep time, so I got that going for me which is nice.",
