      "verdict": "The Skechers Delson - Brant grants a sleek look on a casual day to its wearers. It may look simple but this pair is a product of various, but complimenting materials from top to bottom. Even though there are few complaints when putting the shoes on, once successfully sliding the foot on, the comfort is unparalleled, allowing users to stand on it the entire day while still looking fashionable.",
      "pros": [
        "Almost all of the Skechers Delson - Brant's buyers agree that it yields comfort that is in a league of its own",
        "This eye-catching pair causes a large percentage of users to shower it with flattering remarks",
        "Some of the most common words that the reviewers use to describe the design of the shoe are \"attractive\" and \"excellent\"",
        "Most end users reveal their desire to buy another pair once the old ones wear out",
        "A few mention that the Delson - Brant sneaker by Skechers allows the feet to breathe well",
        "The Brant sneaker is lightweight with enough cushion, but still provides a good amount of support, according to several wearers"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "Few are not that fond of the Skechers Delson - Brant's shoelace system since it is not adjustable, which makes it hard to put on",
        "A number of users notice that the tongue slips down and that it is hard to pull back up"
