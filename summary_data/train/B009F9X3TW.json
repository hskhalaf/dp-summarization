The pieces were freely moving around the 5ft box. There were some scratches, no big deal, it\u2019s going in the garage anyway. Started putting it together and fell short of finishing when there were about 4 or 5 pieces missing...I couldn\u2019t even put it together enough to figure out exactly what pieces were missing. HUGE disappointment!!!! Had it not been for that, I\u2019m sure the product would\u2019ve been great. So ultimately, it wasn\u2019t a product default but rather a seller default.",

Once you get the stand weighted down, a 70lb+ bag works really well. I use it 3-4x per week and have for 6 months and am very satisfied with the purchase for light workout purposes.",
