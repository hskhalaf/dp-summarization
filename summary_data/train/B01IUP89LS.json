      "text": "I have purchased four or five other pairs of bluetooth wireless headphones in/around this price range. These are without a doubt the best I have found. It's no surprise, coming from Anker, whose backup batteries I have relied upon for years. Honestly, my workouts have never been better because of how much I forget I'm even wearing headphones. They stay snug while sprinting, lifting, stretching, etc. They are also extremely comfortable, very good at sound isolation, and the sound quality is fantastic. My only complaint, and it's something I am willing to sacrifice for all of the other perks, is that the battery life is somewhat short. I would say mine only last about four hours of continuous use.",

The Plantronics sound good, but not as good as these. I like these headphones more mainly because of the snug fit in my ear. The 12mm driver is very clear and gives you just the right amount of thump. I want to buy another pair of these, but in another color. I am hoping Anker releases more colors of these... *hint hint*",

If you plug in the micro usb to power up without turning off the headset first, when you unplug the micro usb, it was auto connect to the last device. The power button is raised higher than the volume which comes in handy. I bought these as well as the Taotronic and prefer these.

I've noticed slight stuttering only very occasionally. Not sure if the culprit is the headphones or my iPhone 6S. Excited to have headphones that can take some rain/sweat and let me keep the phone in a waterproof pocket!",

This is the best form fitting for my ears I've felt and the head straps keep everything in place rather than having loose wire swinging around. I'd give 6 stars if I could.",

I have a Galaxy S6 and the connection goes in and out. When I hold the phone or place it in my right pocket, the connection is fine. If I place it in my left pocket, the sound cuts out and even stops completely at times. I am not very satisfied and have reached out to Anker to address this is issue. I have owned a number of Anker products have been really impressed. This product, however, may need some work.",
