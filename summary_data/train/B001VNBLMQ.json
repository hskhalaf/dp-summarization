I normally wear a 6m in boots so they are true to size. Worth the money for sure. I do wish they were a tad taller. I'm 5'2 and they come right below my knee.

They do need some breaking in but that just means they're super good leather! The slate color is the perfect blend of brown and dark gray. As for difficulty with putting them on, it was no problem but I do have a slightly slim foot. It was a little harder to get them off without a zipper but I managed and can tell that will be easier when the leather softens with wear, too. Highly recommend!",

Has a worn, warm, medium to dark brown look (NOT orange like I saw with some other reviews, this might be because these are APU and not the regular cognac color). Highly recommend.",

I also fit the size 6 Whiskey ones fine, my feet slipped right in. The grey ones, although half a size bigger, were tighter at the ankles. I am wondering if these are authentic; but I returned the grey ones mostly because they just did not fit at the ankles.",

    "title": "FRYE Women's Paige Tall Riding Boot",
    "description": "Gorgeous leather follows a classic riding boot shape with an additional layer across the front to add detail.Fit Guide - When you receive your boots, always try them on in the afternoon for the best true fit, as that\u2019s when your foot tends to be at its largest. Your entire foot should feel snug except for the heel which should slip a little, which is necessary for getting your boots on and off. The amount of heel slippage should reduce over time. The ball of your foot should always sit at the widest part of the sole. If it sits too far forward, your toes will hurt, and we certainly don\u2019t want that. The vamp of a boot should fit snug over the top of your arch. Oh, and don\u2019t forget to be sure you can always wiggle your toes\n\nFRYE has done it again with the Paige! This gorgeous classic style riding boot shows off their high end quality and craftsmanship with its finely tailored leather upper, and tonal welt stitching. Of course, comfort will never take second stage either, the ultra-soft leather linings and cushioned insole have all of that covered.\n\nThe Frye Company is the oldest continuously operated shoe company in the United States. Founded in 1863 by John A. Frye, a well-to-do shoemaker from England, and family-run until 1945, Frye products have a long and illustrious history. Frye boots were worn by soldiers on both sides of America's Civil War, soldiers in the Spanish-American war, and by Teddy Roosevelt and his Rough Riders. When home-steading drew adventurous New England families to the West during the mid and late 1800's many of the pioneers wore Frye Boots for the long journey. Today Frye remains true to its roots with its line of heritage boots, but continues to innovate as it introduces chic new handbags, pumps, and sandals to its collection.\n\nSee more",
