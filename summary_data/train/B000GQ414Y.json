Home food would give her the loosies because she was a pound puppy first 2 years, a tummy used to digesting only pellet food. Then we bought Royal Canin. 3 months on, she is a muscular, hard playing, outrunning bully in the dog park, eats her share 2 times a day, no complaining. Takes good big poops 2 times a day, no exceptions. This food is so fine, I am thinking of getting on it myself. Might look expensive, but you need to a give lesser qty than other foods, and a subscription will even out the cost eventually.",

The idea of receiving the product every day is good, but the delivery method is questionable. Imagine that something else was within that box. I would have lost it.",

However, once I opened the box I found a large gaping hole in the middle of the bag, and half the food rolling around loose in the box. This bag has a seal on it to keep the food fresh. That\u2019s not happening now. Once the food is stale, I\u2019m sure my dog will no longer eat it. If something isn\u2019t done to rectify this problem, I will not be ordering again, as it was a waste of money.",
