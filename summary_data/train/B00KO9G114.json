He chose the name ASICS for his company in 1977, based on a famous Latin phrase \"Anima Sana In Corpore Sano,\" which, when translated, expresses the ancient ideal of \"A Sound Mind in a Sound Body.\" Taking the acronym of this phrase, ASICS was founded on the belief that the best way to create a healthy and happy lifestyle is to promote total health and fitness. Today, ASICS offers a full line of performance-driven athletic shoes and technical active sports apparel and accessories dedicated to bringing harmony to the body and soul.",
