So to get around this, I used my Invisilign retainer to put the gel in and put the light directly on that.

The device makes a sound and the light will blink once, but will shut off immediately and won't light up again. I'm upset that I spent $50 on something that didn't work for more than a day.",

I ended up using a custom mouth piece I had made specifically for whitening years ago and put the whitening gel in that. To me it doesn't really work any better or worse than anything else. I would buy just the syringes of gel and nothing else.",

I actually think it works better because I\u2019m seeing results after just a couple of treatments. Note- people showing pictures of inflamed gums need to not overfill the trays. You only need very little bleach. Any type of bleach in contact with your gum will cause that reaction.",

No bad flavor, no aftertaste and no discomfort nor sensitivity after the application or the day after! Which is amazing how it works!

However I dont think the naked I could tell, I have to be up close in a mirror to see. I will purchase again.
