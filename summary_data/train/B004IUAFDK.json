We were so excited to turn up at camp with the new. The trunks were picked up by each car and loaded onto trailers for delivery to the children\u2019s cabin and the same was done at the end of Camp. I was therefore terrible upset that this trunk failed to serve us beyond this one outing. The hinge holding the lid to the body fell off. The handles look worn and surely will break off any minute were the trunk still usable. Absolutely worthless is my opinion of this trunk.",

It has larger wheels than the one I had, but the construction is overall cheaper than the old one. The inside of the trunk has an indentation to accommodate the larger wheels of this version. The rivets that bind the case together all poke through the inner lining of the trunk, leaving a lower quality appearance to the inner trunk. It's still good enough for what I wanted and does look nice closed though.",

If you are purchasing for the locking aspect, you may not be satisfied. I think this type of lock could be prone to malfunction & definitely easy to get into without its key. That aside, I adore it!

Whoever is selling/shipping these, it's probably not a great idea to stick the keys INSIDE the trunk and then lock it if you want people to be able to use them.",

      "text": "To be honest I was very skeptical because of the price, admittedly that it's not 'perfect' as I notice the smallest details of all my stuff. But it does what it needs too, the color is really bright which I actually really like, it locks the only thing that really bothered me was I could clearly see when looking inside, all the screws that was drilled into it for the handles and everything. It seems to be sturdy for the light use that I need it for. I am very pleased and pleasantly surprised by how nice it really is. Especially for such a cheap price!!!",

I moved across the country with it and it did a great job protecting all my stuff. It was a hassle to carry in the airport because the handle is only attached to the top and will not adjust heights. I am rather tall, and that proved to be problematic. I kept kicking it and tripping over it as I walked. However, now that I am settled down, this doubles as a quality storage chest. I am very happy with this purchase.",

Upon examination it is a quality product but if I had known how much craftsmanship went into a trunk I would have bought a finer one. I expect this one to last a few moves or a decade, which ever comes first. Sticker from tourist cafe stuck cleanly to surface!",
