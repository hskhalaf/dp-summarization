It worked fine the first two days then the nut would only screw on the first 1\\4 of the bolt then slide the rest of the way because the nut suddenly became too big for the bolt. It seems like a simple fix to replace them both instead of sending the whole thing back. The drawback may be that I would not be able to use the original tightening handle anymore because the propietary bolt has a ball on top to make the handle fit. An update will follow.",

If you are lucky at the casino, have a very light bicycle, don't plan to use this stand very much, then definitely buy it. Otherwise, find a different stand with a warranty.

Granted, my bike only weighs about 16 pounds not loaded and about 17.3 loaded, but this stand holds it like a champ.

      "text": "I've been using this stand constantly for 5 years. It does a good job in general, but it's very light, which causes it to be somewhat unstable. More than once, I've had a bike in there, taken a wheel out, and had the stand tip over due to the imbalance. I've now gotten used to keeping a foot on one of the legs to prevent this. Also make sure you fully tighten, maybe even over tighten, the quick release levers. If they're even the tiniest bit loose, the weight of your bike can cause the legs to fold up.",

The legs are easy to fold, the extension up and down give.you plenty of height, and the head clamp is easy to articulate.",

To avoid pushing hard against the stand when removing tight pedals or crank arms, I pull on the wrench while pushing on the crank arm. I also took the bike off the stand to remove bottom bracket cups. The stand is very stable, and seems well made. I am very happy with my purchase.",

      "text": "This thing is a light weight stand that's fine for someone that doesn't work on a large stable of bicycles. It has a lot of plastic bits, and seems a little too flexy...but it does work well enough with my road, MTB, and CX bikes. As I've found myself working on other people's bikes more It's held up alright, but I suspect that I'll be needing something more substantial in the next year or two if the creaking from this stand is any indication. Or maybe I'll just fiberglass and epoxy the living crap out of the it.",

This item is a really great purchase and saved me from having to ride/walk to the nearby bike coop everytime my bike broke. It folds easily, supports the weight of a cyclocross bike well, is quickly adjusted and the additional tool tray is a welcomed add-on. It's a little bigger than a camping chair when folded. While it does take up a bit of closet space, it's much better than any alternative!",

I feel it is a great stand for the money spent. Hope it is as durable, as it is convenient, over the years.",

I leave tension on the ropes to keep some weight off the stand, as I am sure my fat E bikes will exceed the rated capacity of stand. Even without the weight of motors and battery pack, using the hoist to lift bikes onto work stand is awesome, as I am lacking in upper body strength.",
