Then my cat knocked it over. I don't know what the liquid inside is, but it splashed onto the cabinet, wall and floor. It had a noxious odor which I am having trouble eliminating. I tried washing the wall and floor, but the odor still remains, albeit reduced. I am going to wait it out to see if exposure to air takes care of it. Damned cat! The product itself is beautiful - the cat is on my you-know-what list.",

The base is larger but it's obviously still unstable if you knock it over. Product package is great too, it was SUPER well wrapped. Here's how to read the temperature on the thermometer: To read a Galileo thermometer, look at the lowest hanging bubble in the middle of the tube\u2014the one that is not entirely sunk, nor entirely floating at the top. This bubble is in equilibrium with the surrounding liquid, and its tag will tell the current temperature.",
