The handle part at the top isnt big enough to securely pick up the lid, why wouldnt they allow the handle to pop up so you can grab it!? You have to put your hand on the top so the steam burns you. Also the hot water easily spills out and will burn you. I HATE this thing so much! What idiot designed something that required you endlessly fidget with it when it involves hot steaming water!",

Four minutes in the microwave and ten to sit. It would take me this long just to get a pot of water to boil on the stove to boil my items.",

I don't stick to the stacking method they suggest as you have to fit the bottle parts as you go depending on the type of bottles you use but all in all, bottles and all parts are cleaned and sterilized well. Just be careful when opening the lids after as the steam can be overwhelming. A very good buy.",
