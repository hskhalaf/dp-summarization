      "verdict": "Based on general user feedback, the Adidas PureBoost X TR 2 was a very comfortable training shoe. Commenters lauded the trainer for its lightweight nature, breathable upper, and overall style. Despite the many positive attributes, a minority of people were dissatisfied with the arch support as it caused discomfort. There were also complaints about the heel height. However, it was still a recommended shoe for various activities because of its shock-absorbing Boost midsole.",

        "A great number of Adidas PureBoost X TR 2 owners raved about its comfortability",
        "Many of the consumers adored its style and color options",
        "The shoe was supportive in the arch area, according to numerous wearers",
        "The fit satisfied several users",
        "A fair amount of training enthusiasts recommended using it for cross-training, walking, and dancing because of the shock-absorbing platform",
        "The lightweight nature of the shoe pleased some testers",
        "A handful of people claimed that it relieved discomfort in their feet and other parts of the lower extremities",
        "The roomy toe box was appreciated by a few individuals",
        "A couple of reviewers liked the breathable material of the upper"

      "cons": [
        "A small number of buyers complained that the PureBoost X TR 2 felt uncomfortable because of the floating arch feature",

(PureboostX is a shoe designed for women's feet and are ONLY available in Women's sizes.) Secondly: Check the other buying options! I got some returned ones in perfect, like new condition for about 1/4 the price from the Amazon Warehouse (just had a generic shoes box and no tags). Thirdly: the back of the shoe fits tall so make sure you have socks that will come up high enough that your heel doesn't rub a blister! I'm excited to get running on these!!",
