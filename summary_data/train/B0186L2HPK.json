I admire their service recovery and \"do-good\" practice, but still disappointed with the second pair. 07/07/2018 - First pair purchased last February, I was really impressed with the quality. Last week, that pair was stolen from my car. I ordered another pair, and I'm disappointed to report they're not the same. The frame is bigger, the lenses aren't polarized. The first pair came with a nice zip up case - the second order did not. Highly disappointed with the recent purchase.",

Pro: good customer service (they offered me a discount on another style), good corporate social responsibility (with their donations to people in need), and sturdy construction.",

But just for those who want a particular look, the wood is pretty dark, almost looks fully dark brown/black so the wood grain look is almost missed. But otherwise, these are a nice, simple pair of glasses that are stylish enough.",

One thing you will notice right away is the loud plastic screech noise that happens when you open the shades to put them on. It was nearing the point that I might send them back and it stopped, I would say over a month in. The reason that I was patient is because I like that these shades have dark, black lenses where you can't see my eyes, and they are well polarized. If you can get past the screech noise I believe you will like them too. I also appreciate that they give to charity with each purchase.",
