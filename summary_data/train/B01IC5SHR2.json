I was worried this product wouldn't stack up but boy was I wrong. It's a great replacement. You only need a small dab of product to work up a generous lather, so theres no need to use a lot. I will more than likely be purchasing this again when I need to restock.",

When you are holding and wetting the brushes and then you open the soap cap the soap runs right out of the tube because it is so thin. Then trying to get the tube closed back up while not loosing a bunch of product has been a little tricky. Maybe a tube that stands up with the opening at the top or change to a pump bottle might be better.",
