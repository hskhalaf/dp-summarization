Thought it was a ram problem, but think its something wrong with motherboard or graphic card. Pretty difficult to dissemble the PC to figure out why connection with monitor is not working since its prebuilt. Will prob contact a technician soon. Also, my PC seems to be a different version from the one showcased in the manual as there was no packaging inside the case. Easy to set up though, but mine isn't working despite setting it up. Hope my problem is resolved soon. Will update.",
