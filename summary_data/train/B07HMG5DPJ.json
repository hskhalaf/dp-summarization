Unfortunately, within one DAY of periodic use the segments were irreversibly locked due to pressure of casting and poor design. I watched my son and he was not irresponsible. Unfortunately, the carbon is so thin that attempting to use pliers only scratches the paint, wears it down and had the potential to bend out of shape. So. SO disappointed and surprised after so many reviews.",

Very disappointing as I was excited about it and saw great reviews. The equipment seemed ok during inspection. Terrible misjudgment on my part and terrible product by the manufacturer.

Although I only do pier fishing, I think it can handle well with medium-sized one. It is pretty lightweight so you can fish for hours without fatigue. Notice that the rod is quite flexible, which is good for casting and saving you from snapping the line. Cosmetic-wise, the whole setup looks really good with eye-catching colorway.

This comes with fishing line that needs to be spooled unto the reel so had to look up some knots and learn something. Overall great to use, quick and easy to collapse and put away.

I\u2019d like to get another but not sure if I should press my luck. Update 8/26/2019: I updated my ratings to 4-stars based on customer service. I contacted their customer service and the seller was very courteous and responsive. I received a refund for my rod. I will likely try and get a similar rod from them again in hopes that the issue was just that one rod.",

      "text": "I would give it 5 stars, but I\u2019ve experienced issues when reeling fish. Overall there is no issue with the rod, it\u2019s very durable. However when it comes to reeling a 5lb bass, the handle will begin to fold and it\u2019s really annoying. The folding handle is very convenient for storage purposes but I think it needs to be improved for toughness",

Took me a minute to figure out where to hook it and I found the hole at the bottom of the pole.",

I think the largest one I caught that day was nearly 3lbs, no issues with the product. I'll be taking this with me everywhere now.",
