It cannot easily be used as an everyday stroller and is difficult to fit in the rear of an suv and almost impossible to get back out of the suv by yourself so I had to purchase a 2nd double stroller for everyday use. That being said, it's perfect for walks and outdoor adventures as it will go over any surface type without a problem. It is the Humvee of strollers.",

These are really expensive and I will admit the quality is there. BUT I do think there are very good alternatives that are out there for much less. These just seem overpriced to me.",
