It features an adjustment screw knob in the middle to access small and large nuts and bolts. The finish is clean bright high-polished rustproof chrome plating with numeric etchings to show the corresponding sizes with the correct side. The small closed end design makes it easy to access those hard to reach areas while giving you added space for turning. This multi wrench enables the user to apply more torque with the patented 3-point touch design. Most crescent wrenches only offer two points of strength, therefore causing the user to round off nut points needed to loosen nuts and bolts. So stop all the wrench slips and knuckle damage you get with regular crescent wrenches and get the new Smart wrench!",
