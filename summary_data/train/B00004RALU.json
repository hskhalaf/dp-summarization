I have also noticed that the Weber infuses more of the charcoal flavor into the food, which we love.",

The tray still catches it, but it's a pain to have to take it off the grill without getting ash everywhere. Also, if/when I get another one i'll probably opt for the premium version with the temp gauge and the side table. Overall it's a pretty good product.",

What I do want to point out though, is my solution to the substandard ash catcher. I purchased a standard 10 quart galvanized pail from the local hardware store to replace the catcher. You can adjust the clips on the legs such that the rim of the pail fits snugly between. I can go 20 grillings before I have to empty the pail. Another tip... when you are done grilling, close the top and bottom vents and you will have charcoal left for the next time.",

I did get the chance to visit them , and the guys were still using them!! :-) You just can't kill a Weber , take it and any other grill and leave them outside for a year.I'll guarantee when you roll them in the other brand will be a rusted out piece of junk. The WEBER? It'll look brand new, that's just the way Weber makes their products!",
