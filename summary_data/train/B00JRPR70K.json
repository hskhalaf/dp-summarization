I decided to taste a few out of the new carton that I just opened, and they have zero flavor / bordering on stale. I checked the expiration date, and it is 9/8/19. At the store, the expiry is usually 2 years out. I basically had 39 days to go through 6 cartons, which is absolutely ridiculous. I have 3 cartons of goldfish that are about to go in the trash. I hate wasting money (which is why I chose subscribe and save) and feel so incredibly disappointed/frustrated!",

They are all puffy and weird shaped or something instead of the flatter cracker type. Why?! There is a noticeable taste difference, too.",
