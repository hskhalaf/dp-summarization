The projector is seeing to maximize viewing experience therefore there's no room to place a lens cap. Also if you calibrate your projector right you should not get any Rainbow Effect.",

I max it out at 120 inches and it comes in clear day or night, sometimes I close my blinds a little in the afternoons but usually don't even have to and I live on the beach and it's always sunny. I use this product in place of a TV and 6 months in and happy customer. really good HD and colors.",

Descent Picture quality 3. Lot of options to play around with in terms of Video mode. 4. Vertical and Horizontal tilting/shifting. Well, it's with all projector nowadays, but worth a mention. Cons: 1. Remote is not backlit, and hard to operate in the dark. 2. Sometime shows \"No Signal\", even though the receiver is always connected. Work around is to select the source again. 3. No USB powered port 4. Low volume compared to other projectors. (Does not matter for me, as receiver have this covered.)",
