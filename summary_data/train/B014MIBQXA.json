We can no longer return it to Amazon, and we have had difficulty reaching someone at Lenovo who can help us, though we will continue trying. $170 is a lot to spend for a chrome book that didn't even last a year.",

He uses it and gets the job done and I won't be too upset if his little brat brother kicks the screen in, like he did with Apple. The thing Works and that's all we need.It won't wash the dishes, but a kid can do his homework. Everyone should buy one of these just to have it in case the really pricey thing you depend upon is out of whack, for whatever reason.",

(Naturally the software for this came on a CD which this type of machine cannot read.) That issue aside, a great value for accomplishing the basics.",

However, I think it is a Chrome issue, not the Chromebook's but on YouTube, 1080p60 runs extremely choppy and laggy, like it is unbearable. 1 more thing I do not like is the track pad. You cant just tap to click, but I like the tactile 'click' when you press on it. You have to press very hard for a very minimal click. Other than those two issues, this Chromebook is flawless.",

Web apps in Java, such as many games, are out, any small programs that one would normally download and install for free are out. I got this for typing and browsing the web. And indeed, I can browse the web and listen to music, but even Dropbox linkages are not working properly, limiting my ability to sync typed materials. One can install Ubuntu on this, but even that is limited and requires technical workarounds. I highly recommend you go for a basic Windows netbook if you are not a pro user.",
