You have to use the app to control this lock, and I really enjoy the tap to unlock function of the other kevo. I did recently add a kevo hub, adding remote functionality to this lock...

Installation took about 15 . Also, I have motion activated video at this door, so when someone approaches, I can unlock the door remotely. The connection to my phone works throughout our one-story home, and even on the outside deck. It is available in multiple finishes, including oil rubbed bronze, so I could match my door hardware.
