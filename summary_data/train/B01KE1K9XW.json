      "text": "I bought this anchor for my kayak after reading many reviews of this product as well as others. Just as others have mentioned, rigging the anchor for 'hang up' situations is important, as you don't have a lot of leverage from a kayak to free a stuck anchor. After following instructions on You Tube, and adding a 3' section of chain to the rode, I was ready to hit the water. In 15 mph winds and a steady current, the anchor held strong. It stowed compact, is easy to deploy, and works like you would expect. Note, on soft silty bottoms with oyster beds, you need to take care not to chaff the anchor line, this the chain.",

A real convenience to have. i recommend this anchor to anybody who has a small craft (where a 3.5 lb. anchor is sufficient). Quick ship via Prime and comes with a strong nylon bag, plus 40 ft, of nylon braid. ya can't beat a deal like this.",

Second time I brought it out it hooked onto what I can only guess was a massive branch or root at the bottom. Boat didn\u2019t move. Unfortunately due to the unforgiving grappling hook design, and despite my use of a zip tie at the top and the rope tied to the bottom per the recommendations of many, it simply wouldn\u2019t come loose, so I ended up having to cut rope and count it as a loss. I\u2019ll be switching to a mushroom style anchor for my next purchase due to this experience.",
