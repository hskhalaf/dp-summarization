      "title": "good quality great price",
      "text": "We purchased two of these binoculars for a family birding trip. The GoSky were comparable to another more expensive set with the same magnification that we already had. So we actually got two for the price of one. Worked great, easy to focus. The phone attachment was a bit cumbersome-difficult to click the photo while holding the binoculars steady-it may work better for an android that has the voice photo click option. I don't think I will use the attachment too much. Definitely would recommend the binoculars. Hopefully the warranty will be as good as the other brand if needed.",
