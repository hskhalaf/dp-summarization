After testing this camera for over a week, I'm happy to report that Fujifilm has delivered another solid addition to the Instax family line of cameras...but take note: If you're a fussy and demanding instant photo perfectionist, this is NOT the camera you're looking for. If you're new to the world of instant photography, or are looking for quality instant photographs with modern digital replay convenience, you couldn't do better than the Instax Square camera.",

      "text": "Too many people have failed to understand that the SQ10 is first and foremost an instant camera with unprecedented creative control. It brings the ability to creatively adjust and edit an instant photo, add digital filters, shoot as close as you\u2019d like, and shoot handheld images in low light without flash. No other instant camera can do what this Instax can. And while the square format Instax pictures are smaller than the resurrected Polaroid format, the results are far more predictable, with better color, contrast, sharpness and consistent exposures, to say nothing of far faster development times, now at about a half the cost of Polaroid\u2019s offerings. It\u2019s a more thoughtful approach to instant photography than just one step.",

I will say that the camera is a little heavy, but it feels slightly lighter than the Wide 300 camera. Lastly, the charging cord could be a little longer, but it's not a deal breaker.",

The picture quality is not that of a regular camera, but it does make really cute photos to display. You can make a lot of adjustments once you have the picture on the screen with color, light, zooming, etc. Overall, it's a great first camera for anyone.",

      "text": "Great printer and cool square format, but my Galaxy s7 takes much better photos in all situations... You would be better off using this as a photo editor/printer and taking photos with your phone. I wish they would make a square printer or square analogue camera. As of right now, this is just a low quality digital camera with a square format printer. Sure, it's nice that you can print instant black and white/sepia photos without having to buy black and white film, but I feel like you lose the magic of instant film when none of the light from the scene reaches the film and you can make endless copies of the same photo.",
