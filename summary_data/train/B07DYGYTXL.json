      "verdict": "Runners who were able to wear the Merrell Nova were happy with what it had to offer. The overall build of this trail runner apparently accommodated the natural movement capacity of the foot. This product was also deemed suitably light and well-constructed. On the other hand, some runners bemoaned the midsole\u2019s focus on natural pronation and the absence of a supportive feature for the midfoot.The Nova from Merrell is an addition to the worldwide family of trail running shoes. It is also a product intended for neutral pronators.",
      "pros": [
        "People who have tested the Merrell Nova were happy with its lightweight build, stating that they never felt as though the product weighed them down",
        "The underfoot cushioning system was appreciated for being responsive and comfortable",
        "Many purchasers were happy with the looks of this running shoe, claiming that the color schemes were visually appealing",
        "The fit profile was welcomed because it welcomed the foot without feeling too snug or restricting",
        "Several testers commented that the flexibility of the product enabled natural and pleasant movements over the surfaces",
        "The general quality of the materials received praise, with runners stating that the product lasted long",
        "A lot of consumers liked the grip capacity of the Merrell Nova",
        "they felt that they were able to ignore the fear of slipping and weave through the trails with confidence"

If you are not blessed with completely standardised feet better to keep away from these otherwise fine and cheap trail running shoes. Trail means you need more support, but running in a vice on your heels? Not my kind of fun to be honest. The heel support bit doesn't come up to all the way in the back, finishes abruptly, that was the source of the blisters for me. Also, wet socks from morning dew. I'll have to try some treatment before complaining more.",

The one major drawback is that they are useless in damp conditions! Not only are they not in the slightest bit waterproof they slip like crazy on damp surfaces. Now I've had Vibrim soles before and I don't remember any such problems but if you intending walking on anything even resembling damp you'r toes will be slipping back the whole time! Putting them away till the summer... When I'm sure they will be great.... hopefully.",
