He loved that he could design it himself and it helped with motivation. He never complained that it was uncomfortable. I had him wear underwear and a pull up over the underwear and it worked great. I cannot recommend this enough. You do need a child that is willing and motivated.",

He was a premie and also has ADHD, We've seen professionals. We've limited his fluids, We woke him up through the nights. Nothing has worked till now, and I hope and pray it continues . This coming Monday will mark 2 full weeks of being dry. Best thing I could've bought. Wished I would have done this sooner!",

This is beyond frustrating, as I have two kiddos that keep wetting the bed multiple times a night and this is my second bed alarm (first one different brand) that has stopped working. For $50 I certainly expected it to last. Very disappointed and frustrated.",

The 1st night he peed the bed like normal, the next two nights he peed a very small amount only enough to trigger the alarm and he quickly woke up and went to the restroom. Every night after that he would get up and go pee before the alarm went off. And now some nights he gets up and some nights he don't but he wakes up dry!! Thank you!",
