It's better to just buy an external standalone USB battery pack, and KNOW you will have enough juice for 2-3 complete recharges when you're on the go.",

Update: After about 45 days, the case simply refused to charge. Contacted Incipio; no joy. Disappointing -- it's a nicely designed device, but it could use two changes: better quality control, and the ability to switch the case off to preserve the battery charge. Due to the charging problem, I've had to abandon the device.",

That is very annoying and essentially makes this case useless. Works great so far! I bought mine from the Clearance center and saved some $$$. It it almost too intuitive to use. I had a hard time figuring out how to charge my phone initially. It feels lighter in weight and more streamlined than my old mophie was - plus less $. I'd pick this one over Mophie in the future.",
