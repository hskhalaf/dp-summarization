In the end, you will be left with extra parts but that's okay. Just use the screws/bolts/spacers that best fit your set. I use this on my 55 inch LG television which is quite heavy and this stand can take it without any problems. I also bought some velcro cord straps to attach a surge power strip and other cables from my gaming units. I love this stand and it gives me the freedom to move it from room to room without any problems.",

A bit complicated assembly, but first rate instructions along with compartmentalized parts made it easy. All tools required but a Phillips screwdriver were included. Once assembled, the TV is easily adjusted. The stand even has a level built in to make sure the TV is level. The wheels rotate on ball bearings and easily roll over carpet. I would highly recommend this stand to anyone that needs a mobile stand. Based on the quality of the material, I'm going to buy VIVO equipment if offered for a product that I need.",

The assembled stand feels very sturdy but is still light enough that I can pick the whole unit up to carry up a few steps when necessary. The cable management isn't horrible. You do have to run cables up from halfway down the pole towards the top. I just dropped a string down the tube and pulled them up. My only gripe with this stand is the wheels. They could be a bit larger. Rolling on carpet drags a bit. Overall, I am very happy with the purchase.",
