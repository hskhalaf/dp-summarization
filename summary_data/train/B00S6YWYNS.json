We tried another brand of flossers for braces, but they were too big to fit under the wire. The Platypus fits under wires beautifully. So thankful my dental hygienist told me about them. My daughter\u2019s orthodontist never told me about them so it makes me wonder how many orthodontists really know about them. If the Platypus company would like to hire me (a hygienist) to visit orthodontist offices and promote their product, I would be a great spokesperson. These things work!

Patent pending structure uses the tooth\u2019s anatomy to floss correctly, eliminating worry of damaging wires and brackets while flossing. \u00b7 Is QUICK! No threading required, you can floss your entire mouth in less than 2 minutes. \u00b7 Is UNIQUE! The only flosser with the innovative structure which fits under the arch wire, between teeth, and up into the gum line. Toothbrush Designed to be effective when used in a manner that most patients actually use a toothbrush. Eliminates re-training! Inner bristles 2mm shorter for better adaptation over brackets and archwires. Inner MEDIUM bristles assist with better cleaning of stainless or resin appliances. SOFT outer bristles angled/curved inwards. This assists in bristles folding inwards, focusing on areas where the brackets meet the anatomy as well as behind the archwires. This is the area where over 85% of decalcification and decay occur while wearing braces. Affordable! Silicone grips designed for maximum comfort and ease of use.",
