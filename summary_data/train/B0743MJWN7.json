We had our bar a little less than 1 month when the \"solid beechwood\" bar began to peel off. I don't know what the core of the bar is made of, but the surface is just a sticker that looks like wood. I am extremely disappointed in the false advertising of this company. They state \"Our bar is made from strong, smooth beechwood that won't splinter, wobble or break\" but it is actually just a beechwood looking sticker that will peel after a few weeks of use.",
