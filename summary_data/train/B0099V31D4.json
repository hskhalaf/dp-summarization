While I would agree with Cook's Illustrated that the device is well-made, easy to use, and provides a wide range of grinding levels, I was expecting more of the structure for the price. Under the brushed steel, it's just plastic. It also can be a bit hard to open up. Nonetheless, it is a nice addition to our kitchen and, for those who entertain, it definitely provides an aesthetically appealing and professional panache.",

Oddly, the salt has more grind variation from chalk fine to salt caramel coarse with just 3 settings. I'm thinking my 4 peppercorn medley is soft and my Hawaiian red clay alaea salt is hard?

The grinders look neutral enough to play with hamburgers or a full-dressed holiday table, and deliver consistent grinds through all the settings. The smallest grind is great when you want just a dusting and the largest setting is perfect for steak/roast rubs. Bravo Cole & Mason, bravo!",

Addendum -- it is now February 2017. Both grinders are still grinding away. Still loving these babies.",
