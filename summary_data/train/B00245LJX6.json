I immediatly boxed it back up and sent it back. Don\u2019t bother with the warranty either because you have to pay for the shipping and it\u2019s more than the machine costs!!",

You can't really do incline bench because the bar is so close to your head and so far back that it's very awkward to do and not very safe when you get to heavier weights.The assembly was pretty easy to do, but would be best with 2 people. The bench can get a bit wobbly and the height of it is a problem because I can't set my feet down while doing a bench press and I'm 6ft tall.",

These plastic pieces broke off mid lift on me, causing the bench to go into a slight decline very quickly. I almost dropped 200 pounds on my neck in about half a second. Happened faster than my spotter could react. Very scary moment. If you do buy this, inspect these plastic caps regularly or weld a piece of metal to each position stop so it will catch the bar and not have to rely on the plastic caps.",

The leg attachment is flimsy and floppy as well, but at the price you get what you pay for. As long as you're more careful than normal, you can still get some use out of it. My advice- spend a few more bucks on a better designed bench set, as this became a clothesline really fast because of the safety concerns.",

Assembly was a breeze, thanks to the clearly-written and well-illustrated instruction guide. All the various nuts and bolts were clearly labeled and easy to access on a shrink-wrapped board. And the parts had a quality and heft I wasn't expecting at this price point. After assembly, there is zero flex, no gaps in joints - the bench is as solid as a rock. My first impression might change after I use the bench regularly for a few months, but for now I'm happier than I thought I'd be. Well done, Marcy!",

It doesn't have a high 'lip' on the front of it, so if you quickly drop the bar back into place, it is possible for it to slip off. Secondly, I wish the seat tilted, especially when doing incline.

At the same connection- the connection is not center. Every time I go to bench the seat is off center of the uprights which messes with my head and balance.

One other thing we didn't like about it is that rest doesn't slide back and forth so when you have the chair inclined, the actual bar is quite a bit behind your shoulders.
