The Seafoam color which I purchased from this seller is not only a fake but a very bad one. The first giveaway was the packaging being cheap and damaged and also coming direct from China. Secondly the Yeti stamp on the side of the cup is washed out and faded. A REAL Yeti will have stainless engraved writing. The writing on your REAL Yeti will also match/line up exactly with the Yeti writing on the bottom of your cup.",

I would say the biggest benefit is if there is something really cold in it, the outside does not sweat or leave condensation rings on your table on hot days. UPDATE: After having this for a few months, I've burned my mouth on coffee more than once after OVER AN HOUR of it sitting in the tumbler. I've since learned my lesson - if you put something hot in here, it's staying hot. Consider yourself warned.",

Although the lid itself secures firmly to the cup with a silicone gasket, I wish there was a lid with a more secure closure for sipping. I might try the mag-slider, but the reviews I've read don't sound too promising. For now, I use the straw lid and am happy with that for my cold beverages.",

The open lid is an invitation for disaster. I also wonder how much the large drinking opening contributes to the heat loss. I do not use the tumbler for cold drinks.",
