It doesn't really restrict your motion and it's easy on and off. It's also not too buoyant, so diving down doesn't cause any problems. It has this quick disconnect that they put there just so you could attach it to your camera, but now I wish the standard wrist strap on the camera had this quick connect too so that I could easily switch between. That's more an issue with the other strap though.",

I only attach the strap when I'm in the water, just leave the other half of the clip attached to the camera and attach or detach the float as needed.

I can think of a couple of times when it out-right saved the camera. The bright red is very visible in the blue water and it will keep the camera from dropping like a brick should it fall in. It stood up to all the abuse of a novice scuba diver, 17mph winds and surf, and got the camera back in one piece.",
