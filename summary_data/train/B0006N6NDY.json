Use contact cement for most of it, not super glue. Otherwise you'll be walking around with half a rocket glued to your hand most of the day. Streamers are the best, not parachutes. Parachutes make the rocket fall back to earth so much slower. Spray paint works great.",

Only a streamer to slow the decent. Nose cone is glued shut or I\u2019d remove most of the putty.",
