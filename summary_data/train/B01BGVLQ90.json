The back to the seat of the stroller does not lock in evenly when reclining and lifting your child. The foot rest is not much of a foot rest at all. The stroller is listed as a light weight stroller which is is not compact nor lightweight. I always buy graco products and I\u2019m not impressed this time graco!! So sad for the money spent.",

Decided to buy a nicer carseat and then stroller separately, wanted a click connect one and one to use as the baby grows. This one is awesome. Infant carrier was secure on it, we are now using it for just her to sit up in, but the flat \"bassinet\" option works wonders for changing diapers while out and for napping. Very easy to fold and unfold, lightweight and slim profile. My only complaint right now is we're having trouble getting the break to stick, we can but it takes several tries.",

I bought our first one because it folds easily using one hand (when your other arm is carrying the baby), Click Connect seat will fit in, it's comfier than an umbrella stroller, lighter than a regular one, has lots of storage space underneath, easy to push, and the canopy is large. Both strollers easily fit in our car trunk, and there's a nice carrying handle too. Now my husband and I can each have a stroller to push. So much easier to take to the mall than the limo double stroller. !",

My only complaint is the tires are bad quality. I think they are meant for strolling indoor because they are getting beat up after 2 strolls in my neighborhood. The stroller will last but I think the tires are not going to last over a year.",

The canopy below will fit a small diaper bag, but if yours is bigger you can hang it from the handles. I do recommend buying a visor extender or a screen of sorts to help provide more shade from the sun and some darkness when your little one takes a nap. Highly recommended.",

Relatively lightweight, easy to maneuver, and easily folds up to store in the back of my compact suv. Much better than an umbrella stroller, which I feel is flimsy and doesn't have much storage room. We also got a jogger, but found that I didn't use it so much bc it's bigger, bulkier, harder to maneuver, and harder to get in the back of the suv on my own.",

Light weight, smaller, fits in our car better, and the best part is the wheels dont get stuck! And it completely affordable!",

So easy and lightweight to fold up to put in the car, check it in and if she fell asleep in the car seat, we could just click it on the stroller. Definitely recommend",

      "text": "We liked this stroller very much at first -- it rolled smoothly, turned easily, and folded and unfolded easily. After just a few uses, however, the latch to collapse the stroller started jamming, and has become almost impossible to operate. We have been in a couple of situations in parking lots where we weren't sure if we'd be able to fold the stroller to fit it into our car to go home, and only barely got it to collapse after pulling on it with all our strength. Wondering if this is an unusual glitch for our particular stroller, but currently disappointed since a stroller that doesn't fold is difficult to transport and fairly inconvenient to use on a regular basis.",
