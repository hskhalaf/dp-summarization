      "text": "The Actatel Idol 4 contains intrusive apps and software over which it is very difficult to exert any control. The relative cheapness of this phone is offset by the potential security risk in intrusive apps, screens that suddenly popup for no apparent reason and are apparently designed so that in trying to close them there is a high risk of activating further apps. Whether this a co-incidence I don't know, but several weeks after buying this phone I had an ongoing problem with premium rate texts confirming I had signed up to gaming software without me actually knowing signed up. I am getting rid of this phone for no other reason than the reasons given in this review.",
