I am 6'2\" and fit fine inside. It was unusually cold during our hike and the tent protection and insulation from the temps. The design allows you to sit up inside and is roomy enough to change clothes, etc. I am extremely happy with this purchase.",

I think my favorite part of the tent is that other than the bathtub bottom, it is completely mesh. I can take the rainfly off and sleep under the stars without all of the bugs. It is also great during dusk when Mosquitos are bad. It is pretty light for the price too. It isn't a backpacking tent, but I have brought it on long trips with no fatigue. Great tent.

Also, while it is larger than my last tent it is a bit heavier than I would like for backpacking. I may buy the same tent in a smaller size for this purpose.

Pictures show outside view and views from inside looking out. LOVE!",

      "text": "This has generally been a good and reliable product for me, but I take issue with it's performance in the rain. Specifically, the interaction between the vestibule flap and the tent door. When the vestibule is unzipped, the internal mesh door is half uncovered and exposed to the rain. Also, if there is water on the vestibule door and you unzip it without shaking the water off, you risk dumping all that water onto the mesh door and subsequently onto your gear inside the tent. This is an issue that can be managed, but I don't like it, especially for trips to the restroom during the night when it's raining.",

Used on at least 6 separate campouts so far (primarily Boy Scout outings, 2-3 days at a time), and they are holding up very well. Easy to pitch and break down. Decent for/2 people, awesome for single occupant. Although not an 4-season tent, I used mine during a Winter Camporee & was fine w/the right bag and sleeping pad. An all around great tent.",
