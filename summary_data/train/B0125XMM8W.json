It's a very nice kit with all the different sizes and tips you need to decorate. I decorated a wedding cake last week using this set. I had no issues with the tips or cleaning them. I would recommend this for anyone. If you are a beginner and you are worried about not having numbered tips, don't worry. Cake decorating is about creativity. Have fun with it.",

Also maybe some instructions for newbies? When I first started a made quite a mess because the bags came out of the tip. I learned you had to cut slips in the bag and fold it over the cap and then screw on the tip to help hold the bag in place. Maybe I'm just an idiot.",
