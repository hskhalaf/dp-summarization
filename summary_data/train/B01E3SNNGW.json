      "text": "I considered buying the other big brand but since my last pair got beat up so soon I thought I'd go with a traditional speaker brand. Sound quality is excellent, what I'd expect from bose. Cost a lot. Durability: I'm a bit worried it would break as I'm not extremely delicate. Presentation: amazing. Really well presented in a massive box for a tiny little thing. I reckon I can store biscuits in that box now, recycling is good. Comes with a little round pouch and some extra ear plugs for size. Charged quickly, lasted long. Pretty comfortable too. Would I buy it again? Probably, but it does cost a lot so I'll try not to break these ones.",

These really are the best out there, the Bluetooth connection is rock solid both indoors and outside, and the sound quality is good, particularly when paired with an iPhone. The only down side is that they don't have any noise isolation so you can hear what is going around you in noisy environments, but I can live with that.",

Highest sound quality I\u2019ve had; on full volume nothing is too loud, but the range and depth of sounds is amazing. Beep bass tones and higher frequencies sing and bony sound harsh or \u2018tinny\u2019. Excellent for running. One you get the right fitting in your ear they stay in place and you don\u2019t even notice they are they\u2019re. Battery life is a little on the low side of using continually. But as they\u2019re designed for short term wear (workouts etc) then it can be forgiven. A quick 10/15minute charge and you\u2019re good to go for another hour.",

They do not sit 'in ear' and therefore have almost no buffer from outside noise. Whilst cycling, the sound of the wind is far too loud and annoying. In the gym (with Gym music being played on the speakers) you need to have your volume at maximum as there's almost zero noise cancellation. The only positives with these earphones is the sound quality. I'm more keen on replacing them than I was expecting them. Massive let down.",

I tried charging them at different ports, different plugs, etc but they were still dead. I would not expect this from most speaker/headphone manufacturers but especially not Bose. These earphones cost me \u00a3114 and for that kind of price I would expect these to last years. I have gone back to my wired headphones which have lasted me well over 6 years now! Amazon were great and provided me with a full refund and extended return policy so no fault on their side.",

The buds are super comfortable, and you get 3 sizes to choose from shipped in the box. Battery life seems good, though a year or two of testing will tell. They stay put when I'm running and aren't moved by sweaty skin. Overall, great stuff.",

The bass is incredible, clear and thumpy but delivered with crisp treble and a decent mid range. I would say the sound quality is as good as if not even a little better than my \u2018proper\u2019 headphones which are sennheiser and cost over \u00a3300.

Used for cycling and general walks, didn\u2019t want full noise cancelling ear phones as you need to be able to hear traffic etc when cycling/ walking on footpaths. Sound quality is excellent, plenty of Bass and little noise leakage to outside, so you won\u2019t irritate anybody nearby with your music. Can get a little sweaty after a long ride but no worse than any other earbuds I have used. When answering the phone , using the earbuds , people cannot tell you are using the earbuds to talk and listen , brilliant!",

I have even found myself wearing them at work every now and then. Would recommend, especially for the current price.",

The battery also isn\u2019t great - I\u2019m getting around 5 hours in between charges which is less than stated. Only benefit is when you turn them on they give you a battery percentage straight away which is useful.",

Only downside I would say is the cable can grip the skin on the back of your neck when running, although you can use the clip to clip on to t-shirt which helps. Also battery life could be better but not a deal breaker.",
