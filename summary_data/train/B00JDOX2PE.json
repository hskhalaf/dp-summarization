MOON JUMPS! EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEXPLOSIONS! it would be nice if they didn't spend all that time making a next gen port and just worked on a little more content for this one..

I actually started to get disappointed during my first play through because I thought I was near the end and the game was rather short... but then it kept going. So perhaps the pacing could have been a little better, but it is still an enjoyable romp, made especially fun by the Aussie development team as I have a soft spot for all things down under. Only piece of advice - be sure to search for SHIFT codes online so you can get some bonus loot, since the team is currently giving away codes like crazy.",

The only weird downfall is that because you are on a planet you have to constantly get oxygen. It's not hard by any means, it's just something you always have to look out for and sometimes run around and find. There is plenty of oxygen on the planet but it takes away from the game slightly which is why I only gave this 4 stars and not 5. However if you are a fan of the Borderland series, I highly recommend getting this game.",

New characters are good. Overall just seems like they slapped a new cover on it and renamed it, but is fun to play if you like the previous ones.",

    "title": "Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel - Xbox 360",
    "description": "Platform:Xbox 360| Edition:StandardThis third game in the Borderlands series takes gamers to Pandora's moon for trippy, space-based first-person-shooter action. The gravity is variable, the atmosphere is non-existent, but the weapons and loot are so, so plentiful. Back is the over-the-top, frenzied FPS-meets-RPG action, but this time there are new vehicles, new weapons, new environments, and new playable characters. Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel expands upon the engine and gameplay of Borderlands 2 and introduces new mechanics including anti-gravity, freeze weapons, and oxygen tanks which can be used to navigate environments and perform special attacks. You play as a member of the Hyperion Corporation and fight alongside Handsome Jack, the villain of Borderlands 2, with one of four new characters, each with his or her own abilities and play style.",
