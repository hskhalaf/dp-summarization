To really see how the port fails, try 'Fading Sun' under the Winder Songs (icemusic) album by Terje Isungset. Either the sub has an issue with quality control or it isn't designed for the lower-end frequencies and should limit. Shame. Will be returning.",

I have a fairly-large media room, and this subwoofer just fills the room no matter how it's positioned / pointed. Plus, it's kind-of pretty for a speaker. You can hear this down the street (through closed doors and windows) when we're intentionally trying to thump. Was easy to equalize the lows to the rest of my system. Beyond thrilled!",

Relatively compact with solid build quality and a nice, clean look - not a cheap look like the theater-in-a-box subs. Sound is much deeper and fuller, makes everything sound much more convincing. At the $100 price point, I couldn't possibly recommend anything else. The value is unbeatable.",

As long as you place this subwoofer appropriately and adjust the volume(less is better) to match your speakers, I'm confident that you'll like what you hear. I gave this 4 stars because the auto on/off feature is completely unreliable. I've had full songs play, with bass tones throughout, only to have the subwoofer remain inactive. It'd probably kick on if I raised the volume but I shouldn't have to do that. Fortunately, you can just turn it to always on, which is what I do.",

I mean its so weak, you will hear it the moment you play it. What it does, it focuses on a very specific high bass frequency to make you think its loud. However, there is no real bass, low freq, or vibration. It is tuned to a very high frequency to fool your ears to thinking you are hearing bass. You are better off buying a logitech 2.1 PC speaker system than this high frequency basss junk subwoofer. Dont let them fool you!",

The extra bass this sub puts out is a hidden gem you didn\u2019t realize you needed until you hear it. It makes playing video games 10x more fun and watching movies and tv shows more enjoyable. I\u2019m so glad I purchased this sub and for the price, you can\u2019t go wrong. It\u2019s a 10\u201d sub so it\u2019s a bit punchy on notes, but it hits the low notes so beautifully.

We changed receivers for the TV, and the one we purchased didn't have a powered subwoofer output, just the signal. I added this and VOILA!, the room filled up with low end. I'm a professional in the production side of the music biz, so my ears are attuned to good quality audio speakers (my recording studio speakers ran me thousands of $'s). You can't beat Polk's gear unless you want to go full on audiophile and spend thousands. This is quality.",
