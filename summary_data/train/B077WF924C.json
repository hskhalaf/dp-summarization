Most all sunglasses too dark which causes eye to strain. I tested 6 tactical glasses and these Hulislem glasses were hands down the big winner confirmed from staff and friends. Hulislem had no eye strain at all even when sun is on the face. The colors you see without glasses will be the same when glasses are worn. Very comfortable; many times forget they are on my face. Can be worn indoors (grocery stores with too bright of lighting), which is great for sensitive eyes, have a headache, or...just because.",

The breaks were in identical and symmetric spots across the top bridge, and by the look of the break, it seems like a bad weld/join.

I wanted something with slight shade reduction that I can use for shooting and driving. Also wanted polarized for driving in the rain because it is said the road is clearer during heavy rains with polarized glasses. I have yet to be in a heavy rain storm to see how the road looks. I will update when I do; the whole idea may be an urban legend because I have an expensive pair of Oakley's and didn't see much of an improvement in clarity when raining heavily.",

She plays in the outfield and tracking balls up in the air is something that is important for her to be able to do.

FYI, I very careful with my glasses...so I'm not even sure how these broke??

One second of blindness follows. My main complain with sport shades is that they are too dark, and the ball disappears from view depending on the angle. I did not have that problem with these! The shades reduced the sun's glare without loss of crispness. I even forgot I had them on while playing, which is all you can ask for when trying to focus on hitting the ball well. I so recommend these shades, that I'll probably buy a couple more!",

I was happy with the lenses and the nose pads. The sunglasses only lasted two months before the frame broke around one of the lenses. Still, at about 1/8th of the cost of some cycling sunglass brands, I can keep buying cheap sunglasses like these when they break and still be ahead.",
