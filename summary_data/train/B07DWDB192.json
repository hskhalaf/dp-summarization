I was concerned at first about the potential metal taste that some cups have when drinking from them but that was not the case with these, thank goodness. It was really great that the set also came with coasters, I haven\u2019t used them yet but they are really nice as well. This set would make for a great gift, at least that was the hint that was brought up during the conversation it sparked.",

The only thing I found was a tiny chip on the top edge of the handle on one, but not noticeable unless you are looking for it, and the spot is not in an area where you sip. But, overall for the price, these are great and beautiful. Seem to be very durable.",
