I decided to try this new version that supports homekit/assistant, on the off chance they ship with an updated firmware that wouldn't cause me the same headaches. Sure enough, they connected flawlessly, and even went through the firmware upgrade without a hiccup. FINALLY! It looks like we're on the right track now. Worth the wait for these colors. Do it.",

It works great with her phone app and love the rainbow effect it can give compared to just the light bulbs. Great mood lighting. Only drawback is the adhesion, but certainly not a big deal.

Bright, very well made, extremely easy to install, and comes with 3/ adhesive tape attached to the back of the lighting strip. I chose to razor the protective paper on the adhesive tape in small sections so I didn't have to use the whole strip, therefore leaving plenty of adhesive tape if I want to move the light strip in the future. Will definitely be purchasing more products from LIFX in the future!! Awesome product!!! ***These pics are only a 3ft strip and I purchased a total of 9ft, still figuring out what to do with the remaining 6ft!",

My son has them in his room and hooks up to the google and voice command is so convenient. the white light nearly lights up the room well enough for regular use If I put one on the other side of the room it would get rid of all shadows and would work perfectly for substitute main lights we have now.",
