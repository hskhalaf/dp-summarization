It is so easy to set up, no directions needed. Plugged a fire stick right into the side of it and it works no problem. Picture isn\u2019t the sharpest but it\u2019s not bad either. The fan is a bit noisy but that was expected. Built in speakers are okay but I plugged it into my old Echo Tap for better audio. Overall this is a great value set. If you want more, you\u2019re gonna have to pay (a lot) more.",

It\u2019s very easy to adjust the focus and I can easily read closed captioning. The sound quality is very good too through the built in speakers. The only slight negatives are the remote needs to be pointed directly at the projector to adjust the volume, and the fan noise is a little loud.

I do intend to purchase a screen as I will be using this outdoors during the summer when we have parties and I can play music videos outside. AAA+",
