The fan won\u2019t start unless I spin the blades first (think 1920\u2019s biplane). Once it\u2019s finally spinning its so out of balance and something in the motor housing is rubbing. No way to access it to see if it\u2019s curable. Unfortunately, my return window closed before I could put in a return request. Going to replace it with a quality fan and throw this in the trash can. Lesson learned, you get what you pay for.",

If you like a cool warehouse look, and a lot of wind, it will work for you! My fiance can't take stuffy air nor heat. Toupees and weaves beware!! So, not a nursery item. But it does as instructed. And doesn't need a lot of balancing. But order the short pole attachment if you have less than 10 foot ceilings. You will get hurt hitting those blades!",

You would think that maybe I got a \"bad\" fan...because of the very loud sound that it makes...but I bought two fans of the exact make and model and both make the same noise. One fan is inside a workshop area 10' x 30'. The other fan is outside on porch area in a 10' x 20' area. I had a professional electrician mount and connect them...so we can't blame an amateur installation. Any way...pretty fan...but loud...and I would NOT repurchase.",

Believe this fan could remove some fingers if someone was silly enough to put them in front of moving blades. The fan comes with an electrical control switch, about the size of a Volkswagen. Definitley get something else. The fan is fairly inefficent as far as moving a lot of air; not too important to me. Lacks lighting; also not important to me. Easy to assemble and install. The fit of the ceiling cover cone is a bit flimsy.",
