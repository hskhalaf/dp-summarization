      "text": "Number of times car was stolen before purchase: 1 Number of times car was stolen after purchase: 0 I have a 1996 Honda Civic, and apparently the car is easy to steal. Mine was stolen from a park-and-ride while I was at work. They recovered the car in mostly very good shape, so I bought this and I've been using it ever since. If your car is one of many in a big lot, this will hopefully make the thief move on to someone else. Sorry other people at the park-and-ride!",
