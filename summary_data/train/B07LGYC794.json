I am not spared from the same and have this problem since last 10 years. To carry the foam band is very cumbersome but this band is easy to carry and store. Deflate, fold and store. To use, just unfold and inflate and done. This is perfect to relief the cervical pain. Keeping it always in my office bag to be used whenever required.",

The pump is removable after filling air in the pillow and it has a wheel lock which does not let air flow out after removing the pump. It is extemely supportive for the neck and its fitting size can be adjusted with the velcro straps. The only drawback is the air pipe cannot be removed and keeps hanging with the pillow. Apart from this fact, it's a great product and would recommend for people having cervical issues.",

      "text": "While I actually purchased this to use as a travel pillow, it seems very effective as a traction device. It goes from very flat to much taller than my neck with enough pumps of the bulb. One thing I am not a big fan of is the way you have to release the pressure. In order to deflate the device, you must remove the inflation bulb from the inflation hose. Which, of course, means you must reinsert the bulb into the hose to inflate it again. Still, for the price it seems like a reasonable design decision.",
