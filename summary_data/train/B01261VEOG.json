Ive had it at work over a month now and opened 1000s of bottles of wine with ease with it. I give this thing raving live reviews. I havent had a cork break off or any cork in the bottles since i purchased it. If the motor had gone out after 100 bottled id have called it worth my money but its still working 1000s later. It does seem to be going a little slower and the charger base is getting a tad finicky but ill just order another happily when it does go out.",

This product saves her hands from having to grip and twist the cork bottle opener. You can have a bottle of wine opened in four seconds with this product. The foil remover is super spiffy too because no more sliding a knife carefully around the edge! Just place over the foil, grip together and twist in one motion. This is a great product and as soon as I'm not broke anymore I'm getting myself one.",

As arthritis came with age, I found that even the rabbit ear could be difficult to use at times. When the electric bottle openers appeared, they held promise, but were unreliable and short lived. The Secura is the first one I have used that is a solid performer. On a single charge, the Secura is able to open several bottles without hesitation. Other similar openers petered out quickly and lost torque. This works well with artificial and composite corks. The Secura works so well that I'm disappointed now when I'm confronted with a screwcap top instead.",

Ok, so few months later, still works great and I bought about 4 more as gifts. All receipients love it!!",

The see-thru area is nice since one can see the progress of the cork extraction and it also serves as a way to see any obstructions that may impede its operation.

(As the corkscrew goes into the cork, the bottle starts turning and has to be held still with one hand while you work the opener with the other hand.)",

It says that the opener comes with a one year warranty. Mine quit working 6 days after my warranty was no longer valid, and it was actually getting slower well before that. I didn't do anything because I thought it was slow because of the cork. So, ease of use, it's a good purchase, but this one, only if you plan on replacing it often",

I originally purchased this because I broke my wrist and, of all the things I couldn\u2019t manage without the use of my right hand, opening a bottle of wine seemed to be most solvable. I read the reviews and opted for this opener \u2014 though it definitely wasn\u2019t the most expensive, so I had a twinge of doubt. But, I was so pleased with its beauty and graceful use that I ordered several more to give as gifts this Christmas. Nicely done!",

The product manual actually states that unless you are using it frequently, to charge it only once every 2-3 months. We don't keep it in the base because we don't want to damage the charger.

One of those clips fell off about 6 months in, and I managed to glue it back on so that it can still charge. Last week, another one fell off and disappeared, so now I'm left with an electric wine opener that can never be charged again. Note that I'm not a frequent user of this wine opener (at most once every two weeks), and I'm not throwing it around aggressively either.",

I thought I was just doing it wrong, but as it turns out it was just a bad tool. I splurged and got this and it has been a God send! It looks super sleek on my counter and it opens bottles within seconds. And the corks aren't all torn up and I'm now collecting them for decoration. However it is a tiny bit loud, but it doesn't bother me. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a new wine opener!",

It replaced a Brookstone electric wine opener (a model no longer available from them) which I had for several years and was quite pleased with it until lately the black plastic housing started to get soft and tacky. That is one reason the Secura wine opener appealed to me...the stainless steel housing. My only complaint, and it is a very minor one, is that the foil cutter mounting technique requires two hands to remove and replace. The Brookstone one was an easy one-hand operation.",
