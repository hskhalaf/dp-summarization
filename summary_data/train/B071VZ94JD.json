      "text": "This is as good a ball peen hammer as you can buy...better than the Vaughn ball peen hammers at the big box stores...and cheaper. Great feel...well balanced...nice head weight...well made. The rubberized fiberglass handle is very nice. I paid $2.00 less for this hammer than a 16 oz Craftsman with a wooden handle. Hammers are hammers generally...so the difference is in the handle and grip. Get this one. Highly recommended.",

I used to use those 12 oz claw hammer to hammer down the nails but with this 24oz things are lot easier. It's a must have tool for your home workshop.",
