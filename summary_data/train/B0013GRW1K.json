Each kit had the supplies necessary to complete the project. Why give the product only three stars? The glue stick that comes with the kit is terrible. So frustrating for a little one (we were working with children 4 - 8) to apply a part and immediately have it fall off because the glue would not hold. We eventually had to find an old Elmer's glue stick and go from there. The glue stick needs to be high quality that will ensure immediate bonding.",

No frustration that you run out of a certain shape or color. The instructions are easy for a toddler to follow also. No reading required, just the ability to match colors and shapes.",

No yellow. I have 3 boys and this caused a problem. I was hoping to at least get a yellow, green and blue for them. I almost ordered a cheaper one that had more inside.... so just be aware that you could get duplicates monsters then the 5 differnt shown.",

The 2 year old needed lots of help, but the 6 year old could do most of it himself. Then they ran around with their puppets growling and chasing each other and laughing like little crazies.",

The package includes everything that you'd need to make paper puppets without a MESS (yes!) It has combination of cardstock cut outs and stickers to build the craft. And the kids love stickers. The end result is wow and the child and parents both feel the sense of accomplishment. The crafts made using Alex toys kits are always display -worthy",

Glue sticks work fine where both surfaces are fairly rigid and neither will be pulled or bent, but the paper bags in this project are not at all rigid and, given that they are puppets, are meant to have hands put inside them for play. Every single glued piece popped off as soon as it was dry, including legs, tails, mouths and eyes. I had to go through and reinforce every connection with masking tape, which was annoying and lengthy and in some cases tricky to do without messing up the look. Once that was done, my girls had a great time playing with their puppets!",

Got a little one who loves art and hands on crafts? Definitely buy these little puppets. Your child willl love them.",

The grandparents was able to read the directions and help the child know how to assemble parts in proper sequence. I will use this, or another one of ALEX Toys Little Hands kits, again next year.

The puppets are easy to make are very fun to play with afterwards with the kids. The company gives you directions for each animal to make it easy to follow. Great for young kids!",

Perfect activity for my 2 1/2 year old and me to do while my youngest is taking a nap. She can then play with it while I attend to other things that need my attention. I didn't give it 5 stars because it is still a paper bag (but a very thick, sturdy one)... don't expect them to last very long with much play. For the price would definitely recommend though.",
