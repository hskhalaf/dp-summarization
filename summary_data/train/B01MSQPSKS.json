Paid for a pair and one is useless. UPDATE! I have changed my rating to 5 stars. Unexpectedly today I received two more whistles in the mail. Both work beautifully and super loud. I can only assume the seller read my review and took it upon themselves to make my order right. Excellent product and customer service. Thank you.",

Admittedly, the whistle works ok, but I collect and wear one everyday and I like an exceptional product, I already have several of the cheesy ones. Rather than waste my time getting to the UPS store 32 miles away, I just made these whistles as gifts to friends. FURA makes a whistle of similar quality but much better sound. I currently wear the Fenix NW20. My message to the seller...stop misrepresenting what you are offering. Other than that this piece would get no more than three stars.",

I don't even try to blow very hard purposely and it is still loud, but not deafening. However if you want to use it to its full potential it is definitely LOUD. Works great with the pup, he comes running every time. Again I use it softly for the sake of my pup's ears and so my neighbors don't go crazy. Will be using the second one for emergencies, so turned out great to have 2. Highly recommended for both training and emergencies.",

The manufacturer should have gone the extra mile and just used stainless or aluminum rings and chain. A quick fix is just to eliminate them and find a stainless or aluminum ring or just use a piece of cordage.",

I think the whistle works well, but it would be prudent to wear earplugs under a set of good quality noise-cancelling headphones to use it. That\u2019s why I gave it four stars - you need protective gear. Nearby animals with sensitive hearing will likely drop dead and any indoor use will result in family derision and censure.",
