(He was surprised at the quality, (he is a camera tech fan, and owns a few SLRs). This camera is small and very user friendly. It allows you to shoot in all kinds of conditions and pull out the perfect shot. My friends always ask for my pictures when we all take them, because mine are always so clear and nice. This camera comes with nice easy software too, which allows you to stitch a HUGE Panoramic shot (really awesome feature) Great photos, great battery life, awesome features, and really easy to use.",

Before I gave her the camera, I had a chance to use it to make a video of my SIP & PUFF kayak project to post on YouTube. The video can be seen at the link below. My only wish is that the camera saved video in a format that is directly compatible with YouTube. Not to worry though... I found a really great and free converter program at RadVideoTools to eaily convert the MP4 file to AVI with no loss of video quality. Here's the video link: [...]",

I bought it because it has one of the longer optical zoom ranges in a point and shoot; I don't like the digital zoom feature on any of the point and shoots as too much detail is lost. Overall it's a great little camera to tote around and it produces nice, every-day pictures with great color. I am a little disappointed with it's autofocus on landscape and garden shots, it does not always pick appropriate points of focus. It's low light performance is not particularly great either, although that is pretty typical in this level of camera.",

It blows away the older 870 (which I loved when it was new) and the HD movie quality is good. The movie quality is not as good as a $1000 HD camcorder, but for a compact camera, it is superb. We have a new baby and my husband recorded several HD movies of the baby while we were at the hospital. Out-of-town family said they felt they really got to know the little one based on the quality of the videos we sent out.",

      "text": "The new Canon SD970IS Digital Camera represents the expected quality from this legacy of point-and-shoot cameras. The ease of use is much enhanced over the 5 MP Elph we replaced. The view screen is larger; anti-motion and 5X digital zoom, and the auto mode-select all work smoothly and quickly. We also find it easier to photograph toddlers, since the time lag between pushing the button and the shutter click is much shorter. The exposure monitoring also follows faces well, so the subject is less apt move out of the area of optimal exposure. Finally, the CPU and photo storage rates are significantly faster, so larger image sizes can be used routinely. Thus, sharp 8x10 images are the norm.",

Canon provided great service for some of my camera's problems, so now it works very well.

    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nCool curves, powerful features and a fun new way to operate the camera mark Canon\u2019s PowerShot SD970 IS Digital ELPH. Amazing resolution and expanded editing options are yours with 12.1 megapixels, and you can even create HD movies. Shooting is fun and easy with Smart AUTO that makes all your shots better effortlessly, and there\u2019s a new user-friendly interface. And see how much fun it is to browse through your photos and even speed up image advance with a shake or tilt of the camera! \n\nPowerShot SD970 IS Highlights \n\n\n\n12.1 megapixels plus 5x optical zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer\nCanon\u2019s commitment to innovation defines the excitement of the PowerShot SD970 IS Digital ELPH. 12.1-megapixel resolution is more than a number, it\u2019s your cutting-edge link to the outstanding clarity and quality you\u2019ve always wanted in your images. Think bold and big, because razor-sharp, oversized prints are a breeze. Get the picture? It\u2019s absolutely brilliant. \n\nThe PowerShot SD970 IS Digital ELPH has a 5x optical zoom lens that makes it easy to get the inspiring, emotive close-ups that will make your images lasting keepsakes. This magnificent lens gives you the power to shoot distant subjects with razor-sharp precision and stunning lifelike color. So you can brilliantly capture a bird high atop a tree, a child\u2019s winning goal from across the stadium or a school play from the last row. \n\nThe PowerShot SD970 IS Digital ELPH is equipped with Canon\u2019s acclaimed Optical Image Stabilizer Technology that automatically detects and corrects camera shake--one of the leading causes of fuzzy or blurred shots. Even when zoomed in, you can get the steady, crisp, brilliant images you\u2019ll be proud to shoot and share. And Canon\u2019s Optical Image Stabilizer Technology is so convenient to use. It functions perfectly with or without a flash. \n\nHD movie shooting capability plus HDMI output\nThe PowerShot SD970 IS Digital ELPH lets you record video in beautiful high definition (1280 x 720 pixels). The camera also makes it easy to enjoy HD movies (and still photos) on your HDTV with a mini-HDMI connector for direct connection to a high-definition monitor. You\u2019ll enjoy the HD experience with no degradation of image or audio in the signal, plus the ability to display up to 130 still images at once. \n\nSmart AUTO intelligently selects the proper settings\nJust set the Canon PowerShot SD970 IS Digital ELPH to Smart AUTO and you\u2019re ready for maximum enjoyment from your picture taking every time. It\u2019s a relaxing and satisfying way to shoot because you can completely concentrate on your subject knowing that the camera has the technical details covered. Advanced Canon technology intelligently analyzes your situation and shooting conditions. Then it automatically selects an appropriate setting from 18 specially defined settings. So whether you\u2019re photographing flowers, a captivating sunset, or your friends at the park, you can be confident that you\u2019re getting dramatic, memorable images. \n\nShooting Modes \nAdvanced presets for the best possible photos under certain conditions. With 20 Shooting Modes, you\u2019re ready for whatever shot comes your way. \n\nNew Active display technology\nActive Display is a fun new feature powered by an accelerometer built into the PowerShot SD970 IS Digital ELPH. When browsing through your images in playback, just give the camera a quick shake to advance or return images one frame at a time. Tilting the camera will activate continuous image advance, and tilting at a further angle will make the images advance more quickly.\nSimply tilt the SD970 IS to advance images \nZoom Blur and Creative Light Effect produce fun, original effects\nZoom Blur is a classic photo effect that takes some technical skill to create, whether on film or in the editing process. But the PowerShot SD970 IS Digital ELPH\u2019s new Zoom Blur feature makes the look easy to achieve. Simply shoot with the feature activated, and the camera zooms during exposure for a great effect. \n\nCreative Light Effect Special Scene mode can turn your image into a whimsical work of art by changing twinkling light sources in the background of night scenes into stars, hearts or other shapes. \n\nLarge, high-quality 3.0-inch PureColor LCD II with wide viewing angle\nThe PowerShot SD970 IS Digital ELPH gives you large 3.0-inch LCD screen for excellent control when framing your shots. Canon\u2019s high-quality PureColor LCD II (461,000 dots) offers spectacular color, resolution and contrast even when viewed at an angle. The screen is highly durable and easy to see in any light with a scratch-resistant, anti-reflective coating. It also features Night Display for easy viewing in low light--a perfect feature for gathering friends and family around to see your images. \n\nA World of Advantages with Canon\u2019s Technology \n\nCanon's DIGIC 4 image processor has evolved Face Detection Technology that tracks the faces of moving subjects and lets the shooter enter the frame seamlessly with the Face Detection Self-Timer. \n\nDIGIC 4 Image Processor\nCanon\u2019s most advanced image processor, DIGIC 4, delivers evolved Face Detection Technology that keeps every face in every photo looking its very best. The technology finds and tracks the faces of moving subjects until you\u2019re ready to shoot, then delivers perfect focus. In addition, exposure, flash and white balance are compensated, so that faces exhibit natural skin tones and backgrounds are properly exposed. \n\niSAPS Technology is an entirely original scene-recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos, iSAPS works with the advanced DIGIC 4 image processor to improve focus speed and accuracy, as well as exposure and white balance. \n\nA Face Detection Self-Timer automatically detects an increase in the number of faces and makes the appropriate adjustments. For instance, to include the photographer\u2019s face in a group shot, there\u2019s no need to rush in. Just put the camera on a stand or tripod, specify Face Detection Self-Timer, and the camera will wait for the photographer\u2019s face to get on-camera before it takes the shot. Motion Detection tracks moving subjects in a much larger range, and the Servo AF retains focus on a moving subject after the shutter button is pressed halfway--allowing you to wait for the perfect shot without refocusing. \n\nIntelligent Contrast Correction\nDIGIC 4 also makes possible the i-Contrast (Intelligent Contrast Correction) system, which controls the compensation level in pixel units to brighten dark areas while leaving bright areas unchanged for better images where the main subject is dark, and more natural transition. The PowerShot SD970 IS Digital ELPH can even use i-Contrast in playback mode to adjust images that were shot without the setting activated. \n\nRed-eye Correction provides three options for removing red-eye from subjects in flash pictures.\n1) Red-eye Correction during shooting actually identifies and corrects red-eye in human subjects as pictures are taken.\n2) The PowerShot SD970 IS Digital ELPH can be set to automatically detect and correct red-eye during image playback.\n3) You can manually locate any red eyes in a scene during image playback on the LCD screen, and command the camera to remove them. \n\nLife doesn\u2019t give you second chances to capture special times. That\u2019s why the PowerShot SD970 IS Digital ELPH features an ISO 1600 setting that reduces the effects of camera shake and sharpens subjects in low-light situations, giving you greater shooting flexibility. ISO can be expanded to 3200 when you select ISO 3200 Special Scene mode. \n\nBlink Detection\nBlinking subjects can ruin the best shots, and the problem usually isn\u2019t detected until it\u2019s too late to do anything about it. The PowerShot SD970 IS Digital ELPH is equipped with Canon\u2019s new Blink Detection to combat this common image flaw. The feature uses the power of Face Detection to determine whether any subject in the previous shot had closed eyes. If closed eyes are detected, a \"blink warning\" icon appears for 3 seconds, allowing you to retake the shot before your subject or subjects move on. \n\n\n\nWhat's in the Box\n\n * PowerShot SD970 IS Digital ELPH body \n * Lithium-ion battery pack (NB-5L) \n * Battery charger (CB-2LX) \n * Wrist strap (WS-DC7) \n * Digital Camera Solution CD-ROM \n * USB interface cable (IFC-400PCU) \n * AV cable (AVC-DC400)",
