The fit can take some getting used to, but after a week or two it becomes natural. Three year warranty seals the deal.",

There is a slight mid-bass enhancement in the T10, which in most cases would be welcome. In full symphonic orchestration, however, the tuba and string basses overwhelm just a bit. If this bothers it is easily corrected with the \"bass reduction\" tab in the iPad equalization. I have ordered the RHA T20 set, though, which are supposed to be without the bass enhancement. I'll keep both sets and use both; that's how much I like the RHA T10.",

They sound amazing. The build materials are top notch. The only fault I find is the cord. It's very rubbery. It gets caught on everything. It tangles and is hard to untangle because the wire sticks to itself.",

Beginning from packaging to putting them on the ears, its just worth every penny/dime/dollar/rs/yen spent on it. I also do lot of Binaural sounds, it totally suits the purpose.",

These headphones are bass heavy but do not distort the sound at all, very deep and clean bass, again, it seems impossible that these little things can pump out that kind of sound without distortion. Buyer beware, these are very bass-ey headphones, even with the non-bass tips they are still bass heavy. For everyone else, have fun because these are stellar. You get the sound of pair of beats solo 2s without the hassle of carrying those things around.",
