The included guide and shoes are very helpful and adequately constructed to inspire confidence. With good technique to can avoid snipe pretty easily with this planner and it works as advertised.",

Tried to replace brush but screw would not hold in plastic threads and brush holder was displaced causing motor to spark. The problem is the design of the motor brush holder is a poor design.",

You have to assemble it every time you use it, takes a long time and is quite difficult -Not worth it. I thought bosch was good but I guess they are only good at making drill bits and stuff like that, not power tools.",

Regarding snipe...yes, you can have that happen but it's not the tools fault, more like operator error. I always add sacrificial pieces and I totally avoid snipe. As with any power tool, you need to pay attention when using it and focus on your work and the tool. If you follow tool instructions, you don't even need sacrificial pieces but it's kind of a safety net if you will. Practice on cheap lumber first to get the \"feel\" of the planer and you will be just fine.",
