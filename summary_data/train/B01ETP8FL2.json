Coverage is good, you don't have to use a lot, and I like that it has an SPF component to it. I've used it a couple years now, will continue to unless they come out with something better!",

You can\u2019t even tell you have makeup on and it provides just enough coverage to even out your skin tone. I like that it has spf too. I still put some extra concealer on if needed and it blends great. Very happy with this product!",
