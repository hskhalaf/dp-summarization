He's the one that gets frustrated at puzzles, so it's been reassuring to watch him carefully construct things. Definitely developmental progress. For something with a lot of pieces (we have 3 sets of 30 for our crew), it's easy to clean up since they stick to each other. My husband and I like to mess with these a bit too!",

She has had a jewel tone colored set for at least 2 yrs. now, that all of her little friends love to play with, and they must be a great, strong quality toy because she breaks everything, but not these. I do make her keep them picked up after play, so they don't get broken. I've been concerned about the small magnets inside of them, but none have ever broke. They are a well made toy that the kids always love to play with.",
