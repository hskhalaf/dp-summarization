My local Academy Sports and Cabela's sell at the same price point but with the Illuminated scope which from my experience is much better in dim light.

I did replace the scope that came with it but this crossbow shoots very consistently and with a good bolt and broadhead....You will have no problem taking any game animal.

I took it out and shot it at 20 yds. Bolts were hitting low and right. I adjusted the scope 60 clicks up and 60 clicks left and BINGO, I was dead on (with field points). This CrossBow seems to pack a lot of power and buries the bolt deep into the target. I will have it out hunting early next week. Great purchase!!!",

I ended up buying a different scope at a sporting goods store for around $50 which works perfectly.

Definitely you need a target block designed for a crossbow. For a newby this is really a relatively inexpensive way to start and I doubt I\u2019ll need something more elaborate.

Go out and buy good bolts for it and extra luminocks, because all the deer you shoot it goes right through them and inbeds into the ground never finding it. Also buy a de - cocking arrow so you don't ruin yours. Take care of your strings and rail and it will take care of you. Hope it helps , Happy Hunting from CT.",

The deer was at a slight angle when I shot. It hit right where I put it. The arrow through the deer hitting the vitals and out the other side. The deer ran about 50 yds and dropped.

The bolts that came with it aren't too good, fletching came off them after only 2 shots each. I replaced the bolts with better ones. The only downside I've come across is the sling swivels rattle when walking, stalking or just moving around. UPDATE TO ORIGINAL REVIEW: This season I took crossbow out and cocked it to check sighting and the upper right arm is de-laminating. I have contacted manufacturer and will update again after resolution.",

Tenpoint or Stryker could rebrand this bow and sell it 700-800 and customers would be very happy with it at that price. Compared to my styker 380 it is a little heavier and has a much longer trigger pull, however it shoots tighter groups and hits just as hard.
