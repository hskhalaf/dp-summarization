However, after I purchased the pen and tried to buy MyScript, I found out that the software is no longer available for purchase. I contacted Livescribe and they confirmed that they no longer offer a way to convert notes to digital text, even though their website still claims this is possible.",

No need to capture word for word as the audio is captured. However, I am not considering a third purchase as the pens just do not last. The display wears out quickly and has a lot of glitches. Customer Support is non-existent. The pen will typically last just beyond the warranty leaving you with no claim for a replacement. I wish either a) they would improve the product or b) have a competitor create a better product.",

The problem is that the desktop software for Mac (Echo Desktop or older versions) is filled with bugs leading to almost immediate crashes. Spent several months working with Livescribe technical support, as this happens on two different Macs. Bottom line is that there is no fix available for the Mac version of the software and the only recommendation is to use a PC. So if you are a Windows based user, you should be OK and the pen will work well. If you use a Mac, your notes will never make it to a usable format on your desktop. Really a shame, because there are really no good alternatives.",

The charging port fell into the pen and it can no longer be plugged in to charge or transfer files. I'm in nursing school and use the pen to record lectures (each class has around 4-5 hours of lecture). It is uncomfortable to write with for that length of time, so I buy the 5 x 8 pads of paper and write out a few bullet points.",

The Pen works very well, audio capture is clean even in a large room, simplicity is awesome, and the actual ink capture is very accurate. But my efforts to sort and copy the notes or Pencasts to my iPad for review have been very tricky. Seems that the development of the Pencast iPad app has stalled - they should really pick that back up...",
