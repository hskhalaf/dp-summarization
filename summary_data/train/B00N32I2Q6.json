That is a quality problem, not a lemon! It is now out of the 1 yr warranty so I am left with a LEMON of a BOSE! Shame on a company that sells high priced products that are actually poor quality",

It would connect then disconnect with my iPad several times during my short uses....always \"announcing\" that I was connected or disconnected. Did not make for a pleasurable listening environment. Then I discovered that if I connect an auxiliary cable to the Bose and my iPad- I no longer get connected/disconnected. So much for the joys of wireless - but at least I could use it. Today, I discover that despite having been plugged in for some time, the battery is dead. DEAD! what a waste of money.",

All that being said, this thing rocks! It fills a room just like you'd expect a Bose product to! Easy to pair. Getting the cable into the charging port was slightly tricky. The outer covering of the unit is rubbery, I thought it was hard plastic, no worries though. Oh, the color IS NOT red, it's closer to coral/orange.",

However because the battery has died after less than 15 months of actual use (purchased as Christmas gift) I can only give it 3 stars. Use was on average only a couple times a week means that after about 150 times and aproximately 75 or less charges it failed to hold a charge. Now I must try to find if I can even replace the battery. hopefully a quality battery can be purchased if it can even be replaced by a purchaser and if it can be found at a reasonable price.",

I was a little worried at first that this portable speaker wouldn't be up to his standards, but after a few days of rave reviews, I was so pleasantly surprised. The speaker really lives up to the Bose name,delivering clear, crisp sound with impressive bass for such a small package. My parents use it by their pool and they absolutely love it. The bluetooth receiver works from across the yard and the battery lasts an impressively long time. Overall a great purchase for the money.",

The size is perfect for her, it's not too big but not too small. We can put the volume up all the way with hardly any distortion in the sound. If anything changes I will update.",
