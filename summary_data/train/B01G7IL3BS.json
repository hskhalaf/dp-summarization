No more ice or \"cold packs\" required to keep those drinks chilled. This is especially nice when you are returning home from a visit and forget to load that cooler.

All 3 of them bad capacitors on the controller/power board. Was able to \"fix\" the first two by just replacing all the capacitors on the boards, plugged back in and tada, works as usual, this one, the 6 can, died in a puff of smoke. A capacitor popped and caused the on board UF transformer to over heat and leak black goo/tar along the inner casing. Not a pleasant sight after I opened the unit, this one I am just throwing out, looking for a better, not cheaply made, brand.",

Its a little bigger then i thought it would be and the back is a little bulky but its great. Keeps everything perfect and cold and the sound isnt loud at all on mine?? its like barely a hum but also its in my bathroom so its not like i hear it often so maybe if you kept it in your room it could be annoying but white noise/humming doesnt bother me (its super quiet imo). If you need a sign to buy this here it is!! Buy this!! (it makes me so excited to wash my face)!",

My one complaint is that it's surprisingly light, so when you try to open the door it just slides on the desk and doesn't open. Some better grips on the bottom or something would be nice. I haven't tried it yet, but I like that it comes with a car plug so you can travel with baby bottles, medicine, etc. It also has a warming feature, but I don't care for hot soda so I haven't tested it out. Overall, a nice addition to the office!",

If you want it to keep the beverages cold, it will keep them cool if you place too many inside, but cold enough for a cool refreshing drink. Suggestion to the vendor!!

Vertically, it fits two 4oz bottles stacked or one 4oz (ameda) and one 5oz (Medela) but only if you use the flat, low profile lids (Medela). I can cram 10 bottles (45oz) in this way, after taking off the door shelf thing. Be warned, it's not as cold as a proper fridge. If you have a preemie or a newborn you might want to put some frozen bottles in there and keep an eye on the temp. I've been using it 24/7 from abt one month. Still going strong 4 months later.",

The USB battery pack mode is mediocre and only good if you have access to ice for your drinks but it is better than dropping ice into a room temp drink or worse a drink in the back seat/trunk of a hot car. This will fit canned drinks well but 20oz sodas and sports drinks are just barely too tall to fit. Would recommend but wish it was a little taller to fit soda bottles at least.",

Our thermoelectric cooling system is popularly used as a beverage cooler, but the warming function shouldn't be ignored. Save time in the morning by bringing your breakfast with you or save money by bringing your lunch and keeping it warm all day. Plus, we included both AC, DC and USB power cords to make the switch from standard (110V) to car (12V) to USB 2A power bank easy and convenient. No need to buy extra wires! We made it incredibly easy to switch from the cooling to the warming function as well. An easy-to-read display lights what setting the appliance is on and can be changed by simply flipping a switch. The Cooler & Warmer produces almost no noise (perfect for next to your bed to save a walk to the kitchen) and is compact and sleek enough to put on a desk at work. Cleaning the interior and exterior is extremely easy, simply wipe them down and the storage shelf inside is removable as well (for even easier cleaning as well as expanding to hold four 16 oz. bottles.)
