Even though the velcro is extremely tough, (and hard to undo), the boots have not held up. The lining is coming apart from the shell, and they fall down. This review is subsequent to my prior review in which I was quite satisfied, but it only took about 3 months for them to start coming apart. I am not sure if they have a warranty.",

They were a little big (too much overlap on her finer bones) on my 13.3 hand QH and a little small (barely made it around her thicker cannon and fetlock and a bit short on the hinds) on my 15.2 Warmblood cross. Hope that helps you get an idea on sizing. Overall loved the boots and will be buying more.",

They fit well and are of heavy material and I've had no problem with seams that weren't sewn properly. As others wrote the velcro is REALLY STRONG!!!!!!!!! So be prepared to use some finger strength. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I saw that they were made in China and I prefer to shop American and I think the SMBII are made in the USA.",
