There will always be some things that are annoying but the pros outweigh the cons. it really is a well-made game when it is running as intended and worth every penny for its entertainment value.",

You can virtually never run out of activities, missions, challenges, and things to do of all sorts in this game of Unity. And given that you can team up with other assassin's (real friends or strangers) in numerous missions and co-op WHEN YOU CHOOSE, makes this a true game changer gaming. You wanna be a loner, be a loner. You wanna be social, be social. YOU DEFINE THIS GAME!!! The graphics are the best yet with stunning visual effects, interactions in battle and on the streets of Paris. THIS IS A TRUE MASTERPIECE FOR AC DEVELOPERS & GAMERS!!! ^5",

The graphics are beautiful, the story is interesting, the city is teeming with life, and you get a real sense of the incredible divide between the rich and poor during the French Revolution. Assassin's Creed as a series has a lot of issues, but that's Ubisoft's fault, not the developers and testers and designers who clearly poured passion into this project. If you haven't tried this game I'd recommend giving it a shot, especially when it's on sale.",

With an i7 4790K/GTX980/16GB DDR3 this game should run great at 1080p, but still struggles hard to maintain 60 fps, and even then there's artifacting and strange bugs, people falling out of the sky, into the ground. Black Flag was bad too, but at least playable, this one is borderline playable. It's a shame too since the modern sci-fi segments of the game where your character gets warped into some future dimension are some of the most interesting parts of the game.",

My internet connection isn't fast, but I really expected a system like Origin, for instance, which allows to save the game when the pc shuts down and then it resumes the download. So, I wonder, Does Ubisoft expect that my computer to be turned on for 3 days until download the whole files? or I am doing something wrong?",

The game also slim lined a lot of stuff which was a good thing in my opinion. Hopefully the game continues to improve with DLC and updates.",

Overall I love this game especially since I hated AC3. Note: frame rate is good on my gtx 780 but I don't expect everyone to have it. Hence a bad design from ubisoft.

I've not been able to get past the 3rd mission due to the game just, stopping. Very frustrating. Remember when new games use to be complete when they were released? It'd be nice if we could go back to that. Thanks.",
