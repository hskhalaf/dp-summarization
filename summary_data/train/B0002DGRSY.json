Our smallest is a rescue Terrier and we will sometimes cut them up in very small pieces and sprinkle it on his breakfast to get them to eat. I highly recommend the streets to everyone!",

The only thing is the chunks are rather big and I need to use a hammer to break them apart into small pieces which makes a powdery mess in the process.",

They had these treats and the treats never made my pup sick or made his stool soft. All my dogs love them and from the video I tried a bite and was impressed how good it was. Its simple.... Freeze dried chicken..... nothing else. Price is reasonable. just a piece of advice buy two tubs. During shipping the pieces get broken up more and there is powder at the bottom. Still can use that to sprinkle on their food, but ran out before I could buy more. AWESOME, EXCELLENT, ate them myself.",
