The stirring spoon, while thin by necessity, doesn't bend after applying pressure (I essentially did a stress test). The main chamber and jigger are a satisfying thickness without feeling too bulky. The only thing I'd like to have seen is a \"half\" marker on each side of the jigger. This isn't a huge minus for me, though.",

I love the little measuring cup...I felt like Tom Cruise in Cocktail using it in front of our friends...although my wife discouraged me from throwing bottles in the air!

Its a good product and package.",
