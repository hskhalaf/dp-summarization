The adjustable wrench popped out of position, but I was trying to do something it wasn't designed for. No surprises. This set really impresses me. I've replaced a shower stall, exhaust fan, lighting, and several other projects. It works great for quick jobs.",

The only thing is I WISH it had wrench extensions, but that was because cars have bolts/screws in some of the most hard to reach places...but oh well!",
