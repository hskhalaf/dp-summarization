But waiting on adding a new candle before review. Chandeliers are 0 for 3. At least one candle doesn't burn properly and oozes wax everywhere. Failure........ look at what dripped on the sink. Yes testing over a sink if that tells you anything....",

Last night I lit the candles at 7:00 pm and this morning at 7 am one candle burned out, the other two burned out about an hour from each other after 7 pm. I tucked a blanket underneath the bedroom door and through the night the room was decently warm enough to avoid turning on the furnace. Great investment and a great backup if you find yourself suddently homeless, living in your car and needing warmth.",

It won't keep you warm if the temps are below 40 degrees F, but it definitely takes the chill out of the air on cool nights. The top gets hot enough to boil water for tea, so yeah - it puts out some heat. The candles are expensive, but there are YouTube hacks for making your own. Easier and cheaper to buy them unless you use it daily tho. No odor, no smoke, just light, and heat. Highly recommend.",

The candles are secure inside the metal holders so they do not tilt or fall. The springs inside the metal holders keep the candles pushed up to the top, and there is a viewing window to see how much of the candles are left. The lantern seems to be of good quality. I hesitated on spending the money because it seems pricey, but I'm glad that I finally did. After seeing it in person, I feel much better about the safety of the lantern [cats, children knocking it over].",

The only shortcoming is the requirement to use UCO candles - but it's worth it because they burn completely with no drip and virtually no soot. If you don't need the light of three candles, burn one at a time and get 27 hours of light before you have to replace the candles. A terrific product that's great for personal use or to give as a gift. Useful and Attractive.",

      "text": "If the lights go out, this is the very thing that you need. It is always ready, no batteries needed. The fire is encased in a protective shield so there is very little chance it will burn anything. The candles burn slowly and I always keep a supply on hand. Much better than a flashlight.",
