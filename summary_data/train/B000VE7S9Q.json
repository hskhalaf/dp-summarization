When i was flying a desk, they were awesome: good for VOIP calls, a long enough range to go all the way to the bathroom, paired fast with my computer or iPhone, and the sound was Sony. But there was no way I could wear them on the street. They just kept falling off. And running was impossible with them. Now I have a job where I have to use closed-air headphones, and these sit on a shelf. :\\",

I find these much more comfortable and they do have a good sound but the folding headband is crappy and cheap. It causes the speakers to ride forward on my ears as I walk forceing me to constantly readjust them. Just fair warning to if they rattle around in a backpack or pocket they will totally disassemble themselves i.e. the speakers will pop out of the frame and just dangle there by their wires. They arn't perfect yet, but this is a decent working Bluetooth pair that does have a stable sound, and pairs easily to an iPhone 4.",

The sound quality is just ok, the range is fair, the battery life is fine. The two biggest problems is the sound is not really that impressive and the overall quality is a bit flimsy. It folds up, then folds in half. Sounds good, but without a carrying case, it doesn't \"lock up\" into place, it just flops around. I don't mind it, but for $50 I'd expect better. I'm thinking of replacing them with a nicer set, haven't decided yet. I wouldn't order them again, given the choice.",

It usually doesn't work until I go into the phones bluetooth menu and drop and reconnect the headset. I don't have this problem with my netbook. My guess is that the glitch is in the phone and not the headset. Sound quality is what you would expect from phones of this size (not much bass). The microphone seems to work well also.",
