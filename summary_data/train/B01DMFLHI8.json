I test on the forearm and the two times I tested I got ample blood and no pain. I used OneTouch strips, but I did not insert them all the way down into the barrel ( I left it about 1/8\" from fully inserted). Sweet!.

It also didn't hurt as much as the branded lancing device and drew enough blood to get a good reading without having to re-puncture the skin. The little button to remove the needle is very useful and the biggest plus point is that it works with the Microlet needle so you don't have to buy another whole set of new needles. Worth the price!

Two notches lower means that it doesn't poke through my skin as far as the others. At least in my case, less depth = less pain.",
