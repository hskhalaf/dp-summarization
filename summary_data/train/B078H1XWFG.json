I'm not a tech guy, but it only took about a half an hour to get the old TV off the stand and this one set up, a power cord and three HDMI cables for all the different gear, cable, Blu ray, and XBox. A Philipps screwdriver is the only tool needed for assembly, a total of eight screws to secure it to the stand. Then everything is at your fingertips. The graphics are clean! I mean the definition is absolutely clear. The Sound is incredible. The screen is actually a speaker which is just awesome. Can't believe how crazy this is. This is one cool TV.",

There was an LG OLED tv next to the one I was going to purchase, and fell in love with the picture quality. The clerk told me that this Sony XBR55A8F was the best overall as far as image clarity, and when I compared the two, Sony was clearest picture by far. OLED is the next level in image quality and Sony is the #1 overall. The speakers in the television will blow you away also!",
