I bought these Fiskars pruning shears and a pair of Fiskars loppers, because the brand is well-known, which I (wrongly) assumed counted for quality. I mean, how do you get to be well-known if your product doesn't work? Neither of them were sharp, and the blades of these little pruners ... I'm not sure how to explain this... preferred to spread sideways - path of least resistance - instead of straight through the small bush branches I was trying to prune. I'm going to try to send both back.",

I've tried tightening the mechanism to no avail. I'll use them but with something jammed into the slot to keep them open. Shouldn't have to do that.

I'd say that if you plan on using these for general gardening, cutting flower stems or thick weeds, these bad boys will tear through those tasks. If you need to cut thicker items, these will also do the trick but likely wear them out much faster. When my pair dies, I definitely plan on re-ordering the same pair.",

I can understand reducing the spring pressure so us old folks don\u2019t get tired hands from squeezing but to have to manually reset the shears after every cut is awful. Will dis-assemble, oil up and try again... maybe get a stronger spring from the hardware store",
