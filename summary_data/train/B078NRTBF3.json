I purchased two separate products from Best Buy: $200.00 Surge Protector & 125.00 Surge Protector. I made this purchase to see if the Device needed an \"Expensive Power Supply.\" The product was still unable to \"act as described.\" The look is breathtaking and the design is sleek, it doesn't work though.

Wireless charging is much easier since you don't have to worry with plugging and unplugging the phone, especially if you are already in bed and have to check a msg. play a couple game, or whatever else. I highly recommend this charger. With a 1 year warranty I feel covered in case anything does happen to it down the road.",

      "text": "I ordered last 13Apr18 and amazon expected date is today - 19Apr18. Guess what? I received it in good condition last Monday -16Apr18. Great job Ibis! The device is working smooth and no issue so far. Here\u2019s a simple tip you might find handy, make sure you turn off vibrate on your phone before charging, or else your phone will fall off from the pad when you received any notification. Another observation, it\u2019s a great buddy of Samsung Galaxy devices like S9+ and Edge7. Charging in full for only 2hours or less. Overall, this wireless charger rocks! I would highly recommend this to my friends. Peace out! \\m/",
