He then decided he would prefer to turn what we had constructed into a spaceship instead of the dinosaur, and took creative reign at that point, but I think in a year or so, he will have the patience to actually complete this as designed. In spite of not using it as designed, the kit is really cool, and he absolutely loves the claws and bones, etc and uses them with his other lego sets.",

Lego.com also provided additional instructions to build a diplodocus, dinosaur airplane, and anklosaurus. Another website had instructions for a mantis and baby dragon (see picture). This set complements other retired sets such as Ferocious Creatures and Mythical Monsters. No doubt, Lego will release something similar in a couple years. I can't recommend paying more than $18 for this set though. For $20 or more, there are plenty of others you can get and which have more pieces.",

It was purchased for a 3 year old, so he definitely needed help building it but he could pick out a lot of the pieces and complete simple tasks. It makes a fun dino to play with once assembled - just be warned that you will want to order three sets so you can assemble all three dinos at once without having to disassemble/reassemble the pieces.",
