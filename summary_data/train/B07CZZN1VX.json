      "text": "Really great size, small and compact while still being very powerful. It actually hurt just a little when I first used it. Power is comparable to my hospital grade Medela symphony and Spectra S2 with even more suction modes. I was able to use Spectra adapter tubing to use this pump with Freemie cups making it ultra portable! Yay! The battery lasts for at least 3 20-min pumping sessions and doesn't seem to lose much suction power in that time. It's great for a work or car pump. I felt I was taking a risk in buying it at fisrt but it's turned out to be a fantastic purchase!",

Yes, there are a lot of parts to wash just like any other pump machines. However, it's strong (even when I'm double pumping) and the battery life lasts for a while at full charge. Even better is the fact that it's actually affordable",

Definitely glad I didn't splurge on Baby Buddha or Spectra S9. I tried bellababy for an entire day and I didn't lose any ounces. The only downfall is there is no way to decrease suction power. I have to unplug if I want to decrease, but that's not a big issue for me; so overall, I'm very happy with this purchase.

We were looking to pump just because of the convenience and ability to rotate formula with breast milk and I found several pumps similar to this one that were $160 - $200.

Everything has worked flawlessly on it and have found great success with the different settings. My wife uses it at least twice a day. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone.",

      "text": "Overall, I returned this item after using it twice. I have used a Medela in the past without any issues, but I wanted to see if another pump would be more efficient. This one was not. 1. Too. Many. Parts. Taking this apart was tedious and annoying. 2. Suction was not only an odd pulsation but it did hurt at the levels necessary to pump milk, and I didn\u2019t achieve any letdowns after ten minutes. 3. Indifferent to the noise level. The only thing I liked about it was the portability of the chargeable base.",

I didn\u2019t know any better bc I\u2019m a first time mom but holy s#^! This thing could rip a nipple off compared to my Spectra which was so much more gentle and I got better output. If you need or want LOTS of strong suction, then this is perfect. One downside is you have to keep going up in strength to get back down so be careful. It\u2019s also very noisy in comparison to other pumps. Super durable equipment though and the portable piece is very nice.",

Also, I like the added accessories: silicone on the flanges(not too hard on breasts), lid for the flanges and a stability stand for the bottles. Noise level is a bit noisier than spectra but it didn\u2019t really matter if pumping on plane. Battery lasts 4-5 12-15minute pumps. Great deal for a good quality pump!",

A downside is the buttons are very sensitive! I'm used to it now, but at first, I would accidentally turn it off mid-pump. I use spectra parts with the pump because the flanges it came with are too big for me. The spectra parts work great with it! It also works with the freemie closed system cups. Overall: this pump isn't top of the line, but it's also much ore affordable then some of the top brands.",

It's cheap but it has amazing suction and the fact that you can recharge even in your car makes it super portable. I wanted to make it more portable so I purchased the freemie cups (closed system only) and my life couldn't be more eased. I wish I had this pump 2.5 years ago.",

I like the option to pump in a bottle or right into a bag. I also like how there is some silicone/rubber insert in the flanges. My insurance pump doesnt have these two bonuses.

My only complaint is the top suction pieces tend to come off when pumping, not sure how I can get them to stay on. The shield protectors are nice if you have smaller breast, but if not they are useless. I also wish it came with another size cup, but for someone with DDD\u2019s the shield works perfectly fine (without the nice protectors). Overall it was worth the $60 (now $50, 4 days later, which I also don\u2019t understand)",
