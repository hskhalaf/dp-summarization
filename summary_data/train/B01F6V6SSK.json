The metallic white and silver go well with the colors of my office, the colors are vivid, and I love the full 1080p display clarity. Makes multi-tasking while working on my digital designing a breeze, and videos look wonderful as well. I especially love how far to the edge the screen displays. Overall, I am very pleased with this monitor and can't wait until I have the ability to make room for another one in my office!",

Pros: - Thin monitor, looks sleek - Screen resolution and quality was a bit better than I expected (comparing to normal Dell Desktop monitor you would probably use at work). - For the price, I'd say it's worth it. Cons: - Screen will often flicker when watching online videos. If you're planning to use this monitor for office, simple web browsing, viewing pictures, etc. this would be a good monitor. For entertainment purposes, not really.",

It's super-slender and clean-lined to almost be invisible, especially thanks to the white back, natural silver\" trim in front and anti-glare glass. It's a winner!",

Overall, it's a good monitor and works very well. Installation was a hassle for me because my computer was being dumb and broke down once I connected it, but I think that's just the fact that my computer is old and sucks. The only problem that I have with it is that it's so light (in terms of weight) that it seems so easy to accidentally knock down. The stand connects fine, but there's this feeling of unsteadiness and wobbliness to the monitor.",
