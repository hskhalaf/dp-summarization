I contacted Bose and sent it back for repairing. This week I got it back, and it was working as brand new. But, today it won't charge again! It's been like 5 days since I got it back!.. Maybe this defect is rare. I have another Bose headphone and it's been working well for 2 years. I really like the design and innovations of Bose products. But this time I'm done with it and I'm returning it. btw, the Amazon service is really helping and considerate.",

That being said, when it\u2019s on low battery, it won\u2019t play music even when the charger is plugged in. I\u2019m sickened I have to go through the return process. This is not what I\u2019ve come to expect from Bose. If you can\u2019t play music when it\u2019s on low battery even while plugged in, what\u2019s the point?! My old speaker does this with no problem!! Might consider ordering a bose mini soundlink II. Super disappointed.",

It filled the main living space quite easily with surprisingly good sound and no distortion.

However, after about a dozen recharges, the system no longer will recharge despite following instructions for rebooting, updating software, etc. I returned the first speaker multiple times and the same thing happened each time. In my opinion, Bose has a serious problem with their battery system. I am not alone in experiencing this problem. I used to respect Bose as a company, but no longer. Highly disappointing.",

This speaker is the size of a beer can and nothing can beat the sound reproduction that comes from larger drivers and bigger enclosures. But Bose has mastered the art/science of getting the best possible sound out of something the size of a beer can. If you need something small and portable, you could do a lot worse than the Revolve. It won't fill a large room. But it will sit on your desk or patio and do just fine. Everything works and the build quality is second to none.",
