The 4x zoom in video mode does not loose focus or quality by zooming in or out. However shooting in HD does take up space on the memory stick duo. Prepare to invest in a 8GB or 16GB memory stick. I did discover that shooting with the red eye setting on faces caused more red eye pictures. Put the setting on auto an now everything is fine. Other than that no other complains.",

Changing from picture mode and video mode is quick since it's controlled by a physical button. It's also the smallest and thinnest. Battery life isn't bad but could be better.

It is a pretty easy camera to figure out, since I never read owners manuals that is a plus!I am ready for my next outing with it. Great camera!",
