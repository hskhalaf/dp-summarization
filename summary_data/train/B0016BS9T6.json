My hair is always disgusting -- oily, sticky and dry and frizzy all at the same time. I installed the Aquasana and it worked great -- for TWO WEEKS. Now my hair is back to disgusting. The filter gets dirty too quickly. Time to find a much larger system for the entire house. I'm not sure how many stars to give it because it worked great for two weeks but doesn't last. Perhaps if you have other issues like chlorine etc, it would work better.",

Can filter my whole house in the long run cheaper than filtering just my shower with this filter.",

I was concerned with water temperature, since I read somewhere else that the maximum temperature allowed would be the low 90s - not hot enough. But after contacting Aquasana I was informed that the maximum temperature is 125F (more than enough); and the filter does come with a sticker stating an average of 115F. We think it works so well that we are ordering a second one for the second bathroom.",
