It's taken a few adjustments to get the cleat where I want it, the markings on the bottom of shoe are a bit lacking but that's a very minor complaint. I rode 150 miles with these shoes out of the box and my feet were very happy!",

    "title": "Fizik R5B Donna BOA Shoe with Fuschia Trim",
    "description": "An ill-fitting bike is a bad thing. When your ride mileage routinely measures in the triple digits, however, an ill-fitting shoe may be worse. Too tight and circulation is cut off; too loose and slippage causes painful blisters. Skiers and snowboarders have known for years: for a perfect fit almost nothing beats the Boa system. The Fizik R5 Donna Boa Womens Shoe takes advantage of the incredible precision of the Boa system while maintaining extraordinary ventilation, tough durability, and impressive light weight. The R5s closure system starts with a conventional hook-and-loop strap close to the toe for near-infinite forefoot width control. Moving up the front of the foot, the Boa Cable dial-in closure system snakes its way through four separate anchor points for complete control all the way up to the tongue. For extreme control over volume, or simply to efficiently clean the inside of the shoe, Fizik designed the tongue pad to be fully-removable. To further control slippage, Fizik has shaped the heel cup at the aft position of the shoe. This feature keeps the foot in the perfect position on hard up-strokes and while climbing out of the saddle. As a result, youre powering the pedals comfortably and efficiently. This has been further heightened by a variable stiffness sole construction. Underfoot, the R5 makes use of a carbon-reinforced nylon outsole. And while this keeps costs down, it doesnt inhibit either comfort or power transfer. In fact, the R5 retains a low stack height and a high level of rigidity. Fizik has also engineered-in trace flexibility, so the outsole drives power directly to the pedals while allowing enough movement to guarantee comfort after 80 kilometers. And on the topic of comfort, Fizik went above and beyond to make the R5 extremely breathable. The R5 features Fiziks Microtex for the support structure of the uppers and nylon mesh for the ventilation windows.",
