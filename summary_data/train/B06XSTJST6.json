That the program did not return to the original network and choose another (any other) is an unacceptable breach of programming integrity. Caution",

It's cool that you can select \"sunset\" as a time for the lamps to come on so as the days get longer the lamps come on later. I even set a shut off time so I don't have to remember to turn the lamps off at all. The plugs are also smaller than some of the other models that I have seen. LOVE!",

For me the lack of hub necessity is a huge plus as I'm not sure I want to dive into that whole smart home thing yet. Currently using one to track power consumption on a mini-fridge I'm not sure is worth running.",

While I wasn't entirely sure where I would use them when we got them, we soon found some useful applications. These were easy to set up and both have worked flawlessly -- including after power outages and Wi-Fi outages. I wanted smart plugs that would also monitor electricity use so we could work on reducing electricity bills, or at least understanding our usage. I put one of them on a suspected \"power vampire\" that we rarely use. I will see if it results in lower bills soon. Overall, I'm happy and would definitely buy this brand again if I need more smart plugs.",

This smart outlet can turn on lamps on a set schedule, or at a moment's notice as you're miles away. Amazon Alexa Setup 1. Open Amazon Alexa APP on your phone; 2.
