All other saws I have used over the last 28 years have a locking mechanism that allows you to instantly find the 45*, 22.5* and 0*. This saw slides right by those if you are not watching what you're doing. Very frustrating...",

Sometimes the angle pivot comes lose and if I don't notice, it will cut slightly beveled! - Maybe user-fault, but if it was a locking latch style it wouldn't be an issue! Other than that, it's light and does everything I need it to with what I think is a reasonable price. Never used the laser that came with it.",
