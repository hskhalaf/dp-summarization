      "text": "I received this camera today, was taking photos in less than 15 minutes, and advanced photos in under an hour. The camera is ultra-intuitive and does virtually everything for you. The auto focus and image stabilization functions both appear to be perfect. NOTE: If there's one drawback it's this...the camera has extremely limited manual adjustments and no manual focus - the next model up (DSC-HX300) does. As a replacement for a Konica-Minolta S414 that I bought for 3 times the money back in 2002, I could not be more pleased...at least after 2 hours. This is an exceptional camera for this price!!!",

I am returning as I could not get very good pictures. I have used this type camera before with much better result. I even get better results with my phone. Also the box was labeled with warning for lithiom ion battery that was not in the box. When I went to return it in the original box I was told I needed to have it repackaged due to the battery. Again there was no battery of anykind.",
