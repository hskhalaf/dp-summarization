That said, outside comfiness, the Evolv piece in question also deserves accolades in the areas of underfoot security and aesthetics.This ultra-lightweight shoe, however, might not be the most supportive approach tool out there. Nonetheless, the Cruzer Psyche is yet another outstanding Evolv piece, what with its stunning design and equally as endearing trail-to-rock qualities.",

It may get more comfortable as you go, but I'll never find out. The heel also rubbed so badly I wouldn't have been able to wear low socks. Just not great. Seemed sturdily constructed though, so they have that going for them.",

Also, the seem at the bottom of the \"evolv\" logo split on one and I can stick my finger between the two pieces of fabric. Didn't have much arch and my ankles were acting up after a week, but that's more my ankles than the shoes.",
