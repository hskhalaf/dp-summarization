The instructions caution against damaging the guitar's finish, particularly on Gibson guitars. I'll just say that the tuner is light, has rubber pads on the gripping claw, and the gripping power is modest. It must take an extremely delicate finish for there to be an issue.",

It can also be helpful to learn how to tune the guitar when you don't have a tuner on hand. But I carry mine. It's small enough to take along. Like I said, I had one already, and it has worked perfectly fine for the past two years without a problem. Even comes with batteries.",

Also, since it sits so conveniently on the head of your guitar, it can be easy to forget to turn it off after you've tuned. Don't forget - you want your batteries to last.
