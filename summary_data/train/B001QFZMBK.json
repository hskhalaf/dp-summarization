It takes nice pictures in good light (taking in account the sensor size); makes good videos; endures water, mud and snow easily; and is small enough to be with me almost all the time. I was searching for another one. Eight years, a lot of new though cameras in the market and I couldn't find a good replacement. Very brave little thing.",

Its been droppend and taken to the desert with highly alkalai dust, and gone mountaineering and come out perfectly. Dropping it once did put a tiny little dent in the metal housing but that's why it's metal right? Plastic would have surely cracked. The photos are a little soft but being able to get photos realiably is important to me. Battery life is very good. I'm very pleased with the wide angle and it's zoom. This is a camera I would recommend to friends and family.",

    "description": "Color:SilverFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nPanasonic's new Lumix DMC-TS1 is the world\u2019s first waterproof, shockproof and dustproof digital camera to also feature AVCHD Lite High Definition (HD) video recording capabilities. The TS1\u2019s tough and rugged design makes it the ideal choice for active users needing the ultimate hybrid for capturing both still and motion images during outdoor activities. The Lumix TS1, with a 12.1-megapixel resolution, features a 28mm wide-angle Leica DC Vario-Elmar lens, a 4.6x optical zoom and Panasonic\u2019s proprietary iA (Intelligent Auto) mode, making this an easy-to-use, yet powerful camera that packs advanced imaging features. \n\nThe TS1 is waterproof to a depth of 10 feet, shockproof from falls up to 5 feet, and dustproof. With its rubber padding, reinforced glass and carbon resins inside the camera, the TS1 features an airtight body protected against water immersion, dust and sand. \n\nStarting at the 28mm wide angle, and zooming up to a useful 128mm in telephoto, the TS1 gives users the flexibility for a variety of shooting environments--especially underwater, where movement is often restricted and the angle of view becomes important for composing shots. The TS1 also features a 2.7-inch, 230,000-dot Intelligent LCD with a wide viewing angle, enhancing visibility during recording and playback by automatic brightness control according to the environment\u2019s lighting conditions. Plus, the TS1\u2019s LCD panel is deliberately thickened for protection against pressure, allowing the display to operate with clear visibility even underwater. \n\nThe TS1 records AVCHD Lite HD video, allowing almost double the recording time in HD quality compared with the conventional Motion JPEG format. The TS1 also features Dolby Digital Creator to record high quality audio to match the high-quality motion images. \n\nThe TS1 features iA mode for both still images and in Movie Mode. For iA in Movie Mode, the TS1 features Optical Image Stabilization (O.I.S.), which helps prevent handshake when using high-powered zoom. Face Detection automatically detects a face in a frame and adjusts focus, exposure, contrast, and skin complexion on the face. Intelligent Exposure continually checks the ambient light level and adjusts the exposure setting as conditions change to prevent blown highlights and blocked shadows. And Intelligent Scene Selector automatically switches between Normal, Portrait, Macro, Scenery, and Low Light modes according to the situation to optimize visual quality. A Wind Cut function is also available to block out most of the noise from background wind. Optical zoom can be used in motion image recording. Users can start video recording by simply pressing a dedicated button on the camera's back panel. \n\nThe TS1\u2019s iA for still image adds Face Recognition--a feature that \"remembers\" faces from previous shots. When a registered face appears in the frame, the camera will prioritize focus and exposure to capture it beautifully. With Face Recognition, when a familiar face is recorded several times, the camera will prompt you to register the face. Once registered, if the face appears into the frame again, the camera will display the name specified for that person and prioritize focus and exposure so that the registered face is bright and sharply focused. \n\nThe imaging power of Lumix has further evolved with the Venus Engine HD, which boasts two CPUs to provide approx. 2.4x processing capability and support for Face Recognition, AVCHD Lite and HDMI output. It integrates the numerous advanced functions with high performance, and low-power consumption. Thanks to the Venus Engine HD, it\u2019s easy to view photos or movies recorded in AVCHD Lite. Simply insert the SD Memory Card from the camera in the Panasonic VIERA HDTV\u2019s Image Viewer SD Memory Card slot to start playback, or connect the camera via an optional HDMI mini cable to a VIERA Link-equipped Panasonic VIERA HDTV and use the TV's remote control to run slideshows. \n\nThis multi-task image-processing engine also enables a fast response time. The TS1 starts up quickly in 1.3 seconds and shutter release time lag is approximately 0.005 seconds, making it easy to capture sudden, spur-of-the-moment photo opportunities. The Flash Burst mode makes it possible to take consecutive shots with continuous emissions of the flash. The Venus Engine HD also supports a High Sensitivity mode that lets the TS1 record up to ISO 6400, sensitive enough to capture subjects in near-total darkness without using a flash. Despite its outstanding performance, the high-performance engine is also more energy efficient, extending the battery life up to 340 shots (CIPA) per a single charge. \n\nOther features of the Lumix DMC-TS1 include:\n\n * New Scene Modes for Still Images: Beach & Surf mode gives users a single mode with optimized auto white balance for optical shooting on the beach and in shallow water. \n * New Panorama Assist scene mode allows users to shoot a number of consistent photos, either vertically or horizontally, by aligning them according to a guide that overlaps the screen. Then using those photos and the bundled PanoramaMaker software, users can create dramatic panoramic images. \n * Increased Scene modes for both still and motion image shooting--optimized for a variety of situations. There are 26 scene modes for still image and 17 for motion image (Portrait, Soft Skin, Transform, Self portrait, Scenery, Low light, Food, Party, Candle light, Sunset, High sensitivity, Beach & Surf, Snow, Aerial, Pin hole, Film grain and Underwater) \n * LED Illumination is available in motion image recording. \n * High-Speed Burst (Speed Priority) that fires off approximately 10 shots per second. \n * Menus are clearer and easier to navigate with the Display Size option. \n * Macro Zoom function lets users pull subjects even closer to capture dramatic close-up shots by using the 3x digital zoom in the wide-angle. \n * Bundled Software: The latest version of PHOTOfunSTUDIO 3.0 HD Edition allows users to view, edit and archive captured content with greater ease and fun. Still and motion images can be transferred to the computer via a USB cable for viewing and archiving. Using PHOTOfunSTUDIO 3.0 HD Edition, users can edit and remove unwanted portions of video clips recorded in AVCHD Lite. Contents recorded in AVCHD Lite can be burned directly onto a DVD disc or converted to MPEG2 format. The software also incorporates the Face Recognition function, which recognizes registered faces in photos stored on the computer, making organizing and archiving photos with a specific person much easier. Additionally, motion pictures can be uploaded directly to YouTube.",
