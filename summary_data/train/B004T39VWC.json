This model is just as good as my other and is standing right next to it. Great for my seedlings and young plants that are not ready to go in the ground. The zipper feature is great as during cold nights especially if you put the unit near your drying machine vent. The unit is very sturdy withstanding some extreme South Texas winds. I've had the unit since February and it's ready to last me into the next growing season. I will definitely add a few more units to my collection.",

Based on previous reviews mentioning racks becoming dislodged when moving plants, I took an extra minute to put one tiny zip tie around each center support to keep the wire racks in place, and have not had any problems. It worked great for starting all my tomato and pepper seedlings, and I'll be ordering another one for my bean starts. The cover also removes easily if you don't need the extra heat and humidity, making for great outdoor plant shelves for hardening or display. Worth every penny and more.",

I'm thinking about buying a bigger one though as this was just right and I want to start some additional seedlings this year. :) Update: This was my third year using this greenhouse and it still is in excellent condition.
