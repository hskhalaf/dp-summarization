My only slight complaint is that the liner on the insole separated on the first time out with them. Kinda disappointed in that but, things happen, still 5 stars for function. UPDATE: Riedell replaced the insoles, although it was noticeably lesser quality. On my second time out with the skates, the the right toe stop came flying off while skating, luckily it didn't cause me or anyone else to wipe out. A worthy tip.......Check everything on the skates an be sure the bolts are tight. Overall, still love the skates. Very comfortable and a smooth ride.",
