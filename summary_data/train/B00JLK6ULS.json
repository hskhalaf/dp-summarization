It simply doesnt work and with no support from the company I am at my whits end. Save your money or burn it might bring you more satisfaction.",

It's slow, glitchy and you hit a lot of \"next\" waiting for the game to progress. You can't stack \"units\" and you keep having to get out of your way, which I hate. You have no way of knowing what your other players are doing and you can't see / know what they're doing. This is depressing. I'm going to play Alpha C.",

If you're expecting a great sci-fi game, then you'll be pleased. This game felt flat and monotonous. It's not uncommon for Civ 5 players to spend days-on-end replaying levels. It was a chore to play Beyond Earth for a few hours. The storyline is dull and the upgrade system has a lot to be desired. The game would've been better if \"Beyond Earth\" and \"Starships\" were combined into one game with the ability to colonize other planets instead of being \"stuck\" on one world.",

They earn benefits from the group as well. A recent update also fixed a lot of issues with that game.

When I start a brand new product, I'd like to set it up with only a couple of computer opponents on a very large map until I get the hang of it. At this point, that does not appear to be an option. Additionally, the terrain has items on it that aren't clearly understood - I can't tell what they are, (I figure that if they move, they are bad), Also, took me a while to figure out how to built outposts. The old Alpha Centauri had none of these problems and was better for it.",

      "text": "It may not be the absoloute best Civilization game, but it is definitely the most fun to play. This game gives you a fresh take on an old franchise, without compromising what you love about Civ games. The best improvements are the tech tree and the variable game play using certain corporations. You can play a game with one nation, and the next time it will play completely differently. It doesn't force you to choose your strategy based on your civilization, like previous games. It allows you to pick who you would like to play with, then decide how you want to win. Great addition to the civilization series!",
