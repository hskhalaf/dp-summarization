I have trouble getting action pictures unless it is on the continuous picture mode. I am not sure if any other camera for the price is going to be any better. I think maybe I should have paid more and gotten a better camera. This is our 2nd cool pics camera. The 1st one lasted almost 1 year.",

    "description": "Color:SilverFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nCAPTURE LIFE'S BEST MOMENTS.\nDON\u2019T MISS THE MOMENT.\nBirthdays. Weddings. Baby\u2019s first steps. With the COOLPIX L24, it's never been easier to keep these memories alive. This compact camera makes it simple to shoot clear photos and movies that you can e-mail, post on a family website or print and frame at home.\n\nWith the COOLPIX L24, it\u2019s easy to capture life's most precious moments. The Scene Mode system lets you choose from 16 scenes to find the best one for your situation, or you can rely on the Easy Auto Mode to automatically select the best settings for your photos. You'll also catch unforgettable facial expressions with Nikon's Smart Portrait System, which includes a Blink Warning that alerts you when your subject may have blinked; in-camera Red-Eye Fix\u2122 technology that automatically corrects red eye; and Face-Priority that focuses on up to 12 faces.\n\nThis affordable, lightweight camera is easy to carry and requires easy-to-find AA batteries.\n\nPOWERFUL. AFFORDABLE. UNBEATABLE!\nThe palm-sized COOLPIX L24 is as powerful as it is affordable. It boasts 14-megapixel recording for razor-sharp photos that will retain their detail on prints as large as 16x20 inches. Plus, a 3.6x optical Zoom-NIKKOR\u00ae glass lens features a zoom range from 37mm to 134mm, so you can capture an entire graduation class as easily as you can your favorite graduate.\n\nZoom range from 37mm to 134mm. The COOLPIX L24 makes it a breeze to shoot quality photos and movies. It has a bright, three-inch LCD monitor so it's easy to see the screen, shoot your picture, and share it with friends. Its three-way Vibration Reduction (VR) Image Stabilization System minimizes the streaky images that result from shots taken with shaky hands. Its motion detector identifies moving subjects and then adjusts the camera's settings to catch the action, so you\u2019re sure to capture a sandlot player's game-saving catch or first bike ride.\n\nLarge 3\u201d LCD Display MEMORIES THAT MOVE\u2014AND MOVE YOU.\nSometimes a still picture can't preserve a memory like a moving image. School plays. Piano recitals. A child's first words. For moments like these, the COOLPIX L24 shoots TV quality movies\u2014complete with sound\u2014at 30fps with 640x480 resolution. It's never been simpler to capture life's most special moments, and it's never been easier to relive them because you can watch them on the camera's LCD, your TV or your home computer screen.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\n * COOLPIX L24 Digital Camera\n * Strap\n * UC-E6 USB Cable\n * Two AA Alkaline Batteries\n * Nikon View NX 2 CD-ROM",
