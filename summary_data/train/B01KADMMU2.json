However, after having to pay a local bike shop to install these on my son's wheels, I could have bought a set of tires from them. They would have been more expensive, but the mounting charge wouldn't bit my wallet. Other than that, the tires seem to be holding up great with my son racing.",

These tires provided a lot more traction in the dirt. I will definitely purchase these tires again in the future for any of my 12/14 size tire pit bikes.",
