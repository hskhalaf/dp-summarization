      "text": "This machine is really good for apples and various berries. It does great with oranges and grapefruit. My bigggest and most pressing concern is with root vegetables such as carrots and beets. The motor gets terribly slow and struggles even when cut into 1\u201d chunks. Since carrots ate base for 80% of my juicing, you can see my dilemma. My other issue is the pulp ejection port cloggs far to easily and makes juicing withbthis machine verybtedious. It\u2019s a shame too because it\u2019s easily assembled and disassembled making cleaning a breeze. I\u2019m contemplating returning to Amazon as it\u2019s just not up to par.",

I was using a centrifugal juicer for a while and noticed that I don't get as much juice as I would from my local juice shop that used a really nice masticating juicer. When I looked up theirs, it was way too expensive to justify for a few juices a month. I get this one and I'm maximizing my juicing now without a lot of waste. Absolutely amazing. Such a great deal. I highly recommend this juicer for anyone who doesn't juice on a daily basis but wants to get the most juice out of fewer vegetables.",

Caynel is easing to assemble, the large mouth work great for not having to chop everything down into pieces. Beautiful color in red match my kitchen, even through it little taller then kitchen cabinets when full assemble. The one thing not really a con on the machine but the instruction. It came with a ice cream filter but no information on how to use it. But other then that I'm really happy to have brought this.",
