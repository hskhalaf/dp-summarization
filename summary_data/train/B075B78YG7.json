It took a bit of work freeing it from the box, but worth it. Oh, and be advised that this doll is meant to be an indoor-only toy according to the paperwork that came with it. Contact with liquids, dirt, grass or concrete could damage the electronic workings inside this doll. Here he is in the Joovy blue doll car seat.",

His mouth doesn\u2019t move like I am watching in videos and he seems to be malfunctioning. Also noticed this seller sent it to us with batteries in it when the box says batteries not included so I am assuming they already knew it wasn\u2019t working properly.",
