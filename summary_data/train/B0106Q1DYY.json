We have had no issues with the unit at all. One of the best things is doing smaller frozen foods like french fries or any other food requiring being cooked in the oven.

In about the 8 month period though; the inner pan self ejects from the outer pan; making for quite a surprising; possibly dangerous event; if you are not ready with a hot pad under it. Upon inspection of the handle assembly; the four nuts/screws are tight; but the inner plastic sandwiched between the head of the screw and the nut; has become quite sloppy; allowing for it to eject automatically, after heating food.

I did, however, like the simple set up of the GoWISE, it being a dial instead of a digital reading. The GoWISE also took less time to warm up. I couldn't say how Della's dial type fryer performs as a comparison. Both of them worked very well.",
