That aside the rose gold on this piece are subtle & make it pop because of the rich navy face of the bezel. Absolutely captivating easy to read dials and even easier to set up time & date. What I'm finding out more about this watch is it so comfortable, versitle, it could be a potential daily use from date night to just hanging out. If your skeptical about purchasing put those to rest! It's a legit Michael kors watch & you can't go wrong with the pricing on it. Enjoy the pics \ud83d\ude38",

The return/exchange time was for 30 days and was over by the time i had come back. Spoke to the seller and they were not able to help me out in this case. However, Amazon was kind of to offer me a refund and now I ordered it again. Otherwise, Its a beautiful watch!",

Also, I love the heaviness and comfort of the watch. I've owned and have worn the watch regularly for 1.5 years now and the acrylic crystal dial window remains scratch-free. It's versatile enough to wear with casual wear or a suit and tie. I've received numerous compliments from acquaintances and strangers alike. If you like what you see, purchase without reservation.",

It is a good idea to buy it here because you are saving a lot for the same exact watch! This watch is BOLD and people just can't help looking at it/ complimenting him on it. The only two concerns he voiced is 1) the face is a little big and 2) he's not sure what to match it with. Other than that it is a great watch and I love the way it looks on him!",
