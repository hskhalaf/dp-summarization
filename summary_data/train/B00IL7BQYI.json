My son drools alot and tries to chew on the corners of his ipad. This case has been perfect at keeping wetness from getting into the ipad. I have purchased many cases for my sons device, looking for one that would keep moisture out and protect from drops and bumps, this case has done exactly what it claimed to do. I am VERY happy with this purchase and definitely recommend.",

Well, I love it...keeps the iPad very, very usable and adds so little bulk and weight for so much protection. Very happy!",

Looks absolutely awesome:) I've also noticed there is hardly any rainbow effects in the case which is awesome! My phone which is full of the rainbow effects, yet the iPad has hardly any:) I really love the case and I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great protective iPad case:)",
