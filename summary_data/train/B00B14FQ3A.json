      "text": "Great sound clarity and work well for telemarketing or call center. Comfortable to wear. If multiple people have a similar style, they will sometimes pick up other people's phone calls, so be careful of that if you are using them in that type of environment. Also, the range is erratic--sometimes you can go quite a bit further than it says but sometimes they cut out unexpectedly. Also, you don't get a warning when you're going to lose the signal--it just drops out--so if you're in the middle of a call and you go too far, you'll just lose the call.",

The most annoying thing is actually listening to the sound, however. It is very difficult to listen on a wired connection. Actually, it's impossible. This set of headphones is entirely wireless and requires its wireless transmitter block. It does have a very good range, however, it is best used on desktops and for other immobile stations. You can't just take these to listen to your phone on the bus. Has very good range though and delivers what is advertised.",

The charge lasts multiple hours (though I've never run it down). Sound quality is great for both voice (Lync calls) and music (especially with the 3 quick EQ settings). Haven't tested fully with the PS3, but limited testing seems to be easy and great. Flip up mic muting is awesome, frankly. I don't have to remember to manually mute my line.",

I was worried that the ear parts might make my ears hurt/sore, but they don't (even after hours of wearing them) because they are nice and soft and cushioned!
