      "text": "Color prints from E mail or web pages are great, vivid and bright. However, it is extremely slow to print (ads claim up to 18ppm) The copy function sucks, on copy function; poor quality copies taking up to 2 minutes, the scan is fast but requires going into Applications and starting Epson Scan every time then to print out is forever.",

      "text": "This is the poorest consumer product I have ever wasted my money on. Every aspect of printing with this machne and of Epson's so-called \"support\" has caused me more frustration than anything else I have ever owned. The photo quality is mediocre. Finally, 5 weeks after I bought it, a paper misfeed destroyed it and now I am happily (except for the hundreds of dollars wasted on it and the ink) tossing it into the garbage. Never again Epson.",
