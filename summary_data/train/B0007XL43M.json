      "text": "So I bought this 3 years ago to play ps3 games with it. I had a roomie that would sleep while I play so I had to get something like this. The overall sound and quality is awesome even the bass. While playing games I could hear the explosions and gunshots if I were there. You can even hear small sound effects you wouldnt normally hear before like footsteps creeping on up you. So it's been 3 years and the headphones and receiver works just fine. The only downside is the batteries it came with don't hold a charge anymore. But just some pop in some new rechargeable batteries and your good to go.",

The amount of stereo decoding ability's is also nice dolby, dts, ect. the surround sound seems to work well. It even comes with rechargeable battery's and a recharger built in.",

The worst problem is the lower ends of the headphones cannot be blocked or the sound shuts off. This a is problem when adjusting the volume. Your hand blocks the sensor and the sound goes off as you try to lower or raise the volume. If you are lying on a fluffy pillow the sensors can be blocked also. However, the sound quality is so good. no background noise, you can adjust for the drawbacks. I highly with recommend them",

But for shorter periods, these Pioneer cans are more comfortable and better balanced (weight) than my previous pair, the wireless Sennheiser RS-45. Just keep in mind that these are line-of-site headphones, so you must have a clear pathway between you and the receiver. For example, my knees can block the IR beam if I'm sitting on the floor (moving the receiver to a higher position solves the problem.)",

    "description": "Product Packaging:Standard PackagingThe Pioneer SE-DIR800C Infrared Wireless Surround Sound Headphones simulate 5.1 channel speakers to create high quality surround-sound like what you'll experience from a traditional home theater. These headphones process Dolby Digital, Dolby Pro Logic II and DTS surround sound from a gaming console, DVD player, or CD player connected through the optical or coaxial input. The SE-DIR800C headphones offer super-soft earphone enclosures so the entire ear is cushioned for greater comfort. Die-hard video gamers, movie and music enthusiasts now have a new ally in the fight to be entertained at any time -- and at the decibel level of their preference. Self-adjusting headset Wired headphone input with volume control 2-Way stand with vertical or horizontal mounting options 3 Room Type Effect Presets - DH1(Mixing room with very little reverberation), DH2(Default mode with moderate reverb), DH3(Small Movie Theater) Inputs - Optical Digital, Coaxial Digital(cable supplied), Analog Line In Input attenuator Frequency Response - 12kHz-22kHz Distortion - 1% or less (1kHz) Rechargeable AA batteries and recharger\n\nAMAZON.COM\nDon't let a sleeping family keep you from your new action adventure movie, DTS 5.1 concert, or online video game tournament by setting up these Pioneer wireless surround sound headphones. The SE-DIR800C phones, which connect to any 5.1-channel source--including a DVD player, game console, digital cable box, or satellite receiver--are equipped with Dolby Headphone technology, which produces up to five virtual loudspeakers in your head by directing and reflecting the sound from each channel. The effect is a stunning surround experience, far more dimensional than with typical headphones, and, some say, even better than with a high-performance surround speaker system. The audio is natural sounding and doesn't cause \"listener fatigue\" as do many other headphones. The phones also work with a variety of surround formats, including Dolby Digital, DTS, and Dolby Surround. \n\n Most conveniently, the SE-DIR800C phones are completely cordless. The small wireless transmitter connects to your source (DVD player, game console, etc.) and broadcasts a clear, strong signal via infrared technology to the headphones. Thanks to the wireless technology, you won't snag a headphone cord on furniture, your dog, your glasses, or anything else. \n\n The phones feature a trio of \"virtual room\" presets from which to choose. The options actually reproduce the sound of a playback system in up to three different listening environments based on the acoustic measurements of real rooms. The small room setting (DH1) re-creates a small, well-damped room with very little reverberation that's perfect for both movies and music-only recordings, while the medium room (DH2) is a more acoustically live (or \"wet\") room that's well suited to both formats as well (with moderate reverberation). Meanwhile, the large room setting (DH3) offers a bigger sound, more like the audio within a concert hall or movie theater. \n\n A final bonus stems from the onboard volume control. With a volume dial on the headphone itself, users can easily turn up the audio without getting out of the chair. The SE-DIR800C phones, which offer a transmission range of up to 26 feet, are an ideal choice for folks who live in busy households where people go to sleep early, or for anyone who wants a little audio privacy while watching movies or listening to music. The phones are backed by a 90-day warranty on parts and labor. \n\n What's in the Box\nWireless headphones, transmitter, rechargeable AA batteries, charger, coaxial digital cable, two-way stand, user's manual.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n \n\n\nPioneer's Gorgeous SE-DIR800C Headphones.

PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER.\nTom Lewis2.0 out of 5 stars Poor sound reproduction, uncomfortable, Dolby HP rocksReviewed in the United States on May 5, 2012Product Packaging: Standard PackagingVerified Purchase .\n.\nFor the price, they should be MUCH better. Sadly, they are not very good at all.\n\nPros:\n\nThe Dolby Headphone circuitry is excellent. I don't typically like headphones because due to the extreme stereo separation from normal headphones it sounds like everything is coming from inside my head. That is a somewhat universal complaint. Dolby Labs recognized the problem, and using some sort of sophisticated phase cancellation and channel remixing or something, fixed it and fixed it good. This thing delivers in that department. Dolby HP is for real.\n\nWired headphone jack. (more on this under \"Cons\")\n\nCons:\n\nThe audio quality is just plain unacceptable. It is boxy, tinny, peaky; not what I would consider HiFi. $9 earbuds from 7-11 rival these $280 headphones for quality. I'm sure a frequency response curve would look more like my doctor's signature than a straight, flat line. As a pro audio Engineer for some time, maybe I'm picky, but accurate these are not, and annoyingly so.\n\nComfort? Nuh-uh. Like someone put one of those glue clamps from high school shop class on my head. Did they even try to aim for comfort? I can tolerate them for maybe 45 minutes but taking them off feels pretty good, like how good it feels when you stop hitting yourself in the head with a hammer.\n\nBut, I found a workaround. The audio output jack allows me to use my 12-year-old wired Sennheisers, which are infinitely more comfortable (I can wear them for a couple hours with no problem) and have significantly better audio quality (which proves that the quality problem is with the Pioneer headphones or wireless technology). Of course I bought the Pioneer unit to REPLACE the Sennheisers. Go figure.\n\nSo the Pioneer base station provides the Dolby Headphone feature, and my $80 decade-old Sennheisers provide everything else. But $280 just for the Dolby Headphone feature is not really much of a bargain, it's just that there aren't any other ways to get it that I have been able to find. Plus, I'm still wired. At least I don't have to charge the batteries.\n\nAs far as the wireless goes (I will wear these while cooking in an open kitchen adjacent to the media room) they are not kidding when they say line of sight; walk behind a small post or turn around to open the fridge, and crackle-crackle dropout. That's at under 20 feet.\n\nThe room size settings are all but useless, too.\n\nI think these are going to have to go back.Read more One person found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse William Faulk4.0 out of 5 stars Amazing surround qualityReviewed in the United States on November 28, 2010Product Packaging: Standard PackagingVerified Purchase I use these mostly to play FPSes on my PS3. The sound directionality of these is remarkable. The signal from the transmitter to the headphones is digital, so, despite them being wireless, there's no hiss.\n\nIt is IR, though, and line-of-sight is required. It might also interfere with other IR signals. I've noticed when it's on that low batteries in my remote controls affect operation more than when it's off, for example. The headphones' receivers are at the bottom of the earpieces, which is the most easily blocked place on the headphones. Fortunately, only one or the other needs to be receiving the signal.\n\nThere is also a standard 3.5mm headphone jack in the transmitter that puts out the surround signal, if you want to use your own headphones.\n\nIt has several selectable inputs (digital optical, digital coax, and L/R RCA line-in), and a couple of other surround mode options, but there's no remote control for it.\n\nThe base for the transmitter is ridiculous. It doubles the transmitter's size. I finally just removed it altogether (it's repositionable for horizontal or vertical placement) and put on some rubber feet instead. I haven't seen any problems since doing that.\n\nIt comes with rechargeable batteries for the headphones, and the transmitter doubles as a charging base. However, there is a third contact that prevents non-Pioneer batteries from being charged there. This seems to be fixable by removing a portion of other batteries' plastic sheathing in the same manner as the provided batteries.\n\nThe pivots and hinges on the headphones seem like they might be fragile, but I haven't had any problems yet. Also, the headband is basically just a padded piece of elastic ribbon. It does the job, but it just seems a little cheap, and has a tendency to want to twist. The headphones' only controls are an on/off switch and a volume control.\n\nThe cans themselves fit around the ear. The padding is a tough polyester, which sounds uncomfortable, but really isn't at all. The ear cavities are not large, though, and if you have notably large or protruding ears, they might be uncomfortable.\n\nThe noise isolation is remarkable, perhaps too good. Even with no audio, it can be hard to hear anything in the room. They can also be hot. I'm currently trying an experiment where I'm putting plastic straws between my head and the pads, creating a channel from the room to my ear. I can already hear the outside world better. The jury's out on whether this compromises the audio quality or improves the heat issue.\n\nAll in all, I'm pretty pleased with the unit. The only real drawbacks are the lack of a remote control, minor comfort issues, and questionable build engineering. They were also pricey. If you can get them cheap, I think it's a no-brainer.Read more 3 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse See all reviews from the United States Pages with related products.
