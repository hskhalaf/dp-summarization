My last 2 Android developer phones were all Samsung products (S4 & S6) and each phone developed pixel line problems in the screens after 2 years of use because of cheap components and potential for software corruption on Samsung's and battery drain is worse on Samsung than Motorola. I plan on developing mods and additional apps for Android and Motorola products. Forgot to mention this link is a case that WILL fit the phone and power Mod combined.",

PROS: Battery life is amazing. GPS is accurate. Call quality is clear. Resolution is great. WiFi works well. Very responsive. Excellent graphics. So many cool mods that can be used with this phone. (Extra power, speakers, projector, etc.) CONS: The only issues I have with this phone are the missing UI settings. I am unable to get the screen to stop coming on automatically, and I can't turn on immersive mode. (Maybe there's an app to bypass these restrictions)",

I'm a little wary of trying to use GPS on it to get anywhere without the charge cord for fear of being stranded after the battery dies.",
