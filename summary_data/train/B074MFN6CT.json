Someone please inform the manufacturer that cats are strict carnivores. Also the BHA used as a preservative is a known carcinogen. I purchased this ferret food because it appeared on a \u201ctop ferret food\u201d review website. Boy do I feel stupid after reading the ingredients list! I tossed it and ordered Wysong Ferret Archetype. It is very expensive but is considered to have the best ingredients available including probiotics and vitamins. My ferrets are worth it and vet visits for sick ferrets are not cheap.",

I switched the Mazuri out and their coats have since gone back to soft and their weight has evened out, though two have had poor sheds while on it. .",

But honestly my 3 ferrets love it & haven\u2019t seen any quality of life & or health related issues feeding them this vs. the \u201ctop tier\u201c More Dooks kibble I used for yrs..so im a fan! *Obviously every ferret is different but almost all are very picky/stubborn when it comes to food so def. check w/ur vet before making major changes*",
