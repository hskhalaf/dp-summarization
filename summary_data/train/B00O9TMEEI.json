      "text": "I wanted to bury my kitty after her unfortunate and untimely passing. I was so happy to find such a lovely casket; the pink cushions were perfect for her. The outside is very sturdy, which is to be expected; this material is often used for supplies that are often subjected to extreme conditions and is part of why I ordered this specific product. I was also happy that I was easily able to customize the casket and paint a portrait of her. In part because of this casket I will always be able to have her nearby without having to have her cremated, which is a huge deal for me.",

It perfectly fit my sweet dog with enough room for his bed, pillow, & blanket so he's comfortable for his final rest. (I used his own bedding, not what came with the casket). It's very sturdy & the tape sealed it up securely. I'm glad I found this so it could be delivered quickly enough to bring my sweet boy back home where he belongs.",

I understand it probably doesn't make much of a difference, but I guess it wouldn't make much of a difference burying my Dog without one. Just a little upsetting when I'm going to bury my Dog and the top is on very loosely and the product is not as described. It's supposed to be sealed. So now of course it's not sealed and that kinda defeats the purpose. You go through all of this for peace of mind, not so that you think about your little Dog beating eaten by bugs and getting wet almost immediately.",
