I ended up using the rod from my 40 year old Hoppe's kit, but then the wire brush pulled out and got stuck in the barrel of my Marlin .22 Model 60. This is going back!",

This box wasn't bad though, if it's all you are going to use, it'll be fine. Stiff enough to keep its shape with other things on top of it.",
