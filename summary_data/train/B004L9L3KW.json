      "text": "I had one of these waste cans before I moved and loved it. I didn't bring it with me and I miss it. So I bought another and it was delivered today. It was easy to install the lid. First, I stepped on the foot pedal to raise the metal rod and inserted it into the lid. Then I closed the lid and pressed on the back to engage the two hooks on either side of the metal rod. It was very easy. I especially love that a 13 gal. trash bag will fit tightly around the entire rim. And the soft close is very handy. am very happy to have my favorite trash can again!",

I used regular, off-brand trash bags that they happened to have at our local Grocery Outlet. The lock feature, while unnecessary for me, secures the lid tightly. Only assembly required was attaching the lid. It took a moderate amount of force to snap it into place. Assembly was very simple.",

I hurt my hand trying to do it. In fact, couldn't even get it done until I remembered I have a rubber mallet. Also: not too keen on how forcefully the lid swings open. When the bin is empty, the whole thing sort of swings back by the force of the lid.",
