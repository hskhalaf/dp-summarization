I workout 5 days a week, which includes a run for 20 minutes, circuit training for 30 minutes and have conquered 20 minutes of battle ropes adding this into my workout routine. My research regarding what supplements pro athletes take, typically includes fish oil. I don't care what the taste is like as long as I will reap healthy benefits. BTW, I'm a 60 year old women.",

Full disclosure: I\u2019ve been taking 1tsp in the am and 1tsp before bedtime. I\u2019m extremely deficient in both vitamins A & D due to a pre-existing condition, so, this dosage works specifically for MY condition/symptoms.",
