I love the straps (I wish straps like these had been included with the original, but that was a pretty good while ago) and I like the follow-up from Wise Owl regarding questions, etc. I was a little disappointed to discover it's made in China instead of in the US, where the company is headquartered and the products are designed, but perhaps that's the only way to keep the price so competitive. It's just as good, if not better than 3-letter brands you can find in stores for at least twice its price.",

I realized during this Covid pandemic that a hammock would be perfect between the trees. This Wise Owl outfitters hammock is perfect. It is packable and can be stuffed into itself in the bag. It is super lightweight and easy to set up. There are 2 straps which go around the tree and you simply hook the caribaner to the straps. The hammock itself is very comfortable and stable. Overall, I would highly recommend this hammock.",

The hammock itself is fantastic, so don't worry about the quality it is a very good hammock. All in all, I would spend my money on the straps again, they are worth every penny. I just believe they could put in a smaller strap instead of the rope.",

For a permanent installation, a hammock with \u201csticks\u201d at either end to flatten the shape would be better.

      "text": "We ordered two of the 9'4.5\" by 6' hammocks. After the taller one set up his hammock and got into it, his feet and head were up on the gathered area near the knots. So, if you are really tall, I'd recommend getting the longer, wider one. Also, it didn't feel like thicker, durable nylon but thinner, cheaper material. He felt it might tear with too much movement. The sewing along the sides was poorly done and it began fraying right away. After seeing this, the second one didn't even unpack his. So, we'll need to send them back. Bummer.",

My only issue is a very very small one and that is the attached stuff sack for the hammock doesn't have a compression strap like the bug net has.

So disappointing. **Update** Lauren, from Customer Service, responded to me immediately upon my email to the company in regards to the 2 small tears. She was extremely pleasant to speak with and she shipped me a brand new hammock that I received within 2 days. I've been laying in my hammock daily since I received it and I absolutely love it! It is very comfy and durable. It was easy to set up after watching a 1 minute You Tube video. Thanks to Lauren, I will purchase more Wise Owl products!!",
