The first one lasted about 9 months before it broke when the charging area. The second one lasted 4-5 months and broke in the same location. There may be some stress on the device where we were plugging it in to the car lighter port. We used some super glue on the second one and limped along awhile before it broke completely. It is a great product while it lasts.",

We tried multiple stations in different places around the neighborhood hoping to get better reception, but nothing worked for long at all. The techie who helped me with it thought maybe it was because the antenna in my 13 yo Civic was in the back window. So disappointed to have to return it.",

Sound quality is good. I have to turn the volume on my radio controls up quite a bit when using the hands free for my phone, but the people whom I call seem to be able to hear me just fine. Volume seems to work more efficiently for listening to audio through my phone. Love how it can charge my phone while listening. Does not have a display for showing song information or caller ID. Nonetheless, I am extremely satisfied and would highly recommend this product!",

Above that, you begin to hear what sounds like over modulation, you can counter it by de-tuning your treble and bass settings on the stereo; but risk diminishing sound clarity. FM transmitter is not very powerful and can be easily overpowered by other Bluetooth FM transmitter devices in adjacent vehicles. Turning the transmitter volume up does help to break through the interference, but in most instances, it just nulls out the other transmissions and all you hear is silence on the radio until the other adjacent vehicle is no longer within close proximity of the FM transmitter.",

When I'm stuck in a traffic jam, other cars with similar FM transmitters are close enough that I can hear other people's conversations. This device isn't strong enough to block them out. The previous FM transmitter I had, a Jabra Cruzer, had a much stronger transmitter and I didn't have this problem. I got this one because I thought it would be better for music (stereo, two bluetooth devices), but the transmission problems make the GOgroove unusable. I am returning it.",

I was able to use Pandora to play music via Bluetooth, which is what I wanted since my car does not have Bluetooth built into the stereo system. The only reason I didn't give it 5 starts was that the reception is not as crisp as the regular radio, not bad, but just not 100% crisp/clear.

The only thing that didn't work well was is my car is manual transmission and I occasionally bump it due to the long curvature base. The calling works pretty decently but talking into doesn't always work right due to the microphone being far away. Can't use the phone when the window is open. Shipped on time.
