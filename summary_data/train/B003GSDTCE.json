I've long suspected that this pair was not truly Maui Jim manufactured as the lenses scratched very soon after purchasing them. I've owned nothing but Maui Jim sunglasses for at least the last 15 years, and I've NEVER had a single scratch. Then last evening the frame snapped completely in half rendering the sunglasses totally useless. I love Maui Jim sunglasses, but I'll never buy another pair from this particular vendor (optima.com).",

I've only had these for 3 and 1/2 months so I'm sure Maui Jim will repair/replace, but still not real impressed with the durability.",
