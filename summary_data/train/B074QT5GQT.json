I show two of my dogs. I had planned to cut a few of these salmon bites up for use in the ring, but we zoomed through the first jar too quickly and it was empty before I knew it. I'll have to wait for the next shows to try them as ring bait. Think I'm going to have to always order 2 jars at a time, just to make sure I always have some on hand!",
