I love the perfect weight of the fabric, it's great for both winter and summer and everything in between. The snaps and zipper are also perfect and don't get stuck like other brands. They also go up to XL so I kept my daughter in her sleep sacks (she loved them!) until 18 months so I always knew she was comfy when she slept. LOVE LOVE LOVE these.",

We bought the largest size so my then 9 month old baby (now 11 months) could grow into it eventually. I was tired of buying larger sizes every couple months with other brands. The only thing I don't like is the shoulder snaps. It touches the baby's face if he is sleeping on his side, and sometime it is freezing to the touch! Also, I wonder if it is nickel free. I hope so. :) Other than that, I love it and will be a forever Baby DeeDee consumer.",

What makes it different from the rest on the market is that it is made from quilt, like a cover - my baby is warm and comfy. It is easy to put on without disturbing the baby because it opens up on shoulders. I absolutely love this sleeping bag and will recommend it to any mom!!",
