Not overly pillow fluffy but still has basic padding. It also has very soft fleecy like Lining on the back side.",

So nice to have a saddle blanket that goes past the end of the saddle, is longer on the sides. Did not remove the tags or use the velcro fasteners for first tryout. Saddle stayed in same position on the pad at end of ride. Wither clearance at the end of the ride was the same as when I first saddled up. Used in combination with ECP Cotton Quilted Half Saddle Pad on top and it was even more perfect for my older horse.",

My major annoyances with this pad are.. 1) the lack of straps (yellow circles) to fasten to the saddles billet straps 2) the misaligned straps for the girth (red lines) There is no way this pad will stay in place.. more than half of the major components for making this pad useful are missing or wrong!
