The elastic waist band is thin which makes it not as comfortable as other pj sets. I washed about 3 times and the ribbon tie (which doesn\u2019t do anything, It\u2019s more like decoration) fell off. I already feel the thin elastic waist band flipping and turning around. When it starts to flip-the pants will be tossed.",

Adding to my review/ the polka dots lay on top of the fabric and are wearing off! Elbows and rear are now solid! And after wearing for 3 months. Will not buy again.",
