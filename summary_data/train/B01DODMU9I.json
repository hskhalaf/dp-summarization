      "text": "I researched this pillow and others for a long vacation to Italy. After researching I bought the BCOZZY pillow. It does what it says. It provides support for both sides of my head if I lean one way or another. I would've liked a velcro between the front two overlapping pieces to make it secure so it didn't unfold. It stayed pretty well without it but an added 1\" of velcro would really seal it up tight. The reason for the 3 stars is that the strap to secure it to your backpack during travel broke after 1 use! That is poor quality and I think it should've lasted a lot longer for the price.",

The arms are supposed to cross over in front to support your chin, but they just flop open constantly. I was desperate to make it work before our trip, so I tried sewing Velcro tabs on the arms to hold them together, but that failed. Just the pressure of my head or chin resting on the pillow was too much for the slippery little arms. If the pillow had some kind of internal support (maybe a wire) to keep the arms in place, it might function better.",

My husband, who teases me about my struggle to find a good pillow, even liked it so much he asked me to order one for him. My second favorite is the NapAnywhere, which took a bit of trial and error but ended up supporting well and folds flat. Sadly, not sold on Amazon (though it should be!).",

      "text": "For a $30 pillow you'd expect a bit more pillow than what you actually get. The \"thick\" areas were not even as thick as a normal neck pillow. Wrapping the thick area around and doubling it up is not supportive enough for an adult's head, folding it just slid off everything, and wrapping it tighter to get more support led to choking. The fill material was nice, but the geometry of this pillow is awful.",

It was more comfortable than a blow-up pillow, but I still was not able to sleep with it. The fabric is very soft, the stuffing is substantial, it conveniently snapped on to my luggage. However, when in use, my neck still felt twisted and uncomfortable and in the end I didn't get a wink of sleep. I will probably continue to use it until the next best thing comes along.",

I have fibromyalgia, so travel is particularly tough on my body, especially my neck and shoulders. This pillow saved me from so much of the usual fatigue and pain. It is versatile, longer than most pillows, and can be adjusted to support whatever area of your neck needs the most support, plus it has a snap on strap that attaches to carry on luggage. I am eternally grateful to whomever designed this pillow! Truly a winner!",

It is not as thick as it appears in the photo but is perfect for the amount of support I was looking for.
