I couldn\u2019t find anything that was quality feeling for a reasonable price. The only gloves that felt right were the A2000 or heart of the hide $250 gloves. I chanced it and bought this glove along with the hot glove break in kit. This glove blew my mind! VERY quality for the price and gets softer doing the hot glove treatment. Feels just like the $250 gloves at more than half the price. Highly recommended!!",

I have tested it and am surprised at the level of utility, protection, and the amount of break in that the glove already had.",

And in a sense, it\u2019s what a glove should be: one that gives the player the right combination of performance and value. The cherry & black leather version is beautiful. Break-in was standard like any high quality glove through shaping and malleting around a baseball, applying a high grade leather conditioner, and trial testing through fielding and was ready to go within 48hrs. Will be using this Mizuno for many years to come.",
