      "text": "Consumer Reports rated these headsets CR Best Buy in the October 2015 issue. I love them. The sound quality and the comfort is great. The bendable ear clips adjust to fit around the ear. You can use these for normal day or sporting events. The cord length is great and allows you to do a workout, run or biking without pulling ear clips some other I\u2019ve tried and hated. The overall product quality is great and they don\u2019t feel cheap at all. These are better than the higher priced Bose in ear in my book. I would highly recommend these to my friends and family.",

I use them professionally with an Audio-Technica AT2020USB+ Cardioid Condenser USB Microphone, with Built-In Headphone Jack & Volume Control and for that application, they are awesome. So, if you want crystal clear audio, get these. I also use them for general laptop applications, such as Zoom meetings or listening to music. HOWEVER, (also as reported by others) they don't really fit well. Even though I'm sitting they still fall out seemingly without cause. And, the volume control just doesn't work. Why didn't I return them? Because THEY SOUND GREAT!",
