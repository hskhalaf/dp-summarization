Yes, a hard case is, well, a hard case, but this one has treated me well and I haven't damaged anything in over a year of use. I play Zildjian A's, so, if you know cymbals, I wasn't about to get something flimsy. The main material is pretty bomber and the stitching and handles are NOT coming off, even under heavy touring use. Highly recommended!",

My son just took this bag loaded with cymbals on a two week tour of Italy with his college jazz band.

(I don't use the back pack straps, but they're heavy duty, too). My last cymbal bag was a Sabian Bac Pac that lasted 12 years before the seams started to rip. I expect this one will last even longer.
