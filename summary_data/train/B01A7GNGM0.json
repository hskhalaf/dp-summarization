I used two of the pieces in the set and attached them to the pole with zip ties and it worked perfectly. I used black zip ties because they would be less noticeable; it would be nice if the supports came with green ones but obviously not a deal killer for me. They are sturdy and not going to bend under the weight of the vine. I even have two left for another project..............These are perfect!",

Look great up on the walls Only downside is the documentation is a pain to read (I gave up) and the amount of screws/hardware woefully inadequate. Just run to the hardware store and get your own Amended: added a photo shot with the cleamatis in August, really excellent product",

Then \"gently\" squeeze them for desired \"closure\" giving climbing plants a lot, or little space to climb. Love how you can add one above the other to \"completely\" cover the entire length of drain pipe. We use three per drain pipe. The \"green color\" blends in nicely with the foliage. Will purchase more of these. *** IDEAS & SUGGESTIONS, could easily adapt horizontally and placed on deck rails, or around smaller trees, or a free-standing lamp post, or mail box! Have Fun, we did!!!",

They show no signs of rust or wear despite living through a full winter, spring, summer and a couple rainy months of fall. Great deal for the price!",
