      "text": "This printer is a great idea - small, rechargeable battery, quiet, and fast. However, Epson's use of \"precision\" print heads means that you'll ultimately end up clogging them if you neglect to use your printer for a couple of weeks. If you're lucky, you can dump half a new ink cartridge into a cleaning cycle and the printer works again. However, if you're like me, the self-cleaning won't work and, if you're out of warranty, you've got a $200 paper-weight. This is especially true if you use the printer in an area that's either very dry or very warm.",

WiFi is a hit or miss so I you start with cable connection to make it connect property each time. Bottom line you will spend lots of time and money getting this to print properly on the road. My dissatisfaction is so high I will not use it anymore even after replacing the ink and maintenance box.",

Cons: I would like a snugger latch on the closure. And it would be great if they could get the same print quality with less weight. Also, a bluetooth option would be nice.

For anyone who has to maintain life on the go and requires significant printing capabilities - this is the only one i would recommend for the price after researching in stores and online.I have had it for about six months and absolutely no complaints.",

      "text": "I gave one star because it is small and compact, but the set up software is horrible. It does not work! The WiFi-Direct does not work! It works well from the USB cable, but that's not why I purchased it. I also purchased the EPSPON DS-30 which scans well, but the software also is not great. If there is a way to scan multiple pages to one PDF file I can't figure it out. The HP Deskjet software is much more practical, useful, and easier to use.",

The installation with the DVD on a Windows 8.1 system went very smooth, both with the USB connected and than switched to WiFy using the printer as a hub. When I installed the same software on my Windows 7 Laptop, the USB connection worked great, when I switched to WiFy, not so good. I had to download a new driver from Epson for the windows 7. After that the WiFy connection worked great. The print quality is very good for documents. Have not printed any pictures.",

Here is the rub, GOOD LUCK FINDING INK CARTRIDGES AND THE LITTLE MAINTENANCE BOX (holds the wasted ink) you have to get them from Epson, sometimes on Amazon but never in a store or office place. I recommended this printer highly and getting the ink from Epson is not so bad.",
