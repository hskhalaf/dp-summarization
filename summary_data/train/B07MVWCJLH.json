After having it for 2 days its brilliant and easy to learn your way around it. Good things to know are there is no right click. So to do this you have to hold alt then click with your mouse pad. There is also no caps lock but to do this press the magnifying glass button and alt at the same time then shift to turn it off again.

The battery seems to need charging quite frequently, which would not be a problem in itself, but I find as soon as I plug it in to charge up, within a couple of minutes it becomes impossible to use as the icon freezes. It is tempting to leave the thing on charge permanently but I know this is not good for it. Would therefore not recommend this product.",
