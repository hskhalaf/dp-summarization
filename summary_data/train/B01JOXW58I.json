After a few minutes, it starts working again and repeats the cycle all over again.

This new generation Linksys made by Belkin really disappoints.",

Otherwise you will only get the 100mbps even if you have more coming in as the wiring makes a huge difference.",

Reception is much weaker than the Netgear, and the transfer speed between my desktop computer (connected to a wired port) and my laptop (which is connected wirelessly) is simply terrible. Around 4Mb/s (32Mbit/s) on both the 2.4Ghz network and the 5Ghz network - this is also when they are next to each other (1-2 meters far from each other).",

I give this route 3.5 stars though because after upgrading Internet speed from 50Mbps to 100Mbps and 300Mbps (download), the router would not detect the speed change. After multiple resets of the modem and the router, the only way for the router to pick up the increased speed is to reset the router to factory defaults and upgrade the firmware to the latest again. Perhaps a firmware issue but very inconvenient for the user.",
