I live in apt complex that has a reputation for roaches so i thought one more round would work. Well i dont know if they were expired or what but it didnt work, roaches didnt even touch the bait. I shared both orders with my boyfriend who also lives in an apartment complex and he said the same thing. I will be contacting the seller since the baits were untouched",

I woke up in the middle of the night and found one belly up middle of the kitchen floor and a bigger one crawling to its death. As the days go on I only see one here and there but I dont see them alive. Today is day 4 and found one with wings! Definately getting to the nests. Follow directions. I flooded my kitchen and bathroom with these traps. I think the 1 stars probably didn't use them strategically. I'm a happy camper",
