When I shower they are on the entire time except for a brief time as I remove one at a time to wash feet. Highly recommend for a safe bathing experience. Would also be good for any slick surface.",

I think the size should only be listed to maybe an 11. I would recommend these for anyone having trouble with slipping in the shower.",
