The lip faces down. The lid will fit. 2. \u201cNon-stick Issue\u201d. Take a small baking spatula and go around a portion of the egg. It will slide out. Also use oil or butter to begin with. 3. \u201cCups are hard to remove\u201d. See picture in my review. Lift the tray by the handle and place on surface of stove. The cups will pop up, and they\u2019re easy to remove.",

First if all it is not a non stick i literally threw away 6 eggs because they all were stuck and came out looking deformed and in pieces. Also the cups are so small that if you use large eggs it can and will over flow. I am delicate with my cookware soo i have soft sponge and thats what i like to use so i did. The not stick (black part) literally scraped off as i was trying to remove the residue of the eggs that stuck to the cups.",

We used a sauce pan for soft boiled eggs but a lot of times the eggs are overcooked because you can only guess at the cooking time. The size of eggs are different. Medium, large or extra large eggs have different cooking times. Using this pan we can determine the consistency of the inside of the egg. We press on the egg slightly with a fork to determine the softness or hardness of the egg as it is cooking. Easy to clean the cups. Easy storage! I would highly recommend the product!",

You'll get the hang of how done you prefer your eggs, I prefer a runny yolk, which means the top should not be solid/have some movement, then my eggs are done. Easy to clean up also, the teflon hasn't deteriorated at all. Definitely recommend for poached eggs, works great. Update: Bought a second one of these for the fifth wheel. My wife and I are still eating eggs and grits for breakfast almost every weekend, can't live without this!",

The only complaint I do have is that, although the egg cups are coated with non-stick material, you MUST remember to spray with oil before using. Otherwise you'll have quite a task ahead cleaning each little cup....I found out the hard way!",

Don't worry about eggs getting stuck, they come out even easier this way. Importantly, they taste more like poached eggs than boiled eggs.",

The egg cups themselves, are solid, non-stick and also have decent weight so as to make them non-flimsy. The bottom stainless steel, is surprising light. This is why I believe others have had issues with quality, but really, all fits together so well, that the other parts compensate for this lightness. All in all, one of the better poachers I've seen.

It is made well, but very heavy to lift and I never use but 3 of the cups so it is very cumbersome for me to handle. Now that I have this one, I see you now have exactly what I wanted - but when I wanted it, you didn't have it.",
