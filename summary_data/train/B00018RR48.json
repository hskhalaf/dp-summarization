The pots work beautifully, is well made and has a very pretty design.",

It\u2019s better to just keep it off because if bumped, the ring will be swimming.

It cleans easily. The electrical cord holds on magnetically, which I suppose is a good thing. If you were to trip on the cord, it would fall out rather than take down the entire pot.",

The one thing to be aware of is the length of the cord. It is a magnetic connection that disengages easily to avoid pulling the pot over (a good thing.) The cord is short, and will need an extension for most people. To avoid the extension from pulling and disengaging the connection, we taped it to the table. Not very attractive but worked fine. I would prefer unattractive than a pulled over pot of oil!",

Designed for use with oil, broth, chocolate, or cheese, the set combines powerful electric heat with easy temperature control and handsome but tidy construction. The 3-quart stainless-steel bowl is lined with nonstick coating for keeping heated foods from sticking, and the stand, bowl, ring, and temperature probe all assemble and disassemble easily. A combination of finishes\u2014brushed on the bowl and ring, mirror on the stand and handles\u2014gives the unit a contemporary flair. \n\nHeat up is efficient here--getting oil to 375 degrees F takes between 10 and 15 minutes. Best of all, you can change the temperature setting with a simple turn of the dial to adjust for different ingredients or the passage of time. For clean up, run the entire set (temperature probe and cord removed, of course) through the dishwasher. A set of eight color-coded fondue forks is also included. Fully assembled, the fondue maker stands 6-1/4 inches high; the bowl is 8-1/4 inches in diameter at the opening.",
