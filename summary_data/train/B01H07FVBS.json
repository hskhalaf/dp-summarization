      "text": "BenQ have really outdone themselves with this monitor. I have never been so amazed at a picture quality before. Take this as an investment, its build quality is fantastic and the thing looks simple but beautiful. The bezel is thick but the politeness of the logo and gentle glow of the on button are unimposing. The picture quality is stunning, colours are deep and the contrast is exquisite. Absolutely grab this while you can, but a caution, i've got 60hz monitors and they are sluggish compared, you might find yourself getting a couple of these.",

I needed the monitor so I just bought it If you are going to buy it put it on your watched list and you may get a bargain. That aside its a good all round monitor for gaming watching movies and dare I say work related activities",

The S switch it comes with is very handy for navigating the monitors options and the USB 3.0 built into the side of the monitor is a nice little touch, I would 101% reccomend this monitor",
