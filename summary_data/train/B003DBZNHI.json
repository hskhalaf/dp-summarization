With adjustment, pencil written on white paper is very readable. I use it for long-distance office hours. I am still getting an IPad to be able to better draw, but in the mean-time, this works very well.",

      "text": "This is a straightforward inexpensive document camera. It requires software to use, so you can't just plug it in and go. The software is free, and only available via download, but at least you don't have to keep track of the disk. The software is a little hokey, but has a few decent features (snapshots, zoom, autofocus) The camera only requires a USB cable (included) so you don't have to run a separate power cord. I used it on a Mac and it worked well enough. It is no way compares to a commercial document camera, but those cost 10x more. For the price, its a decent value.",

This is a lot better than another document camera my wife used that cost 5x more. Great product!",
