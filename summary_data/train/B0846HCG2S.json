It is not the quickest of the phones and it will get saturated quite often if you have a lot of things open in the background, but if you shut them and let the phone think for a sec. it will be all good. If you need a quick fix this will definitely do the trick!",

My G7 would easily last 3 days without a charge, with this phone (this is the power version) you can literally see the battery drain in front of you.

All were as expected , esp pleased with the wide angle camera on the rear , and the substantial extra settings, inc manual, over the G6 . If you have a G6 it is well worth the upgrade to this phone, in my opinion. For the money, not sure how you could possibly not give this phone 5 stars.",
