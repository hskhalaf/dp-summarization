I never even knew naughty dogs came out with this till awhile ago when I actually saw. Bought it played it and to be honest wish there is more uncharted series to come in the future lol. Loved the story since it focused on the two other characters in the series. Honestly if you never played the lost legacy I\u2019d actually give it a try. After I played this it made me wanna replay the whole entire uncharted series all over again.",

It took me 9.5 hours to play all the way through on normal dificulty. There are no super natural happenings or trippy effects in this one. Just some straight forward fortune hunting, puzzle solving and intense gun battles with a Warlord and his private army. Hopefully Naughty Dog continues making the Uncharted series as I've really enjoyed each game.",

The game play, graphics, etc. are all similar to Uncharted 4: This game was originally conceived as DLC for Uncharted 4, and then was expanded to an entire game. The single player campaign is great, I have not played the multiple player (I am not really interested in multiplayer for any of these games, so cant comment there). There is a chapter in the middle of the game that provides a new free-roam aspect to the Uncharted series. Very cool",

The major difference is that instead of playing as Drake, you play as Chloe with Nadine as a computer controlled tagalong. Very little if anything changed with the controller layout. The action and graphics are just as spectacular as Uncharted 4 as well as the scripting and voice over acting. If the ending is an indicator, and I believe it is, the series will continue with these main characters. It remains to be seen if I will get as excited about them as I did Drake.",

I bought Uncharted Lost Legacy because of its plot, the storyline (which I felt like could've been done slightly better and a bit longer) still, a good game and consisting of two tough women who know how to handle their own. I've played the first Uncharted and I have to say, I already favor this one over that. Drake's cool but Chloe and Nadine make one heck of a team.",
