I normally use Estee Lauder 5N-Deep Neutral, but I realized the color is more skin tone than Estee Lauder. However, unless you use some type of setting powder this concealer will move around and off your face. Using a moisturizer underneath this concealer makes it move around more and I found that it provides light to medium coverage. I normally have to apply two or three swipes to get my dark circles covered. I did find that when you use this on top of the Estee Lauder it's the perfect combination for a better hold and STAYS PUT ALL DAY.",
