So we bought a second hutch and modified it to be a mirror of the first one. We then took the screens out of each end and connected them. The result is now both bunnies have plenty of protected and safe space to hop around in. They obviously love it and also really like their tunnels and protective houses at each end. We gave our bunnies cage a couple of coats of outdoor varnish to make it waterproof :)",

The inside of the hutch is awkward and not easy to clean. The tray is hard to slide in and out. Other than the look of it, it just isn't ideal. We will have to replace the cage after a few months.

Even after cleaning daily I get urine on the ground under the cage..... not a winner. So disappointed.",

It is super easy to put together (I did it alone) amd extremely easy to clean. I like that there are two areas on the roof you can easily open. Plus, it's a real good looking hutch! I definitely would not put more than one rabbit in it, though. Even with my itty bitty bunny. Bunnies need plenty of room!",
