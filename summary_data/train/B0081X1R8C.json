      "text": "These are by far the best headphones I have ever owned. I did not realize how good the sound could be while watching movies or videos on my computer. They really enhance the sound like no other headphones. They are comfortable and block out other noises pretty well while playing music, otherwise you can hear sounds IE; the phone, t.v. etc. when the headphones are on your ears but not in use. I am extremely happy with this purchase. I bought them for about $127, I noticed they went up to $150 already. I feel like I got a good deal as well.",

The Bose name is overhyped,but I certainly enjoyed my previous pair. I am glad I found several Bose headsets under $100. I had several to choose from and I don't know there is a whole lot of difference between them,but I chose this set from Amazon Warehouse. The description said good condition. To me they look brand new. I am blown away by the incredible sound these produce. The bass is outstanding! Again,I couldn't imagine paying over $200 for headphones and for $75 I couldn't imagine any headphones sounding better. Extremely pleased!",
