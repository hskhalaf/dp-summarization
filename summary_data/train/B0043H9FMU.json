I would recommend buying extra teflon sheets I've heat pressed hats, headbands, baby clothes , stuffed animals, etc. I've had this heat press for 5 months bows and works like the first time I used it",

After reading reviews and comparing several different heat presses, we decided to go with this one! What a great decision! The first night we used it, we did over 20 shirts with no problems! Takes about 15 minutes to heatup and although no instructions were included, its simple to figure out. Big press, but not huge. Came with teflon sheet that we attached to the top with magnets to avoid having to place on top the tshirts for each press. Once you figure out how much tension you need, its perfect! Would definitely recommend this heatpress! Love it!",

For a start up press .. I love it! I was referred by a friend and he loved it.. and so do I. Super easy to to use. The thing I did notice was the heat press mat lifts a little when you remove your shirt after pressing. I\u2019ll probably have to find a way to tack it down a little bit so it won\u2019t lift. Overall.. my first try at this.. awesome!",
