I have a set of ceramic knives that has the handle protruding about 1/4 inch below the sharp cutting edge making it difficult to use for chopping unless the handle clears the edge of the cutting board, These work better for me.",

The only negative I have is that you have to be very careful not to cut your finger with the corner of the knife blade. After a couple of nicks you\u2019ll get the hang of it.

All ceramic knives are delicate and again my experience is that eventually there will be a mishap and they will snap; including the most expensive.

Today, I throw one of the knives away, since it was almost dangerous to use. A dull blade has a danger of cutting yourself. It may be easy to clan, easy to hold, but it does not cut well, it is not a good knife.",
