Its amazing at taking one sheet at a time through the feeder. Not once have I seen it double feed with 2 sheets stuck together. Beware though that it would not be the best for scanning family photos. Attached are 2 images. One from a typical cheap Epson Workforce Printer/Flatbed scanner and another from the Kodak. Both at 600dpi with max jpeg quality and little compression. The Epson is much better quality.",

Generation of searchable PDF is very slow compared with iX500. Poor Mac OS support. Its Windows software does NOT work with Parallels Desktop + Win10. (But VirtualBox + Win10 is ok.)",
