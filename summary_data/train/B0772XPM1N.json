No one can control that. The dressers and night stand were already assembled, just had to put the \"feet\" on. Super easy. I would definitely recommend this product to any one. Its very modern, looks great.",

      "text": "I really like this bed set, but the bed broke after 1 week. There are only 4 support slats which does not redistribute weight well. For a couple of dollars more, they could have put 2 more and my bed would not have broken. Wow! I then contacted the seller and they indicated they don't offer a guarantee. They don't even stand behind their own product to offer a solution to the fact I now have a broken bed because they were cheap. It's ok though...I will buy the necessary slats and fix the bed on my own, but I would never recommend 2K Furniture to anyone else!",

The shipping company, however, is quite slow and fails to communicate clearly when you will actually see your things. Tracking marked it in our town for over a week before it was delivered on a date that was still later than our expected arrival date. Long story short - if you have time to wait and don't like to know what's going on, the furniture set is great.",
