      "text": "I just ran the Colorado 2018 full Tough Mudder in these New Balance train shoes. They fit perfectly and helped me get through 12 miles of mud and trail and to get through, under and over 20 obstacles. The NB shoes provided superb traction which was very important as the course had us tackling some steep inclines up to 12,000 feet above sea level. Equally important is how well they drained after going through the watery, muddy obstacles (e.g. Block Ness Monster, Caged, Kiss of Mud). I hosed them down the next day and they cleaned up well, looking almost brand new. I'm very impressed with the Vazee Summit shoes.",

(Since my usual size was on sale, I was hoping that previous \"runs small\" comments might apply to people with a Roman toe. But no, they just seem to run small.) Also, the sole provides poor traction on hard floors. I was hoping that these would also be backup shoes for work, but they were slippery on the hospital floor. The women's wide width was not as roomy as the pair of NB boys' wide width shoes that I love. Unfortunately, most of the current boys' styles look childish.",
