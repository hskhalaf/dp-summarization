Don't freak by the absence of \"f\" and \"j\" bumps for finding home; instead of bumps those two keys have a greater concave across the top than the other keys. You can barely see it, but you can certainly feel it once you get accustomed. Ausgezeichnet!!!",

I sat down at the computer this morning and touched the keyboard with a static shock (like we do as kids by rubbing our feet on the ground and shocking each other) and killed 4 of the keys! I spoke with the tech guy at Cherry Americas and he said that it is possible to damage the keyboard controller on the PCB with a static shock. WTH??? He couldn't help me because it was 1 month out of warranty. My Avant Prime keyboard lasted almost 20 years .",

The Varmilo is crap. The snappy, crisp sound from the G80 switches make long typing sessions more enjoyable and without any hand strain. Some cheaper mechanical keyboards I have with clone MX blue keyswitches are almost the same feeling, without the crisp sound. Would buy again.",

After every stroke there is a noticeable ding type noise right after the clicky key stroke noise, almost like a metallic echo from the aluminum frame. A little disconcerting, at first. Overall, a decent keyboard for the price. Oddly, the keyboard came packaged in a plain brown cardboard box, like you'd get in a bulk pack shipment.",

It's definitely made for gaming such as DOTA2, LOL. etc. Of course, you may say the Cherry black switch will be better. But from my perspective, i highly recommend this G80 3000. 3000 is also a better typing keyboard. Do not hesitate to buy it if you really search for a good keyboard.",
