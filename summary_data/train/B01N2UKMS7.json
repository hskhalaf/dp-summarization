I still have a little room, but since they are laced all the way up, the extra room is actually great because I can choose different thicknesses of socks to wear. They are a little stiff at the ankle and caused some pain for the first couple days, but I can tell they are already loosening up. The only problem I have is that they don't have a \"pull on\" strap in the back - so getting them on and off is not easy.",
