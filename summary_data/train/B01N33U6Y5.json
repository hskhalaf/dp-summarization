Anything less and virtually nothing comes out of it. My only other complaint is simply the design. Having those extra caps to deal with is not something I need to bring to my dinner table.",

      "text": "Glass bodies of these grinders are easy to clean, provide a comfortable grip and nice hefty feel in my hand. Wonderful design, modern style looks great in our home. Top dispensing orientation took a few uses to become instinctive but totally eliminates the need for the catch plate \u201cnormal\u201d grinders require. Grind size (coarseness) adjusters are smooth and effective, requiring just a slight single-finger tap to quickly switch from coarse to fine or back. Brushed stainless tops and collars resist fingerprints, clean easily and are interchangeable. When you can see the contents, color coded tops are completely unnecessary.",

I am willing to pay for a new top but can't find a replacement. Anything can break but there needs to be a way to get a replacement part. If there is resolve this post will be updated.",

I say this because I bought a different set , paid a lot for them only to have to replace them because the grinders were on the bottom and got pepper all over the cupboard.. also had another set that the grinders were hard to turn and did not do a good job of grinding... these grinders have solved both problems.. I definitely recommend this product.",

I wouldn't recommend a grinder that rusts shut like this. I'm assuming it's because I grind pepper over liquids that are boiling and the steam rusted my grinder but that should be par for the course. Who solely grinds pepper on lukewarm already cooked food? I grind pepper over boiling liquids WAY more often. Anyways, I don't recommend.",
