That being said, the quality of abrasive, level of bond strength, and crisp feedback are better than some budget stones I have that don't wear as rapidly. And, of course, the wear may well have been the result of error on my part - my hand can get as heavy as the next guy's if my attention slips. All in all, 100% worth the price of purchase.",
