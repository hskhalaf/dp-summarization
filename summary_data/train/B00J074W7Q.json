I have tried about everything out there and for the money...and being plant based...in my opinion it's right up there with the top name brands; for a lot less cost. I mix it with Organic raspberries, blueberries, 1/2 of banana, Green Vibrance and self ground Flax Seed; plus some high potency mutli vitamins with minerals and Ubiqunol. I usually am never tired and have energy that keeps me going until fairly late at night.I'm going to be 70 and something has to be helping me and I believe it is this regiment.

I should say though that the pre made versions of orgain that come in the small containers taste totally different and are really not bad. If you must order Orgain for some reason, skip the powder form and spend extra on the small cartons.",

It does not taste good and it is darker in color than any that I've had before. The expiration date stamped on the bottom is two years out, so that isn't the issue. When purchasing from Amazon.com, LLC who am I buying this product from??? Do people actually make counterfeit protein powder??? That seems unlikely, but maybe I'm naive. Will only buy from whole foods or costco in future.",

I ordered the unflavored version because I did not want to consume all the erythritol and Stevia of the flavored version. But to my surprise when I received the product I check the nutrition facts in the label and it is different from the Amazon\u2019s version. It has 1gram of Sugar. The Amazon nutrition label has 0 gram of Sugar.",
