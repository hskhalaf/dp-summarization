This is not a memory foam (obviously, or I wouldn't have ordered it) but that should be the only excuse to ever fold up a mattress. There's a giant crease right in the middle, like the inner cotton is broken. My daughter won't be sleeping on it. Will definitely be sending it back. If I can't send it back, maybe I'll give it to my dog. Again I ask, WHY would one fold a mattress this small to ship???",

The only downfall is that it doesn't break down to a smaller size for airline travel, though I would bring it along on a roadtrip.

My only regret is that I didn't know about this product sooner. And there is no need for a mattress protector because its waterproof plastic on both sides. I was also impressed with the quality and feel like we got our money's worth with this purchase. It arrived in 3 days with Amazon Prime too.",

The Pack \u2018n Play itself has a hard service that I wasn\u2019t satisfied and feel comfortable placing my baby to sleep in it. The mattress fits perfectly and is so comfortable for my 3 month old baby. Plus, having the mattress in gives it a few more inches higher in depth so it is easier for me to place him in without having to reach further that can strain my back (I\u2019m 5\u2019 3\u201d). My baby is now 5 month old and we have never encountered a problem. Wish I knew about this for my first born.",

If you live in the city and don't have room to spare for an actual crib for your little one, like me, this transformed my playpen (Graco) into an actual crib.

It was good and did it's job but it's not waterproof so any accidents end up being absorbed into the foam (>\u00a2<). With this new mattress, I can wipe it down plus I feel like the baby is sleeping in an actual bed!!",
