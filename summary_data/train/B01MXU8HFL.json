My dog tends to end up with her lower body sideways with her upper body twisted. Another problem I have with it is the top clips strap doesn\u2019t stay tight. I\u2019m going to be adding Velcro to keep the strap tight so my dog stays secure because any time she moves the strap looses up. Other then that it seems to be a good product. I\u2019ll be using it a lot so I\u2019ll see how well it holds up.",
