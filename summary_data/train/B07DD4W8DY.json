    "description": "Make magical things at the push of a button.\n\nWhat if you could sketch a design, then turn it into something real you could actually use? What if you could print things you wanted, needed, or just dreamed up on your desk, instead of relying on factories half a world away?\n\nMeet Glowforge. It uses a beam of light the width of a human hair to cut, engrave, and shape designs from a variety of materials.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot you can do with that kind of power: it\u2019s having the perfect gift when you need one. A way to furnish your space. A personal boutique. A sandbox for your inventions. A launchpad for your business. And that's just the start.\n\nThree steps to a finished product.\n\nStep 1: Make Your Design\nWhether you craft for fun or you\u2019re an experienced designer, it\u2019s easy to bring your ideas to life. Use dozens of different design software packages \u2013 everything from high-end CAD software to PowerPoint. It takes PDF, SVG, JPEG and other common file formats. Designing can also be as simple as drawing with a pen \u2013 Glowforge has onboard cameras that will scan your drawing and transform it into a digital file you can print, once or a hundred times. \n\nStep 2: Pick Your Materials\nYou can use all kinds of materials with Glowforge \u2013 things like wood or leather, fabric, cardboard, acrylic, and even chocolate. In fact, you can print on hundreds of materials \u2013 a river rock, secondhand lumber, your iPhone. It\u2019s up to you, but to make things easy, you can use our line of Proofgrade materials. They\u2019re finished and come encoded with automatic settings for perfect printing every time. \n\nStep 3: Watch the Magic Happen\nHit print and watch your Glowforge go. It works on a PC, it works on a Mac, and we have apps for iPad and iPhone \u2013 so you can create with just your fingertip. See your finished product in minutes. \nHuman accessible laser power: less than 0.1 mW CDRH/IEC Class 1 laser product",
