It assembled pretty easily with one person. Watch out for the 2 different length poles, there are three, maybe put a mark on the one shorter one. Really spacious inside, it slept three of us and two dogs just fine. I could see getting quite a few years out of it if I take care of it.",

Came with everything including a tiny loft, which is really handy, if just for setting up inside in the dark to hold a flashlight. I like that the included bag is not so small that it is impossible to put the tent back in while dis-assembling. That has always ticked me off. It's airy and yet has the perfect cover so it's private. Very nice for the price.",

It is nice and tall so I can stand up in it and has a lot of ventilation on hot days. I have not tested it in the rain yet but I like how the rain fly goes all the way down. I use it for myself and my toddler. I can comfortably have a queen size bed set up and a portable crib and still have room for play area. It's really easy to set up and take down. I was able to do it myself (and that's with a toddler at my feet).",
