I use my phone a lot so I don't want to use my phone. Besides, the separate GPS unit does the job more efficiently. But Garmin has made it so transferring favorites is easy with their Express but it only does a partial job. I'm having to re-enter a number of customers. Also, volume is not as loud as my model 50. Otherwise, it's just getting used to different placement of icons. And why did you change favorites to a heart?",

It worked out great. another nice feature is that the screen is large enough that it can show nearby restaurants and gas stations on the map. There's a clip on the back for holding the pointer, which does work better than finger-touching (though using fingers on this model is no more difficult than with any other).",
