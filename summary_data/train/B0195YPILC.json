The item pictured looks attractive, sturdy and functional plus made of wood. Abject failure on three of four qualifiers. The positive? It is made of wood. As is the box it came in. This bellows is composed of highly compressed thin sheets of paper. Layers and layers of paper with a slick thicker plastic handle cover with woodgrain look. The leatherette was not awful and the rivets were sturdy. Compressed paper was not on our wish list. Item returned to Amazon. May have to take up woodworking.",

This tool provides precise control with the amount of air in the bellows much better that the fanning carboard which sometimes can put a fire out. The quality of the product is ok, if it were more expensive I would be more annoyed about it, but it serves a great value. I would highly recommend this product for anyone who is serious about campfires.",

It's infinitely better than fanning with a piece of cardboard and I've gotten fires hotter than I ever could without it. The construction material looks cheap but a year later, it still works great. My only complaint is that the air is a little too focused, meaning you get a strong, quick burst of air in one small spot, which sometimes puts out a fire instead of stoking it. I think a slightly broader nozzle would be preferable.",
