Came in Saran Wrap and tossed in a box with other items which is fine but I\u2019d prefer for the product to arrive in its official brand packaging and sealed. when I removed the wrap I was able to squeeze out the product past the initial hardened crusty part in the opening. Lol sounds gross. I can just hope that it contains the orginal, untampered cleansing formula but next time I\u2019ll just go to the store to ease the doubt.",
