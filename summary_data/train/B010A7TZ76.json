      "text": "I bought two of these for my home office. They replaced another (older model) Canon and a H/P. I experienced a problem with wireless installation and called the Canon \"Tech Support\" line. The heavily-accented technician told me I would have to pay $150 for a solution to my problem. I hung up and muddled through the problem myself. BE WARNED: Tech Support won't be much help unless you've got plenty of cash to spend. I gave the printer(s) four stars because I was able to solve the installation problem myself. I'd give their so-called tech support no stars.",

Also you have to install a special driver on your computer to get it to scan, and run the scan from your computer rather than the printer itself- so if you're scanning a multi-page document and your printer isn't right next to your computer, it's quite inconvenient and time consuming. We have actually gone back to using the black and white laser printer I got in 2001 and the scanning apps on our phones rather than using this horrible and inefficient device. That's how bad this is.",

The start to finish. which included un-taping the printer parts that were taped together. And I printed something on my cell phone without having to do anything. Thank you Canon, You might eventually get me to install Full frame cameras. This was super easy. The competitors' printers stopped working altogether. Purchase Canon. The quality is fantastic!!",
