I would have given this 4 stars, since it is a nice unit but a little loud. Unfortunately, a crack began to form in front of the left foot pad. I am pretty large, 6'6\" 235lbs, but still under the published weight limit of the stepper (250lbs). It is not safe to use any longer. Too bad, because it is nice option during the snowy and rainy springs in Michigan.",

The 'twist' more closely mimics how one would walk up-down stairs in real life, which is why I feel I get a much better workout, short of real stairs or a much-more expensive stair master machine. This also works great in areas with low headroom; it adds about a foot to your height, so if you're 6' you can use this with ceilings at least 7' in height. The resistance bands are a nice addition and good for arm/shoulder workouts.",

Day 1, the peddles were bit heavy to push down, but after I got used to using this machine, they became just right as long as I stand over the edge when I do reg. stepping exercise. I think because my weight is not heavy enough. I just started to add \"Speed Skating\" like exercise with it, and I'm liking it. When I sit on a chair and push the peddles down, that gives me good workout, too. I enjoy using it, and make up something as I use it.",

Makes creaking sounds after awhile, need to use WD-40 on it. I would recommend this if you don't want to spend much, or you have limited space and need something portable. This seems to work pretty well for both of those markets, unless it ends up not being durable, but only time will tell! I'll update if anything bad happens.",

I do not think it will help my butt as far as toning, but it should help other problem areas. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because at the lowest resistance it was still hard to move.

It's great, but not perfect: the stride length is tiny, it can be squeaky, and I'd mostly love to be able to increase the resistance dramatically.
