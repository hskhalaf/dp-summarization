The reason I did not give this device a 5 star rating is due to its cost.",

      "text": "I purchased this unit because I thought I would get more detailed information when it was connected to a tablet or a laptop for transmission of network data and use the basic testing as a stand alone unit for quick results. I liked the small size my techs could carry it in their pocket.. The better solution is to buy an adapter for your tablet that you can connect a network cable to and then run any number of free apps which can give you far more information. The adapter costs about $12.00. This is a waste of money $299.00 you can buy a tablet and adapter and get far more info.",
