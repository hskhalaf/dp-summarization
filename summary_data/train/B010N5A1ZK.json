EDIT 2017-02-10 These shoes were great for all about 2-2.5 weeks of playing on them. As one other buyer pointed out the soles on both of my shoes were defective and started peeling back causing a dangerous condition where I would be tripping over the now folded back rubber. I've tried shoe gooing them as well as super glue to no help. Buyer beware of defective soles!",

I have shoes that have held together for a decade, or longer. I don't expect these to make it past a year before they are unwearable.
