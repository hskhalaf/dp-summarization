These gloves are pretty much like what some of the Pros use. I use these 3-4 times a week in boxing class training alongside former and current boxers. One major key to these gloves over others is the wrist support. The gloves come down right to the cusp of my forearm. this is critical for hard punchers like me, so not to injure your wrists. Everlast makes quality equipment. These are a certain upgrade over my Title gloves that are now collecting dust.",

The Velcro has not completely separated but it will with continued use and then the gloves will no longer be usable. This is the only problem I have however, it is still a big one. I would like to think I just purchased a defective glove because I have had no problems with the other glove.",
