If you can make this work in your yard get it, you can use up to a 100ft extension cord. 14 gauge should be fine but if you aren't certain of your home wiring get the 12 gauge to be safe.",

Doesn't seem to lose power in higher grass. Very light. Cons: Mind the extension cords. Easy to knock a wheel out of alignment.

The wheels are adjustable for different cutting heights. It\u2019s easy to maneuver, especially for women and children. If it has a con, then it is that if your grass is too thick and high, it loads it down and the blades stop. So you\u2019ll need to first cut your grass with something else such as a manual or more powerful gas or electric. I used a manual push mower. Once you get your grass height under control, then a weekly pass with this is great. And no raking.",

After starting this machine, it sounds like working good, however, the cutter (or power) was too weak to cut even short grass. Also , the grass catcher was too small so I had to empty the catcher every single minute.... Moreover, I smelled that something was burned inside the machine after only 10 minutes.",

The holes in the plastic for the screws to attach the handle to the mower do not match the holes in the handle itself so had to be forced by making the plastic holes larger. The snap on grass catcher falls off frequently while mowing, causing all the caught grass to fall out on the lawn which defeats the purpose. (Happened three times today on small lawn. Each time it had clicked in and attached completely as advertised.) Very cheaply made!! It looks and acts like a toy,",
