I have a 4.5 gallon oval aquarium on the top and two 3.5 gallons circle ones on the bottom. Although not made of real wood, it is super sturdy and very modern. My 17 yr old son even commented that he liked it and wanted an identical one for his dorm room. Couldn't be happier with my purchase decision!!",

The only issue I had is the bottom part does not line up with the legs so it can not be screwed together, we just have the bottom piece sitting there. We bought the matching coffee table as well but it has not arrived yet. Hope we do not have the same issues!!",

I got a shelf unit from the same company, and the shelves look and feel much more like wood even though they are clearly labeled as composite. The metal corners do not align and one side of one sticks out from a corner, and the other corner doesn't line up at all. It is stable and I will keep it in the corner of a room because it's not worth the hassle to try to return. I gave two stars for the look and the ease to put it together. The quality is sub par.",
