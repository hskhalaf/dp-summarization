Now, this thing doesn\u2019t cut, it crushes. Badly. It\u2019s not sharp, from day 1 it crushes all the nails and I actually have to go get real scissors to trim the leftovers of the crushed nail. I\u2019ve tried sharpening it with the same tools used to sharpen regular nail trimmers, impossible, too narrow and curved blades make it impossible. I would not recommend this at all.",

Simply put, there is no pet care solution on the market like the FURminator product line. The FURminator Dog & Cat Nail Clippers let you groom your pets nails right from your own home.

Get professional quality results from your own home with the FURminator product line.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\nFURMINATOR NAIL GRINDER\nA well groomed pet is a happy, healthy pet. But, there are many reasons that frequent visits to your pet stylist aren\u2019t always possible. With FURminator\u2019s line of professional quality grooming tools, you can achieve professional results in your own home. As industry innovators and experts on pet hair, FURminator understands the entire shedding cycle and the role that hair care and hygiene play in helping to reduce shedding and make you and your pet happy. For that reason, FURminator developed a high-performance line of hair-care, nail, hygiene, and waterless products.\n\nNail care is one of the most important and somewhat misunderstood areas of pet care for most pet owners. Because nails require clipping and grinding, many pet parents are afraid of injuring their pets, but ignoring nail care is just as harmful.

Monitor your pet\u2019s nails and care for when appropriate to avoid overgrowth.\n 2. Pet\u2019s nails should not touch the floor when standing. Regular maintenance is important for the health and comfort of your pet.\n 3. Before starting, note where the dead nail ends and where the live part \u2013 the quick- starts. Hold the paw firmly while gently pressing the base of each nail with your thumb.\n 4. Use the nut on the outside of the nail guide to adjust desired cutting depth. Until you and your pet are comfortable, don\u2019t get too aggressive. Cut just a little off every few days.\n\nFor a complete look at the FURminator product line, visit the FURminator Brand Store.\n\nFURminator Nail Care Nail Clippers Accurately trim the nails of your dog with the FURminator Nail Clippers.
