No real noise cancelling system but they fit so perfectly with a great range of buds and earpieces to completely custom fit your ear the \"seal\" is superb. I wear them every trip (I LIVE on airplanes) and they are only slightly more noisy than my $300 HUGE over ear headphones that I no longer even carry. They take up as much room in my briefcase as my presentation pointer (actually less). Simply superb in every way!",

The only complaints I have about these (I've gone through 3 pairs): 1. the wire gets tangled/twisted SO easily...after awhile the inside wires start to get messed up and they will break. I wish they would make these with a different, more flexible/tangle free material. 2. the mic/control piece almost always stops working after a couple of months on every one that i've owned. is it the sweat? durability issue? not sure...but either way, I don't use it much so it wasn't a deal breaker for me.",

Babies crying in the row behind me doesn't bother me at all with these head phones. I also run with these and they stay in my ear really well and I never have to worry about adjust them.

I contacted the seller and they told me it's a Manufacturer issue. Basically they are Falsely selling this as working with the popular Apple products and when you discover they do not - they push you to Monster that will inform you it's not Apple comparable. Then if you want to return given it won't work, the seller keeps 50% or more of your purchase price!! This is criminal!",
