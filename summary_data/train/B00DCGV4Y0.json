There is a small problem in that it doesn't always recognize the \"keystroke\". Also, when I turn it on and I haven't set it on a surface yet, it will scroll through my contacts (the red keyboard is on many surfaces because I haven't set it down. Not a defect.) but I can't even figure out the sequence of buttons to scroll through my contacts on purpose. If I can figure that out, and how to send a message on the keyboard, my rating would be a 5.",
