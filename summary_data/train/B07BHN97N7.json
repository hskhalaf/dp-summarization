By mid-May the molds at the top of the shoe were completely worn down, despite him putting and taking his cleats off in the dugout in order to prevent the molds from getting worn. Unfortunately, since I bought the cleats a month before baseball started, I am unable to return them. It was a complete waste of money! Cleats should last longer than 1 month.",

This is because the mid-sole is actually too soft (compresses on push off), and because the cleat mold design allows dirt to clump on the bottom of the shoe, diminishing traction. Also, not super durable. Look somewhere else unless comfort is a higher priority than performance.",
