The combination lock works well and eliminates the risk of losing keys. This cash box is probably too small to use for business purposes but works fine for storage of valuables at home.",

I only bring out this box when it's time for homework 'cause she will lose all her crayons and such things inless than two days! -- so yeah, this is the ready-homework box. I really LOVE this little box -- I think it would make a great small lunch box too. Furthermore, it's very easy to set the combination lock. I'd love to get the larger size too.",

      "text": "Perfect size and decent workmanship for the price point. I needed a metal lock box to keep my meds in. Works out perfectly for my weekly plastic pillbox organizers and keeps them safely locked away from my 3 year old Grand daughter. REvISED. Took box with my meds on a cruise. Put code in and would not open. Had to ask room attendant for screw driver to open. Box was destroyed in process. I can no longer recommend.",

      "text": "This cash box/safe is perfect for anyone looking to secure smaller items, without having to take up a lot of shelf space in the process. We got this for my son so he could keep his wallet and cell phone locked up when he is not in his dorm room. If you take out the cash tray, you can put a cell phone, wallet, and a box of gift cards in the box comfortably and still have some extra space. He says the combination lock was very easy to program, and this is exactly what we were looking for. Great value!",
