So much so, that if you attach this to drywall and try to use the extinguisher, it will pull the mount off right along with it.. So, attach to a stud if you don't want that happening. That said, I am not certain a child or a weak person could remove this from a wall if it was attached securely to a stud however, it is THAT tight. So keep that in mind. I'm thinking of buying a fork style mount separately.",

I think it's necessary to do both. It also says to be six feet from source of fire and to not let the fire be between you and the exit. Not sure how that's always possible?
