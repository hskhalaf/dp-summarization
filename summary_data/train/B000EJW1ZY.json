He would have never survived all the work he's done with a hammer and nails. God forbid, if it tore up tomorrow we've definitely got our monies worth. If it did tear up I'd buy another one in a minute. I've never used it, but I've seen the hubby in action and it's definately a big winner!",

This means you have to fire a brad, open the magazine, slam it shut hard enough to advance one brad, and repeat. I\u2019ve tried loading the brads through the opposite side of the magazine, different brands of brads, oiling the magazine grooves - no luck. Still a great tool overall for the price, but QC not great.",
