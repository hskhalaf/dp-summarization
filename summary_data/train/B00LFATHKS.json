So I contacted the seller to purchase two double sided adhesive strips...they shipped me two at no charge! Excellent customer service!",

My only complaint is the selection of tones. There are about 4-5 tones that won't drive you mad, each as a sing or repeated chime. The rest are ungodly annoying. You have to scroll through them all to get back to the one you want, so setup isn't great. However, once you have it it is good.",

      "text": "This was bought as a gift. This order arrived on time. I'm very pleased with the quality but I will say this... when the system was installed it was installed with both receivers and 1 button (one receiver plugged in towards the front of the house, one towards the back). When the button is pressed the receivers would ring out of sync. I believe that may be because depending on where the receiver is plugged in the house it will ring when it receives the signal from the wireless button. Perhaps the further away the receiver, the further away the signal has to travel, resulting in that minor delay. Still a great product.",

This unit has several 'real' bell tones, which was important to me, not just 'midi' music (yuk). It has over 50 alerts, so getting through them all was a bit of a pain. But, once I decided on a tone for each door, set up was easy. I have about 1500 sq ft, in a tri-level house with a basement. I can hear it well with two bells plugged in on two different floors throughout the house.",
