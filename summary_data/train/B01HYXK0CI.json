There is a little silver ring that sits at the base of these where you plug your headphones in and that little silver ring WILL FALL OUT and even when you put it back in the sound you get will be HORRIBLE. Yeah, they're cheap to buy. But there is a REASON they are cheap to buy, and the reason is they are cheaply made and WILL FALL APART. I've told you why you shouldn't buy them.
