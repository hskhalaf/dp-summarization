When open the two boards are not level. The boards rock back n forth.",

So far, it has held up wonderfully and she uses it a few times a week. The knives are sturdy and are much bigger than most that come with cheeseboards. It can be a bit tricky to open, and you need to be careful so that you don't pinch your fingers. It's a bit on the heavy side, which means it's sturdy, but that could cause some problems for you if you plan on moving it around while entertaining.",
