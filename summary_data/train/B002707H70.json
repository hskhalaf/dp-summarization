The bar was pretty easy to bend though and the warping does not change results. The cap does not need to screw all the way in - you just need to go far enough to make it water tight so others' comments about it not tightening all the way were irrelevant, in my opinion.",

It helped tremendously to lower the high spots. it needs to be done several times. Best to wait a few days till after a good rain.",

I filled it up with water and my 24hp lawn tractor had little difficulty pulling it around the yard. Do be careful on hills, as this roller is very heavy, and I did get stuck going up a steep section of yard where the tractor started slipping, and I had to unhook the roller and re-orient the tractor so it was not going straight up the hill. The roller flattened out all of the tunnels nicely. Storage is easy once you drain the water. I hang it on the wall of my barn.",

It now has a giant flat spot from sitting one night in warm temperatures! In fairness to Brinly I have not contacted them about this. If you buy it, I would suggest draining the water immediately after use. It is easy to put together, the plug, as others have mentioned only goes in a couple of turns which is good enough.",

None of the steel rollers I saw had a scraping bar to clean off any clinging dirt or clay. My only regret is that this roller is not available in a heavier weight poly and a larger diameter, maybe 30 inches to get more weight and leveling power. All in all, this is my choice as a great roller. Forget steel if you have any rocks or gravel in the soil you want to roll.",
