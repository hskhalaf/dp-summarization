The holder looks nice, but is actually quite frustrating to use, as putting the tools back in requires threading them through TWO snug holes. I don't want to do a puzzle, I just want to put my tools away! Complaints aside, these do the job just fine.",

I figured it was worth a shot, and if the tools were not that good, I would not be out that much in the first place for the amount of time I need them. These hex keys come in a nice holder that can be mounted either vertically or horizontally, or you could just put them in a toolbox drawer if you want. They work, and are good enough for what I need them for at a decent price. Cheers!",
