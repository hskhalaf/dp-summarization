He took them out last night was hitting farther which he should when going up a size, he really liked them. I probably would still do the tour x for a size one club since hey are a better price and the younger kids are pretty hard on clubs or lose them. The tour x bag was really nice. This bag is decent nice colors. Overall very happy with these.",

They fit my 14 year old son perfectly (he is 63\u201d tall). He moved up to this teen set from his junior Calloway set. These should bridge him for two years until he is ready for an adult size/ length set. Bag and clubs look great. Really happy with this purchase. Calloway does a great job with the junior and teen sets. Amazon does a great job with price and speed of delivery.",

      "text": "I bought this set for my 7 year old son. He had the same set in version one for two years and was starting to have to lean over too much to make good contact. This version 2 (blue set) was the perfect answer! He's striking the ball much better because the club length fits him much better. Great product for the money! The only thing we wished it came with was a hybrid of some sort. The fairway metal is good, but it would have been nice to have another long iron option between the 7 iron and fairway wood. Thanks Calloway!",

Putter has good grip and the head is well finished, the drive is also very effective for learning and also achieving long distances. Remember: it's a set for Kids, options as Cobra are OK, since has more Clubs, but Callaway Driver and Putter are good to go. The Bag finish and solid stand are very practical as a professional bag.",
