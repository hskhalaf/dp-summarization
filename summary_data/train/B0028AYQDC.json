I would hate to think how this performs in the South East. or other humid parts of US. You need to connect a drain line. Who has time for that? A return is not easy. This thing weighs 90 lbs. 2- Does not cool even a small room even though the installation is according to their instructions and claims 500sf or 700 sf of cooling. 3- non-intuitive controls and remote control 4- very bulky and hard to move and store away.",

Honestly the ONLY reason I wanted this particular one was that it allowed sliding window access. When all other ones I kept finding would only work for traditional up/down windows. 100% happy with my purchase.",

So I shut-off all the ducts to the attic, and installed this up there. My attic is probably 25'x50', and this unit handles it just fine. I also didn't need to install it in the window, on a support bracket, as the in-window units require. Pretty easy. And way, way cheaper than installing a second central A/C unit, or replacing the existing central A/C unit with a bigger one.",

It keeps our somewhat open living room which is about 600 square feet at 77 degrees when it is over 100 degrees outside. It isn't a whole house air conditioner, but it does the job it was made for. I recommend it.",

This was a little fiddly to set up but instructions were pretty clear and I'm sure there are online tutorials if you needed them. The only tools needed are a couple of Philip's head screwdrivers. It is over 100 deg outside and within 20 min the bedroom that had been hot for days was comfortable and cool. The room I'm cooking is about 200sqft. Only niggle is that the seal around where the hose meets the window plate and around the window plate have gaps but nothing a little tape or foam cant fix. Overall best AC ever and would definitely buy again.",

I have so much regret spending my money on this product. The remote stopped working within a few days, at first i thought it was just the batteries but no! It somehow cools my room but not as good as the other reviews i read. The worst part..my energy bill went up 3X!! not energy efficient If you need a portable AC unit, i suggest just go to Home Depot or Lowes or even walmart!",

We put it in our living room which is about 700 sq feet and the cool air was able to go into the dining room and kitchen as well, with the fans we used to direct the air.

As far as the water build up we had to drain it every week as it got pretty humid in Santa Barbara last summer. I cannot believe we went this long without one.",
