I also suggest using a water hose and nozzle for cleaning out cuts if you aren't cutting all the way through. I also used this saw to cut a 45 degree angle along the edge of a 12 X 24 cement slab. We didn't have the edging tool when we poured. It cut the edge quickly. It looks pretty good.",

I ended up just using a shutoff valve on the garden hose itself so I wouldn't have to touch the one on the saw. DEWALT - put a decent brass valve on this thing!",

Saved us about $10,000 for a new tile floor. Setup was a bit time consuming with having to hook up water and make a straight line. Grease pencil for the line to be able to see it. Saw motor and saw plate do not allow much clearance for use of a piece of wood to use as a guide. However, Once the saw is cutting, keeping it straight was quite easy. Followed the saw with a shop vac and left little or no mess behind.",

The optional \"wet\" capability is a must have. Works wet or dry but if you need the wet you can't do without it. My only real complaint is that I wish it came with a carrying bag or case.
