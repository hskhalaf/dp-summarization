I like to tuck in the little snap flap when my computer is in use and it tucks away nicely underneath the mousepad area.",

Made the computer heavy, made it cumbersome to open, one or both pieces kept popping off when I opened my computer, and showed fingerprints all over it.

      "text": "This product is an awesome price and great quality. I absolutely recommend it! My only complaint is that the \"orange brown\" is definitely just orange. I added a photo to show the difference in online color vs actual color. I still like it and it surely stands out at airport security. But, other than that... all is great. It stays on, the closure works, the padding makes me feel better about walking around with it, etc. As long as you're a little flexible on the color you expect, you're good.",

The other issue I found is that the attachment that holds the cover together when the laptop is closed randomly sticks out when not in use. It kind of gets in the way. Also, it doesn't really close all the way because of the leather laying under the keyboard--that doesn't bother me but it might bother some people. Other than that, it works for the purpose I bought it for (which was buying a case that won't break), and I think I will continue to use it! I am pretty bummed about the imperfection though!!",
