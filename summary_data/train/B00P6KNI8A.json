About $15-20 overpriced but again it\u2019s Paw Patrol. Nevertheless, we\u2019re both satisfied and he really loved it. I used the Marshall bubbles toy for estimating size of small shelf on top. The middle \u201cshelf\u201d is fabric and has a slight slant. Also it should be noted the bottom bins will sit on floor. There is no bottom shelf. My size lookout tower and toddler bed pics for size comparison.",

All of their toys are organized into character bins. So they know Barbie and doll accessories go in Kristoff and Sven, Anna and Elsa have their Barbies, etc. much easier to get them to clean up now!",

My only concern was tipping, as it doesn't come with an anchor for the wall. We purchased our own and anchored it for our 1 year old. It is the perfect size for a 1-3 year old and we are happy with our purchase.",
