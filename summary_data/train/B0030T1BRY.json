As other one star reviews indicate these are apparently not designed to fit most 2 x 4's that you would buy at Ace Hardware or Home Depot. Buy these at your own risk and pray to god you don't spend a weekend planing down the wood to get them to fit. I could immediately tell there was going to be a problem and didn't waste my time. Item returned. UPDATE 4-23-17: Found metal brackets at Lowe's that fit STANDARD 2 x 4 dimension wood. Hope this helps someone in the future.",

The bad parts about them is that they injection molding is done pretty medium. You'll have to spend a bit of time with an Xacto knife cleaning up edges and stuff, but assuming you have straight lumber, it appears everything fits well. Also, since they are all assembled and screwed together, they are a bit awkward to store. I used to have metal bracket ones that folded up, but I felt they were a bit weak. So trade in some convenience for more sturdiness.",
