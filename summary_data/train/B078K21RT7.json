It was perfect and I had zero issues activating it, using it, talking to customer service. I terminated my account for the time being until I go back on Vacation next year. But I would highly highly recommend this little GPS for anything you would want to track. I was going to throw it into my preteens backpack to keep an eye on her as well while she walks home from school, but we decided to get her a phone plan instead.",

Also, you can not turn on or off the Alarm button yourself they have to do it. The app would be better if I did not have to press update or last to see where it is and auto does not seem to do anything for me but count down.. I have not figured out what I accidentally touch to make it go from map mode to street view and it is not easy to get back to map mode. There is no instruction booklet.",

The mapping app is disappointing too me! I\u2019m thinking about looking for another system. Yes it works, battery life for me is about 12 days! But I have it on basic settings also, and I am not sure if that matters. The accuracy and updates are off sometimes. But I would give it a 3 out 5 stars based on my expectations.",
