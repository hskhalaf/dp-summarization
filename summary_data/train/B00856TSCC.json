I add the raw shelled hemp seeds to salads, smoothies, oats, yogurt, baked products. It adds something special to muffins or bread while baking, I really recommend trying to add hemp to baking. Nutritionally, they are a great way to add fats to my macros (better than chia in terms of fat vs. carbs). I don't use a full 30g serving, for me 10g are enough. Did not noticed any strange side effects.",
