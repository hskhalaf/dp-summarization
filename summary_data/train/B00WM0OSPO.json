Update: 3/1/18 this is my second watch, had to send the first one back because one of the needles fell off. I alternate between this watch and another watch, I haven\u2019t worn this one in a little while. This morning I noticed that another needle fell off! This watch looks great but I have to take 3 stars away because it seems like this watch was cheaply made.",

Now its garbage. **UPDATE** I put the watch in rice for 48 hours, then when I put it on and tried to set the time, THE PIN CAME OUT \ud83d\ude44",

I was disappointed with the way it arrived, tin box dented and opened with the watch having fallen out, but I don't blame the seller because I had ordered a separate item at the same time. The watch is beautiful, I have a small wrist and usually have trouble finding straps with enough sizing holes but this was perfect. It is also very easy to switch straps with other compatible fossil straps. Overall highly satisfied with the watch.",

Great watch for any androgynous or butch ladies out there looking for something more masc that still fits. An important note: The light colored band will absolutely discolor immediately. If you get it wet at all the leather turns darker- which is pretty impossible to prevent 100%. I am actually fine with this as I like that its wearing into a darker color, but if you don't like the sound of that I recommend choosing one of the other band colors.",

To me it looks good and really isn't bulky looking on her. She has some very small wrist too.

The brown band has gotten a little darker, probably because of sweat and lotion and normal use, but could be easily replaced. The watch face is easy to read and the hands glow in the dark, which was probably mentioned in the product description anyway, but was a nice surprise for me since I just skimmed the description. Very nice and worth the price.",

      "text": "I have small wrists and most oversized watches look well, oversized on me, but too oversized to be fashionable. I was a bit apprehensive about this one, but I've now received it and absolutely love the look of it on my wrist. Yes, the actual watch face is huge on me and in fact end to end is a bit bigger than my wrist so it doesn't \"curve\" around it quite right, but the thin leather band tempers the oversized feel. By the way, the leather on this looks and feels marvelous. To me, the whole watch just gives off a \"neat and clean\" feeling and being neutral colored, it goes with so many outfits. A great everyday watch!",
