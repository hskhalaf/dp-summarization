This results in the crepe or omelette 1: being thicker around the outer rim than in the center and 2: the food cooking faster around the outer rim because it's hotter than the center due to actually contacting the burner around the rim, but not in the center. Seriously. I just want a pan that's actually flat. Is that too much to ask for?",

I thought the seasoning process (using potato peelings) to be strange, but I followed the directions and by golly, I've never worked with a better non-stick surface. I made crepes (my first time ever) using this pan; it was easy and fun. The cleanup was a snap: I used a soft cloth and very hot water, and I was done in just a few seconds. If you are serious about cooking, ditch the Teflon and invest in de Buyer cookware (I'm saving up to buy more, piece by piece).",

    "description": "Size:9.5 InchDe Buyer\u2019s French Crepe Pan offers the perfect cooking surface for delicate crepes, caramelizing vegetables, and pan searing meat. Made in France from blue steel that\u2019s easy to season and maintain, it builds up a natural patina with use over time for a foolproof non-stick quality with quick food release. Specially designed with a contoured handle to assist in swirling crepe batter to form perfectly thin, delicate crepes. With a cooking surface of 8-inches and overall surface of 9.5-inches, rim to rim, its shallow depth and flared sides allow delicate foods to be flipped and plated effortless without them breaking apart, from crepes to fluffy pancakes and fried eggs. It works equally well for braising meat, poultry, and fish. A great addition to cooking tools for easy, professional-style cooking in the home kitchen. To season before first use, simply wash in hot, soapy water and scrub with a stiffer brush to remove protective wax coating. Dry thoroughly. Add enough cooking oil to cover the bottom of the pan and heat it over medium flame until smoke appears. Carefully discard the oil and wipe the pan with a paper towel. Voila, the pan is now seasoned and ready for use. To clean after each use, hand wash under hot water with a gentle sponge. Always dry thoroughly. Do not use soap, clean in the dishwasher, or scrub with abrasives, as these will spoil the natural patina buildup and its non-stick quality. Never soak the pan, as it could rust. Should rust occur, simply scrub rust away and repeat the seasoning process. Made in France from blue steel.",
