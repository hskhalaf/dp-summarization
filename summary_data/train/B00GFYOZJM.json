Bought two others that claimed to be long enough for even tallest, but yet unless I lowered and raised hands signigificantly, it would catch on feet and come too close for comfort over my head. On the 3rd attempt, I bought the King rope. Candidly, I misread the description, I thought it was weighted, which is what I was looking for. That said, the rope/length/speed/handle swivel is great. I hope they come out with a weighted one, but I am good to go with this in the meantime.",
