The Harmony 1100 had it all and it seemed to be designed by engineers that liked form and function, not just trying to meet some checklist of capabilities.",

I bought for my parents, who live in a huge house of around 10,000ft2 construction and 80,0000ft land. This universal control was controlling nearly everything related to Image, Sound and Internet. Though it is really efficient, it is not so simple to set it and instructions were a bit complicated, we had to hire someone to set it as we wanted, and who taught us how to re-programme if needed. Otherwise, it is very simple to use once the programming is done.",

One push of a button will turn on all the pertinent devices, set the inputs and even change sub-settings. I did not have any problem locating all the components and brands in my entertainment set-up. My wife is beyond amazed now that she only has to push a single button to watch TV, to play Blu-Ray or to listen to digital music. We put away all the other remotes as we no longer need them. This was the answer to our problem!",

Of course I have 7 devices on the living, one of them is a PC that I attached an IR sensor to it and made this command the PC. AWESOME. It take you some time to program everything, but after that, you can make magic with it, changing channels, input, muting the TV, changing video 1,2, 3 on my onkyo, etc.",

There was some of both. An email to the Logitech tech support group resulted in a change in the button assignments of the H1100 which helped my application a lot. Further investigation of the problems I was having finally pointed to the IR extender, not the remote. When the IR extender issue was resolved we became happy users of the H1100 and would recommend it to others.",

This is the first universal remote I have owned and am very happy with the purchase. More imporantly, my wife is happy with a single remote for her needs.",

The only down fall if any, is that the battery live is short and definitely needs to be charged on its dock every night.",

      "text": "I love the way you can program all sorts of things into this (but it doesnt handle the needs of an XBox!!) but once you have done all that, you can't easily hold it in one hand and flip through the controls like you can with a standard 'candy bar' shaped remote. I am prety disappointed actually. If you want this for surfing the TV - forget it! If you want this for controlling other stuff that doesn't require you to flcik though things constantly then its a great way to put everything in one place - but it still has its foibles with that stuff anyway. Too much money for a bad ergonomic design IMHO",

Both devices do what is claimed from a functional standpoint, but the 1100 just handles better for me and I am a happy camper now. Let's hope it lasts for many years.",
