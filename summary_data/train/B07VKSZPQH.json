Now that mileage is increasing I bought these Nimbus. From the 1st step you can feel the difference, the are so plush and comfortable. You can instantly tell there is less shock to your joints. They are also quite responsive with the new insoles they are putting in them. They won't be your race shoe (if you race) but they aren't designed to be. If you want luxury on training runs they are brilliant.",

Updated fluid ride creates a more responsive ride in a lighter weight packaging and a 360 fluid skin upper adapts to your foot while strategic overlays seamlessly wrap and support your feet throughout the run. Improved upper fit. Gradient mesh in combination with 3D print will provide an excellent fit combining the right amount of flex and support. A different lasting method will provide more room in the toe-area. Improve fit with new eye-stay design. The star-shaped makes the eye-stay more deformable, which improves static and dynamic fit.",
