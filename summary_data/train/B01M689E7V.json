It wouldn\u2019t heat the food up, the light would turn on, but wouldn\u2019t heat up. I have been extremely careful about not getting the plug area wet. So I know for a fact it\u2019s not water damage. I would like to know why this happened to me.",

It has a separate box containing a spoon and a fork on its top, so I don't need to buy them. And after I open it, there's also a separate box which can be used to fill some fruit or salad. Inside the lunch box is made of stainless steel, which is safe to be heat and washed. In a word, this lunch box is beautiful, fully functional, and convenient, I highly recommend it to all of you!",
