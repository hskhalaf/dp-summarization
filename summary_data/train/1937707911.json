These books start with the basics but cover all the information you need to prepare. The vocab definitely was useful on the test. The online practice tests were almost identical to the real GRE and the practice scores were fairly consistent...I actually got higher on the real test than on these practice tests. Highly recommend! The ETS has their own quantitative review available for free on their website, but it isn't as thorough or easy to go through.",

Definitely make sure to do the online practice exams, since they provide you an experience with the \"tracking,\" where the test becomes more difficult if you perform well on the first section. Also, not sure if this experience is shared by others but I performed 3 points better on math and 4 points better on verbal in my actual GRE exam than in the online Manhattan Prep practice exams.",
