For whatever reason, this jacket as well as most other spots gear run a size small. I also believe jackets that extend beyond the top of the buttocks should flair out a bit, instead the latest jacket seems to actually be more form fitting than order Servo jackets. Although a lot of extra room in the chest and shoulders area. You can see what I'm talking about in the stock photo. That said, it's still a great jacket and the latest version seems to be of better material.",

It is not the warmest jacket which was something I was looking for because I tend to overheat on the mountain. The pit vents allowed for nice airflow and the wrist cuffs kept the snow out. The best aspect of the jacket to me was the media pocket which had nice cable management. Overall fit was on the loose/baggy side meaning it is not a street wear type jacket.",
