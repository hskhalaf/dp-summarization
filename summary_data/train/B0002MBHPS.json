      "text": "Perfect for my purpose! Needed something to keep the tires from throwing mud forward and up under the seats of a 2018 full size Polaris Ranger. Why Polaris has that area open for that to happen is a mystery. Fortunately blocking off that area wasn't too difficult. These guards fit perfectly except for one slight cut out modification needed on the driver side. Passenger side hangs fine with no modification. Used angle iron, stainless steel screws, washers and nuts to hang them. Not only do they work well, they look good too.",

They are very heavy duty rubber but not too stiff and are just the right size for my f350 dually. They also arrived in about a week which is much better then other items not sold on prime. Highly recommend these for SRW and dually trucks",

      "text": "We use this to replace our very large dog door flap that is for our Great Danes. The flaps that you can buy to replace the torn flaps are much more expensive and do not last. Our cats are able to still get in and out and the Danes have not been able to tear it up like before. Just cut it down to fit your door and it screws under the frame to work like the one from the original box.",
