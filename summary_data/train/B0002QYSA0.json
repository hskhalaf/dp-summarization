The rear sound/volume level control is a snap to adjust to taste, the all in-one quick disconnect cable makes it super easy to unplug and move the tube if you need the cargo space.

I'm running the factory head unit and all factory speakers. Pretty easy to install in a couple of hours. Just run power from the battery to the sub, ground it and then splice into the two back door speakers. The only hard part was getting to the factory speaker wires in the pillar between the front and back door. No regrets on this purchase.",

Hooked it up and was shocked. Sounds great and for me hits hard enough. Not going to wake up the neighbors, but just good full sounding system, tied it all together with an Alpine power pack for the other four speakers, as to retain my factory deck with Sync.

It was easy to install and does a great job keeping up with quick bass notes that larger speaker have a hard time keeping up with.

    "description": "Bazooka BTA6100 BT Series Amplified Subwoofer (6\" 100W)\n\nAMAZON.COM\nAs all-in-one solutions go, you simply can't beat the A100 Amplified Bass Tubes by Bazooka. Designed to be a simple-to-install yet effective upgrade to your car's existing mobile audio system, the A100 Bass Tubes feature a 100-watt, 2-channel amplifier built right in, coupled to a dual voice coil woofer. Since the amplifier has a built-in crossover to remove the high frequencies that the woofer cannot play from the signal, you get exactly what you need in the A100--crisp, clean bass and nothing more. When connected to your system, the end result is seamless integration, both electrically and audibly, yielding sound quality that your factory system simply can't touch. \n\nCrisp, clean bass and nothing more. Click to enlarge. \n\nThe Bazooka Bass Tubes enclosure is optimized for corner loading.

Click to enlarge. \n\nBT Amplified Bass Tubes\nThe new amplified Bazooka subwoofers feature the legendary patented Bass Tubes enclosure design, but with a twist. These units are completely self-contained bass monsters. Available in 100-watt BTL or 250-watt Class D amplifier configurations, the new amplified Bazooka subwoofers are the true solution to the common automobile interior problem of \"not enough space for bass.\" \n\nA Bazooka subwoofer adds the bass, clarity, and realism that your system is missing with absolutely no modifications to your car, its warranty, or its original audio system. If you are leasing your car, there is no better way to upgrade your stereo system than by adding a Bazooka subwoofer. \n\nBTA6100\nThe BTA6100 features a 6-inch dual voice coil subwoofer and fits in places most subs can't. The 6-inch works great behind the seat of small trucks, the trunks of sedans, or hatchbacks. Simply point it into the rear corner to take advantage of the Bass Tubes enclosure, and you're rockin' in no time! \n\nThe Bazooka subwoofer's patented Bass Tubes bass-reflex enclosure design allows for use of 100% of the woofer's cone area. Inch for inch, it will outperform most boxes. \n\nThe Bazooka Bass Tubes enclosure is optimized for corner loading, and its port and woofer are on the same plane and in close proximity for maximum corner-loading results. And, just like a megaphone amplifies a cheerleader's voice, the corner of your car amplifies the concentrated bass output of the Bass Tubes enclosure. \n\nIts advantage is that it fits any vehicle: the perfect fit for a perfect sound. \n\nAs with all Bass Tubes Enclosures, the BTA6100 comes with straps to keep the sub securely mounted, while still making removal quick and easy if you need even more cargo room. \n\nBazooka Add-ons\nUse Bazooka's F.A.S.T. harnesses to make installation even easier. They're a simple way to protect your vehicle's warranty by making installation a plug-in process. The T-shaped harness has three ends: One plugs into your car's OE radio, one plugs into the plug you removed from the OE radio, and the third end runs all the way back to the rear of the car and plugs into your A100 Bazooka subwoofer. Great for leased vehicles, the F.A.S.T. systems are available for most popular cars. \n\nBazooka's RBCM-100 Remote Bass Control Module allows you to control the amount of bass from the driver's seat. \n\nOptional Chrome-Plated UMS Brackets give a flashier look, as well as a more secure, permanent mounting when removal isn't a problem. \n\nWhat's in the Box\nBazooka BTA6100 BT Series 6-Inch 100-Watt Amplified Tube Subwoofer, wiring harness, installation hardware, and instruction manual.",
