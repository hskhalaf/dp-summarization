I continued using them for 3 months and her tummy was doing better. I wasn\u2019t sure if they helped or not, so I decided to stop and didn\u2019t place a new order. Within 2 days, her tummy issues got so much worse than they had been. I waited a few days to assess what the problem was and then reordered the probiotics. Within 2 days of restarting them, she was back to her normal happy self!",
