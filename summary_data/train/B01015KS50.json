      "verdict": "Overall, the Under Armour Rocket receives positive feedback in terms of the shoe\u2019s exceptional traction, comfortable cushioning, and its upper\u2019s breathability. Although a few feel that the shoe lacked in aesthetics, its performance on court pretty much makes up for it. At only $100 per pair, you are bound to get your money\u2019s worth.",
      "pros": [
        "A lot of users say that the UA Rocket feels very comfortable",
        "One even comments that wearing them feels like \u201cwalking on air.\u201d",
        "Like the Anta KT 4, several wearers say that these Under Armour basketball shoes do not need any break-in time, adding that you can play in them straight out of the box",
        "Majority of the reviewers agree that the traction of the Rocket is the shoe\u2019s highlight as it performs very well on both clean and dusty indoor courts",
        "One tester even compares it with other basketball shoes such as the Kobe Mentality 2, Kobe 9, or Kyrie 2 that are known for their high-performing outsoles",
        "The materials in the upper are described as lightweight, soft, and breathable",
        "A number of testers say that the shoe feels like the Under Armour Micro G Torch",
        "Due to the Micro G foam used in the shoe\u2019s cushioning, many are happy with the type of impact protection that the Rocket provides",
        "A lot of buyers remark that the Under Armour Rocket and its materials are durable",
        "One shares that after four months of using the shoes, they still feel new",
        "A couple of users think that the Under Armour Rocket is \u201csuper stylish,\u201d adding that they love how they can use the basketball sneaker both on and off the court"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "Most of the wearers notice that the shoe\u2019s outsole attracts dust",
        "however, they agree that it is not to the point where it needs constant wiping",
        "Several players say that the Rocket\u2019s upper is prone to scuffing",
        "It also creases easily at the forefoot",
        "A few testers comment that the cushion feels quite firm despite being Micro G. One reviewer, however, believes that once the midsole gets broken in, the foam will eventually gain its bounciness",
        "Some feel that the UA Rocket\u2019s materials look cheap",
        "Commenters have the same complaint about the Nike PG 3"

      "text": "These shoes look really good and I wore them out my first time without any problems. They are decently comfortable from the start, though I have to say my Adidas Crazy Strike Lows were more comfortable. Performance wise, these UA high tops feel stable and firm, which is good to help protect my ankles. I swapped out the insoles with some Spenco cross trainers, as I do with all my basketball shoes. Size-wise, these UA 9.5s fit just the same as all my Adidas which have always been size 9.5s, so if you're wondering if you should go up or down a half size, if you normally wear Adidas hoop shoes I'd get the same size.",
