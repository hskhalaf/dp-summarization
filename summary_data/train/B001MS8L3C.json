This is a quality design and it seems to be quite tough. I will use it a lot in the coming months and years. The only change I would make is the stripping basket, it is too tall to sit on your lap as you paddle around, a shorter profile would work better.",

Theres no other place for your feet except for on the footrest or in the water. Could really use some heavy duty netting on the bottom. Great storage. If you're concerned about roll-overs but want to be on the water with others in kayaks or canoes, this is for you. VERY stable. There are other brands/makes out there but this seems to be the most versatile. Even great in salt water. I've bought 7 for family members so far. May buy another for me.",

So much more enjoyable than my kayak, much more stable, I can take and store more things to make the day more pleasurable.
