      "text": "There is nothing wrong with the 2100 except for the very noticeable delay between pics. The camera's digital processor takes about 5 seconds after a photo is snapped to ready itself for the next one. Otherwise, the optics, the 3X optical zoom and the 2 megapixel resolution are fine for anything from Internet apps to 8\" x 10\" print enlarging. It is competent, not spectacular, but it gets the job done at an agreeable price point.",
