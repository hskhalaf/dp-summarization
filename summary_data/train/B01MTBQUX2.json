Probably the best option available for a Mac until Apple gets its act together and adds a port for a lock.",

To use the included combination lock, you will have to installed/screw a small provided hardware onto the Kensington slot. After that, you can use the combination lock to lock onto that hardware. If you want to use a different locking cable, say a keyed lock, you will have to remove that hardware to expose the Kensington slot.",
