Always come out crisp and clean. Always look professional. Last 1 lasted 8 years under heavy use in my home office. Cant ask for more than that. Toner is a snap 2 change. Easy, simple to use. I always use the high yield cartridges. Good for thousands of prints. Once you own 1 of these printers, youll never go back to an ink jet.",

This is really frustrating, since otherwise this is a perfect printer.",

So, if you need copying/scanning capabilities, try the HL-L2380DW. It has a larger footprint, but it definitely can copy and scan. I must say that Amazon ROCKS when it comes to customer service.
