It'll absolutely freeze completely, and no matter how long I wait (I've tried 2 hours) it won't unfreeze. Pretty worthless. Worse, I bought it before beginning a long stretch of traveling, so now I'm overseas with a machine I'm constantly having to reboot. Don't waste your time or money...many better products out there.

I ended up getting a Dell laptop which I love, but I still use this for very basic things like email and reading the news.",

Unfortunately, there was a problem with the screen connection and the picture would go fuzzy. I asked for a replacement and Amazon shipped it right away without waiting for me to send back the bad unit. My wife is really happy with the big screen and resolution. The processor is very responsive and she love's the white color. I only have to provide MINIMAL Tech Support, so everyone's happy!",

Additionally, the \"7 second boot-up\" is flagrantly false, since it came out the box it's been a minimum of 25 seconds, usually closer to 45. It does have a good hi-res screen. But the audio is awful, sounds like 1980's plastic speakers. Not worth the money compared to the HP version of Chromebook that friends have & the battery actually lasts what it says it does for more than a couple of months.",
