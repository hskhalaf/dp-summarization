I have used other clippers and cut my toes with them. When I received my Harperton Nippit I immediately tried them and was thrilled! They were easy to hold on to and required very little pressure to quickly and effectively cut through my thick toenails. I will never use another clipper again!

They're wicked sharp (which is usually good but can be bad if you're not careful), and the design of the head makes it easy to trim nails evenly, regardless of which hand you are using! It's an intuitive design feature that is so useful you'll wonder why nobody else has ever done it like that!",

I highly recommend this particular one as it is my favorite toenail clipper. . Nothing can be more aggravating than to get a clipper orientated correctly on the nail only to have the handle slip in your hand. That problem is alleviated with this clipper and its generous non slip handle.",

      "text": "I recently purchased Nippit toenail clippers. In the past, I hated trimming my toenails because it was always such a chore. I could never get clean cuts with my old clippers, and the result was unevenly cut toenails. I would often wait too long until the next time I trimmed my toenails again. Fed up, I researched toenail clippers. I ran across Nippit, and decided to try them. Why did I wait so long? Nippit is the right tool for the job. It is effortless to cut my toenails now. The cuts are smooth and even. The shape of the cutting edge, makes trimming ingrown toenails easy. I, actually, look forward to trimming my toenails now!",

A gentleman named Sam contacted me and offered to correct the problem. I received a new pair of these the other day. I will upgrade to four stars for the excellent follow up. Thank you Sam",

Plus they must be super sharp as they clipped each nail in one press of the clipper. One more thing, they are made to stamp in your grasp. A lot of research had to have gone into the design of the Nippit.",
