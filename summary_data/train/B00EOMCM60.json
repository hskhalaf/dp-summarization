It works best to drill the holes very slowly, in case you hit roots, and to put the drill in reverse each time you bring the auger bit back up and out of the hole.

Probably the flat sides helped. Once I had all the preliminaries out of the way, I drilled 10 holes for planting bulbs in about 15 minutes. Only reason for not giving 5 stars is the shaft that should come with two or three flat sides.",

      "text": "Upon receiving this auger I clamped it into a vise, and using a flat file I filed 3 flats around the shaft, which took about 15 minutes. This was effective in preventing the auger from slipping in the drill. My main reason for purchasing this was to use in replacing a couple of dozen sprinker heads in my yard that no longer pop'ed up or retracted properly. The auger was excellent in loosening the clay soil around the sprinkler heads so I could dig down far enough to unscrew the pop-up heads. My 18V cordless drill didn't bog down, even though I was digging in heavy clay. Product worked great for this application.",

With all the rain we've had recently, the ground was somewhat soft and it really cut right through the dirt and kind of pulverized it. It was easy to shovel out. I have a shoulder injury, so can't do a lot of hard digging. It was a real life saver. Highly recommend.",

I found that pulling up the auger quickly whil spinning, after achieving the desired depth, was most effective for clearing the hole of debris. Huge time saver!",

Get bigger than you think you need since the dirt falls in the hole as you move down. Bottom line fine for the right use.",
