Even though it is dishwasher safe a simple soak in the sink does the job and it is off to the stove. Without equivocation, I recommend this rest and will buy another one when or if this breaks.",

But it does what we want, so lack of aggravation is worth the price, lol.",

    "title": "Le Creuset Stoneware Spoon Rest, 10-Inch, Marseille",
    "description": "Size:10\"| Color:MarseilleKeep surfaces clean with help from this stoneware spoon rest from Le Creuset. The unit's 10-inch design provides ample space for resting spoons, spatulas, and ladles either on the countertop during cooking or at the table when serving. The unit comes in the shape of a spoon, with space for the head and the handle. It also sports the Le Creuset name in raised letters and Le Creuset's signature concentric rings for an added touch of charm. Le Creuset's line of stoneware comes with a hard-wearing, impermeable finish fired at temperatures as high as 2192-degrees F. with a porosity level of less than 1 percent, it blocks moisture absorption, which can lead to cracking, crazing, and rippling along the interior. Its non-porous construction also resists odors, scratching, and staining for hygienic use and optimal performance. Even more, its high-quality enamel protects against metal marks and other damage, which means it's safe to use with knives. Best of all, the glaze on the exterior makes the stoneware items fun to mix and match with other coordinating Le Creuset pieces (sold separately), while a neutral-colored glaze on the inside offers an optimal palette for food presentation. and thanks to an unmatched thermal resistance from-65-degrees F to 500-degrees F, Le Creuset stoneware moves effortlessly from the microwave or oven (or under the broiler) to the table for serving to the refrigerator or freezer for storing leftovers. When finished, it cleans up easily by hand or in the dishwasher.",
