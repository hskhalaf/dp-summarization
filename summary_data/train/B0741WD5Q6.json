      "text": "Ive used poachers for the last 30 years, without a doubt the key is the cups the egg sits in. A true poacher should heat the egg from the sides never from just the bottom, this allows a solid white to form while keeping the yolk liquid. Most poachers cook from the bottom up which leads to an over cooked egg. This poacher is the best one I\u2019ve used in a long time, great value highly satisfied, if you love poached eggs this is a must, worth every dime.",

As the water starts to boil a little, I turn the heat down to a slow boil, then place the cups in the pan and go about 4 1/2 minutes for a soft center. probably a minute more for a firm yolk.",

I've been around a while so I know not to just take a firm grip for the first time without testing. Lucky me. The handle was as hot as the side of the poacher. It does poach eggs perfectly but if you don't want to worry about burning your hand then buy an insulating slip cover for the handle.",

Cooking spray the cups, add salt/pepper, and a large egg fits with plenty of room to spare.

After 2 or 3 uses, the handle is now stripped so the screw does not hold the cup and handle together, it just falls apart.
