I turn the device on, connect to my AfterShokz headphones, and... It won't play. I get a repeated \"Spotify login expired, please reconnect\" message from the Mighty. I reconnected to Spotify multiple times through the Mighty app with no luck. It *seems* as if the Mighty must have access to wifi to connect to Spotify before it will play. Someone please tell me how this is useful when I'm outside or in any other location without wifi? What's the point? #FAIL",

I regret the purchase and looks like I will have to wait until after the weekend and maybe holiday as well for any customer service response. I think if this were like 25 bucks I wouldn't be so upset. But spending almost 100 for this little thing? Yeah, I'm pretty upset. Wouldn't recommend unless they can come up with a prompt resolution.",

It's a bit expensive, and takes so long to boot up you'll wonder if it's running Windows 95, and the setup confused me at first; but it connects smoothly to my Amazon account and synchs my playlists, which is fantastic.

      "text": "UPDATED: Lowering my rating. Firmware 2.5 was pushed out, and things went downhill. With firmware 2.3 the physical volume buttons on Powerbeats Pro worked. Every physical control worked. With 2.5, you can no longer control the volume from the earbuds. This means you have to use the tiny little buttons on the Mighty, and you'll end up skipping tracks instead. Their customer service tells me you can't roll back to a prior firmware, and they're not interested in fixing this. They said they didn't think the controls ever worked. Can't recommend this if they're not interested in keeping features alive when they push out firmware updates.",

Spent a full month and hours in attempting to fix. Multiple email games with support team and no fix. The software issues are awful and making what should be a good product a useless one!! It simply isn't worth the time, effort and aggravation just to get the device to actually work!",

In fact, set up look less than 15 minutes. I am not sure what issues other people are having but it appears to me that it would be user error.

App/UI aren't helpful and the device (Mighty) is so clocked down (slow CPU) that a lot of actions have LARGE amounts of lag in them (e.g. 5+ seconds of feedback after an action) which makes troubleshooting even harder.
