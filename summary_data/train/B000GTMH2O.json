I'm a big dude (275lbs) and this thing didn't wobble a bit or shake which was my greatest concern. The thing is solid. Another benefit, as mentioned in other reviews is, that you really don't need to put much weight onto the bar to get a good workout. So no need to empty your weight trees every time you want to use this thing.",

There workout benches, universals, etc that include these exercises, but they always seem to be thrown on as an after thought and don't really work that well. The Deltech leg machine, on the other hand has a perfect feel to the motion of leg lifts and curls. I especially like that there are adjustments for different leg sizes so I can set it just right for me.",

This thing is solidly built, adjustable and I can't imagine it ever letting me down midway through a workout. Definitely worth the money!",

Both the curl/extension adjust to height. I am 5'4 and thought it might not adjust to me but it did. The padding is good. Its very sturdy. Leg motion is smooth. I like that for the leg extension has a stopper. This is exactly what I wanted and so happy I bought it. Hope this helps anyone looking to buy a leg curl/extension machine.",

Actually you need minimal weights for the leg curls. The only problem I found was that the bolt and nut which attach the V bar that holds the weights was a bit loose, however this problem was easily resolved with two rubber washers on each side. Now the movement is nice and tight with no shaking whatsoever. When you also factor in the price this is a definite BUY!",

I am 6 feet and my wife is 5 3\" and the machine is one of very few that is adjustable for curls and extensions. Very sturdy and smooth similar to a 2k $$ gym machines and it can handle more weight than you can lift. Highly recommend this product for the home gym. One thing I recommend is adding a few drops of machine or any light weight oil between the rubber spacers that go between the bracket and leg attachment. Makes the movement super smooth.",

The knob would not go all the way in because the holes didn't line up. Luckily for this company I know how to fix things. If I didn't I would have returned it. So ur taking a chance that it wasn't manufactured correctly. But!!!! Once assembled it is very sturdy and smooth. Have gotten a great leg workout out of it.",
