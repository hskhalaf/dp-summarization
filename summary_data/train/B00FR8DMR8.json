I'm no hi fi expert but have spent my life working with live music and sound balancing for performance. This is a satisfying, clean, clear and understated, balanced sound. I son't think you can ask for more. They're comfortable too with no perceptible sound leakage. Good sturdy lead which is a good length and looks sure to last. Oh and I love the hard, zipped storage case (I have a small dog!) And the spare (sturdy) lead and spare cushions show confidence from the maker in a long and happy future.",

Maybe my Samsung wasn't a good match, or maybe they didn't suit my hearing but within hours I decided that I couldn't live with them and sent them back for a refund. I've now got some Sennheiser Momentums, and for me they're much better.",

They dont have the extension of bass as the se846 but i would say they sound similar without a doubt. If anything these sound smoother and more rounded, more natural. All in all these are a good value set of cans that have the high quality and id expext to last as with most of shures gear.",

I ended up adjusting my eq to actually try and mask the some of the detail. If you career involves extended periods of time listening to or mixing music, these are perfect for you.

There are not many sets that everything sounds good, but these do. Excellent headphones, but not as present and bass is reserved.

They're also way, way more comfortable and feel lighter. One caveat is that they sound way better from a powered source. So if you plan to exclusively use an iPhone or iPad as your source...you will likely be disappointed.",

I used Aune X7S with DagMagic 100 (set to higher rate) and SMSL Sanskrit Panda stack. All with enhanced power supplies. Same result with both setups.
