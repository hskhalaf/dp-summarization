While the packaging is good, the value and usefulness of this product does not drive me to recommend its purchase.",

His skin was so soft after his shave and the oil left a slight fragrance behind that was just refreshing. I will definitely be buying this again and again.",

He said he really was happy with the shave and felt it was the closest he\u2019s gotten outside of the barber shop. He has really dense facial hair and the hairs themselves are huge. I\u2019ve never seen hair like that. He has a horrible time shaving and he cuts himself up. This has really reduced the amount of cuts and razor burn. We will be purchasing this again.",

It does have a bit of a softening effect, but I think you'd hopefully get this with any type of preshave product.

A bit thin, much more so than Taylor of old Bond street version, hence it wont last as long.It also doesn't really hold up to the lather well, therefore it provides little in the way of extra lubrication. Also the scent is barely detectable. If I had wanted an unscented Pre-shave oil, I would have ordered one. I'll be going back to TOBS once it's gone.",

The oil itself seemed to be only marginally helpful at best, but to be honest it was difficult to determine if it made any real difference relative to using shaving cream alone (Old Taylor of Bond Street). Moreover, the scent was barely noticeable; and certainly did not smell of sandalwood. Although there was nothing wrong with the product, I'll be trying other oils in the future.",
