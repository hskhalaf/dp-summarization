The seams are very cheap and came already falling apart (I guess that\u2019s to be expected with $10 leggings) I think these will be loungewear around the house they are extremely soft and comfortable just wish they were made just a tad better! Did not pass the squat test with the lavender color although it wasn\u2019t too bad. Sweat is also noticeable with this color so beware gym people! While my review is a 3 star I will be buying again because like I said they are cheap and still comfortable for lounging in.",

When stretched just to pull on, the fabric ripped causing a small hole to open, which eventually would have tore open further. When I went to take them off the seam along the waist was ripping as I had to pull and stretch them down. I could hear the stitches rip as stretched. I just had a baby and in between sizes 8/10 definitely not a os. No wear near the quality of my solid black LuLaroe. My $5 Walmart leggings are better quality. Do not buy!",

They really are buttery soft, the high waist and wide waistband means you will not be dealing with a muffin-top or any sort of rolling down. They are light, but truly opaque, and very stretchy. I'm 5'1\" and 155 and I chose to order the plus size because I didn't want, or need, them to be super form-fitting, or tight in any way, and for me they work perfectly. I haven't noticed any shrinkage when I've washed them, but I ALWAYS hang them to dry. If you're reading this review I suspect you're interested in buying some capri leggings~ try these, they're PERFECT!!",

I just tried the black leggings on yesterday and noticed it was WAY to tight in the right leg and the seam was off. It looks like on leg was stitched smaller than the other.
