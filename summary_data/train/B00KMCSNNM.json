I am going to reorder a large and hope that it fits, because I think it will actually do what it says it is supposed to. Posted pics of me before in undies, and then with the faja on so you can see. Only reason I have 3 stars is because I don't know yet if it will fit, will revisit once I have a larger size",

Good faja's should not crease when sitting or standing or cut into you like this one does.",

The only reason I'm only giving 4 stars is because you can see the \"corset\" hook line on the front through your clothes and the \"butt\" lines on the back. It's not a big deal if you have on a patterned pr ruched dress but will be noticeable with a bodycon dress or thinner material.",

Yon can totally feel them through your clothes. Also, it is very tight of course so don't wear it for really long periods of time.

It wasn't as snug as I would have wanted on my waist but once I added my lipo foams and ab board it was perfect. Had it been smaller on the waist my foams and such wouldn't have fit.
