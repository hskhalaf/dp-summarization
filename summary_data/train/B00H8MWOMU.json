A few things I really liked: 1) the large container is quite large; I made gazpacho with 64 oz. of tomato juice plus veggies in one go. 2) I thought I'd hate the plastic containers, but they are very sturdy and lightweight, so I'm very happy. 3) the blend'n'go cups are popular with the young adults in the family. 4) The smoothie setting is amazing. Just set it and get a minute or so of cheap entertainment as it goes through its paces.",

My 5 yo LOVES the \"automatic smoothie cycle\", often yelling over the blender \"look mommy!!!! It's going on its own!!!\". The smoothies come out smooth everytime, no matter how much kale we put in. It crushes up ice like a champ. The smoothie bottles that screw directly on are nice. I haven't used the food processor bits yet, but they feel heavy duty enough. I'm super pleased with this blender.",

We had broken off the food processor catches and wrote to the company to buy a replacement when they just sent us one for free! We have burned out one prior Oster blender after weeks of nearly daily use and if that ever happens with this one (doubtful because it handles full ice cubes with ease, especially with the reversing action), I think we will be buying another.",

The blender parts including blade, seals, pitcher are NOT covered in the warranty. Customer service on the phone was great the first three times the food processor failed. **** Initially I posted that this was a great bargain and an excellent product but as I said the food processor is inferior. It's not suitable to mixes, breads, spreads, or anything that thickens. Mine died mixing pancake batter. Very loud and is prone to walk across the counter. Maybe the PRO version is better? FYI, written correspondence with customer service got a bit nasty, so I advise call on the phone.",

I will definitely not be buying Oster products in the future.",

Easily blends whole fruits (minus the cores) and can create very smooth baby foods. Crushes ice with no problem. The single serve cups are ideal for taking your drink with you, but I prefer to use the large blender to make drinks and then pour into the single serve cup as I don't think that the single serve blender attachment blends as well. The blender also comes with a separate food processor but I cannot rate the food processor because I haven't used it.",

These speeds are also not great, slow is too slow, fast is too fast, medium is basically slow. The 'pre-programed' speed is also not great as it just moves the blender all around with it's jerky starts and stops. The carafe design is also bad, two part blade design that will leak eventually and will require constant fiddling with. All in all I am really disappointed.",

Update 6 months later the other tab broke and now the food processor attachment is worthless. If you are buying this because of the added feature of a food processor, don't bother. It won't last and Oster will not sell you a replacement food processor or parts. Looking for a 3 d printer file of the lid so I can print a new one and beef up the design.",
