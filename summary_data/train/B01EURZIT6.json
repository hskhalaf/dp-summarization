Side rails didn't fit flush together. The lack of pilot holes when attaching the slats made it difficult due to my broken hand, but I managed. Thoughts: definitely needs 2-3 extra slats. 4 for a king size bed isn't enough to support the box spring / mattress properly. Overall; I personally wouldn't buy it again. The quality of it is cheap and for the price I feel it could've been made better. I recommend it if people are looking for something along the lines though. Looks great and made of wood.",

There are only 5 flimsy slats on this bed, so unless you have a box spring, your mattress might not stay supported. We personally purchased a memory foam mattress, so there is no way this bed will support it. My husband will be making extra supports. There is also a large gap between the mattress and the baseboard as well as the height (between the mattress and bottom of headboard). So I would suggest going with a tall mattress, or again a box spring and mattress.",

I don\u2019t expect this bed to last forever.",

But definitely need to get a box spring otherwise your mattress will try to fall through the slats because they are spaced to far apart. They need to either add more slats or include a box spring with the purchase. And this happened after 4 days of having it. Just by sitting on it. The board's are cheap wood and definitely need a box spring. Not only all of that it sits way to high where the pillows fall off behind it. I reccomend you do your research thoroughly before buying.",

If your like me and use foam mattress without box spring under it, u WILL need a flat board to go over the beams, bc they only give you a couple slats and that's not enough to hold a foam mattress up without sinking. So we got a board to go over slats and that works wonders.",
