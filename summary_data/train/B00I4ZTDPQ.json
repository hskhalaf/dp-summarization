Only problem she still has is with cord management while they're in the stand, I haven't found a good solution for that yet that will make it quick and easy for her to tidy up the cords and pull them back out just as easy. The length of the power cord, despite being a little shorter than what I needed to get it out to the corner of the counter, is a good length for normally putting in a bathroom.",

With GFI style plugs (common with bathroom hair care tools), the tool plugs are heavy. When plugged in upside down (with the tool wire at the top), they tend to lean out, creating a gap at the top. Poor design of this stand. So. I added a block style adapter to prevent strain on the tool plugs, and prevent them from leaning (pulling) out.",

My flat iron, which I never use, didn't fit anywhere,so I didn't fret about that too much. I do LOVE the fact that this stand has outlets: super convenient! The stand is also very sturdy.

Not sure why Sononiture didn\u2019t go the extra step to provide room for other hair products. I like the product it just doesn\u2019t work for what I need. I would not recommend buying at this time.

I use one of the smaller barrels to hold my round hair brush instead. I also wish it had some type of cord management brackets to wrap the appliance cords around.
