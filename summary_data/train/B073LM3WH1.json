At first he was hesitant to be put into it, but now that he realizes he gets to go with us on our 2x daily walks, he likes it a lot. I don't have to leave him home when I walk the young dog. And the sling is comfortable enough that it doesn't kill my joints to pack the old guy around. I would recommend.",

I bought a cloth one before and it didn't seem as well made. Would definitely recommend this product. It was difficult to find a carrier that would fit my girl but this one would fit an even larger dog than mine.",

See picture Giving this one more shot with a replacement, but if the same issues are present, I will be requesting a refund. There definitely is a lack of QC prior to leaving the manufacturing center... cannot rate more than a 1star at the minute until I see the replacement bag.

I have an 11 pound puppy I wanted to carry around the house at times, because my larger dog likes to nibble on feet of the smaller pets. This carrier is very awkward and cumbersome/bulky. It is not practical if you really need to use your hands for anything else. It does have pockets store a little cash and a phone if you went out, but I don't think you could really spend a long time wearing this. I tried it a few times around the house, and it was just annoying. Id rather keep the dogs seperate for now.",

And there are plenty of devices for storing water bottles, poop bags and bonus silicone bowls. Hands are free when going out with dog. Highly recommended for those who have small dogs!",

They had tried a different carrier that dog didn\u2019t like and squirmed and tried to get out of. Dog seems to like this one, cooperates while being placed in carrier and seems to have a smile on his face. Sometimes when carrier is lying on floor dog goes over and lies on it. Much easier to carry him in sling carrier then under your arm. Very happy with purchase, other dog owners we run into while walking stop and admire it.",

The netting with a drawstring was perfect to draw around his shoulders to keep him inside and at sometimes he preferred the sling to sitting outside of it.
