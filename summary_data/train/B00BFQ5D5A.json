Yes, it is a gear that has a lot to offer when it comes to grip and crack climbing performance.\u00a0This beginner-friendly 5.10 piece, however, comes with a few flaws, the most unflattering of which has to be its bleeding upper. Nonetheless, the Five Ten Rogue VCS has enough positives to be considered a worthwhile investment",

The first time I wore them I was a bit worried because they were very tight on my toes, but after climbing in them a couple of times they have stretched a bit to conform to my feet and fit very well. Appears to be made of high-quality materials. I have only worn them a handful of times, but each time I wore them for several hours and haven't had any issues with the material turning my skin blue like some others have mentioned. Perhaps this is something that comes with more time/exposure.",

They are more comfortable than most climbing shoes, but the rubber and shape are not good enough for technical climbs where everything counts. I'm using them for warm up - for serious attempts I'm using 5.10 Anasazi VCS. For similar price there are better options (5.10 Moccasym), so I don't recommend the Rogue.",
