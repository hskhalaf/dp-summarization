      "text": "This product is extremely well made and works exactly like advertised. I have tried dozens of neck wraps and heating pads over the years and the Sunny Bay wrap is one of the best I have tried. The exterior material is high quality, soft, and durable. They didn't scrimp on the beads, so you don't have to keep repositioning the beads to keep the heat where you want it. Overall, I'm very Impressed and will be purchasing other Sunny Bay products in the near future.",

Sometimes I fall asleep when sitting in a chair; and with this wrap around my neck when that happens, it provides the added benefit of stabilizing my neck, keeping my head from falling into an unnatural position and adding new neck pain. I would definitely recommend this neck wrap.",
