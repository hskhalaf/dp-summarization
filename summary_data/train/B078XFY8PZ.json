      "text": "I am restoring my 1996 GT Backwoods and didn't want to dump a lot of money into parts for an old bike. I decided to upgrade my cantilever brakes with these since the price was right. they are made of 6061 aluminum and branded Wake. The V-Brakes are smooth and work well with my Alivio shifters, but the pads feel a bit mushy. The bike still stops better than it ever did with the cantilevers so I can't really complain. They are a decent buy especially for the money as an upgrade from cantilevers, however I will be replacing the pads soon.",

      "text": "These are very nice brake arms with good build quality. The return springs are smooth and proportional which makes them very easy to adjust. The included brake pads are, like others have said, pretty cheap and too soft. They will wear extremely quickly and gives the bike a spongy feel to the brakes. The soft pads also create a lot of squealing which is usual easy to fix by adjusting the toe-in of the pad, but that isn't the case with these pads. My recommendation to other buys would to be to buy these brake arms but replace the pads with a better quality pad that features an offset design.",

This set was easily installed and came with everything needed to complete the installation except for the cables which were purchased separately. After installation she was definitely able to stop much quicker. Also adjusting these brakes is much easier than her original set which took way longer simply because they were much older and the spring tension was getting weak. Very happy with this affordable set although definitely not top of the line as far as quality.",
