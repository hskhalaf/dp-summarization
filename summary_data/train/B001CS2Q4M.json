It didn't darken or alter any of the leather colors at all, but did make an obvious difference in the softness and suppleness of the leather. It also took out minor scuffs and scratches with a little buffing. The process I used was to spread a thin, even layer all over, wait about ten minutes and then use an old cotton tshirt to work the remaining conditioner into the leather.",

In addition to Bick 4, other leather conditioners my shine kit includes are Venetian Cream, Saphir Renovateur, and Leather Honey.. and for my money I'm going to now reach first for the Bick 4 with the understanding that it's very mild and good for conditioning well-taken care of leather.",

I've had these boots for about 2 years and hadn't done any conditioning to them (shame on me). I wish I had started using this conditioner sooner. I'm sure if I had done regular treatments to them they would still look brand new. Definitely recommend.",

It worked really well for what I wanted, smoothed out the minor scuffs without darkening the color. Both shoes are full grain leather and the shoe beside the Bick bottle was conditioned while the other was not. The last photo is how it appears during the application (before drying) it may appear slightly darker, but it's actually the original color of that shoe (2 years of wear and tear). If I had major scuffs I'd likely use a different product, but overall I am happy with the product and would recommend!",

Easy to apply, my leather was thirsty! Much healthier look and softer and more even appearance. No residue which I had read in other reviews but didn\u2019t believe. Believe!!! Great product. Will buy again.",

It also doesn't seem to strip color like other lotions, by looking at the cloth after I use it. Glad I bought it.",

You just sort of pour it on, rub it around, and the leather soaks it up. No rags - no wet sponges - no wiping off - no nothin'. If your leather is dry, it refreshes it. The end result is soft leather, and it makes even old boots look a lot newer. I do believe it darkens your leather a bit, but who cares if it makes your boots last longer?",
