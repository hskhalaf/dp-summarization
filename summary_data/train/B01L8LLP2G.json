It also can be used on opposite direction of my devices, which means I can hook up one game device into two TVs or monitors.",

This allows us just to push a button everything stays plugged in. Very cool idea.",

In addition the placement of the HDMI ports required an extension which is included here. Most of the many splitters listed do not say \"bi-directional\" and seemed to be aimed mainly at adding extra displays to a device (1 in 2 out) which is the opposite of what I wanted. Installation was a snap and reception was perfect for both the Blueray and the Firestick. True couch potatoes may prefer a splitter with remote switching rather than the manual push-button on this device.",

When the Roku and the DVD player are both plugged into the switch, the power is back-fed into the DVD player, which then lights its display and tries to run, although it is turned off. That can't be good for the DVD player. I'm back to switching cables, instead of being able to use the switch.",

I go between Fios and Amazon firestick with a click of the button with this, and I did extensive testing to see if there was any drop off in picture or audio quality. The verdict was no drop off whatsoever. So really a 5 star review if it wasn't for the mentioned sensitivity.",

This device allowed me to quickly connect the portrait monitor with my laptop and switch the display quickly. No power is needed, only hdmi cables. no issues so far. Been using it for several months. Will recommend to others if they have need for what this product offers.",

I follishly bought a cheap splitter on Amazon without reading the reviews which in hindsight were very poor. While my DirecTV connection was fine, my Blu-ray player flickered. The only way it was good was if you unplugged DirecTV, which defeated the purpose of buying the splitter. I just hooked this up an it works great and is not that much more expensive! Next time I'll pay attention to the reviews!",

Honestly, this is a great item to have to reduce desk clutter, and it's small size makes it able to be placed anywhere on your desk.
