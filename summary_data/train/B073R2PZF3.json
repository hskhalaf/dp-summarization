Pulled pork from shoulder roast outstanding. I will definitely go with Amazon's choice for other purchases and won't hesitate to buy again from Gramercy. Customer service is also great -- I got a response within hours on questions over a week-end.",

It appeared to work well out of the box but the temperature regulation mechanism didn't work, so it would reach the target temperature but then keep heating the water until near boiling. So I would definitely recommend testing the unit once or twice to avoid ruining an expensive cut of meat. Having said that, Gramercy's customer service were great. They were quick to respond and easy to communicate with and sent us a replacement unit which seems to work great. Any product can have an occasional dud, and since this was handled painlessly I definitely recommend the brand.",
