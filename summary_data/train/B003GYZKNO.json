I recently moved and needed something to take along while hiking. The camera is thin and small enough to fit in my pocket while roaming the woods. The pictures I have taken so far have come out wonderful and the speed from turning on to ready is great. This camera fit my budget and was exactly what I was looking for. I still have a lot to learn about the other functions, but the ones I have used have been great",
