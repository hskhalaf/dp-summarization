The color is rich and works very easily with Adobe After Effects software. I recommend washing it and drying, then immediately hanging it while hot from the drier, that will remove folds and prevent wrinkling. I do not have the screen pulled taunt, so there are shadowed areas but the software works pretty well with these slight color variances.",

      "text": "I have a 2014 MacBook that lacks the ability to generate a virtual background for Zoom conferences. I saw this here on Amazon and liked it both for its relatively low price and fact shipper could get it to me in a couple of days. It really works beautifully, in that Zoom instantly recognized the color and allowed me to use virtual backgrounds that were well saturated and stable. The screen really looks more like a flannel sheet, which makes it easy to hang (I hang with a couple of binder clips on a curtain rod), but it made in such a way you could slide a rod through it for hanging purposes. Highly recommended!!",

Sure, it can be used for that, but it's designed for indoor use, product photography, wedding shots, YouTube video backdrops. Things that newbies and professionals are equally as involved in. I LOVE it. It has boosted the production value of my videos and conferences by a power of TEN!",

I faced the softer side towards the camera, and backlit the sheer side with bright but diffuse indirect light. A little bit of tuning of the chroma key and this worked like a champ.",

Great for Chroma keying yourself into exotic locations. Have fun. UPDATE: The company called me & told me a trick to getting out the wrinkles. Put boiling water in a spray bottle & spray it on the fabric. Awesome customer service to call me from China to give me this tip!",

If you do need to remove the wrinkles, then use a steamer to take them out while the fabric is hanging on the rack. There is no use in attempting to get the wrinkles out beforehand, unless you have a bus--like I have--to transport it without folding. I have attempted to roll the fabric to minimize the folds, but this takes about as long as steaming the fabric later. I also need to steam out the more expensive version so why pay more?",

The color is a tad darker than the picture but that's fine. Nonetheless great product for the price.",

    "title": "Prism Backdrop by Ravelli 6x10' Black Muslin Photo Video Background, 100% Cotton, 150GSM Weight, Flocked on One Side, (5.7x9\u2019 after pre-shrinkage)",
    "description": "Color:Black| Size:6 x 10' (5.7 x 9' Preshrunk)\n\nThis is a 100% cotton backdrop made from a loose weave pattern with relatively thick thread. This initial size of the fabric is 6x10\u2019, but after heat treatment the actual size is approximately 5.7x9\u2019. Prism Backdrops by Ravelli are offered in three standard sizes: \n\n10X20' (actually 9X18', 5.7lbs)\n\n 10X12' (actually 9X10.8', 3.8lbs)\n\n 6X10' (actually 5.7X9', 1.9lbs)\n\n The material is 100% cotton which can wrinkle significantly. 100% cotton offers very good photographic results, but some combination of hanging, spraying, ironing, steaming and/or photo editing may be necessary to deal with wrinkles and shadows. \n\n\n100% cotton is also heavy and is a woven material. The weight can be excessive for some background stands. And the weave pattern can allow a certain amount of bleed through from background lighting. Prism Backdrops attempt to achieve the best possible balance of weight and light handling characteristics for the photographer.\n\n\n All sides are stitched to avoid unraveling and a 3.4\" rod pocket is sewn into the top. Each backdrop is folded and comes in a plastic bag to avoid moisture and stains and then each bag is packed in a cardboard box for shipping.",
