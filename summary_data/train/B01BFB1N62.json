The evolution of the Wayfarer ensures that authentic style is always as contemporary and functional as it is iconic. Squared unisex shape with lightweight nylon fibre rims, a coined metal bridge and thin, matte coloured metal temples paired with new flat gradient mirror lenses offer a daring take on icon-inspired style, while classic G-15 and B-15 options provide a more iconic look.",
