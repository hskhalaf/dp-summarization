      "text": "Though this light is for professionals, it is also ready to go as soon as you plug it in. The settings menu allows control over every aspect of the light, including x- and y-range adjustment, speed, color, strobe frequency, etc. I honestly set it to fast and bright and let the kids have fun. It turned my living room into a dance hall instantly. Now my kids' friends want to come over to dance. As far as quality goes, this light is very solid and very, very bright. There are no serviceable parts so it is put together to stay together. I highly recommend this stage light to anyone looking to party-up a room or gathering easily!!!",

It\u2019s great - using DMX I can control where it goes on the stage and the color . White is super bright and can be used as a \u201cspot\u201d if you need it. Not a focused spot but can surely highlight an area of the stage.",

I normally DJ for 60-200 people in a small to medium size hall.The Pyle PDJLT50 is a very powerful light lots of color and functions.I found it harder to program then others but works well in small and medium size rooms.. I think it would work great in a larger place it has great movement but you need to make sure light is programed and placed so it doesn't hit people in the eyes. Great powerful light.",

Just plug it in and press the mode button.... Let the dance party begin! If you actually start pressing buttons while you're looking at the function map they start to make since. Also, if you plan on taking this to a party, mount/place it above or away from where people place their drinks. The electronics don't have any real protection from spilling so keep away from the bar top.",
