I still have to wash them and i leave em in the mudroom (not the house for Pete's sake) but I can pretty well keep the funk under control with this spray. Thanks!!",

I was wearing the shoes while in my office several days later and I was getting grossed out thinking I had stepped in gum. I checked my shoes and didn\u2019t find any. It then occurred to me that these happened to be the one pair of shoes I had sprayed. So combine that smell with a little sweat and voila, the scent of dirty old chewing gum.",

Customer service was also exceptional - I was offered a free replacement of a different scent when the peppermint didn't do the trick.
