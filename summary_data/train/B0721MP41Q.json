Yes, they can be a little heavy handed with the bass. And the mids and highs sound clear and tight. I listen to a set of bowers & Wilkins at my desktop. So that is my point of reference for hifi sound. Highly recommended. Would definitely purchase again.",

Also, the battery is longer than the other pairs of bluetooth headphones I've owned, but not the advertised 14 hours, maybe 8, if I am being generous.

I used these at the gym, snow shoveling, landscaping, everywhere. My guess is the cold to hot temperature changes caused them to loose integrity over time and then one sudden shock (dropping them down onto a table) finished them off. The sound was great, bass was surprisingly full, and the battery was solid. The only \"flaw\" is the volume rocker on the earbud cable would weigh itself down, causing the cable to drop to the right side, this was annoying when running but the included earbud cable holder helped.",

      "text": "First time giving Anker a try on headphones and I was not disappointed. These are high quality headphones, I was afraid that they would be uncomfortable because I wear eyeglasses. These are not uncomfortable at all, I especially like the clip in the back because it keeps them sturdy around my head. The base is superb, not too heavy like the Beats and the different ear buds are easy to replace. These headphones were easy to sync to all my Bluetooth devices. I truly loved them that I bought two!",

I had several Soundbuds Slim, but wanted a longer battery life, and these were just the ticket. 3rd set because I ripped the ear off the first set in 3 months, and the second set just started acting up after 15months of constant use. I am network and alarm installation technician and I wear these all day, listening to Audible or Pandora. They work well in most environments, meaning either 20ft up a ladder in the wind or crawling through basements, they stay put and keep working all day. I have been very please with them, and will probably buy again.",
