      "text": "This is great for those that live in apartments where the only source of water is from the tap. Water from the kitchen faucet, while good enough for some, never was good enough for me, given the distinct taste that accompanies it. This works great at removing various impurities, giving the water a very clean taste. The filters last long enough that you won't be spending all that much to maintain having clean water. This, of course will depend on how many people will be using it. We have about three total people here, and the filter lasts about a couple months, give or take.",

Two refills of (up to the first ledge) will usually leave a quarter inch of water in the reservoir. I'd like something on the pitcher that says \"you have 12oz of space left\" and something on the reservoir that says \"fill to this line for 12oz\". Otherwise, I use it daily and would buy it again.",

      "text": "I almost didn't purchase this because of other reviews stating the filter wasn't working or that the jug was difficult to open/clean. I decided to write a review to let potential buyers know that it does work well and it easy to open! You have to make sure to twist the filter in and make sure the filter lines up with the opening to filter the water properly! Make sure to follow instructions and dump out the outlined amount of water before drinking!! Overall a great buy! I would say that this is more for single person use maybe two if you fill up the jug diligently.",

I periodically have to remove the shower head, faucet aerators, etc. and clean them with vinegar to remove the buildup. I have to also clean the coffee machine often as well. So I figured if I could stop the cause first, it should work better. The pitcher filters slowly. You have to fill the top basin, place the cap back on and just leave it to slowly seep through the filter. It pours good, but is a pain for trying to filter as much coffee water as I require. I may opt instead for a coffee machine with a built in filter.",

It is easy to hold under the kitchen faucet for refill, which the larger models don't facilitate. The improvement in practicality is a result of a simple design.",
