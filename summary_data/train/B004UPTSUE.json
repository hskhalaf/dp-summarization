With that being said, it's loudish and startles many of the dogs. I usually start it at the end of the bath and let it run a bit before I start drying so dogs get used to the sound. Had two times where I flipped the switch to start it and it didn't start...will send another review if this becomes a real issue since I've only been using it for five months.",
