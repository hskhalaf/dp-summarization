I feel like it fits me well and that she is secure in it but I could tell she didn't feel comfortable in it. I'm hoping she changes her mind in the future because it would allow me to do stuff around the house if she is clingy that day.",

I had the baby in the Babyjorn for 3 hours and he never fussed or cried. This is a must have for every new parent! And Grandmas love it too!!",

But I thought I'd give it one last go and order another carrier and oh am I glad I did! This is so comfortable, baby can be faced in or out, there's not infant insert required and it grows with baby! This is definitely a must have baby item!! Plus you can't beat the price!",

My baby is now 15 pounds and it hurts my back to carry her for any extended period of time. I can\u2019t imagine what it would be like when she\u2019s closer to a year (she\u2019s 6 months). It does give my baby great support though in both the out-facing and in-facing positions. For the first few months I think it\u2019s perfect!",

      "text": "Overall this carrier is well made and durable, but the design is very strange. Unlike older models, the space for the arms is very small and restrictive. The older versions have a longer adjustable strap around the arm hole. This one is so short that my baby was clearly uncomfortable when he was still very small. I got this because I liked that the legs could fit comfortably and not be spread super wide like our Tula, and it is very easy to put on, but the arm holes were so bad we only used it 3-4 times before we gave up. Bummer to spend the money on something you can\u2019t use!",

In fact, it was such a nice kid-carrier that were nearly able to re-sell it for the Amazon price when our kid grew out of it. Being able to use it with the child either facing the parent or facing away was also a big help - apparently not all infant harnesses do that.",

My back only ached if I didn't have the little one in there correctly or if I didn't have the straps adjusted properly. I might purchase a Moby or Mei Tai for the next baby just to see if the straps are more comfortable resting against my body for longer periods of time. However, I will probably still use the Bjorn for the next baby, too,",

I can do it one-handed in less than a minute, which is great when you have a fussy baby on your hands. My daughter enjoys the Bjorn too, and squeals with excitement when she sees me grab it to put on. It is the most comfortable on my back as well, and I can wear her for a very long time (she's about 17lbs. now.) without feeling much strain on my back. I think a Bjorn is a must-have for every busy mom (or dad)!",
