It blends very good with the black, so if you're going for an obvious color block, then you might be disappointed. However, I like it. Definitely makes it a more versatile with every outfit. Enjoy!

      "text": "Very happy with this watch! Lots of complements from friends on it. Between mountain biking, working on cars, and surfing on a weekly basis, it has held up to oil, sweat, and salty water very well so far. I would highly recommend this watch to anyone looking for some style! I do see this as a younger persons watch though, I cannot picture an older guy with this. But that is just my personal opinion. One thing to note is the blue anodizing around the edges is starting to wear off, I am a little disappointed in that.",

    "description": "For almost 3 decades, G-SHOCK has been a world standard for tough watches. And with the introduction of the new large case digital, G8900, the world has another sure thing to wear on its wrist. The large case digital is highlighted by a high-intensity led backlight which can be activated by the flick of the wrist or easy-press front button. An aluminum bezel provides a first line of defense to its omni-directional shock resistant structure and the semi-round case bridges the gap between the legendary 5600 and 6900 case styles. Gloss black resin Band digital watch with a blue face.\n\n\n\nCasioWith the launch of its first watch in November 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.\n\nToday, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time.
