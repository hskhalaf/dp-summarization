I will say they went above and beyond to fix the matter and you can DEFINITELY buy with assurance that if you have any dissatisfaction, they WILL address it, promptly.

It was beautiful when the lights were turned low to soft jazz music as we honored them. We will use these again. In 2017 we used glow bracelets which were a success as well.",

Compare these at 18 cents each to 35 cents for a piece of candy (from a 2lb/56 piece bag of Palmer Halloween mix), it's a no brainer and much better for dental health. These come neatly packaged in a 4 section tray with 25 of each color per section. I tried one of each color and they worked great, very bright and easy to operate.
