      "text": "I miss this tablet. I sold it a long while ago. It was the first one where I actually owned a premium, per se, tablet. Because it is premium. It was so thin, had excellent resolution, had LED display, it was marvelous. It had an Intel but it packs a bit of punch as I was able to play 3d racing games on it. Videos looked fantastic and the desin of this tablet at the time...wow. How can such a little thin thing have decent power, nice display, and good battery life? Camera was, eh, but it had that 3d measurement thing using the camera and thought it was cool. A very memorable tablet.",

The worse is that Dell silently decided to drop all support for their tablets shortly after this was launched. The tablet had problems from day one, from drivers, to hardware issues. Instead of retiring the products from the market. Dell decided to sell its bad stock of tablets and make a quick buck. I still have a 4 year old iPad working perfectly. And this Dell was almost the same price.",

Find a shady spot and trade sunglasses for readers and no problem. Battery life seems to be great. I have tracked 4 and 5 hour bike rides and found plenty of battery when I got finished. No stars for camera quality since I have not used it yet.",

There is not much space to hold the tablet comfortably and the webcam is placed in the bottom left area. What's great is that it's so thin and light. It is a decent size screen, although at times I wished it was larger. If you prefer the Google interface with android, it's a decent tablet for light work and browsing on the go. If you need \"snappiness\" and are use to the Samsung TouchWiz interface, the Tab S / S2 / S3 tablets are better",
