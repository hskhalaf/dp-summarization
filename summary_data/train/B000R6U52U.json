If you need a cabinet this is the one to get! It was half the price as others and was very easy to assemble and everything lines up perfectly. The manufacturer even added extra parts just in case, which was great!",

My boyfriend is a handy guy so was able to creatively cover the finish that had spiderweb cracked as a result of the assembly efforts. He was ready to return it but we decided it wasn't worth the nuisance. Overall, it helps with our storage needs and the flaws are virtually undetected.",

Just clean it up afterwards. Great job manufacturer! I hung it myself, but would have been easier as a two-man job.",

The twins love it too, just the right size for their counter..",
