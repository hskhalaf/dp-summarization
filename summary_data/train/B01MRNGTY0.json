      "text": "If the remote breaks that comes with the fan the entire fan is useless. Harbor Breeze no longer makes this fan and there is no replacement remote that will work with this model. There is also no pull chain so the remote is the only way to make it work. You also can't replace the receiver inside the fan as it's attached to the motor. If you bought this fan from Lowe's Harbor Breeze told me they would replace it for free. Since I bought it from Amazon I'm not sure if I have any chance of getting this thing to work again. Either way it looks like I'll have to completely replace the fan after 1 year of use.",

The remotes work great and the light bulbs can be dimmed by holding the light button down until the desired brightness is achieved. The only problem I have is that the bulbs that come with the fans are 40 watt screw-ins and a special size. With the globe design, the light in each room is dim compared to the light I'm used to so I will have to search for higher wattage bulbs that fit.",
