I have a PRO Manduka mat which is one of the best in the market yet I still find it somewhat slippery since I sweat a lot ... this has been bothering me for a while now. But I can finally say my frustration is gone. Highly recommended:) - good price too! Especially because the yogitoe are like $65. You also get a hand towel!",

However, I still get warm and the hands slip in downward dog, pike or other forward bends. This towel has completely stopped that and given me the confidence to try more aggressive poses. It's nice to get both sizes, too. For Pilates, I only have to use the hand towel and it stops the slide. The large is best for a full yoga class. It washes well and maintains the grip.",

I accidentally dried the towel and it didn't shrink, which is good since it has the 4 corner pockets. Maybe I have a long mat, but the towel fit it perfectly. Some reviewers said it was too long though. I want to order another towel in a different color. Also the smaller towel is great, I think this is a great deal.",

I've used my sisters more expensive towel, which is a bit softer, but I much prefer this one. Definitely worth it!",

I had an issue with only the spray bottle breaking and Iuga responded very generously with a new bottle and towel. Additionally, it is a very nice bonus that Iuga also adds the hand towel as part of the overall package. Could it be better, yes, but worth the price you pay.",

First of all it has a good grip to it so I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m slipping on my mat. Some towels I really need to spray with a lot of water so I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m slipping and I\u2019m finding I don\u2019t even need to with this one. It\u2019s also a nice soft material-I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m sticking to it. I like that it comes with a hand towel,that\u2019s a nice feature, and best of all the price is really good for what you get.",

The corner pockets fit perfectly over my mat and I like that it included a little spray bottle to spray your towel in the beginning of class so you have some grip. The little hand-sized towel was also an added bonus to wipe myself down! Awesome purchase for a great price, would definitely recommend.",
