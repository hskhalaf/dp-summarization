Turns out I'm better than I expected and this kit certainly didn't hinder me at all. I will say the base isn't heavy enough, I don't feel like I can walk away with a hot tip and not freak out about it falling over while I'm away. Having very little experience with soldering irons, I will say I wish the grip was closer to the tip for dexterity purposes, but that may not be a realistic expectation out of an iron since it gets so hot. No idea.",
