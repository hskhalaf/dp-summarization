I\u2019m not sure why the disparity and if the sizing is done with the assumption that you\u2019ll be wearing the shoe barefooted and if the material stretches considerably over time.",

They're also thinner/more ventilated at the front so you feel the cold more, which can be positive or negative depending on time of year. They look a little slicker than the originals but IMO, the originals are slightly more comfortable overall/",

I've said the shoes fit is as expected but thats only because I've had similar before. They tend to be slightly small so I would always go a 1/2 size up from other makes. Plenty of toe box room and extremely comfortable straight from the box. I could wear these all day every day. Great if you have a job in which you need your feet to be comfortable",
