It didn't take me to long to devour it. I spaced the three packages over two months. Each package was divided in half, two morning breakfasts with crackers. Until opening, it does not need to be refrigerated. It came in a foam box with dry ice and was very cold when it arrived. Would buy again.",

These are great for appetizers, and would be wonderful in a salad or in pasta. The skin is also edible, or you can also remove it when you plate the salmon.",

Overcooked! Overcooked! Overcooked! All three of the salmon pieces. I shared the salmon with 5 other people without commenting on it and they have similar critic. Overcooked! I'm disappointed with this product so far. I thought the $8 smoked salmon from Raley's or Safeway was better. both 1 more set this product to give it another chance. I hope it gets better.",
