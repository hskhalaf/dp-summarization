The mouse would never connect to the laptop, some file \"missing\"; I soon discovered via Google I was not alone. Known issue with this thing. It went back to Amazon the next day. Win7 Pro 64 on a less than a year old Dell w/4gb and SSD. So much for the wifi mouse. Well played HP. I can see why HP is in trouble after this product experience. I would have given NO stars but that's not an option, it seems.",

Quality build, as good or better than any other Microsoft or Logitech mouse I've owned. Runs on two AA batteries (a plus in my book since I can use my rechargeables) Its a classy looking mouse.",

After many days of using it daily today it lost pairing. I thought it was the battery, but the batteries it came with are still at 95 percent. I rebooted the laptop and that solved the problem. The only flaw I'm still trying to fix is that I can't get the back button to work. I have tried to program it several times and nothing. It fits real well in my hand and it runs smoothly over my mouse pad. For the cost, this mouse is awesome, I highly recommend it.",
