The phone immediately sees the USB connection and the SD data is accessible via file manager. I then popped my camera's SD card in to copy the photos I took of the setup over to the phone (uploaded for this review). Needless to say it worked great on a PC too.

Previously \"bad\" cards tested fine, and could work in heavy testing for 5+ hours without even getting warm to the touch. This is too old now for a refund, so it's going into the trash before it causes real damage and potentially a fire. Avoid at all costs.",

I lied... I have another complaint. The plastic shell is on the fat side, which makes it hard to have things plugged in next to it. But it's what's on the inside that counts... right? Yeah... sure... for that price I'll pretend. ;)",

I was a fool for not grabbing it sooner! well made, looks nice, and has worked well with our class 10 cards we use in our camera. its a no-brainer whether i'd recommend this against any cheaper counterpart.",
