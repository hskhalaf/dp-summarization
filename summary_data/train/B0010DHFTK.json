      "text": "The grinder's initial build quality and workmanship seemed good considering the price. However, as someone new to using angle grinders, I was unaware of the risk of damaging the motor via overheating. Within 24 hours of opening the box, I had damaged the device by overworking it while grinding concrete. Because this is a common problem with angle grinders, imho Makita should have taken AT LEAST ONE of the following steps: (a) discussed the risk of overheating in the owner's manual, (b) provided a mechanism to issue a warning and/or shutdown the tool when internal temperature is too hot, and/or (c) covered this kind of damage in their warranty. Unfortunately none of these things is the case.",

I have never known ANY problems with my Makita tools, like so many claim to have. When they wear out I send them back and have them rebuilt. I have been doing construction since 1975 and built over 400 homes renovated over 200 more and have operated some really junky tools but none of them are Makita's. This little grinder is a breeze to operate and the case is TOP SHELF! Four grinding disc's and a diamond wheel cutter and an extra wheel guard for under 80 bucks. WOW just WOW!",

I probably still have 7. I then used it to cut angle iron, and square bar; pretty heavy stuff. It worked great. Take your time and ease it thru the metal.

Anyhow, I've only used this for a day so I can't say how long it will last, even though it feels very well built. It's one of the best compact grinders I've used. It makes my job much easier. It seems to have a very powerful motor that'll make your grinding go quickly and easily. The packaging was very nice and everything seemed of very good quality. I'd highly recommend this to any welder/fabricator/DIY'er.",

Minor detail though, good machine. Recommend highly to anyone that needs a grinder for multiple purposes, it's a stand up machine.",
