The lower part of the boot is quite flexible compared to the Sorel snow flurry boots that we have previously used. I will update this review if they don't hold up to little boy abuse. Edited to add: The outer fabric of these boots do absorb water. It is an easy fix with a quick coat or two of Scotchguard.",

My favorite part is the whole rubber bottom and how far up it comes. It seems that so often, under the snow is mud. These are certainly up to any conditions! My kids had both of their pairs absolutely mud covered and filthy and they wiped right off. They were a little more expensive than I wanted to pay, but they are totally worth it. Plus, I bought them big knowing that they can use them next season as well and they don't slip or flop on their feet.",

I\u2019m disappointed also that there\u2019s no way to tighten the laces, just draw in the string to close the top part around your calf but it seems flimsy & can only be pulled in so much. I see that snapping & breaking off. Too bad because they are cute, good quality except the shoe lace part. Will be returning.",

I like the lightness of the product and the drawstring closure on top. I have had other boots that didn't have this feature and this boot is just that much more convient to keep snow and debris from getting into top of boots. Merrell's design looks solid and will probably last long after she grows out of them.",
