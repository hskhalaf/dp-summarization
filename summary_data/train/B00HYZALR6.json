It could be mounted on a slanted wall (although i did not) given the stem is hinged to accommodate that. Thankfully, it uses three standard light bulbs. A dimmer can be added as well. The size is substantial and the look is beautiful. When the light is off, the outer fabric shade appears very light grey and when the light is on it appears more white. The narrow depth of the shade makes it look much more modern. I'd use the product again and highly recommend it for any bedroom or possibly a walk-in closet to add effect.",

I tried a few different types of bulbs, even getting down around the 2200k color range, but the fixture itself renders the light into a white, almost a hint of purple color that I just don't like. Perhaps if the bottom diffuser (which is a white piece of round plastic) were more of an off-white/beige, this would solve the issue.",
