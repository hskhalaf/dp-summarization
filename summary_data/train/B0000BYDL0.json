This one appears very sturdy a works extremely well. If it is durable, which it appears to be, it will keep the five star rating I gave it. Instruction recommend oiling which is indicative that it is intended to last.",

It's built with a sturdy metal so it should hold up for a long time of use. Just make sure not to overextend when pushing down. We have found that it works best to leave a couple of cans in the bottom so when you add cans to it they align correctly. It holds five cans. The sliding mechanism works smoothly! We have been recycling cans for years where we did not crush them. It feels great to recycle with less trips to the recycling center! Also, it's fun to use, you get to crush a can in seconds!",

(I understand why) The reason for replacement was that the old one had been smashed 10 years ago and the fatigue finally broke. I have great confidence that this new one will last a lot longer. So far it is working better than I remember the other one did.",

We replaced it now because it was used so often and for so many years that the metal got a literal \"groove\" in it and couldn't be fixed. Our new one works great and I wouldn't ever buy any other kind.",
