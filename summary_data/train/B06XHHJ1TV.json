Despite having my hand further up, I don't clench the hook as hard with reduces tension in my arm and neck. The bag the hooks come in is adorable, and the extras are a nice bonus. Only downside might be that the hooks are only marked with their measurements and not letter size. I think most patterns use both though.",

But I would not brag about these to anyone really- they sort of feel like a cover over the metal. It feels hard, but you arent feeling the metal exactly on your hand. These hooks work great!
