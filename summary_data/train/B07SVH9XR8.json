      "title": "Versatile Instax camera",
      "text": "The ability to see the image before exposing the film on these hybrid Instax cameras makes for a completely different experience. While you loose the sometimes unpredictable nature of the analogue cameras, you're not going to use up any film on iffy shots with this. That said, the built in camera on this is rather average. It's perfect for handing to someone for a quick picture, taking group shots etc, but it really shines as a printer with images taken with a good smartphone. I'd definitely take the versatility of this model over a print-only Instax device though. It's easy to use, versatile and convenient overall. A good addition to the range.",

      "text": "Definitely the best Instax camera money can buy - worth spending the extra on this model. It connects to your phone so you can print directly from your phone onto Instax film. You can also shoot on the camera multiple times before choosing which shot to print, which is so helpful because on the old Instax cameras thej automatically print every shot even if its over exposed or too dark. So this one is the best and I\u2019d highly recommend!",

Slight downside is that the film is expensive, hence the importance of SD card versus earlier models that ONLY printed!",

The pictures come out extremely dark and if not, yellow. I\u2019ve been using Instax for years now so I know what the good pictures turn out to be like. Didn\u2019t even use up all my Instax films as this is too disappointing. Definitely not recommended.",
