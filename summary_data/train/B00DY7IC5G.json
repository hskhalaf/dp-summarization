I'm certain if I ever have an issue it's gonna be due to overweight issues, but at 70 bucks a pair I won't lose sleep about replacing them in a couple years.",

      "text": "I ordered 2 sets (so 4 total) of these stools for my basement bar. The stools look great and feel fairly comfortable which is why I am giving them any stars at all. Three of them wobble pretty bad, which won't be too bad to fix by putting felt pad sliders on the legs so they slide on tile easier (and less noisy). The main reason for star deductions was that 1 stool didn't have any screws holding it together at all! Luckily I had 4 screws lying around the house that were similar enough to the ones used (found out by taking a screw out of a different one) and that I checked before sitting down on it.",
