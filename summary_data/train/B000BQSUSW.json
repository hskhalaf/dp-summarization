    "description": "Size:2 gallon\n\nThe Eagle Type I galvanized steel safety can with funnel is used to store, transport, and dispense flammable liquids safely and comes with a funnel to facilitate filling and pouring. The can is made of 24-gauge galvanized steel, which is resistant to rust, dents, and certain chemicals. Gauge is a measure of thickness (the lower the gauge, the thicker the material). The powder-coated finish resists scratches, chipping, fading, and other wear. A flame arrestor helps prevent liquids inside the can from igniting and keep flames from spreading. The spout cap self-closes to help prevent leaks or spills. The cap assembly opens automatically to vent internal vapors. A trilingual safety warning label alerts users to the can's contents. The funnel is made of HDPE (high-density polyethylene), which is resistant to dents, punctures, and certain chemicals. This safety can may be available in different colors (blue for kerosene, green for oil or other combustibles, red for gasoline, or yellow for diesel) to separate, store, and identify different liquids. This product is FM Approved as a safety can used for handling flammable liquids in quantities of 5 gallons or less. It complies with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard 1910.106 for the safe storage and handling of flammable liquids.

They are often color-coded for different liquids (for instance, red cans for gasoline, blue cans for kerosene, yellow cans for diesel fuel, or green cans for oil). Other common features include flame arrestors, which help prevent the liquid inside the can from igniting, and seam welds, which help prevent leaks. Certain hazardous storage cans are FM Approved, and many meet National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards for the storage and handling of flammable liquids.
