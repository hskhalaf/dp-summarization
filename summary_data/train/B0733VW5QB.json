I was very impressed at the difference in the smooth picture, compared to our old monitors, especially in First Person Shooter's. The packaging is well designed to protect these monitors for their journey to your house. The picture quality is very good, especially for a TN panel. Our games look better and no doubt run much smoother. 4 out of 4 have great picture quality and appear to be defect free.",

I'd say it's as good as it would get for TN. The speed on this little monster is the main selling point and it surely delivers. I doubt I can go back to anything below 144hz again.

I give them the benefit of the doubt though that this was just a bad monitor because my 34\u201d is a delight to use.

However my unit came with a Dead/Stuck pixel, After contacting dell/alienware about this issue they told me it is in their policy and that they will not be giving me my warranty. So i guess i will just be forced to return it to amazon and order a new monitor.",
