      "text": "Love the look and finish. I had only two problems with it. First was the cold water valve had not been tightened down at factory and within one day of use was gushing water down wall. Tightened it down and resolved. The other is that unless you bottom the spout when inserting, it will leak. Fixed that with a custom cut piece of 3/4 PVC pipe and 2 rubber gaskets. So unless you are real good at measuring for your backsplash, it will probably leak. Lots of nylon tape will not fix it. Now that it is not leaking at all, I love it. The 1.0Gpm restrictor was perfect for my application.",
