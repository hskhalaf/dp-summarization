I've probably lost connection maybe once or twice since it has been connected to my wifi. (about 3 weeks ago now). I can always switch to bluetooth (if I'm range) if wifi does not work. Overall great product so far. Please work on the app! Less click and more information will be appreciated.",

These controllers are integrated into the b-hyve app which provides a common look and feel for your homes irrigation requirements. I use 4 of these and an Orbit in ground 12 station controller. My furtherest placed controller is approx 125\u2019 from its Bluetooth hub and works perfectly. All controllers on a particular hub participate in their Bluetooth mesh network which provides long reaches. My only suggestion has been voiced before, having the h-hyve app provide irrigation times synchronized across all devices.",

There is NO phone support on weekends, there is no live chat, no email support. The forums indicate if your hub gets disconnected the only recourse you have is to write a forum post, have one of the support people see it, then remove your device from your account a few days later and try again. There is NO factory reset on the hub. You can brick your device by pausing the pairing process. That's incredible.",
