But after just one application and one day, they were gone. I used this over the doors of each room so I could be sure it would not go near food. Today I think I saw one fly and he was renting the farm with the option to buy. After using this, you will never use another fly spray again. Just give it a couple of days. Results are not immediate but they are impressive.",

After a bad leak and mold issue, we were bombarded with mold gnats in our kitchen. Vinegar or fruit traps did nothing, but spray this product on the window sills and we'd wake up to literally dozens of dead gnats on the sill. It is messy to clean up the dead flies, but totally worth not having gnats in your food or buzzing by your face all day. Results over night and about 1 month of using 3 times a week to get rid of gnat infestation almost completely. Highly recommend.",

I sprayed around the garage, especially around and on the garbage can and for the past month have not had flies despite 90+ degree days. The garage door is open quite a bit and still no flies.

I sprayed just maybe once or twice in the couple of weeks following to be on the safe side, but no flies the entire season! This product was safe to use indoors and out, but I do not have pets, read for pet instruction",

    "title": "PT Alpine Pressurized Fly Bait - 16 oz can - by BASF",
    "description": "Pt Alpine pressurized fly bait is a solution that is ready to use to kill flies in a wide range of environments. This new formula provides baiting properties which will aid in bringing flies into the treated area. It provides a quick kill with a proven baiting formula for 30 days on non-porous surfaces. Pt Alpine may be used in combination with fly light products such as vector plasma, vector plasma one, and the vector classic for fly population reduction. It is a fast acting baiting spray that is a highly adaptable fly product that can be used in both residential and commercial settings and can be applied as area, band or spot treatment applications. The product applies fast and dries clear with no mess, and leaving no odor. For the best possible prevention for flies, use the pt. Alpine pressurized fly bait and integrate it with other fly control products, such as residual or contact sprays, fly traps along with drain cleaners. New size change from 20 oz. to 16 oz. can. Application: point can toward target area from a distance no further than 12 in (30 cm) and press down. Make a light application at a rate of 2 ln ft./sec and avoid run off or dripping from targeted area. Area treatments are effective where flies congregate, roost and feed. Or areas where flies are likely to congregate or infest. Do not apply bait in areas that are frequently cleaned. This product will not adhere to surfaces that are dusty or greasy. Reapply when bait placements are no longer visible and/or reinfestation occurs. Use a water-dampened paper towel to remove unwanted bait placements and then discard in trash. Read entire label.",
