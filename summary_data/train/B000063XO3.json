The seller said it was used but in good shape and that all pieces were counted. When I got it, it was as described. My kids and I couldn't be happier. Having a child with developmental delay, this is one game that gets her motivated to learn.",

Compared to her other games: Sneaky Snacky Squirrel, Hungry Hungry Hippos, and Whack-a-mole arcade, she prefers Cariboo.",

We play a lot of games with our older kids (10 and seven) and so we wanted a game that the little one can play too. So glad we were able to replace this. She loves it and it is fun for the whole family to play something with the little one. So far we are only using the color cards, but she is getting the hang of it. Thanks Cariboo!

Also, the game construction is not great, because once a couple of the ball-cover-lids are opened, it is too easy to see if other balls are in adjacent spots. The best part about it for us is it is an activity one of us can do with a grandchild, but the actual game play is a little boring, and I think over-priced for what you get, especially if one purchased a new game, at about $150 retail, but that's just my opinion.",

    "description": "This game is an enjoyable way for your little one to learn the ABC's, numbers, shapes and colors. Each turn gives kids a chance to match fun drawings, unlock secret doors and discover hidden treasure. Designed especially for young children. For 2 to 4 players, ages 3 to 6 yrs. Imported.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nTaking a step away from trivia questions and clay sculpting, the makers of Cranium have instead created a game for teaching wee ones a few colors, shapes, numbers, and letters. (And, if you know 3- to 6-year-olds that won't lose all the included cards and balls, they may also learn sharing, cooperation, and imaginative play.) The bottom of the box houses the game itself, with three chutes along the top that the balls are dropped into and three rows of flip-up panels that are decorated with various colored objects. Players draw cards, match them to a panel, flip up the panel, and hope there is a ball underneath it. Once all six balls are recovered a treasure chest pops open and gameplay can begin anew. --Pam Lauer\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nCranium Cariboo is the magical treasure hunt game designed especially for young children. Kids love exploring the golden island of Cariboo, where they find castles, boats, balloons, and more. Cariboo reinforces four early-learning fundamentals, letters, numbers, shapes, and colors and it's packed with fun! Cariboo Expanded Edition grows with your child with an advanced set of cards that doubles the fun. Cranium Cariboo has received several prestigious awards, including the Platinum Best Toy Award from the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio.\n\nSee more",
