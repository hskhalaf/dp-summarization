They're better suited for use by men - wearing them over undergarments makes elimination difficult for women and would require opening and closing the strap while standing. They're quite heavy, stiff and uncomfortable so I'll be donating them. I designed a belt that's easier to use, very lightweight, washable, flexible and much less expensive should I decide to use one.",

He says it works great and wears it most days at work where he often lifts heavy things and is constantly bending and on his feet. It's not a permanent solution, of course, but it has been a lifesaver for him until he can afford think about surgery (probably a long time from now). He wears it sometimes with and sometimes without the foam piece depending on the type of support he needs.",

Best of all you can sit down with it, something I couldn't do with the other kind because it squished your stomach and groin so bad that you had to un-velcro it while sitting down. This belt hold the hernia in place so well that you almost forget you have one! Highly recommended!",

There are very few hernia aids made for women, which is odd as we get a lot of them according to stats...so, make sure you go up 2 sizes, and you can adjust down but not up!!",
