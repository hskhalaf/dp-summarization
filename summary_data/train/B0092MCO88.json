The uneven distribution of air makes it extremely hot near the hose opening. I had to keep shifting the hose to redirect the direction of the air flow. I had to also manipulate the cap in different directions (e.g., left, right, forward) to help redirect the direction of air flow. The dryer hose is extremely short. During my second use of the dryer, the hose came apart. It blew out of the dryer compartment. I am rating the product a 1 star. For these reasons, I am reluctant to recommend the dryer to anyone.",
