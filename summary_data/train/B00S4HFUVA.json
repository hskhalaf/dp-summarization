    "title": "Extreme Max 3006.7231 BoatTector 24\" Contour Fender Value Pack, Blue",
    "description": "Color:BlueContour Fenders provide excellent protection, with a wraparound design that protects both gunwale and hull. Unlike round fenders, their square design stows efficiently in limited storage space. Closed cell foam construction means that the fender will never deflate or collapse. These contour fenders are 24\" x 6. 5\" x 2. 5\". UV and tear resistant, with a marine-grade tri-laminate cover, double thermal-bonded seams, and corrosion-proof polycarbonate grommets. Two-year replacement . To keep your shopping simple, we've also included a pair of high-quality, 3/8\" x 5' solid-braid fender lines - the perfect length and diameter for use with this fender. Two-year replacement .",
