      "text": "I put this bench in our steam shower as a cheap alternative to a teak bench. I did not expect it to last long in the host, steamy environment of a steam shower (essentially a wet sauna, steam room). However, the finish looks great after 1.5 years of almost daily steam shower use. It shows a little fading but still looks great. There is no staining from corrosion from the hardware. The only thing I can't attest to is how this bench would stand up to daily UV (i.e. outside). Otherwise, it is fantastic.",

It is more of a zen look for a living room, patio, or bathroom. You would need to stain it darker or finish to not look tacky at a dining table. I love that it is American made and sustainable wood. All of the seams and joints have no issues. The bad reviews seem to be from years ago.",

But it arrived somewhat darker and richer looking and with some teak oil, it's just beautiful on the front porch with a red pillow. It was easy to put together, is lightweight, but is also solid and stable. Definitely recommend.",

This spring I gave it a light sanding to remove any accumulated stains, oiled it, and put it right back into service. (By the way, it's great to sit on, too!)",
