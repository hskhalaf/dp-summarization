      "text": "This product seems to be well made, but the packaging and instructions included are ridiculous. The fitting instructions are so small and of such poor quality printing as to render them unreadable (I guess they could not afford a larger piece if paper) . The instructions are for two different models to add to the confusion and no where on the product or packaging does it indicate the model of the product that you purchased. I can not find a country of origin on the product or packaging, but my guess is China, because I think any American company would do a better job communicating with the end user. I will never buy another product from this company.",
