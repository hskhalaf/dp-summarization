She loves the taste which doesn't mean much as she eats basically anything, but so far it's been very good for managing her weight. As always, the recommended feeding amount is probably too high, my cat gets one tub per day along with a couple of spoons of kibble.",

And her wet food is a supplement to the dry, and after the 2nd day, the nonpreservative wet food smelled strong, even though refrigerated, and at that stage she wouldn't even eat one bite. She smelled it and walked away. So although I wanted to use this more healthful natural product, I ended up giving it to another family for their cat.",

      "text": "My cat is the epitome of a picky eater, she only seems to like fish flavors. She will not eat pa\u0302te\u0301s at all, but she doesn\u2019t want larger chunks in wet food either, she will lick all the moisture out of these foods but not eat the sheds or chunks of meat in food and this food is heavy on. The consistency is that jarred toddler food and has an people friendly presentation. I have gone through dozens of moist foods and she frequently changes her mind about her likes and dislikes. This is the only brand that she totally refuses to eat any flavor of.",
