      "title": "The Raven Delivers for Youth Hockey Players!",
      "text": "Love this 30 flex Raven hockey stick for my mite-aged son. His first Raven lasted about 3 months before it got snapped in a vicious corner puck battle (stick got caught in a gap in the boards--not the Raven's fault that it snapped!). My son loved the stick, and so we rushed to buy him a replacement. It's nice to have a pro-grade stick that is sized appropriately for younger players. Go-T Hockey did a great job of quickly shipping us the product. Well-packaged and arrived as anticipated. Just put a nice Buttendz grip on this stick and my son should be ready for practice tomorrow night.",

      "text": "My son really loves this stick. He put a thick sock over the blade and practice shooting with this stick in the house. He loves the weight and feel. Not very many 30 or 40 flex out there. My son is ten, very tall and very skinny nearly five feet tall and just barely 70lbs. He needs a 30 flex unfortunately this stick was to short and we had to return it for the 40 flex. We had no problem with returning it and had our new 40 flex stick a week later and it is now his new best friend. No complaints here.",

I bought another because he loves it so much. The second one is chipping a bit on the blade heal. It could be because he\u2019s a bonehead and hits the ice for a pass too hard but still. It won\u2019t deter though, I will buy him the next size up when he is ready.",

      "text": "We have been using Raven's youth hockey sticks for over a year. The Raven is the perfect fit for our 8 year old and has the correct amount of flex. We no longer cut sticks to fit which increased the flex so he could not use them properly. His shot and stick handling has improved due to the youth flex and height with the Jr. sized blade. The stick warranty and customer service has also been outstanding! Thank you for designing a quality stick to fit todays youth hockey player!!",

    "description": "The FLEX30 by Raven Hockey is a Junior/Youth hybrid designed for players under 80 lbs and looking to control a hard pass on the rush while also being able to raise the puck top shelf. The most commanding feature of the FLEX30 is the low flex rating of 30, appropriate for the height and weight of most youth hockey players and the lowest in the industry.The FLEX30 is the perfect stick for players under 57\" tall.Most youth sticks have a shaft too narrow to allow for correct puck control and cutting inches off a typical junior stick will increase the stiffness negatively affecting passing and shooting. The FLEX30 is the only stick in hockey with a flex low enough to correctly fit players who weigh less than 80 pounds. All this with a 60-day warranty.",
