The mesh is fairly large, so these can't be used for bulk section items or small things like snow peas, but they work just fine for most produce. I just throw them in the washing machine when they get dirty. They also allow for airflow, which can help some produce last longer. Would buy again!",

My daughter recommended these bags for produce because they are mesh so the cashiers can see the contents. I have only used them once, so I think it would be unfair to comment (yet) on their durability and sturdiness, but as a person who has been home sewing for a long time, I can tell that they appear to be quite well made. I look forward to long, plastic free years of use.",

They are durable and easily cared for. However they are made of Nylon which is plastic made from crude oil. I\u2019m probably going to return them and get organic cotton ones. It is helpful for the environment since they are reusable and we are cutting back on the use of plastic bags. Recyclable plastic is really just using old plastic to make more plastic products. I believe we can do better.",
