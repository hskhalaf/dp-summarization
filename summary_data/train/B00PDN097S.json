Normally when I buy baby food from target or walmart or safeway it has an expiration date of at least 1 year sometimes even 2 years out. 2.5 months seems really short.",

Packaging was well boxed and protected when recieved too. Nothing expired or looking weird.

It would be much better if at least one of the flavors was some other vegetable, fruit, or grain combo that didn't have vitamin A (like apple and oatmeal, for example).",
