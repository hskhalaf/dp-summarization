The bright white setting is more of a bluish \"cool\" white; quite pretty. Tomorrow I'm switching them to the warm white setting, though, which I'm guessing is more of a yellow white and would better match the yellow white light cast by my landscape lights. The light cast is more than sufficient and I am pleasantly surprised! Very nice product and satisfied customer. FYI: this picture was taken with my phone from from inside my house so it doesn't do the lights full justice. They're even brighter outside.",

Each light has 4 solar collectors, one on each side. They look good and work great, casting plenty of light on the warm setting. They're strong, not flimsy feeling or looking like the plastic ones we've seen. We've received many compliments from the neighbors since installing these lights.",
