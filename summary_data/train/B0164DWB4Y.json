      "text": "Product is OK, but I must say, I really think the unit I received was used - I purchased new. The packaging was sort of old and faded. Additionally the tips to the Injector only had protective plastic on one of the tips (the small one). I am not impressed with the efforts you must go to for access to the seller's website for the \"eGuide\". Once you get to the website it is sort of disappointing. I think the idea of marinade injecting is great and it will take some trial and error to get it right.",
