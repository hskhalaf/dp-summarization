      "verdict": "The Diadora Maracana L promises comfort and performance with its ultra-soft, full-grain calfskin leather upper. With the majority of reviews, the leather was proven to provide straight out of the box comfort. Even the wide-footed players were impressed with its accommodating fit. On the flip side, it was also deemed to have a large fit for the narrow-footed and an arguable construction quality. Overall, this soccer cleat is highly recommended for the wide-footed players who consider comfort on top of their priorities.",

      "cons": [
        "A good number of users found the sizing of the Diadora Maracana to be extremely large",
