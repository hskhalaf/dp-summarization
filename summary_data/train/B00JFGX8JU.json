Can recommend it highly. Seller sent product quickly and is exactly what I have been using. Puffiness on my old eyes has disappeared with daily use of a minuscule amount. Will always look for it from this seller.",

Big mistake, package damaged, possibly opened already , seemed \" old \" , color and texture seemed different. Large air bubble in cream . Seemed like it either wasn't full or partially dried up. Huge disappointment",

I've tried other products, that cost less, that have given similar results. I'll finish off the jar I purchased and see if there is any change after a more prolonged time of usage. If there is a visible change in that time frame I'll write a more favorable review. Dr. B Roach",
