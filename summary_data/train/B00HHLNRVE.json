Each unpeeled clove I plopped in and pressed resulted in beautiful crushed garlic--the clove was completely spent. Clean up was easy-peasy, the peeling came right out and I had no need to use the little cleaning brush that came with the press. No garlicky hands either.",

I'm not sure what the advantages of this having 3 separate moving parts but it works really well and it's very heavy duty and you feel like you can really go to town on the garlic and it's not going to bend or break in any way.",

That said, this is working great and I don't understand some of the complaints I read. You will like this press and the rubber garlic roller that came with it is very, very cool!",

The brush is perfect for cleaning the tool when I am done. I use a butter knife to remove the skins in between mincing cloves, and to scrape the garlic off the outside surface once it has been minced. It even works on ginger root! ( After it has been peeled, of course).",

Before this purchase i cut garlick with a sharp knife and did a pretty good job,i thought. The Propresser makes a tedious and smelly job EZ. The end result is that youre favorite foods have a stronger Garlic taste, due to the uniformity of how the cloves have been crushed. In closing, a great product that would make the \"Chef of the future\" proud",

It seems to take a little less pressure to squeeze out the garlic, and you do not even have to peel it first, although it is easier to squish if it's peeled. Easy cleanup and believe it will last for years! Thanks for a great product at a good price:)",
