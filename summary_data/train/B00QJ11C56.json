Perhaps I need 8.5 instead, however 8 fit perfectly in length.I went back to my minimalist shoes which were the vibram five fingers for running as my foot were free to spread out at contact. My foot were no longer in sore.",

The style of these shoes are also what gravitated me towards them, making the shoes look more extravagant than they actually are. Despite these things, the shoes do get dirty fairly easily, but as long as you are willing enough to take the time to clean your shoes every once in a while, then these shoes are absolutely perfect.",
