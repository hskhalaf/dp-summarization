I expected the 150BT to start as easily as the 145, and also have more power. I was dissappointed with the power of the 150, as well as the number of pulls it took to start it during the first few operations (20-30 pulls). The new unit seems to have the same power as the older unit, and hopefully the starting will be easier in the future. The $300 price of the new unit seems a bit high for what I got.",

Once you get the hang of starting it you get a pretty decent amount of power. Someone reviewed that it sucked down the gas too fast. I found I could go almost 3 hours of constant blowing per tank.",

They then proceeded to tell me that the 2 year warranty isn't for the issue I am having and that I would have to pay for repairs. Moral of the story, don't buy Husqvarna anything.

Read the instructions, added gas, started maybe second pull and off I went. Didn't stop till it ran out of gas. Will note that it does seem you need to wait a few minutes afelter refilling to start it again. No problem at all. Did that and off I went again. Highly recommend!",
