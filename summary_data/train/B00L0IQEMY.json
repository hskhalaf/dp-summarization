They look outstanding in our newly landscaped front yard. We were terribly impressed receiving an informational email from GardenBliss even before we received the lights. And the instructions which came with the lights could not have been clearer and more user-friendly. Thanks to GardenBliss for an excellent product and for superior customer service. We highly recommend the purchase of these solar lights.",

They give off more of a blue/white light and are adjustable to two different heights. They have been through a few storms with no issues over the last week, so that is a good sign. I do wish they let off a bit more light, but they work well so far.",

It's winter and they get a short charge due to cloudy weather here in Seattle. The posts are heavier and don't break when pushing them into the ground. I also like they came with two post lengths.",

That's because they are plastic and not the most durable plastic. I contacted the vendor and they replaced the light and even supplied extra. That's great customer service. They've only been in for about a month. We'll see what they look and act like in six months.",

They put out a pleasant cooler color light, not warm light (keep that in mind if mixing lights!). Consider these more of a bluer light than a warmer yellowish light like some others. Price per unit is competitive. Well enough made. I mow by them weekly and they're still holding up.",

Either way I'm forced to replace the batteries in the bad ones first to determine what's wrong. I Bought these specifically after reading all reviews.

Not rocket science but for those who don't read, you may have a problem(but only created by your refusal to read the instructions first!!).

I did purchased an extended warranty, as lights similar to these did not last 2 years.",

One light did not work, I contacted customer service by replying to the shipping email and was not only set a replacement but 10 extra lights since the replacement was back ordered. Great company as well, they follow to make sure you received the package and if everything works properly. I will be purchasing these lights again in the future for sure.",

At least Amazon took them back after the return window when I explained my complaint. I would not recommend purchasing these.",

Unsolicited, GardenJoy read my review and sent me an email--WOW, I thought all reviews fell on \"deaf ears\" but GardenJoy stepped up and sent me 4 new lights immediately--Great Job and would highly recommend buying from GardenJoy--the Lights are all working great!

So now we have lots of lights just lying on the ground and we need to purchase something else. If you're interested in a quick / cheap fix, these are the way to go. If you'd like something to last more than a season, buy something else. The assembly is straight forward. So don't worry on that front if you do decide to go for it.",
