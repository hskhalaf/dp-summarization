This swimsuit is the perfect color and no one else had the same one ;-) Carter's knocks it out the park as usual in quality so no worries there! This fit our tiny 10 month old perfectly and dried quickly between pool dips. I think I may buy it in a larger size so she can wear it over the summer as well!",

Granted, she is somewhere are the 90th percentile for her height/weight, but I definitely should have gotten a larger size especially since she\u2019ll need to wear a swim diaper with it. I think it will probably fit her okay since my family\u2019s beach trip is in early summer. And for the price I can\u2019t complain. The colors are more vibrant in person.",

I ordered the 3T and the waist is better but the legs are ridiculous, like shorts around her legs.. I have a Carters suit from 4 years ago that my super slim daughter wore and it has elastic around the legs to keep it tight around the leg. It was such better quality!
