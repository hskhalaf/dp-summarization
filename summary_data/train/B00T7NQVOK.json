The younger one had to fill the drawers before going to sleep. I put it together alone- it would have gone smoother with help, but was manageable with using a night stand for supporting the frame. No written directions, only pictures. I missed the nut on the first steps and couldn't understand how the frame was to be held together, finally after checking the directions twice, I saw the nut!",
