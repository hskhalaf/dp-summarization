Zipper end is elastic so it stretches when you pull on the zipper making the zipper less likely to tear off from wear. Buttons are Magnet, not velcro so it lasts. Will definitely keep using this backpack for me shoots.",

I use the tripod strap to carry my job tripod. I like how the backpack is divided by too and bottom so it was easily able to carry all my other accessories. This backpack it\u2019s own raincover! and also a compartment on the top cover flap. I wish there were more options like different color and style. Would definitely recommend if you have small lenses",

Items don\u2019t move around while in transport and it\u2019s super comfortable! Being water resistant and having the ability to put a tripod on the side makes this my favorite bag. The top compartment is great for hold everyday items like food and whatnot. But you can also throw a drone in there! Very stylish love the color way and the material! All around a great day to day bag! Check out my YouTube channel for a review! \u201cTyler Berry\u201d",
