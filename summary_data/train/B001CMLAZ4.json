Over 3 years it has endured much more use and abuse than it would in a residential application. The button is pressed about 15 times a day and the chime unit gets passed from hand to hand every hour to the on-call person. We have not yet had to replace the battery in the button unit and I think we have only replaced the batteries in the chime unit once. Range is good enough that we can carry the chime unit anywhere in our three story, 24,000 square foot, concrete and steel building.",

Con batteries, knowing when to change the batteries. I recommend that you write down the date you installed the doorbell and replace the batteries every 6 months. The push button takes the small disc type batteries the ringer take 3 AA batteries. Great product for those who don't want to spend a lot of money on traditional old fashion type door bells. My doorbell had stopped working after a remodel of my home. Well, after all, \u200bit was 48 years old.",

Second, I love that it has a wall plate with 2 hooks that you can hang the unit on. This makes it easy to take to the garage or out on the deck if you are expecting a package especially one that you have to sign for. Third, the outdoor bell button has a rubber button. This is good since our old button had a hard plastic cover that eventually cracked. 3 simple tones so don't expect a symphony or holiday jingles. :-)",

It works flawlessly. I also experimented with keeping the button in the final location and moving the chime further and further away in the house - it worked more then sufficiently at twice the distance of the final chime location. Overall this is a great replacement to a faulty doorbell.",

The number one criteria for us is the volume control. With this chime's volume set to medium, we can hear it everywhere in our 2000 square foot home. The ability to bring the chime outdoors on the deck when needed is a significant plus. We would purchase this item again.",

      "text": "I ordered this doorbell for my hard-of-hearing 85 year old mother based on the reviews that the doorbell was very loud. Fortunately, before trying the product we tried it against her existing, 30 year old doorbell and found that the existing doorbell was just as loud. Neither doorbell could be heard over a loud television. The light on the doorbell is so dim, it cannot be seen more than five or six feet away from the doorbell and as such is not helpful in alerting the resident. May work for a small apartment, but did not work my mother\u2019s small house.",

When in his workroom or any other location where he claims he could not hear me, he now has the part that RINGS near him or in a pocket. His dear wife, ME, has the button to push to make the bell ring. Finding husband? SOVLED. Love this product. Well packaged and quickly arrived.",

      "text": "I live in a house with a wall around the property, and a gate that is some distance from the front door. Wiring a bell to the gate would be possible but quite inconvenient. The reason I bought this particular chime is because it claims a operational range greater than most on the market, and I needed the range. Training the push button to the chime is as simple as pushing a button on the base unit and then pressing the push button itself. While the Honeywell chime is a bit more expensive than others, the materials and apparent quality are well above average. Installation is a snap, and the operational range is more than adequate for my needs.",

We chose different signals for the front and rear doors, which was an easy option to configure. The alarm is loud and distinctive, no worries at all at missing a guest, candidate, or vacuum salesman.
