      "verdict": "The 8th instalment of the Fastwitch is a very light running shoe that gets a little more cushioning for runs ranging from 5 to 10K\u2019s. For very efficient and elite runners, this could be a superb option for half marathons as the lightweight stability keeps their form throughout the run. Besides having a more forgiving sole, the improved breathability and exceptional grip makes this an excellent option for those who are looking to lower their PRs.",
      "pros": [
        "The soft mesh upper of the Fastwitch 8 is one of the biggest reasons why some runners loved the comfortable feel of this shoe",
        "It is a value for the money investment, based on the comments of several reviewers",
        "It is significantly lighter than the previous model",
        "The upper gets a boost in breathability because of the large and numerous holes",
        "According to a few testers, the outsole is very grippy, even in wet conditions",
        "A handful of reviewers loved the more forgiving cushioning as it allows them to take the shoe for longer runs",
        "The lightweight support is enough for neutrals and mild over pronators to enjoy",
        "There is substantially more reflective details in this shoe",
        "It runs true to size, as noted by some runners"

      "cons": [

The last 2 models 7, and 8, have felt more like the Kinvara. Less fabric. More breathability. In the 7 I feel it was compromised and the shoe wore out in a couple months, casing me heel pain that I'm still recovering from. I'm glad that with these 8s I feel more support from the mesh. Overall. I love um. My only dislike is the color. I reluctantly got the black and for the next 2 1/2 months every time I see them I'll flinch at their lack of zeal. Lol.",

      "text": "I really liked this shoe but there was one thing that made me return them. The shoe is true to size (I'm a 12 in free runs and adidas running shoes, got these in 12). Super lightweight, glove like fit on the upper. Extremely comfortable. The deal breaker for me was the tongue of the shoe. It is very short and also isn't tethered to the upper. Just trying them on the tongue started to disappear down the side of the shoe, something I know would frustrate me while training in them. If the tongue had something to keep it from sliding it would greatly improve this shoe in my opinion.",

I had to go up one full size and wear a woman\u2019s 8 1/2. Then I purchased these in a men\u2019s size 7. They fit great. Also note: the main reason I\u2019ve been wearing these for years is because they have drainage holes in the bottom. I sweat A LOT (live in Florida). It seems like the Fastwitch 9s don\u2019t have these sadly :-(",

    "description": "Saucony Fastwitch 8 Running Shoes The Saucony Fastwitch in its eighth edition lives up to its legacy of speed and a touch of stability. With a lightweight engineered mesh upper offering breathability and support, and a responsive SSL EVA midsole for quick transitions through your gait cycle. Flexfilm Upper The upper consists of engineered air mesh that combines breathability and support, allowing air to fully permeate the entire footbed to ensure your feet stay cool and comfortable when the temperature goes up. A strong, lightweight material is melted to the upper, which allows for few layers in the shoe shredding weight, providing flexibility and resulting in a seamless upper, reducing chafing or skin irritation. SSL CMEVA Midsole Within the midsole lays the SSL CMEVA (compression moulded EVA) that provides lightweight responsiveness. The Fastwitch 8 utilises this full-length CMEVA midsole to provide cushioning for increased impact protection and shock absorption. Specifically engineered with a 4mm heel-to-toe differential, the Fastwitch 8 encourages a faster performance. This supports natural form and encourages an efficient, continuous and positive gait cycle from heel strike to toe-off. PWRTRAC Rubber Outsole The PWRTRAC rubber outsole provides 3x better traction than standard rubber enhancing grip to pounce off into your next step. This tacky, durable rubber provides exceptional traction and abrasion resistance allowing you to go for longer without any sign of wear, giving you the confidence to reach your targets.",
