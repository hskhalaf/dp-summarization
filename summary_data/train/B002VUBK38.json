Using my natural putting stroke, the ball jumps off the face and starts rolling in the line. I\u2019ve used for one round and will be using it for a tournament Saturday. Keeping track I got up and down on three holes I probably would not have with chipping so it saved 3 strokes today. Put the ego aside and don\u2019t care what anyone thinks, if this can save 3-4 strokes a round, it\u2019s worth it.",

Don't know what else I can say, except it has a permanent home in my bag now.",
