I regularly carry my 16inch laptop in this bag which fits comfortably with several other documents. 2) Has enough compartments to carry all necessary items. 3) The bag is made of quality materials which with around a year of use has not begun to crack or tear. Even with a fully weighted bag it has hardly seen any wear. It has definitely been recommended by me as well as bought a second time as a gift.",

      "text": "Every leather messenger bag I have bought for my husband ends up in the trash with a torn strap. I hate it because the rest of it is fine, but the straps always wear and eventually tear right at the joint where the strap meets the bag, but not on this bag. He's already had it longer than most, and it has held up great. It still looks new! And the smart design lets me know that someone knows a thing or two about straps that tear and how to avoid that. I think we finally found a keeper! Oh, and it's pretty good looking too. I actually like the color a lot more in person than in the photo.",

Hasn't happened to me and I can't quite see how it would. I could use at least one more inside pocket, but I make do with other small pouches, so it works. The outside front pockets are good for objects I'd like to be handy (little notebooks, pens, nail file, tissues, etc.). But I keep my wallet inside. The small handle is awkward, but I only use it to lift it out of the car or out when I can't reach the straps. It works.",

There is a good amount of storage and organization - outside zipper pocket, outside dual pockets under the top flap, cell phone holder, pen holder, inside zipper pocket, etc. My only complaint is I wish there was some kind of division or dual compartment within the interior of the bag in order to store a laptop on one side and various items on the other side. Overall, great buy! Not cheap, but you get what you pay for with these things.",

The closing mechanism is a cheap magnet button clasp that doesn't even hold and you have to fiddle with it and try to align it.

These are cheap and poorly made and is a shame for such an expensive bag to begin with. The quality of the bag I am indifferent to.

My 14 inch Thinkpad makes this feel like I'm dragging around a dead elephant with a chain over my shoulder. But if your heaviest item is an iPad and you've just got a binder and folders/papers then this is great. I love the inside pocket with the magnet that acts as a snap closure. NOT to be used with textbooks or laptops if you have to walk for more than 5 minutes or you'll regret it. But for hauling lightweight stuff (papers, iPad) it is a very soft material and looks great.",

Definitely a great gift, you will not be disappointed.",
