However, I don't recommend this unit for two reasons, 1) it is supposed to fit 18 bottles but you have to fight to get bottles of varying shapes to fit 2) the unit does not maintain it's tempurature when my apartment gets warm. I have it set at 54 degrees but it goes up to as high as 62 degrees.",

It works perfectly, looks really nice, and has a soft light to allow you to find what you're looking for. It is also whisper-quiet! I debated for a long time about this purchase and now wish I had bought it long ago. Perfect!!",

The pear shaped do not fit without removing a rack, limiting the capacity of the fridge. We would probably take it back for more capacity, but it seems like a hassle due to the bulkiness of the return package",
