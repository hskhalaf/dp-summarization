      "text": "I ordered two of the covers for the long rails of my son's crib and a package of two side rail covers (sold separately, but by the same manufacturer) in the gray color. The grays didn't match! The two long rail covers (pictured on the left) are a noticeably lighter blue/gray. The short rail covers (pictured on the right) are the color gray I expected. I plan to re-order the long rail covers to see if it was somehow a fluke, but I'm not holding my breath. I may have to switch to another color entirely rather than stick with the mismatched gray covers. Very disappointing.",

The only downside s that my particular crib has a slat in the very middle instead of having a gap in the very middle where the crib rail tie would go, so the crib rail ended up about an inch off center. That is a trivial issue though. Love it.",

      "text": "One day you may notice that your child's crib is covered in bite marks. On that day, you will panic and come to Amazon for crib rail covers -- the type of thing you swore was unessential and not worth wasting your money on. This is the crib cover you will buy, and you will be grateful for it. It is soft on the top for drool purposes, liquid-resistant on the bottom so that the drool doesn't make the wood underneath gross, and fits most standard front rails. One thing to note is that this is a single panel. You may need to buy 2 (plus side panels) if your kid is a full-on beaver like mine.",

And I'm sure once my son is old enough to start chewing on everything in sight I'll be thankful I had these ready to protect his crib and teeth. TIP: Don't forget to buy the matching side rail coverings. This is just the front rail.",

      "text": "My son began teething on his crib and I was very worried about the impact on his teeth, and the wood. I searched and searched for the right product, and ultimately I chose these rail covers based on the Amazon reviews. The crib rail covers are super soft and attractive. They are easy to get off and on, which is important as I've washed them several times. Despite the many washes the covers are holding up nicely. My son's crib is white and the covers match pretty well. I high recommend these rail covers.",

      "text": "My LO was using her crib railing as a teether, which damaged her crib and even more troubling meant that she was getting a mouthful of paint. I ordered two of these and they have been a great buffer. I also like the way that it looks (since I like to keep her nursery pretty minimal.) I only wish it was a little cheaper to buy 2, since I'd imagine the majority of people want to cover both railings (or is my baby the only one who isn't partial to one side?)",

EASY to install (maybe 10 minutes on two cribs for all 6 pieces) and they actually look halfway decent! Was nervous the side pieces weren't going to fit because the wood gets thicker, but they work.
