However, I also have a Canon 40mm pancake lens which is about one quarter the price but is also sharp and f/2.8, so this item is not good value. Carl Zeiss think they can sell their name for twice the price of other brands. When Sigma and Tamron get into this market, they may need to think again.",

There are only two problems you might have with it: - it's only f2.8 (there are brighter lenses out there, but those are more expensive and generally much larger) - it has a funky hood. First off, mine separated into two parts, but I just glued it back together. The next possible problem is that the filter size of this hood is tiny, and you can't use the built-in filter threads of the lens while the hood is on. I've had it since the beginning with my A7S and NEX-7, and had zero issues with it other than the hood.",
