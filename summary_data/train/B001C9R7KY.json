Then this Triple Paste AF cream came in the mail 1 hour ago. I am finally completely comfortable and essentially symptom free.

I had to cut the end off so I could dip my finger in to get more out of the tube. I kept using it for several days after cutting it open. It has not dried out. It would be better if this came in a wide plastic jar. That would make it easier to get all of the product out of the container.",
