More importantly, even my untrained eye could spot that they were correcting my overpronation. There was a visible difference. And no aches and pains in the aftermath like I usually have. I'll come back and update once I put some more miles on them, but I have high hopes that these shoes will make my half marathon training more comfortable and safer. 6/12/16: After several more runs, still loving these shoes. While so still get some tenderness in my right calf, my knee and hip pain are basically gone. These shoes really do the job the are supposed to.",
