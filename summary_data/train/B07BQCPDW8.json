      "text": "First off, it is only because of Princeton Tecs abhorrent customer service I am writing this review. Back to back Apex Pro units had black plastic debris floating behind lenses and sealed within the unit, sealed in the box and purchased from Amazon. Tim in Princeton Tecs customer service related their firm had no resolution as it was not purchased direct, and did so on May 26 2020, in a matter of fact manner. He threw Amazon completely under the bus, who was fantastic, and I would completely avoid Princeton Tec. Honestly, it\u2019s absolutely, subpar hyped junk.",

The headlamp is comfortable, but it goes through batteries super quick. I use the headlamp to walk my dogs at night and I have needed to replace the batteries almost monthly. I have spent about 40$ on batteries in the last 4 months. Maybe I just got a defected headlamp? I would like a replacement and wish I had acted sooner to return it.",
