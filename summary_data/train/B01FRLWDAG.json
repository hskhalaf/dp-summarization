I had a harvest like this picture every 1-2 weeks, which was life changing. Froze the extras and use them all the time! I am never going back to dry herbs again. GET THIS KIT! easy enough for anyone who has a windowsill!!! Strong herbs you can smell from across the yard. Also since they are heirloom they easily produce seeds so I collected many for the years to come and to give away! I have probably 3000 cilantro seeds and 1000 basil seeds from these plants.

They're fairly new and I'm guessing that's why they're not certified USDA organic yet. It takes many years and lots of money to do so. The company makes a great product that has a minimum shelf life of 20yrs. It's a must buy for people who stock up or even the every day gardener. Seriously, I was not paid.
