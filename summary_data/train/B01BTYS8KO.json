My kid loved it but I hope it will last until she'll get tired of it. Overall I'll recommend buying it",

However, we did not use the mask that came with the costume because we previously bought the hard plastic mask (which I highly recommend) and that is what he wanted to wear. The two strips of velcro do a pretty good job of holding the tail on while also making it easy to remove for sitting/car seat purposes. I would definitely recommend for any PJ Masks loving kid.",

My two major complaints are: 1) Only worn twice and the velcro that holds the tail on the back has come completely off so the tail no longer attaches. 2) The body of the costume fits great but the mask portion is HUGE. Half the time my son does not want it on because the eye holes fall below his nose making it extremely difficult for him to see. Overall I think there really needs to be more effort put into re-enforcing the velcro and measurements on fabric or perhaps using a different type of fabric for the mask.",

The stitching at the bottom of the opening is loose and looks like one quick tug, and it's going to come open completely. Once on, it seems okay. He had on a thicker, long sleeve shirt and a pair of track pants, so maybe it'd have more room with thinner clothes. It can be chilly in the Midwest come Halloween though, so hopefully it will fit by then.",

I like that the mask isn't just a slip-over-your-face mask but actually a little hat-type mask that goes over his head, too. That makes it easier for him (having just turned three) to put it on himself and he likes the independence. ***Update--we have had it for about two months now and the material has gotten several runs in it, so that's disappointing. My son still loves it but it's not as durable as I'd hoped.",
