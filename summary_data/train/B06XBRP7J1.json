The unit is sturdy and the food secure. So far so good, and we are pleased! Be sure to calculate the amount of food your pet needs. Each portion is 24ml, which is equal to .1 cup. So if your pet eats 1/3 cup, you need to schedule 3 portions at that feeding.",

I'm not sure if they got through the bottom or the top, but there were bugs of various sizes swarming in and around the feeder. We had this feeder for almost exactly a year before this issue arose, so maybe the product deteriorated over time. Threw it away immediately and won't be trying an automatic feeder again - I'd rather deal with the cat waking me up in the morning than the roaches!",

With the old feeder they figured out how to stick a paw into the dispenser to effectively eat whenever they wanted. They have been unsuccessful at breaking into this one so far. I also switched to a larger sized kibble -- Science Diet, to slow them down. So far they have both slimmed down considerably and no longer beg to be fed constantly.",

We also had to use a separate plug-in timer to set the feedings. This does not suffer from any of those problems, so it's a major upgrade. Properly cleaning the detachable food storage bin does take some time (hard-to-reach spaces require air drying), meaning you'll have to hand-feed or schedule your cleaning to avoid a hangry pet.",
