I decided to try this to see if a less expensive product would give equally good results, and the answer (at least regarding CoverGirl) is no. This pencil is actually somewhat painful to apply because it doesn't draw on easily and requires several heavy passes to get a decent looking line. But once it's on, it's not going anywhere... I have to scrub at my eyes with makeup remover to get this stuff off. My eyes do not thank me. I haven't tried the blending feature at all, so I can't comment on that aspect.",
