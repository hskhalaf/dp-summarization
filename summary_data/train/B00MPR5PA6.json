They also don\u2019t taste the same - these are oddly synthetic tasting, the proper ones are not. It\u2019s entirely possible that fakes are being sold on amazon - the printed images on the packaging as well as the writing looks like it either sat in the sun for awhile, or else was printed on an low quality printer - see attached images (left is fake, right is genuine).

Now it's hard as a rock when you bite it and taste flat. Not worth it anymore unless they changed it back to what it used to. Update: I contacted MusclePharm about the issue with the protein bar and they sent me a replacement that isn't the bad ones. They also said that they haven't changed the formula, so seems like these were just bad batch or really old bars. So if you're getting a bad one that's really hard to bite just contact them and they will send you a replacement.",

I don't know why, but they've recently changed the recipe and they don't taste anywhere near as good as before. I finished the box, but only because I didn't see the point in returning the product sans one protein bar.

I think if you\u2019re really worried about macros and the ratio of protein to carbs and fat, you may be better off with a powder, but this is my go-to when it comes to bars. I use them after early morning heavy lifts while I get ready for work or just eat it when I get to work. But if I\u2019m just doing cardio or lighter lifts I stick to whole food sources and track to make sure I have enough protein for the day. Cookie dough is my favorite flavor by far!",
