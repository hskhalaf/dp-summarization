There is still space under the compact. It was just disappointing that there was so very little blush in the tiny compact. I returned it.

I wont subtract a star for that, but people should know that you will get a tiny disk of blush, with no compact/mirror/or brush. It is just a small pot of color. I think the size is fine overall, since make up shouldn't be kept forever, and there is only so much blush one can use at a time. This color is nice on my light toned skin. It would build color easily. I say I have to go with a minimal amount in my swipe, but someone else could benefit from a few swipes and still look like a natural flush.",

With a good brush, it's creamy consistency is easy to build the sheerness or intensity of color you like. Unfortunately, it isn't the color I was looking for. I read ALOT of reviews which called \"Creation\" a plum shade, which I was looking for. It is a bricky- peach shade, which to me, doesn't compliment my \"summer \" color, light complexion. Sometimes it's hard to buy cosmetics online, I hope someday all the colors on our computers are lifelike !",
