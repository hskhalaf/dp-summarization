He seemed pretty excited every time I filled his bowl. I feel odd leaving a five-star review of the flavor, but I think that's what B would say. The scent was not overpowering or offensive at all. Value for money? Yes, it costs more, but for a happy tummy and less vomit to clean up, I'll gladly pay. Finally, please enjoy this picture of Mr. Barkley. I know your day is better for having seen his cute face.",

Though my kittens were playful and affectionate, they were also very stinky due to excessive flatulence. I suspect the soy and grain products in the Purina kibble were contributing to this problem. After upgrading to Merrick's soy and grain-free \"Purrfect Bistro\" kibble, their flatulence subsided and I'm enjoying their cuddles much more! They're playful growing boys with no digestive problems since I made the switch. I think this product is worth the extra money.",

This second order was even more smooshed than the first bags. I would guesstimate that at least 2-3 inches of the kibble arrived as ground up dust. So I will go back to ordering this and all other dry food from Chewy. This food is too expensive to throw away due to poor quality control on Amazon's part.",

They put a hard cover book with no protection into a large box with this bag of cat food, so it tore the bag open, making cat food spill out and get oils all over the box and my book.

My kittens are healthy and grain free, I will stick with this catfood! so if youre looking for quality try a bag of Merrick, I have nothing but praises for this company",

Saves me a side trip to pet store. I consistently buy this from Amazon. Our car seems to like it and is a healthy eater and decent weight but he's an active indoor/outdoor cat.",
