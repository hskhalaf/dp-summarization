Fellowes also makes a professional version 12.5\" size of this laminator. I have both and they both work great. The primary difference between the two is the size. The 12.5\" version will handle larger items and therefor has a much larger footprint on a table or countertop. For most standard uses, however, this model should be sufficient.",
