      "text": "I am so disappointed in these. They claim to be for freezing, heating, and storing but I froze food for my 6 mo old overnight and in the AM dropped one on the counter (less than a ft drop) and it shattered! Not the quality I was expecting from this brand. I emailed the company but no one has gotten back to me. Very disappointing. If you are a multi-tasking mama and can\u2019t afford to be extra careful with these, skip them and buy something more durable. EDIT: The company did respond to my email and are sending me a replacement! I will definitely give them another shot because they are such a convenient size.",

I bought two orders at the same time thinking they would be perfect... all of them GARBAGE. All in the trash!!",

They're good whenever we have some 2oz leftover food. We found a better system by just using Mason jars and serving the portions that we need each meal. The quality of the product is great, it's good material and it freezes without a problem. If I could change anything I'd probably just get a bigger size.",

It\u2019s not that hard to get out and you could use a butter knife if your fingernails are really short or weak. The inner piece of the lid has indentations in two sides. I\u2019ve found that the lid snaps onto the container more easily if I line up the indentations with snap sides of the outer ring, rather than doing it the other way.",
