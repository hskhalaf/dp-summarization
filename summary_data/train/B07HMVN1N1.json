This is evident with the use of perforated leather and flexible mesh in a much lighter and ventilated package. The subtle tweaks on the New Balance 696v3 provide improved shock absorption and comfort. It continues to gain traction on the hard court for an extremely budget-friendly cost.",

Every time I wear them to play (1-2hours) my toes are either raw or sore after each use. I kept thinking I just needed to break them in but after about 8-10 tries my toes and the toe box of shoe just isn\u2019t giving in and have decided to give up on this shoe which was disappointing. It did give me great support and traction on Court just don\u2019t need the sore and/or raw toes.",

It is like it is not the perfect fit or shape of the foot. Instead I gave a try to another brand shoe which I dont need to mention here and oh man, what a difference, perfect fit of the foot and great comfort, I should have quit using the New Balance from the beginning.",
