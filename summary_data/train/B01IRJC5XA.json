Joint pain, you name it, I was experiencing it. I didn't want to take a thyroid medication for life. So, I tried Thyroid Support. Within 2 weeks I was sleeping much better. I had no more scalp itching or body twitching at night ( which I also suffered with). Within 2 months, I had hair growth! I will continue taking this forever.
