First the locking mechanism on one leg failed almost crashing my d500. Then a month later the riser for the head failed and won't lock. Horrible quality. Do not buy. Save your money and get a different tripod. Stuck with an expensive paperweight now.",

They send me a link that directed me to a Financial institution, not the product itself. So, I am stuck with this defective product and a terrible service by Amazon. Not sure if I want to recommend this product to anyone thanks to the service I got.",

Fortunately I was able to catch it and no damage was done to my camera or lens. But now I can't lock the legs for the tallest use. It looks like the stops are made of plastic; very poor decision for one of the most fundamental pieces of a tripod.",

When added to a loaded camera bag it weighs it down a bit. Overall very happy with it, but this will not be my travel tripod for hikes.

Edit: note that the plates are not compatible with the common Arca Swiss standards. This hasn't been an issue, unless you buy a mounting accessory that requires such compatibility.",

      "text": "I've owned this tripod for a couple of years. I've used it on the beach, in the salty Atlantic ocean, in mountain streams, and even Iceland! It is ROCK solid and has yet to fail me once. People want carbon, not sure i'd use a carbon tripod over this one even if it was given to me. This weighs less, and costs less, than a lot of the carbon \"leaders\". Why pay $800+ for a carbon tripod that weighs 2lbs+ more than this tripod? This tripod meets my landscape and travel photography needs nicely.",

Pros: Big, heavy, solid. A great economy, quality tripod for beginning to intermediate photographers. I think a lot of pros would be happy with this too. Cons: Big and heavy, not for backpacking a long ways",

It feels solid (not quite as solid as a heavy-duty wildlife tripod, but you shouldn't even be looking at tripods at this price point if you want that). I use my tripod rarely, but when I do, it needs to be able to measure up to the options that I need. This does. My rig consists of a Canon 7D with a 24-105mm lens. It holds it just fine.",
