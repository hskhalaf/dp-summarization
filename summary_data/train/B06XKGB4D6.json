I used it on my gas stove with no problems and it's easy to clean; all the parts fit together well and are easy to take apart. Great price for excellent product and service.",

The teapot is a 5 but the lack of quality in all four cups; and the fact that I would not serve tea to guests would give this an overall 2 star rating. Disappointing.",

The infuser basket has super small holes so nothing falls through and is high quality. It has a little handle so you can move it around while it brews. The handle doesnt get hot. I just put a little water in, put it in the microwave, put in the infuser, and put a little loose tea in. Soooo easy.",

I love watching the water boil and the built in diffuser is exactly what I've been looking for in a tea kettle. Its really convenient that its both stovetop safe and microwavable. The only issue ive had is the handle gets hot and it makes it difficult to hold the pot but that's to be expected and easily remedied. Also, the 80ml tea cups only holds enough for about a sip but that's not bad if you're sharing a whole pot of tea with a few people. Despite these two minute issues I give this product five stars.",

The little matching teacups are adorable but I really didn't need more cups. Wish there was the option to buy just the teapot without the cups. I haven't tried to diffuser yet, but it looks really nice and seems easy to insert and remove. All in all, very happy with it.",
