      "text": "Brought these after they come highly recommended by a friend and wow was he right! These are brilliant, the most conformable shoes I've ever owned. They feel like walking bare feet but have just the right amount of sole to make walking over rough ground comfortable. Think I will be wearing these a lot more than I expected when I bought them. Only small downside is they feel a little to big. I brought in my normal size 9 and they feel like a size 9.5 but to be honest it doesn't affect anything comfort wise. Cannot recommend them enough!!",
