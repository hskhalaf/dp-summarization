The ends of the hose (about 3 feet from the ends) started turning black within a month of use and they spewed out some black substance that stained my shirt. After that mess they worked fine until it burst while I was using it yesterday. Seemed like a decent value at $89 for 100feet and two years use. I have a 50 footer, just waiting for it to fail at this point too. I store the hoses coiled up, drained, and indoors, so not sure how to make them last longer.",

Yes it is stiffer than the other hoses I've bought. O-rings,couplers,and plugs can be found at most hardware and home improvement stores. Also to mend a blown hose your nearest parker store will do that,they have fitting and hose ends also",

      "text": "I bought this pressure hose because of the price. Being so cheap, I figured that it would not be great but I had to give it a shot. The quality of this hose is disappointing as it has already started leaking from the end connections after only a few months. The hose itself is turning black from the inside due to the metal jacket inside coming apart and water seeping out and started to do this after only a few uses. I use this hose a couple times a week which is probably more than most people, but I would say to avoid this hose unless you only use it maybe once or twice a month.",
