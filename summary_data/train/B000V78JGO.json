If I had to strip 6 ears, I would simply dump the corn out of the chamber as needed by either inverting and shaking the corn out, or by opening the device which is pretty easy to do. It's so much safer than stripping corn from the cob with a knife, which is what I used to do before. Probably not the stripper of choice for a restaurant, bot works great for the average size family.",

The corn stripper does get the corn off the cob pretty well, but catching the corn is iffy. It catches most of the corn, but there is still corn that escapes. The clear, curved plastic part comes off easily during stripping. Maybe it's my form rather than the device, but it's still frustrating. Overall, there is less mess than cutting with a knife, but don't expect it to be perfect.",
