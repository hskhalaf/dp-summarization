Since 4x5 files are usually 500mb+ in my experience, working on a slow drive is frustrating. With this I can do all kinds of edits and not have any lag whatsoever. And saving is incredibly fast!!! I highly recommend this product to anyone in the creative industry that works with large files!!!",

Yes, cheaper--but it froze my machine and I had to return it. The Seagate freezing is a known issue with numerous web references and no ready remedy. 3) However, know that after each connection/reconnection of this and other Thunderbolt drives, you will probably need to re-enter your MS Office 2011 activation key. What a pain! More info here--MS is not currently (Aug 12) supporting Thunderbolt: [...]",

You end up saving yourself 400$ and you can get a Samsung 840 SSD which is by far the most reliable SSD on the market with its Tri Cell technology.",
