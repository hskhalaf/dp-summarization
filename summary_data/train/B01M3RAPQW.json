      "text": "Love these gloves! I now have two pair. The smallest size I bought for my daughter that just turned 3 and they are still pretty big on her. These gloves stretch, and are thin, but 100 times better than a stretchy glove because of the fabric they are made out of is warmer and they don't get wet as quickly in snow. It is impossible for my 3 and 4 year olds to wear regular gloves, their fingers are too small. These are perfect!",
