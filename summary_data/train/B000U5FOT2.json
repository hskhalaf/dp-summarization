If you want to use odd number of panels you have to buy an accessory from their website, also that does not come with free shipping. We already pay a premium to buy this gate why not provide the \"Harware package\" with the product, since they have advertised this as \"fully adjustable\"? I'll be returning this product as this is not what I was expecting after going through all the trouble to find out that I need the \"hardware package\". Disappointed!",

We don't want to always put him in his crate, if he is getting into mischief, but need to confine him to a safe area, & still allow him to play. We purchased a Classic Rib Doormat 36\"x48\" @ Ocean State Job Lot for $10 to put under it (in case of puppy accidents). We set it up 4'x26\" rectangle which accomadates the mat. It is very sturdy & our Houdini pup has not escaped yet. Updated 11-8-15 with pictures regarding measurements. Hope this helps.",

My hope is that the puppy will be trained before he gets big enough to try to knock them down on his own, so I\u2019m not planning to use wall attachments at this time. They are very substantial and with bends in them for upright sturdiness, barely even wiggle when opening the walk through gates, which are a must. They have not moved at all.....Kind of pricey but totally worth the piece of mind with the puppy training!",

It keeps our dogs away from the baby\u2019s play area upstairs. We had to buy the additional panels so at almost $150, this was a very expensive play yard. However- based on what my friends have and the other gates I\u2019ve seen, this one is by far the best. If you want quality and you have the money to drop.... go for it.",

Just open the panel and walk right in.",

A word of caution for anyone who might have trouble picking things up - it is on the heavier side. That can be expected for something so large and built to be sturdy, but just thought I would mention it.",

It doesn't allow pets to get out when that happens, just that you would have better peace of mind if it did and less annoyance to play with it to make sure it is locked well.",
