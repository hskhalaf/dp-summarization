The shoe was a size 10 and I maxed out the stretcher. Left in for 5 days. Tried the shoe on & stretched out the toe area for 2 days. Didn\u2019t use any stretching spray. The shoes now fit perfect. Just broken in. Careful not to over stretch. Easy enough to check the fit every 24 hrs. Next are my heeled shoes.",

This is a rather firm shoe and I have to redo it a couple times and I left the stretcher for several days. I know it seem like a lot but I am saving a wonderful pair of shoes. I love the strecthers.
