      "text": "I confess I had trouble setting this product up. And I could not identify all the accessories this product came with (the instructions did not indicate what they were either). The B&O website was very unhelpful, as was the instruction manual the product came with. However, once my brother figured it out and set it up for me, it worked really well and was so comfortable. I wish it came with a better storage/folding option because these would be great for travel, but I think would get really damaged in a backpack or purse. Five star product, one star off for bad instructions.",

      "text": "I have been used to my other Active Noise Cancellation headphones (BOSE). These B&O are very comparable, and the sound is pretty amazing for headphones. Anything I get anymore is active noise equipped, because it just makes such a big difference in sound quality. Yes, these are expensive, but the ANC works unlike some of the cheaper units that only claim ANC but don't deliver. Overall, I am happy with these and they will reside upstairs so I can quit hauling my BOSE up and down.",

And that they come off of my head because the piece goes on your ear not around it and that is a problem with me",

Annoyed to spend so much on this when I could have paid half the price for a brand that actually worked.",
