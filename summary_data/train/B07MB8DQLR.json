I emailed Black Diamond customer support with my issue and they suggested the Astro 175. It was just the ticket. Broad clean consistent pattern with no hot spots or yellow rings and a few bucks cheaper. If you're looking for a good usable no frills headlamp, this might be your huckleberry.",

The beam is concentrated in a 8 foot wide by12 feet ahead arc and is still light enough beyond that to pick up rattlers (3 this month) for another 6 feet on either side beyond the 8 foot arc . The head band is comfortable and easy to adjust. I hope it is made in the US, although they do have a production facility in China.",

When it does turn on I can slightly tap it and it goes right back off. Save your money and buy something more reliable...",
