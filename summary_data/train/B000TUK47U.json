But once you do, it is a much more comfortable position for a great deal of typing. Keep in mind that the curved shape may take up more room that a conventional keyboard. I have a keyboard shelf on my desk and it just fits. If your current keyboard is snug, this might not fit. I love that it has a ten key and a touchpad for when I need them. No regrets on this at all.",

Without this keyboard with built in touchpad I would have had to have surgery on my wrists -- I'm on the key board all day long without any pain. Not everyone feels comfortable using the split keyboard and touchpad -- but it's absolutely wonderful. I just hope they will continue to make since I wear them out every 3-4 years. Thanks for a great product!! E",

I suffer from neck and back issues and the repetitive lateral motion related to the use of a traditional mouse causes me great pain within an hour. I highly recommend the use of this keyboard to anyone that experiences pain related to neck, shoulder or wrist injuries made worse by a traditional keyboard and mouse.",

I added an extra star due to the seller being cool and for quickly responding to my concerns. I think this keyboard could work well for small kids, for learning to type or as a play keyboard.",
