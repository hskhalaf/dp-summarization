The bike is wonderful, thus far I can\u2019t fault it.. looks and feels very strong.. it\u2019s faster than my last scooter.. The people I was dealing with seem a very honest company who went out of their way to help with my concerns. I would recommend this scooter and company without reservation.",

However, the parking brake is a little bit hard to operate for an older person, the initial moving off can be difficult if you are on an incline, more often the machine will jump (Refinement on the stat would be an advantage and perhaps the rear brake could be fitted to use the foot.) I find that there is a lot to do for the hand specially the left one baring in mind that the driver usually a disabled person.",

      "text": "Arrived 10 days early so wasn't prepared to take delivery. Found small dent in the back after delivery man left. Queried whether it should have had a seat belt, had two replies, one saying it shouldn't and one saying that no vehicle leaves them without seat belts. It is not possible to change KPH to MPH which is annoying. Haven't been able to use it as I can't engage the hand brake - it's too stiff. No proper manual, just a load of photocopied sheets which have no numbers and are impossible to put in sequence. On reflection I wish I had been able to see the scooter before purchasing but, being housebound, this wasn't possible.",

If you drive a car, you can handle this, but otherwise I would choose one that is less complex, maybe a class 1. I think it\u2019s wonderful. It can go up to 30 miles per charge, and is great on kerbs and dropped pavements. Thoroughly recommended with the provisos above.",

It is comfortable, looks smart and performs very well. Excellent lighting. Storage over the 2 lockers is reasonable, although not quite enough for a week's shopping. There is a steering lock for security. I added a motion sensor (from Amazon, \u00a312 very reasonable and effective.) Couple of minor queries answered promptly. Overall very satisfied and happy to recommend.",

To be clear, the machine is amazing but it was the logistics that caused me concern and initial stress. The product didnt arrive when promised nor did I get the \u2018training\u2019 the was promised on delivery. I can tell you that the owner of the business has gone above and beyond my expectations to correct them personally and, went on to explain why he had issues and what he has done to solve them for all. I appreciated that. The delight of having the machine and some personal service makes the initial pain of delivery and training go away. Highly recommend the product.",

This scooter is extremely fast, the full allround suspension and large wheels make its handling a dream. The turning circle is ok for such a large and powerful machine, but not the best. Storage is great, better than other scooters out there, with the back box and under seat storage. It has a usb charging point for your phone/ipod too. The lights (high/low beam), indicators and break lights are excellent, very bright. Fantastic machine and half the price that a mobility shop would charge you.",
