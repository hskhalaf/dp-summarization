      "text": "More difficult than previous LEGO offerings. Harder puzzles that sometimes require a walkthrough to figure out. HOWEVER, the overall gameplay is outstanding and the customization feature alone is worth the price. I was bummed when I first started the game only to find that I could only assign a few skills to my custom-created villain. But then, in the middle of the first mission, I ran across a device that added a superpower to my character. Game on! I love the inclusion of some RPG elements in this game. My character now has about a dozen skills/powers that I can swap out as I please. Oh! And the kids love this game too! Good family fun! (Yes...I'm the gamer dad.)",
