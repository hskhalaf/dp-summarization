      "text": "I generally like Sabian cymbals and have played plenty of them over the last 20 or so years. At $65 I didn\u2019t expect too much out of the sound (though it wasn\u2019t bad for an inexpensive cymbal). I did however expect it to last more that the three or so months until it cracked in two places. Obviously this isn\u2019t a cymbal for gigs or recording, but apparently it isn\u2019t even worth the coin for practice a few times a week either. My advice, stay away from this dud and spend a little more scratch on something that will last a little longer in the rehearsal room.",

    "description": "A CLASSIC DUAL PURPOSE CYMBAL AT A SMART PRICE!\nDelivering both a full-sounding ride and a penetrating, heavy crash, the SABIAN 18\u201d SBr Crash Ride offers unmatched versatility at a price point that is sure to fit any budget. If this is your first kit, the SBr 18\u201d Crash Ride offers the tonally tight sounds only SABIAN Brass can deliver. It\u2019s the ideal first step for drummers looking to get into their first set of quality cymbals at a great value. With a wide range of models to choose from, SBr is easy to get into. We believe that it's not a question of where you finish \u2212 it's where you start. And with SBr, you're on the perfect track to get to where you want to go.\n\n18\" SBr Crash Ride offers unmatched versatility at a price point that is sure to fit any budgetView larger Features hand-guided, high-pressure hammering and traditional hand lathing for quality.View larger WHERE YOU BEGIN MATTERS\nLet\u2019s face it \u2013 at this price point, most manufacturers refuse to put their logo on the starter cymbals they manufacture. But the medium weight and classic profile of this popular model, along with the Sabian logo, lend it instant credibility. And it looks the part too, with deep, large-peen hammering and pinpoint lathing \u2013 the same hand-guided, high-pressure hammering and hand lathing that Sabian lavishes on its expensive bronze cymbals. As a result, the decay is fast so you can crash-ride it with confidence, and the bell has a powerful sound \u2013 not unlike a much more expensive bronze bell. Stick response is clean and the sound is always lively.\n\nSABIAN SBR \u2013 THE BEST BRASS!\nWhere you begin as a drummer is important. For that reason, SABIAN has designed SBr cymbals to make your first steps easy and enjoyable. Hammered and lathed, SBr cymbals deliver the tightly focused sounds of pure brass \u2013 at a very nice price. And they are available in popular models and sizes. Responding to a universal demand for quality cymbals at all price points, SABIAN introduced SBr in 2009 as a new series of brass cymbals designed to offer improved quality and value for entry level drummers. Produced from a special-formula brass alloy in the SABIAN Vault, the budget-priced SBr is available in a full range of popular sizes and models, each featuring deep, large-peen hammering and pinpoint lathing.\n\nCRAFTED IN THE SABIAN VAULT\nSABIAN Master Product Specialist Mark Love was instrumental in the launch of the popular Brass series: \u201cSBr offers a new, higher quality of brass cymbal and sound for beginner drummers and students. Despite their budget price, SBr cymbals are designed as value-added cymbals that set a new standard of quality at this price point. To guarantee this level of quality, SBr cymbals feature the same hand-guided, high-pressure hammering and traditional hand lathing applied to more expensive professional cymbals. \u201d\n\nSONICALLY MATCHED \u2013 ONLY FROM SABIAN\nWhen you get into drumming, it\u2019s not a question of where you\u2019ll finish \u2013 it\u2019s where you start. With SBr, you can be confident your sound is powered by pure SABIAN brass. And you\u2019ll sound even better when you choose a \u201cSonically Matched\u201d set containing cymbals hand-selected by the experts in the SABIAN Vault. The SABIAN 18\u201d SBr Crash Ride is available in the SBr 2-Pack along with 14\u201d SBr Hats. It\u2019s just one more example of SABIAN\u2019s dedication to players seeking affordable quality in their first cymbal purchases.\n\nDeep, large-peen hammering & pinpoint lathing give this SBr a look and sound well beyond its price. \n\nPRODUCT FEATURES\n * An effective dual-purpose cymbal for discerning beginners \n * Designed and crafted in the SABIAN Vault \n * Ideal for full-sounding riding or heavy crashing \n * Clean stick response, with lively bell \n * Professional large peen hammering and pinpoint lathing \n * SABIAN Brass delivers tightly-focused sound \n * Smartly and affordably priced for any budget \n * Where you begin matters \u2013 Play the best brass! \n * Quality protected by SABIAN 1-Year Warranty",
