The expeditors fit straight out of the box, super comfortable and extremely well put together. They are not the current fashion which is a bit loud and brash, but discreet and unobtrusive which suits me. The soles are very well treaded and made of soft enough rubber to actually grip, they are also firm enough to walk over broken ground while are just as happy on tarmac. Overall an excellent walking shoe....highly recommended.",
