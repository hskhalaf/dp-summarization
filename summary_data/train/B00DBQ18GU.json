I've used both the pulse options and the various other blending options, and all work beautifully. The pitcher is very stable on the blender motor, and there is no way anyone can shake it around (as some people are tempted to do).

I suspect there was a manufacturing issue with the coating or the metal itself. We did get this issue replaced under warranty, but were told at that time they would NOT fix anything again if it broke (I don't get that customer service??). So, of course, a few months later the mechanism that locks the pitcher in place failed, so now it \"flops\" around without locking and effectively renders the whole blender worthless. I will never buy this blender again, and probably not a Kitchen Aid based on the poor customer service experience I had.",

Good power and easy to use, with the added bonus of the pulsing for the Ice blending feature. Reduced down to 3 stars as the blade bearing failed. Liquid can get down into the bearings and leak out the sides and if its acidic it will destroy the bearings. It is a bad design which is why they stopped selling it. Do not buy one.",

Sometimes I'm never sure if the pitcher part is locked into place with the bottom part before I start it, but this blender is very good in that regard. It blends superbly so far.",

I just seen it in the macys catalog for almost $200. Same model. I got such a great deal! Now I see it for $88 and up on here. I'm glad I got it when I did.",
