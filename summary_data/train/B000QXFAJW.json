      "text": "Recently purchased these for my five year old boy who HATES wearing shoes because they always hurt his feet. I've tried Chucks, Vans, off-brand and finally decided to give the Samba's a try... They are SO easy to get on his foot (I'd literally struggle for 10-15 minutes with shoes going over the heel properly until these) and they stay tied throughout the day. They have also withstood two weeks of Kindergarten boy play and still look new! Not a single complaint from him since he's been wearing these daily. They are true to size and even fit on wider feet and STILL no issues going on. Will definitely be buying again. Great purchase, great value and great price!",

      "text": "The best attribute of the adidas Samba is that it is extremely durable. Much of that durability is linked to its 100% leather construction. Of particular note is the suede toe area, which bears the brunt of much soccer-related activity. The shoes that were delivered to me were not leather. They are mostly vinyl, with some sort of odd synthetic material in place of the toe. The supposed-to-be suede toe areas were cut to visibly different sizes on the right and left shoe. Further, the material that was used in place of suede proved to be extremely cheap. The shoe was worn in the rain once, whereupon the fake suede material promptly ripped.",

They have done a good job, showing little wear after a few months of everyday wear on a five-year-old boy. He says they are \"cool\" and are comfortable enough that he wears them all day without complaint. He has always had wide feet, so we were glad to find a comfy shoe that we didn't have to order in extra wide. I love that they go with pretty much any outfit. When he outgrows these, we will be buying another pair in the next size up!",

Do not buy if your kid's feet are even slightly chubby or a \"little\" wide. For comparison, he wears 10.5 (little kid) Nikes; and these adidas 9.5 (little kids) fit the same. Don't like the rather stiff sole. We've been bending the sole manually with our hands. Might even ask our teen to run over these shoes with the car a few times just to soften them up. Like the black which doesn't show dirt, and little guy gives a thumbs up.",

Our boys are so hard on their shoes, yet at this point when they are growing so quickly I strongly feel that they should be growing out of shoes before the are wearing out shoes we are paying decent money for. Our boys are 10, 8, and 5 and I plan on buying these shoes again when they outgrow them.",
