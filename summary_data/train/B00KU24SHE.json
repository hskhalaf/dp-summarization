I am also convinced that the mattress is too large for my bed. I ordered a queen size, but I can never align it with the mattress. Therefore, the mattress cover makes the bed uncomfortable, as a part is always hanging off the edge of the mattress. This purchase was a real disappointment and a real waste of $$$.",

      "text": "This basically deleted my arthritis hip pain! It feels like sleeping on a cloud. I thought it had a cooling strip on it, but I don\u2019t think so, but I use calling sheets to help with the heat during sleep. I can totally recommend it for hip arthritis and especially side sleepers. Some back sleepers may love it, too. If you have neck and shoulder strains and pains you may not like it as much unless you use a neck pillow because you sink in some some it leaves your neck crooked a little if on a too high pillow. Just an observation I noticed since I have both. Overall, great purchase though, I go to sleep smiling:)",
