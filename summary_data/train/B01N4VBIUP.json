Easy breezy to clean and NO matter what you cook, your food never sticks!! * only downside* I wish you didn't have to buy all the other stuff (which we never used). Only needed the pots' (and/or) pans' + the matching top/covers. << I did noticed my round frying pan had a small dent on the inside-Presently appears solely cosmetic & has had NO ill effect w/ cooking performance ^^so that is why I still gave 4-Stars \u2022Will update my review if this changes & spot becomes rusted >> I'm going to search for just the pan&cover set for my sister. Overall-FABULOUS item!!",

THE ONLY WAY THAT I CAN CLEAN THIS POT NOW IS TO SOAK IT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. (NOTE: I NEVER PUT THE PAN IN THE DISHWASHER OR USED ANY ABRASIVES ON IT).

Plus the inclusion of an Induction Cooking Steel Bottom which adds to the solid build and reduces the warping of the pot/pan bottom.

The large round pan cooking surface has already come off in places and is now useless for cooking. I would not recommend this product.",
