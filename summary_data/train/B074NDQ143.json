I wake up with no aches or pains and it's hard to stay awake once I lay on it. I love it and find myself counting down until I can go to sleep just because it's so comfortable!!!",

I've been warned these wear out earlier than traditional mattresses, if so I can buy 13 of these over the years and get sleep for the same amount of money and toss and turn.",

      "text": "I thought this was a 12\" mattress but it barely expanded to 10.5 after resting open and un used for 4 days. It expanded to that height within the first four hours but never exceeded that. Some areas measure less than 10\". Now the quality is great, very much a medium firm mattress if not more firm. Which takes getting used to but we planned on that. The benefit is the support and pain relief a firm mattress offers and that's apparent already. Just wish it was the height listed and as I purchased. May source another mattress from another company and hopefully it works better",

It\u2019s anywhere from 9\u201d to 10.5\u201d depending on where you measure. The corners are much lower than the middle. ~NOT \u201cmedium plush\u201d as advertised. More like firm to very firm. I have an Olee medium firm mattress that\u2019s softer than this one. ~Too hard for side sleeping ~The description says a queen weighs 80 lbs but the box says 65.8. Generally, heavier means better quality memory foam. Pros: ~very little motion transfer ~it doesn\u2019t cave in when u sit on the edge ~no smell ~fast delivery Seriously considering going through the hassle of returning it.",

Also, don't bother to try and call the warranty number listed on the receipt. They are a waste of time.",

I slept on the bed that night and my family had a hard time getting up this morning because it is so freaking comfortable and the right amount of firmness and softness.

Certainly wake up with less pain in the shoulders and neck. One small flaw... not enough to deduct a star... through the cover you can feel that the blocks of foam that were cut to make the mattress, the edges are rough and chunky instead of neatly sliced.

    "description": "Size:Queen| Style:Memory Foam Mattress OnlyGood mornings, good feelings, good times, good Vibe. \n\nThe Vibe 12-inch Gel Memory Foam Mattress combines two leading sleep technologies at an incredible value. Gel-infused memory foam keeps you cool during sleep and body-contouring memory foam reduces pressure points and properly aligns the spine. Gel draws heat away from the body and creates a cooler sleep surface and aids in preventing excessive tossing and turning so you can get a more restful night's sleep.

This can reduce pressure points and allow the spine to stay properly aligned in a neutral position. When you move in bed, memory foam gently 'fills in' and reshapes itself to your new sleeping posture and minimizes motion disturbance and transfers between partners. \n\nBenefits of Gel Memory Foam\n\nThe latest technology in gel memory foam mattress, this mattress is conforming, comfortable, and comes complete.
