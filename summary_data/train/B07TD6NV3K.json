And without breaking them in , wore them to Great North Run. What marvellous trainers , soft , smooth , light to run in, and most comfortable. I have got some decent pairs including nike vaporfly 4%. But id pick levitate 2 anyway over the former.",

Update: after over 500 miles I really started to love these shoes. But decided to try something else when it was time for a new pair, after a few hundred miles in my new pair I went back to these for one run and realised how much they suit my style of running. Just ordered another pair - after 20 years of running I can now say these are definitely my favourite.",

    "description": "Brooks Levitate 2 Running Shoes Strap in and get ready for the run of your life. Brooks is back with the most energy return running shoe in the business. The polyurethane foam encased in the thermoplastic skin delivers this exceptional ride that gives back more of the effort you put in. FitKnit Upper Using FitKnit upper, Brooks have designed the Levitate to work with you and your unique foot shape. The material will move with your every stride, providing you with both flexibility and durable versatility. The mesh that surrounds the upper is made from an extremely lightweight and breathable material. This means that as you begin to work, the warm air that will start to build up within the shoe will then be able to escape out of the shoe. Once removed, it is replaced with cooler air, which will leave you feeling fresh and ventilated. Sweat will also be removed out of the shoe, which will increase comfort. The toes are surrounded by thicker material which will prevent any bumps and knocks from causing damage. The rearfoot is also held in a firm and upright position by strong walls which will prevent it from slipping out of place and causing injury. Up the foot laces and a soft padded tongue will allow you to find a secure and comfortable fit every time. The ankle collar is also extremely soft, which will reduce the risk of discomfort and irritation from rubbing and chafing. DNA AMP Midsole Using Brooks' developed innovative DNA AMP, the foam found in the midsole will deliver long-lasting spring and bounce, helping push you further and faster. Towards the bottom of the sole, the EVA is shock absorbing and will prevent any heavy pressure from causing damage to the foot. The top half of the midsole, and in closest contact to the sole of the foot is extremely cushioned, ensuring that you will have smooth comfort in every step. The biggest benefit that the DNA AMP foam will provide is rebound and bounce back. Made from a soft, naturally expanding foam encased i",
