When copying large amounts of data, you will only be able to see write speeds of around 60MBps which is half of what older CMR technology drives do.

It did work on the one Windows 10 machine I tried it on so I guess if all your machines are Windows 10 you should be fine. I am not sure why this would make a difference as all my other passport drives work on all my machines. The drive itself is fast when it does work and not loud at all.",
