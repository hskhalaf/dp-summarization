But seriously, i think the 18 volts makes this vacuum an incredibly powerful, light-weight tool. I use it on vinyl AND carpets with great success.

I tried a different brand it only lasted 6 mo.was holding a charge. So I decided I would try the hoover again and try the commercial works fantastic has more suction but still has tipping problem.

The reviews match the described performance and quality. Purchased an extra battery to extend the long term battery charge cycles (it's the engineer in me). Pulled invisible dirt and dog hair right out of the carpet. We are going to ditch our corded upright and focus on a good canister vac for jobs requiring a hose and attachments. We've decided that this would be a perfect combination for household cleaning. Our home has mixed hard surfaces, carpet, and throw rugs.",

Sadly I just got off the phone with Hoover and I am 1 month past warranty. How did they know it would only last a year? Maybe for the price a year is good enough?",
