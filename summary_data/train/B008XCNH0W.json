I apply the SPF 20 concealer over brown spots which lightens them, then add a second layer over the darker ones, still a bit visible, but an improvement. The concealer never hardens in the container as a different brand has done. And the container has never broken as many make-up products can. No problems with breakouts or clogged pores. Always cleanse before bedtime! I also enjoy using BareMinerals lipsticks and glosses, blushes (Beauty and Lovely), lip liners (Electrified and Revved), and powders.",
