Once you peel off the paper portion of the label, you will be faced with the finest adhesive known to man. It will laugh at your meager attempts to remove the residue with something as mundane as Goof-Off. Neither is it phased by acetone, mineral spirits, or Shell's finest 87 octane gasoline! You will spend FAR more time trying to remove the adhesive than installing the switch. You will finally be faced with bitter defeat and install it with sticky residue to always remind you that you are not the infallible craftsman that you thought you were.",

Also, 2 of the 10 switches I received had numerous scratches on front which were not the result of shipping. Appear to have been returned and / or used based on volume of scratches.",
