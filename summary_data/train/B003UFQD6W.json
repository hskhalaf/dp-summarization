In comparison to drugstore primers, it falls short; it creates clumpy, spidery spikes when applied thickly and doesnt seem to do too much when applied lightly. However, it has been a decent compliment to a natural mascara.I would not pay nearly $30 bucks again, though, when a second coat of mascara does the same job.",
