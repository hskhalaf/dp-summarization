It was super easy to install and fit perfectly. There have been some comments that this is a tighter fit than the OEM Mopar but it went in nicely and is a bit more snug but not horribly. Ordered on a Saturday and got it delivered on Sunday with Prime even though I opted for two day shipping. Wow is all I can say!",
