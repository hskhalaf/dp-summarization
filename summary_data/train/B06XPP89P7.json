I guess one could learn to live with dents and scratches but I believe the manufacturer should use packaging to have the product arrive safely. The packaging contains absolutely zero protection between the outside walls of the carton and the aluminum frame. Therefore, if you're willing to accept dents and scratches this still might work out for you but I'm not interested in receiving a new product that looks like it's been used many times.",

It is sturdy enough to hold my product - those totes are filled to the brim with soap and glass jars. The handle folding down I can easily stash it away and it is light enough for me to lift and move by myself if needed.",
