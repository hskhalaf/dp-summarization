With the moto g the 2nd sim doesn't seem to receive as good as signal as the first, but the dropping out of signals so far has been acceptable. Both sims use the same carrier. I like the speed of the processor. I do believe I've found a good dual sim phone and can stop searching for any more. The price was also a plus.",
