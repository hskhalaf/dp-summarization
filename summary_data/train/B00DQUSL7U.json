What I love about these the most is the Mush footbed! If you've never worn Tevas with Mush before, what that basically means is that the footbed is super-cushioned-awesome, and over time, it starts to mold to the shape of your foot. Initially, the footbed stays pretty solid and flat, but the more you're on it, the more the Mush wears in and starts to adapt to your feet. You'll actually start to see little toe prints toward the front if you're wearing them a lot.",

So sad, another clothing item lost to the sad cheap side of the fashion industry. I would gladly pay more for a quality shoe. What is wrong with people?",

The multiple straps provide extra support as well as make them look a bit more dressy than typical flip-flops. These are the 3rd pair of brown ones i've owned and i'm excited to have them in black for the first time. I look forward to wearing both pairs out!",

      "text": "I've had a pair of Teva flip flops for at least 5 years. They aren't worn out, but after wearing them almost daily, they did lose a bit of cushioning (one of the great attributes of these flip flops, along with the good arch support). I've never had a more comfortable pair of sandals and the 2 new pair I received (in black and bracken colors) are the same high quality as my first pair. These are must-haves if you like sandals but need cushioned soles and arch support.",

Ideal for the beach, poolside or backyard play, this sandal is made with a soft yet sturdy nylon webbing in a cute criss-cross strap design that will hold the foot in place much more effectively than your average flip flop.

Founded in the early 1980's by a Colorado River guide, Teva pioneered the sport-sandal category. For more than 20 years on rivers, in canyons, and across the trails of the great outdoors, athletes and enthusiasts have traveled the globe comfortably and confidently in Teva footwear. Providing positive contributions to the world in which we play is at the core of everything Teva stands for.
