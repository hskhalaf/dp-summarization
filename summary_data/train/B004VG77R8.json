The Dragonfly 2 is much smaller and I do not think anyone will be concerned when I take it out of my pocket. Fit and finish are perfect and it is razor sharp.Update. I still love this knife, but because it is small and I am kind of klutzy I have lost two of them. I will probably order another one, but in the mean time I am using one of my Sage knives. They are big enough that I have never lost one.",

The big problem is the handle... it is made of FRN which is basically a plastic resin material and it bends and flexes when it shouldn't. It certainly doesn't feel like a quality handle compared to the steel blade. Spyderco should upgrade to G-10 for better durability and stability.",

Nice subtle wire clip holds it tight but doesn't scuff up pockets too badly, and doesn't advertise to the world that you've got a knife. Outstanding fit and finish.",

This may be the best small knife design ever- but it's not *too* small. You can do most every-day cutting tasks with it. It's a little short for food prep maybe, but I don't think lot of people do that with pocket knives.",

The others are pretty rad, and it feels REALLY good in the hand. You can choke up on the blade for fine cutting tasks and the over/under choils are nicely tractioned. Highly recommended!!!",

The lock back design means that one handed closing is a little difficult, and the speed is slow when opening. Overall this is a great EDC knife. For me, the price was a little steep for such a small knife, but if that is not a problem then this is an amazing knife.",

I like the serrated version with either H-1 or VG-10 steels for cutting anything quickly but the ZDP-189 is hard and RAZOR sharp. Scary sharp. Very comfortable to carry and probably won't frighten anyone when opening either. I would imagine some people would freak if I whipped out the Zero Tolerance.",

You pay something of a premium, but the combination of surprisingly excellent ergonomics and amazing edge retention from the ZDP-189 make it well worth the extra cost. The FRN handles take a lot of flak for feeling like cheap plastic, but the knife is more than sturdy enough. It's not an art piece, but that's fine. It's a highly functional tool, and from the moment I took it out of the box it felt familiar in the hand. Great ergos, great steel, and a tiny profile that disappears in your pocket - it's a winning combination.",
