Irritating moving around of focal point on AF. For the sort of camera it is, it needs to connect via WiFi and have a touch screen.",

    "title": "Ricoh WG-4 Silver 16Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom with 3-Inch LCD (Silver)",
    "description": "The WG-4 and WG-4 GPS offer outstanding waterproof performance - down to 45 feet underwater-and shock resistance against a fall from heights up to 6.5 feet. While inheriting the easy-to-hold, non-slip design of the previous lineup, they provide a choice of new body colors that stand out in the outdoors. They also feature such state-of-the-art developments as a large-aperture, four-times optical zoom lens (with the maximum aperture of F2.0 at the wide-angle end) and a high-sensitivity, back-illuminated CMOS image sensor to deliver high-quality, low-noise images - even in the water, at night and at indoor sports events where the subject is poorly illuminated. Other significant improvements have been made to upgrade the camera's operation and performance, including faster AF operation in macro shooting, improved image quality in underwater shooting, and the addition of the USER mode for instant recall of the user's favorite settings. An array of optional accessories are available to accommodate active outdoor photography. For instance, an adhesive mount and a handlebar mount are designed to securely fix the camera for hands-free shooting, allowing the photographer to take advantage of such movie recording features as a dual shake reduction system and Full HD movie recording (1920 x 1080 pixels).",
