Now i know why pediatrician does not recommend any pillow, and the best way is to let your baby sleep on different sides.

Nevertheless we will still be using it for the unforeseeable future and it\u2019s helped with her to not favor one side of her head-like all torticollis babies do.",

I use it when they\u2019re just laying around, in a car seat or any other place they will be for long periods of time. The only issue I have with this is the bottom portion of the pillow went flat pretty quickly. If your baby has a bigger head this pillow probably won\u2019t be good for you. It\u2019s great for my daughter that has a slightly smaller head tho.",

I dont use it for sleep due to the risk factor but she has started moving in her sleep a lot anyways so it wouldnt make a difference. I can see it being better for a stroller. Its not considered safe for a carseat so I wouldnt try that either.",

I don't worry as much putting my little one in his seat while I get some dishes done or fold laundry.
