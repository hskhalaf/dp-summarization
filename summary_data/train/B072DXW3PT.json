On the calendar page for May 2018, you have given an extra day to April. April does not have a 31st as you show. Sunday should be April 29th, and Monday should be April 30th. I know we all wish we had more time, but I almost schedule a truckload delivery on a day that doesn't exist! Hopefully, there are no more errors to be found.",

Cute calendar, but wish it actually had the whole year on it...especially if it's being sold in that actual month, and is sold with the label of \"January 2018 to December 2018\".
