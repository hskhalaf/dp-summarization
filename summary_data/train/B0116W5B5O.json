I know the dimensions are there on the site but until I sit in it myself it's hard to tell if I'll like it. Finally, the website advertises it as 400lb capacity. It's 350lb capacity.

The upholstery developed multiple huge ugly gashes 18\" long -- and it turns out the warranty for that is 1 year, not 10. The mechanism failed, and won't keep me upright. La-Z-Boy will send parts, but I can't disassemble the chair, tell them what's wrong, and reassemble it. Amazon's assembly person for my new chair said he could not fix the chair's mechanism.

I am not as heavy as the chair is built for and there is no reason for a caster to break so soon. This is the only reason I rated the chair a 4-star. Perhaps La-Z-Boy could invest in some casters that will hold the weight the chair is built for.",

So, it seems had already had scratches when it was packed in the box. Absolutely unacceptable for such expensive chair. Paid double the price of competition for quality I was expecting. I guess you have to order 3 chairs to assemble one great one, and return two with damaged ones. Assemble instruction not perfect. Hard to attach handles.

Also, the box/chair is fairly heavy, so unpacking the box and moving the pieces independently to the assembly location was helpful. This chair is on our second floor, so I assembled it upstairs. All pieces fit well and appeared to be of very good quality. The chair is very comfortable and I'm glad every time I sit down in it that I chose this chair. Love the chair!",
