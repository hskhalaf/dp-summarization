I won't be able to attest to the non-stick quality or ease of cleaning until I use them. I will update later.",

The only downside about this purchase experience is I was very confused about when to order. The \u201cin stock\u201d availability status changed daily. Finally after a week of watching I just decided to pre-order and it came in three days, even tho the in stock date was set after that. So you\u2019re reluctant to order based on that, I\u2019d say go for it anyway.",
