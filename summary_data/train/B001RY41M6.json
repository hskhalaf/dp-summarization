      "text": "I had a butterfly emerge from its chrysalis in December of 2017. I had brought it inside before it emerged because of the cold weather. The butterfly grew attached to me and refused to fly away. She flew in the house a little bit but always wanted to be in my hair or on my shoulder. She was like a pet. My little girl and I fell in love with her. When she died, I knew that she was very special and sent by God. So we purchased this beautiful box to keep her in. We absolutely love it! Thank you!",

And the box itself is sturdy enough that I don't have to worry about it being damaged if she drops it.",

Pretty disappointed little girl and I'm not too happy considering it was $30. In my opinion it is not worth the money and I would not recommend it because it is junk.",

The package of the actual product was dented on one corner but it did not cause too much cosmetic damage to the jewelry box itself. The butterfly is beautifully painted. There are drawers on all sides of the box, with the best part being the drawers don't fully pull out. The drawer stops right at the end. I like this because my youngest won't accidently pull out and dump the jewelry out. The butterfly design on the outside is very pretty. Not over the top gushing pink; which is what my daughter likes.",
