The handle is strong and no worries it will break. My only disappointment is that it doesn't say \"Yamaha\" anywere on the outside of the case. I do know someone else asked this question, and someone said it did have the logo on the exterior. The case is pretty \"plane Jane\" and no ID on it anywhere. This may be a plus for someone needing a bass case and is not using a Yamaha brand bass.",

      "text": "I'd bought the previous model ~3 years ago, and it was more than adequate. This version is much beefier, something you'll notice as soon as you swing open the cover. Apparently the case is very well reinforced and braced, because there is none of the sloppiness and twisting across the hinges you'd get with a cheaper case. The padding and material inside is super plush, as well. I'd trust this to protect a much more expensive guitar than any I've got!",

And it does. Perfectly. I've only had the cheaper old school cardboard type cases before. I used to get them for like $20 all day long. But this case, let me tell you.... is definitely worth the money! I'd feel comfortable throwing this thing in the truck bed and go camping and not even worry about my guitar. I'll probably be getting one for myself.",

It's less than a hard shell case, but more than a gig bag, and at the price it's a pretty good deal. Black, water resistant exterior; well attached handles (which unfortunately don't link together); a large zippered pouch will hold standard-sized music books, strap, and picks. Nylon zippers appear to be fairly heavy duty and well-attached. I gave one of these to an 8-year old, and it -- and the guitar -- are still intact, so that says something.",

I gig with it multiple times a week and I very pleased with it, compared to the Roadrunner cases I was using on my other guitars. It seems pretty well sealed, since I don't have to add water too often to the in-case humidifier. Sizewise, it's a perfect fit for the Yamaha FS800, 830, etc.",

Our bass player used it daily to travel from home to our studio here and on location. It was purchased for one of two guitars we tried and the one we chose one using a Gator case. We tried it for our Ibanez Mikro Bass and it fits perfectly and is as quality a product as the best cases we've used for any instrument. The Mikro Bass comes with a gig bag but if you want yours to last for generations, consider this Yamaha case. Duffy Odum, Weemus Studio 2020, Adel GA",

The sides are very stiff, so folding wouldn't have been possible I guess (and may have damaged the case). If you're looking for a case for anything but heavy travel (or being checked luggage) this one is perfect.",

      "text": "a bit tight for fg830 yamaha acoustic?! recd case appears brand new, is Tight fit on sides for yamaha fg830: it rubs on the lining/felt of case. I don't want this to scratch the finish of my guitar. I cannot understand how at least 3 reviewers specified that this case fits fg830 yamaha acoustic guitar? I also have an acoustic/electric 12 string washburn that fits perfectly in this case with room on the sides unlike the yamaha acoustic. Feel free to comment on this review esp. if you have an fg830 yamaha acoustic guitar that fits in this ag1-hc case.",

The case has feet on the side, bottom and foot and can actually stand the case with the guitar (guitar not balanced well) upright .",
