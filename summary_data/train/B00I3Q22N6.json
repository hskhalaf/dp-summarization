That said, I'm wearing them all day to facilitate the stretching and they are comfortable . They are a beautiful indoor soccer shoe which I wear for everyday walking. My indoor playing days are a distant memory.",

Nikes typically run narrow for me; Adidas versions didn't fit well. Pumas were too tight, even in an 11. Decided to give these Diadoras a try. A 10.5 fit incredibly well. Width is slightly wider than some others with good width in the toe area but without added length. Have now worn these to play in a number of times -- they are proving to be a comfortable shoe.",
