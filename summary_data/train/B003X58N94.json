It was very well padded inside so I did not have to worry, thankfully. Make sure you note it has a 14.5\" stance.....the distance from where the back leg rest and the front of the mirror. I attached a pic to illustrate the stance. Now its not wide, but I figure it does its job and you fit in the mirror anyway so that may simply be an individual preference.",
