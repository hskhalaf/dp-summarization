The only downside is your 365-days begins the day you renew and you lose whatever days you may have had left on the expiring version so if already have it and can put up up all those annoying popup reminders to renew wait until the last few days before you enter that new number.",

      "text": "This is a great antivirus program which is fast and does not consume resources as do other antivirus programs. However, there is one major caveat, Webroot can not be configured to automatically scan hard drive partitions. It only scans the partition where your OS is located, which is usually the C drive. If you are like me, I have my HD divided into many drive partitions. I have four partitions: C-F. You can manually scan each partition, but what a hassle. For a paid antivirus program, this is unacceptable IMHO.",
