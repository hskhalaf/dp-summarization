Then 16 inches on center to the next stud, etc. Once the minting brackets were up it was only 10 minutes to finish. We have a 20' deck and wanted the option to split up the sun hitting the deck, so we can choose to deploy 1 or 2 awnings. Very pleased with final product. Would purchase again and have already recommended to friends",
