After putting a very thin layer of this oil on the pan, I noticed a lot more smoke/burn of the oil at a lower heat. The Camp Chef conditioner could take a lot more heat and this oil burned at a lower temperature. I.e. I couldn't pre heat the pan without getting a lot of smoke. I'll give it a few more tries and really make sure I'm not putting a lot of oil on the pan (thought I did that already).",

The flip-top lid leaks (in fact it was leaking in the Amazon box when I got it), and when you squirt the oil into the pan, it always drips down the side of the bottle no matter what you do. 2. It's not as emollient as other cast-iron pan conditioners I have used. It feels like you need to use more than you should. 3. I'm not sure how I feel about it having a scent. It's pretty subtle, but it doesn't seem necessary.",

It smells great, but does not leave that smell on the food. It does have a low smoke point but food still does not stick and cooks well. It doesn't get sticky or build up.

I started reading more about flax seed oil and was intrigued because some of our cast iron is at the cabin and we can go a while between visits and the flax seed oil doesn't go rancid. Happy to report that seems to be the case - a better, less sticky, less heavy coating on the pans. Pleasant smell and lighter oil make it easy to use and it seems to adhere really well. Glad I ran across this - bottles at home and the cabin now.",

The next time I use it, the food doesn't stick to the pan. I like this better than the flaxseed oil I had been using, and will buy it again.",
