The main story line was very short, but that might have been because one of my friends was using Nabit the whole time. The only annoying thing I found was that you could only save after beating a boss stage, if you quit right before beating it, you would have to start back from the last boss save point. It is still a fun group game though.",

The colors and detailing on this game are also excellent. In short, buy it!",

I recommend that it's still super fun as expected with nintendo and I recommend it to all switch fans. Just use the pro controller.",
