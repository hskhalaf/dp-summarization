On the plus side, the birds to enjoy it.",

My goal anyway was to have some moving water to prevent mosquito eggs but if the fountain was able to contain some of the water it would have been a nice view. The suction also sometimes does not work and we find the fountain floating around.",

This happens quicker than I expected due to the splash radius. I have mine in a bird bath that carries about four inches of water. Everytime it stops the safety mechanism needs to be reset by adding water and covering the unit with a dark towel for a few seconds. It might work all day in a pool or small water garden. Some of the spray heads do not work properly, with water only come through a few of the holes.",

Instructions a little confusing and not that thorough, in my opinion, with all the different little attachments but if you have half a brain, it really wasn\u2019t hard to figure it out. I set my birdbath up, filled with water and the pump started to work immediately as I was walking out the door with it. I am totally thrilled with this purchase!! Thank you!!",
