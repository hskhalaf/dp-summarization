The strap hangs on one side and does not swap to the other. So if your shoulder gets tired, too bad.",

I am SURE once they got close enough they could tell ours was a package and didn't even try. We felt very safe with it and it IS secure if you use the lock closures. Very good buy.",

My wife preferred it on her back, and I preferred wearing it somewhat backwards/the bag on my chest. Either way, it was nice to have and worked perfect for everything we needed.

    "description": "Color:Black\n\nThe revamped Metrosafe LS150 anti-theft sling backpack from Pacsafe stays true to its classic design heritage, while providing functionality and seamlessly integrated security technology.\n\nThe bag\u2019s fabric is embedded with eXomesh Slashguard, a lightweight flexible, stainless steel wire mesh that protects your gear from a quick slash-and-run theft. Flexible, stainless steel wire runs through the adjustable Carrysafe Slashguard cross-body strap to help prevent slashers from slicing through and running off with your gear, while the Turn & Lock Security Hook attaches the bag to a fixture for added security. The Lockabout Security Clip and smart zipper security provide multiple layers of protection and lockdown points for zippers to help protect against pickpockets.\n\nThe RFIDsafe blocking pocket helps prevent your data (such as from e-passports, credit cards, and key cards) from falling into the wrong hands. Additional Metrosafe LS150 features include zippered main and front pockets with organization for cards, phone and passport, an iPad compatible sleeve, and adjustable cross-body strap. It holds a volume of 7-liters and weighs just one pound.\n\nPacsafe keeps travelers one step ahead of the game by keeping their gear secure from opportunistic thieves with a wide range of stylish adventure backpacks, leisure bags, urban bags, women\u2019s bags, and camera bags, as well as luggage and travel accessories.",
