      "text": "I bought two pairs of these, one for my wife and one for myself. Since we were each on the cusp of two sizes, her Small and Medium, me Medium and Large I ordered 1 L, 2 M and 1 S. We each found the larger size to be much more comfortable so I'd say they tend to run a little small. We were also afraid they might shrink a little. Just testing them they seem very warm, but we still have to wear them in the snow and see how they actually perform.",

How many times do you go hiking and cross a stream in your water proof hiking boots only to have the water come over the top of your boot. Now you can hike the rest of the day with a wet foot. Or, how about pulling on that half frozen wet boot the next morning. These socks are waterproof. The extra thick ones will keep your feet warm and dry while your boot warms up. Yes, they are pricy, but I love them.",
