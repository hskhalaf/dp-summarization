I have to use a pillow because its so hard. the head extension does not extend forward enough, so I have to use a wrapped up towel for it to be usable. I was sold based on the reviews, I only wish I discovered the extension sooner. The only reason it received 2 stars instead of 1 is because it is quite sturdy. I do not recommend this chair.",

I like most things about it -- adjustability, size, construction -- the mesh is a bit too springy (i.e. weak like rubber bands). I also would like the foam padding in the armrests to be a bit stiffer. The front ends of the rests are flexible and I worry they will eventually give out over time. Only speculation for now. On the other hand, before buying this chair, I bought the comparably priced GM Seating ErogHuman and although that chair is built like a Panzer it is as comfortable as a torture machine. For context, I'm 6'1\", 185 pounds and the Ergohuman chair fits me great.",

The new chair has some updated features and is very comfortable. Word of advice: ensure that you keep all of the bolts tightened - they will loosen up over time and this is what leads to parts breaking over time.",

      "text": "After years of cheap office chairs and hip and leg pain over the last year, I sprung for this chair. The amount of adjustments is fantastic - you can get a totally custom feel. I really love how the seat itself will slide forward or backward, making room for bigger butts if needed. The arms rests go up and down and in and out which was crucial for me, since I switched over to a mid-keyboard mouse. Great chair!",

WE exchanged the wheels for larger softer wheels so as not to harm our hardwood floor. This has proved to have bee a good idea. I would buy again, but do recommend the larger wheels.",
