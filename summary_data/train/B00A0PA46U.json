      "text": "Pricey? Yes. Worth it. YES. So while there are plenty of fishing backpacks out there that are less money the Wild River is by far the best. The layout and storage for the backpack is amazing. You will have no problem fitting all you need for a fishing trip. Very well thought out with the layout, clips, etc. I have worn the backpack while fishing from the bank and it is very comfortable. The padded straps and front strap make wearing it for longer periods of time no issue. Durability seems like it will be fine. I have not had it very long but the material seems thick and high quality. Absolutely recommend.",

I found myself not needing backpack as much as I thought but it does work great when you're carrying a lot of stuff out to car or boat or back to your fishing hole. I like it and glad i bought it the light that can flip out or shine inside is great idea. A lot of cool features with this backpack. Comfortable to wear for sure.",
