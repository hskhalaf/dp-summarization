He has not yet placed the ball into the launcher, but I'm sure that will come with time. We've been playing for 30 minutes about three times a day.

    "description": "Ready to have fun with your furry friend? Get the Playball AUTOMATIC TENNIS BALL THROWER FOR DOGS and start having a blast! Our ball launcher for dogs allows you to choose from its 3 launch distance settings making this highly suitable for indoor use. Lights on the launch unit will indicate which distance setting has been chosen. The furthest setting can TOSS THE BALL UP TO 20 FEET! The Playball tennis ball thrower for dogs can operate on both a power plug (included in the box) or on 6 \"C\" batteries (not included) as well. This makes our launcher useful for both INDOOR AND OUTDOOR PLAY! Our launcher comes with 3 NEW AND IMPROVED mini tennis balls (1.5 inches in diameter each) that are highly durable and can withstand getting wet/ saliva and will not jam your machine. PLEASE TAKE CAUTION TO ONLY LOAD ONE BALL IN THE LAUNCHER AT A TIME. LOADING MORE THAN ONE BALL AT A TIME CAN JAM THE MACHINE. In case you ball gets jammed in the automatic ball launcher, simply tilt the machine back, hold down on the white setting button for 15 seconds which will automatically power up the motor, then tilt the machine forward and your ball will be released. Due to this machine only accommodating small size balls (1.5 inches in diameter), our dog fetching launcher is meant ONLY FOR SMALL SIZE DOGS! The small size balls will present a choking hazard for larger size dogs. As with all pet toys and launchers , play must be supervised by a pet parent! You can play with your pet by dropping the ball into the chute to be launched and when your pet retrieves the ball, simply drop it in again for never ending fun! Alternatively, you can train your pet to use the automatic ball thrower all on its own for self play. When your pet retrieves the ball, simply offer it some treats near the opening of the intake chute if it will drop the ball in. The Playball Launcher can keep your dog healthy and happy! This product makes a great gift!!",
