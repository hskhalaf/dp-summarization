It makes my almost 40 year old skin feel super tight, and causes the skin to retain hydration better. I'm just mad that I did not try it sooner. I also had a minor snafu with my order and they instantly made it right! I can see this working well for menopause, post surgical, dry, and problematic skin as well.",
