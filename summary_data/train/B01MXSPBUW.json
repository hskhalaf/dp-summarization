I had the post-op appointment with my orthopedic surgeon this week and asked. He said a TENS unit absolutely can be used after joint replacement, and that physical therapy often includes TENS treatments. He suggested placing two of the pads above my knee joint on the quads and two below my knee, a couple of inches apart. I've used it twice now and it absolutely is helping the pain. If in doubt, ask your doctor. I'm so glad I did!",
