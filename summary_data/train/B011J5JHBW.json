I did NOT receive what I ordered!!! Instead I received the tall 8.45oz bottle which does have an odor, reacts completely different on my skin in a negative way and the bottle leakes. It is NOT the same product! I've always loved all my orders from Amazon but if i could ide give this negative 5 stars!!!",

Unfortunately, Sephora isn\u2019t stocking this anymore...which is why I turned to Amazon. Compared to the clean-feeling, odorless version I used to get at Sephora, this product left my skin sticky and had a distinct lemon scent to it.
