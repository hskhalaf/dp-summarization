I started doing my own pool maintenance this year and I would be lost it wasn't for these kits - they're fantastic and buying replacement agents and reagents is breeze. No question if you want to be serious about your pool get yourself a set of Taylor testing stuff",

Testing more than pH and chlorine will save you money. Understanding the stabilizer will save a s@#t ton of chlorine. Understanding alkalinity helps fix pH. Understanding calcium will save your pumps and the walks of your pool. COULDN'T BE HAPPIER.",
