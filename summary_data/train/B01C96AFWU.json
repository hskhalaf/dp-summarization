I'd say overall there are some really surprisingly high quality items in this kit, especially for the cheap price. Of course, you can't expect top of the line at this price, but it seems like a lot of thought went into making sure that the important stuff was well-made, like the jumper cables and the air pump especially. I now have no problem trusting this kit in my family's vehicles.",

The whole thing fits well into the trunk of his small car, and I feel like he's well prepared (the window breaker went into the glove box, of course :)).

I guess I give it four stars because it's something he should have. I guess if and when it gets used, I'll revise my review up or down based on his experience with the kit. I bought this kit over others because it includes an air compressor, which is something I have had in my own car for years and found useful multiple times.",

A couple of ideas to improve on it is sewing a pocket or another strap on the opposite side of the cables, compressor to secure other loose items and/or add a clear plastic zipper bag for keeping the small stuff together like tape, tie wraps, etc. In any case, still offers great functionality and value!",
