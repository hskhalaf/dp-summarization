I bought my Mirro 1 and a half years ago, and I've been amazed by just how much abuse the thing can take- it's been through my washer and then the dryer and still works great, with everything but the camera and outside screen working excellently. It has good call quality, quick texting with T9, and absolutely AMAZING battery life, though I don't have web access and so can't cover that area. But still, this is a good phone to invest in long-term and features everything newer phones would have - great call quality, fast texting for sbout the average price.",

But I have only used it 2 1/2 months and the LED screen display has gone black - therefore I can't see my contacts, who's calling, etc. Still sending and receiving calls but very disappointed this phone has malfunctioned so quickly under average, normal use! It's my only phone so going to be a problem doing without it while addressing the problem!",

      "text": "I have been trying to find a senior-friendly phone for a couple of years. Too many phones just make the keys bigger. In my experience, seniors may be less familiar with using common features like scrolling and menus. The most important thing is to make the most basic functions intuitive. A senior is trying this phone out, and has found it easy to use. I like the fact that you can turn the speakerphone on with one external, clearly marked key. It's very difficult to find this feature, or to search for it specifically. So I'm disappointed to learn that it's not very durable. Have other people had that experience?",

My current one (3rd), I have had for 5 month, never had any problems, no black screens or freezing of program, unlike some reviewers claim above me...I bought all of mine brand new, so if you buy a \"refurbished\" unit, stuff like that tends to happen. I do NOT advise buying used cell phones. For $56 shipped, brand new, you can't beat this phone, period.",
