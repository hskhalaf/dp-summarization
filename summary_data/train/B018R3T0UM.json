I\u2019ve been using this wheel cleaner on my ray volk racing wheels and they work pretty in taking out all the dirt. The bottle comes pre sealed and capped which is really smart for shipping so nothing can spill out. Overall, its a great product and this is my first time going with this brand.",

Do use a wheel brush though if you have more than ordinary dirt and dust build up. No wheel cleaner can get rid of brake dust alone not even the really expensive ones. Good job Trinova!!",

You can spray on and wash off if your wheels are fairly clean, but if they have a lot of dust or dirt then a light brushing from a soft bristle brush works best before rinsing off. I've tried several of the wheel cleaners on Amazon and this has been the best so far.",
