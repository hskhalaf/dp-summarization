If no one can hear you, what\u2019s the point of the phone? Which means I had to take service off of my old phone, put the service on this phone. Take it off of this phone, because it\u2019s not working, out it on another phone that works, spend hours in the Apple store just to have them tell me that the problem can\u2019t be fixed. The whole phone has to be replaced. All this before going out of the country on a trip. Yeah... it\u2019s sucks. Buyer Beware!",

This phone is close to immaculate! the only signs of use are near the charging port where there is a little bit of scuffing. Another plus of my purchase was that the phone came with a pre-installed tempered glass screen protector, as well as a charging cord, and the charging block itself. The jet black color is in amazing condition for this phone being refurbished.",
