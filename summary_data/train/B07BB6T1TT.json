      "text": "The TV, for the price, is good, but you\u2019re definitely sacrificing a lot. 1. Color - it looks opaque, lacking vibrance. 2. Resolution - my 2014 720P Samsung (32 in) looks better. The dimensions are perfect for a bedroom or a small living room. The sound is the only thing going for the unit. The unit is light. Easy to pick up. It doesn't require more than one person to set up. Ultimately, if you're not big on color, then this TV is..... Ok. It's a low end budget TV - like buying cheap razors; you regret it, but you bought a years supply from a big box stores.",

      "text": "After My Samsung 32 inch flat screen TV/Monitor died, I ordered the Komodo Sceptre 43\" 4K on July 22, 2018. The audio was such a disaster that I have to return it on August 8, 2018 . I ordered the Hisense 40H3080E 40-Inch 1080p LED TV (2018 Model) the same day. The audio was much better. It was designed to have external speaker connectivity that stays connected (It doesn't reset to manufacturer setting every time it turns off). It connected nicely to my Logitech speakers with surround sound capability. The picture looks sharp with the 1080 dpi movies. The TV is also compatible with Spectrum remote set up. I can use Spectrum remote to adjust the volume.",

Resolution,color,you need to go into the settings to adjust.Watching center, or in front is the best because the side angle can look washed out ,yet the color remains decent.For those who may want a timer,it's under \"time.\" So far,every feature is working ,and we're satisfied with the economically priced HDTV.
