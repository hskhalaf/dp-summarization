      "text": "These headphones are great initially. They have good sound and look really nice. However, I've now had two sets of headphones rip in the earmuff. The first time, Plantronics replace them under warranty. The second time, they said no because the headphones were out of warranty, even though it was on the replacement set they sent. I took very good care of them and always transported the headset in the provided case. Right now, I wouldn't buy another set of headphones from Plantronics as they are clearly not living up to their old manufacturing standards.",

Fast forward through a song by bumping the control ring forward. a quick silence button allows you to quickly mute the sound and listen without removing the phones themselves. Noise canceling worked so good I never hear the stewardess on the plane. No issues what-so-ever. Worth the price",

The fit, for me, is nice and comfortable and the sound is really good for my ears. I do wish there was an app with these that had an EQ so no matter what you were listening to you could tailor the sound. All in all, for the short time I've had them I'm pretty happy.",

The pain lasts for like 10 minutes after I remove them. I'm really disappointed because I really wanted a gaming headset and thought this was perfect. It may be good for listening to music once in a while, but nothing longer than 1 hour. I have average sized ears that don't really stick out or anything.. this sucks.",

On average, that's probably 2 or 3 times per month. Over the two years that I have owned them, that's less than 50 uses.

There are some annoying drawbacks however. Sometimes, the volume would be set to maximum and the dial on the headphones won't change it whatsoever. The biggest downside I feel was the quality of the material. The lining of the foam cushion on the earpiece started tearing after about an year and a half of use. Just lasted long enough to be out of warranty. I expected an item of this price to have lasted much longer. It's not unusable yet but I fear the fabric will tear all the way soon enough.",

Rather have too much bass than not enough since I can customize that myself.

Love the large controls making it easy to pause or fast forward or back with just a quick twist or tap of the knobs on either side. Excellent battery life too. Listened for several hours while wireless with no problem. Nice quality charging cable and audio cable as well as a nice velvet lined storage bag. Easy to stow in the backpack when on the move.",

They sound wonderful and the noise reduction works great on planes but anything above an engine hum and these don't do much. The sensors that tell them to turn off if you take them off are a little too sensitive, if you even move them around on your left ear it will turn the music off. But really you can't come up with too many other weaknesses. If you want a BT, noise canceling quality headphone then really you can't do better.",

Also, they are not compatible with my plantronics savi wireless phone headset. That would have been great for me. I cant get them to work with my laptop yet. I think it needs a special driver.",

Charge lasts for several hours...I've used them in airports and it drowns out most noise by design alone. I have yet to use the ANC but I'm sure it would work just fine. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a set of \"budget\" over the ear style headphones.",

The battery life right from the beginning is just about 2-3 hours on Bluetooth. When more than one device syncs to it, the audio quality falls from OK to downright terrible",

However, for $150 (listed now for $180), this is definitely not worth it. I'll avoid Plantronics in the future.",

The active microphone is a cool feature: it makes your phone calls more natural by letting you listen to your own voice as well and second, you may listen to conversations in your surroundings without removing the headphones. Battery life is great, charging is done very quickly. The comfort feature of stopping by and staring the music when taking the headphones off and putting them back on also works great with Android.",
