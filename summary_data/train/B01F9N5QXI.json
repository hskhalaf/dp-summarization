The ads don't really bother me (yet), but knowing you can always upgrade I'd strongly recommend the ad version first. Even at $100, this would still be a good phone. At $50, it's a killer. To be honest, I don't like is the heavy handed 'BLU' on the front of the phone. I really wish they'd take their deign cues from Motorola. Simple face, brand the case. It seemed to me that the phone ran a tiny bit hot while playing Pokemon Go, but that's full brightness, GPS, Wifi and all 4 processor cores running, so it's understandable.",

It's camera produces good photos, almost as good as my Sumsung galaxy S7 edge does. However I think there was a mix up with the purchase of this item. I joined the Prime membership club and paid for it, with the hope that the prime membership price would be applied to this item. But that was not the case. I hope our reputed Amazon will look at this and sort it out as soon as possible. I am very likely to recommend it to anyone looking for a good cellphone at that cheap price.",

It isn't going to operate as speedily as your $500 phone. If you load it up with a ton of apps running, it will run pretty sluggish. 2. It has 1GB of RAM and 8GB total memory. To be functional, you will need to install a Micro SD card as well. This is a must if you want to install apps. Just install, configure the SD card as the primary save location and you will be good to go.",

      "text": "I have had this phone for over a year and I have definitely gotten my money out of it! I purchased the 16gb model in August of last year and have since taken with it me to Europe as my primary travel tool. I used it as a map and my camera. The camera held up well and worked better than I was expecting! In short this phone is not perfect and may not be worth the nearly $100 it costs now but if you can get it on sale you won't be disappointed!",

Just wanted to add my two cents Pros: Almost everything Cons: I use an app that monitors the temp of the phone and every day or two the phone seems to be overheating. I use the app to power down other open apps and it is fine. Although related before, it is amazing that such a nice phone has a VERY soft speaker. I am using a speaker booster app which helps a little but still, it is annoying.",

If you get this phone I highly recommend getting a memory card for it and keep customization to a bare minimum. The screen is beautiful though. If you can go for the higher tier with 2gb of ram or the Motorola",

      "text": "Fantastic unlocked $50 phone. I was skeptical about buying it with advertisements on the lock screen, but it's really non-obtrusive. You do have the Amazon Apps installed, but there's nothing pushy or gimmicky and it feels like a cheap Nexus phone. The screen is sharp and great for reading text. The BLU R1 also supports the 2,4,7 and 17 LTE bands with 12 on its way, so it works well with LTE on both AT&T and T-Mobile. I set this up with theso that I now have a relatively inexpensive world phone, though FreedomPop sadly doesn't support LTE.",
