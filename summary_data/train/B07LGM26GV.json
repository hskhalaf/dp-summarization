We're in, out and done. Does this take bumps as well as a baby*rend sit and stand? No. It also will veer off towards any sloping a road or sidewalk has. But overall this stroller is worth it.",

The small change I would make in the next generation is to be able to lock/unlock the front wheels like a jogging stroller. Some times if you are pushing on uneven payment with 4 kids it gets a bit tough.",

Although u do have to pull out the seats, basket, and the canopy for it to fold properly it will still fit in most halway closets perfectly. We travel a bit n this works for us in more ways than i can think. It's even served as a play pen for my little ones. The seats seem sturdy and comfy. Lots of storage and we've even taken inside themeparks. We get soo many compliments as it seems and is very useful for parents with multiple little ones.",

The Good: Capacity - Lots of space for kiddos, waters, coats, backpacks, etc., durable, canopy included, eye-catching, lots of people stop and ask us about it. The Bad: It does fine on paved, level surfaces, but dirt, sand or curbs are more challenging, especially the more weight you have in it. Like other reviewers have mentioned, I would def pay more for a 'sporty' version with bigger, inflated tires and maybe a suped up suspension system.",

I guarantee we willbget YEARS of use out of this thing! Only downside is price but compared to a 3 kid stroller... not bad. I can't speak on durability yet but it seems very well made.

Storage under the seats is great and easily accessible from the zipper on the front. The canopy is adequate for shade and can be slid from the top to either side depending on the angle of the sun. It folds to fit in the car. It is a little on the pricey side, however it is worth every penny! I would buy it again!",
