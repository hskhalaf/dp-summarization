I love my other bearpaws as well but these are a nice change. They arrived on time and packaging was great!",

Definitely stands up to its promise of being water repellent. I went out in a major snowstorm in the Burgundy. I stopped in snow and slush. The boot held up very well. I have since mucked up the appearance of the boot due to my own carelessness, but the boot is as promised. Highly recommend",

Trying to get in out of the slippers causes leg cramps because the ankle opening of the boot is disproportionate to the shoe size and calf. I thought they would stretch and they haven't. I could understand if I had large ankles but that's not the case. Contacted seller for an exchange but no response.",
