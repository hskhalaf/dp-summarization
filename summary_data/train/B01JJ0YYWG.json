Why 3? They could have easily designed this with only 1 screw. It also does not like rechargable batteries. Expensive and wasteful! Second, it can be flaky with opening and closing. Unfortunately, I kept this thing long enough that the return window was missed. Being at this price point makes it hard to move on to a different product...",

Every time you brush it, it goes off, which means that it will sometimes lock while the door is being closed or while sitting open. Also, these extra open and close actions burn the battery much more quickly. It's also impossible to disable the tap-to-close part of the app on your device without force stop (android) or disabling bluetooth (android/ios). It would be nice if the app could add a confirmation click, at least, or a complete disable of the tap-to-lock feature.",

I am a single 25 year old female and this was easy to install using the video instructions; it took me about 30-45 minutes to get it completely functional and connected to the app. It is easy to lock yourself out the first few times because whenever your phone is in range and you touch the deadbolt it will lock/unlock. I really like how you can unlock/lock by pushing the button on your phone. The only downside is that guests have to have the KEVO app and you can only send a \u201ckey\u201d to their email. Otherwise, I really like this for the price!",

From the beginning, we had an issue connecting the lock to our phone apps, and had to rely on the fobs (separate review on those).

How can you indicate that the lock is confirmed as locked, when indeed it isn't, and not inform the user that it can't lock because of a low battery?! Simply UNACCEPTABLE!

I gave access to the lock to one of my friends but she just couldn't get in at all, so no use in having this poorly made lock in my place. Don't buy it; it's not worth it even for half the price",
