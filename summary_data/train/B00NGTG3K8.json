Negatives and the biggest reason I returned...the sound is flat no bass to mention. Sound is clear just flat. I was expecting a bit more range for the $60.00. If you listen to music and enjoy a nice bass response, pass on these. I have had better listening experience for ear buds that cost $30.00, although they are not built as good.",

To skip to the next track, you need to hold the up/down buttons for 2 seconds. So, if you want to skip 5 tracks, you'll spend 10 seconds waiting for the controls to respond. It's excruciating. Otherwise, the quality is pretty good. If you have your device in hand and can use that to skip tracks, or you rarely change tracks, you're set.
