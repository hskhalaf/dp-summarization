They also made sure there were no exposed screws and everything was safe. They noticed our telescope had a crack so they went ahead ordered us a new one. When they were done they cleaned up all trash and left everything very clean. We were very impressed with the product and the services. I would highly recommend this product and company.",

One piece of wood is pretty split so I\u2019m worried about how long it\u2019s going to last and it\u2019s one side of the monkey bars. The set up of the house is a little strange how they block off the entrance to the house after going across the monkey bars.. so we left the small boards off that go around the house area other than on the swing side and the table side.",

Perhaps if one accounts for replacement due to normal wear and tear on floorboards or wooden ladder rungs. Overall, we (and most importantly, our kids) are thrilled with the purchase.",

It\u2019s very unstable, from the ladder to the monkey bars, to well everything. The assembly on this is super easy and the instructions are great, however it is a waste of money. Also the only way to even get anything done about it is either to return it fully, or backyard discovery will send parts.",

    "description": "With its large deck and colorful canopy, the upper fort will make your kids feel like they\u2019re relaxing under a big beach umbrella, or sailing on the high seas in search of pirates using its steering wheel and telescope. The rock wall ladder and monkey bars provide safe and challenging options for a fun ascent to the top, and the 8-foot slide offers a quick and wavy descent back to the bottom. Try building castles and writing your kids names in the sandbox area below, and when they need a break, head over to the brightly colored awning and snack bar to cool off with a cold juice box.",
