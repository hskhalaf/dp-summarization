Went to use it today and it won't work. The blue light comes on but nothing happens when you push the \"on\" button. Can't return it either I guess. I consider this to be a waste of money. When it did work, it did an adequate job but not nearly what I expected. I've cleaned my jewelry in a jar with baking soda and dish detergent for years. Cost me nothing. Guess I'll go back to that because this product has been a disappointment and a rip off.",

I just put in water and a drop of liquid detergent (you can run this with just water if you like). It runs for three minutes and automatically stops. After that, I use a toothbrush the gently scrub the jewelry and give it a final rinse in water. On diamonds, you can definitely see the difference! So far I'm very happy with it and recommend it for jewelry cleaning. The sound is not really loud and the build quality is very good.",

When my mom came to visit I had to run hers through 3 or 4 times to make a real difference (she hadn't had them cleaned in > 10 years) but she was flabbergasted. She said she hadn't seem them that clean since I was born! :D based on reviews here, I use warm water and add a tiny drop of dishwashing soap. It's small enough, I keep it in a kitchen cabinet on a small shelf. Out of the way. I don't like lots of appliance clutter, and this doesn't add to anything. Highly recommend.",
