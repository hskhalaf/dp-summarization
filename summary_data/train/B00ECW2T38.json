However upon putting on the bolts are hardly long enough and one of them even snapped. I used my own strong bolts to install. While it is a fairly inexpensive product, I expect better quality from a name brand product. This seems to be the only product like this on the market though so I don\u2019t have much choice but to keep this one. Go Rhino used to make a similar one but it has been discontinued it seems :(",

The hardware included seems decent, I like that it has nylock nuts. This isn't the type of thing you want loosening up on you. Someone could have a nasty surprise. Something about this is that it locks and holds the ball in place while you tighten the large nut on the bottom. I actually bought this MOSTLY for that function, rather than the step. The step is just an awesome bonus!",
