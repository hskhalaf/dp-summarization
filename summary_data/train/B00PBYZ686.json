The tree was approximately 10 inches circumference and maybe 18 feet tall. . The Greenworks saw worked much better then expected. I took it out of the box, put some chain oil in and started to work. It cut through the trunk with no problem. I had to stop once to add some more chain oil and slightly tighten the blade but other than that it was relatively quick work. I am very pleased and would recommend this saw to anyone to use on small to midsize trees.",
