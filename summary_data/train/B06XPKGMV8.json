The eyes are really epoxied in there, and are still attached after many vigorous dishwashings. The glittering rhinestones and chromed hood are even gaudier in real life than they appear in the pic. Only issue is that the spoon is pretty small, about 3/4\" across, and holds maybe half a teaspoon. It's fine for stirring but poor for swizzling. Remember to adjust recipes that call for barspoons, because this one holds less!",
