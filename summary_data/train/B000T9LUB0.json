      "text": "This old version of the Norton Antivirus software is a real bargain to be had. You see, I actually prefer the old 2008 version to use on my Windows XP PC's. A bonus is that if you you choose to, it offers you an upgrade to the very latest version of NAV. So it's a real deal. Since I am already using NAV 2008, I just use the product key from the CD jacket to update my subscription. You don't even have to install it over and over again. Just purchase another one to extend your subscription.",

The Norton 2008 requires so much memory to run that it will slow down your computer dramatically. It will run slower online and offline. It stops viruses as well as I expected, but it makes everything slow and annoying. Even though I paid for a year of protection, I uninstalled it and bought a different program. Trend Micro hasn't slowed our computer down at all.",

I placed my order and was disappointed that there was no mail-in discount included. However, I was happy that I did save $10 over Norton's website price and my local retail stores.",

I was able to install it just fine and the PC ran OK for a few days. But then it started freezing up and crashing regularly. My wife lived with it for another week before giving up. We uninstalled Norton and installed Webroot AntiVirus with Antispyware. The PC has not crashed since then. I don't plan to purchase another Norton product.",
