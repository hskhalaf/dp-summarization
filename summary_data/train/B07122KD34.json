I've used both conventional and spiral flute taps before from Dormer, Morse, etc in aluminum and haven't broken any of those taps, so I at least sort of know what I'm doing.",

You have to reverse the drill and back out of every hole.",

They are not bad for what they cost and buying another set to finish is still worth the time and money considering the cost of tap sets and numbered drill sets. I will buy this again.",

On hard it hard to get it to bit so you will want to use a smaller drill to drill a pilot hole. On soft if you slip a little you can screw up the alignment and then the tap part won't be so useful. Trick is to go slow and have a good pilot hole no matter what.",

I would recommend going slow on the drill if trying these in wood as they cut so easily, it is easy to get aggressive and chew up the threads in the substrate. The shank and threads are just as sharp and clean as the first day I got them and I have used over a dozen times. Great and highly recommend",

    "title": "Hymnorq HSS Metric Hex Shank High Speed Steel Spiral Flute 2-in-1 Combination Drill and Tap Bit Set M3-M10 with 1/4\u201d Hex Shank Set of 6pcs",
    "description": "Style:Metric 6pcsOVERVIEW\nMade from high-speed steel, these combination drill and tap bits are designed to tap up to 10-gauge wood, plastic and other soft materials. They are not suitable for drill and tap in metals. \nThese drill taps are a great time saving accessory. Each one is a combination of a twist drill bit and a tap. The point is the same as a twist drill bit, which is self-centering. So, you don't have to buy a centering drill bit or a center punch. Now you can drill and tap at the same time in one operation. \nNo tool changes, good alignment and fast cycle times make this a very productive tool. \nThis Migiwata high-speed steel (HSS 4341) drill/tap combination bit set are offered in a set of 6 different metric sizes (M3, M4, M5, M6, M8 and M10).\n\nTECHNICAL DETAILS\nMaterial: High Speed Steel 4341\nTapping Material Type: Wood, Plastic, etc.\nTapping Material Thickness: About 5mm\nPoint Type: 135 Degree Split Point\nShank: 6.35mm (1/4\u201d) Quick Change Hex\n\nNOTICE:\nIt\u2019s highly recommended that the combination drill and tap bit is used on a tapping machine with drill lubricant. \nIf you apply an electric hand drilling machine to do the tapping job, please pay attention to your operating, because excessive shaking and tilting may affect the result and even break the bit.\n\nCAUTION: \nAny cutting tool may break or shatter under improper use. Government regulations require use of safety glasses and other appropriate safety equipment at all times in the vicinity of use.",
