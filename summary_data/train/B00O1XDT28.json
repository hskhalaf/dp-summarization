They fit her perfectly (and with enough room to grow), she says they are comfortable, they are super cute, and best of all - today we were in the pool for 2 hours and not a single drop of water got in!!

I like how these almost suction cup around the eyes to make a gentle seal. The colors of these are bright and fun, which my kids love. The quality seems to be good.

These are not tinted which makes it much easier for the child to see inside and under water. Swim teachers can better see the kid's facial expressions and if the kid pays attention etc. Personally, I think kids look cuter in light colored goggles and when one can look them in the eyes.",

This particular model was just sun-par, in our experience.",

Teachers tried and failed with several styles and brands. On a whim I got these because he said he wanted pink and purple ones. Maybe it's just a color thing. I don't care; he wears them. There is some leakage occasionally, but he's four so I attribute a lot of user error to most of it.",
