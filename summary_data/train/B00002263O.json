Highly recommended \u2014 I may buy more (if I can figure out where to put them) as semi-permanent infeed/outfeed stands for my table saw.",

      "text": "I set both supports to bandsaw table height. But one support is on the floor, the other on a half inch rubber mat. Inside the outer square tube is an inner weldment wedge shaped full length. Adjustment down by backing off the crank is highly precise; I imagine a few thousandths of an inch is possible, much less than a 32nd or 64th. I guess it correlates with the thread pitch of the crank, after a study you could make quick adjustments with partial turns of the crank. Set up a machinist's travel gauge then see the result of a quarter turn of the crank. Since the weldment is a wedge there is no slippage. Fine investment !",

The feet can be easily adjusted if your shop floor is not level. The stand is heavy enough that it will not easily tip over. Before, I had a cheap light-weight stand from Sears. This stand is a significant improvement. I would purchase this stand again. Its made in the USA, so that is good. I have revised this review to downgrade it from 5 stars to 4 stars, since it is not so easy to do a fine adjustment of the height.",

I am far happier with these other stands for less cash and they can take over 1,000 lbs! Adjustment on these does need an allen wrench but i welded a holder onto the stand and its a non issue now.",

The stand was rusting under the paint, the roller was seized, the mounting flange for the roller head was bent, and the legs didn't bolt on properly. It appears that HTC moved production to the lowest possible cost manufacturer in China and didn't bother with even the most cursory quality control. The Rockler heavy duty roller stand is now a much superior alternative to this formerly good quality stand from HTC.",
