Anyway, I included a photo to show the pigment and that it\u2019s a nice reddish brown color. The other reason I didn\u2019t give this five stars was because the product arrived well- packages by Amazon, but there was no seal. So you can\u2019t be 100% sure if it was not tested/ returned and re-sold. I wonder if other buyers have the same experience with the lipstick having no seal. It\u2019s labelled \u201cNEW\u201d.",

I've been using her eye liner for a while (BEST ever, will be there the next day through sweating), so I thought I'd try the rest of the line; they last quite a while and most importantly they won't make your lips dry if you choose to wear it matte (they're matte by default, you'd have to add lipgloss for shine). I reapply twice a day, but I drink coffee a couple times a day and water non-stop, so I give it a lot of wear and tear. Overall, great durability and a great selection colors overall.",

I'd recommend keeping it on hand if you're using it for a night out, and just reapplying when necessary. It also dries your lips out a bit so be sure to wear chapstick when you're not wearing this.",

It isn't too contrasting or \"frosty\" looking- a thing some darker skinned women have trouble with when wearing pinks, and it adds a nice flush of color without making me look goth (that damn bergundy trend- ugh). Its also velvety smooth, matte, and stays on all day without flaking or cracking. Get it!",

I recommend this product as I only have to touch it up mid-afternoon to keep it dark. It really has great staying power. I use a light lip balm on my lips before I put the lipstick on just to keep my lips moist, but the product is really not that drying. I recommend it.",
