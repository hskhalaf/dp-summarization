They have the same sweep and rise as my Sundays but are 1/2\" narrower; not even enough to throw off my flow.",

The only down-side, which I already suspected based on the price (and all straight-gauge construction) is that the weight is NOT 1 lb, 12oz as stated in Amazon and other places on the web. These bars weigh 2 lb, 5oz. If you are counting every oz., you will likely have to pay a lot more to get lighter ones this size. To me, the sturdiness counts more and they are a great deal.",
