And fit absolutely perfect on BOTH scooters! I am very very happy with them and especially like that they have clips on BOTH ends and cover every single part of the scooter - don't waste your time looking any further (I did it for you!) And ps- I did NOT receive this at a \"discount or complimentary \" like most people that leave a review (wish I knew how and I probably would!) Good luck!",

It is outside all year in the hot CA sun so it does fade (the black) and it does thin out, hence the tears and rips later in life. It fits my 150cc scooter perfectly even with a cargo box on it. I'd rather buy these once a year than pay $30-100 for more expensive ones that will eventually die too.",

The fabric is noticeably becoming brittle to the point that it's tearing when I remove it to go for a ride. Was hoping for a cover to last until next summer but this one is destined for the trash instead.",
