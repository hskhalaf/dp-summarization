My last heavy spring mattress lasted about 13 years before I noticed internal spring issues. This one didn't last half a year. If I could return or get a refund, I would try. I don't usually write reviews or try to make returns. However, this product was horrible. Maybe it was defective? Cross your fingers and find out.",

The firmness level is medium and just right for me. I also like that both sides are the same, as occasional flipping extends the life and comfort. I would buy this mattress again.",

The fabric is rough, and I'm probably leaning towards purchasing a cover. Another complaint is with the cheap white tabs used throughout.

    "description": "Size:Full| Color:BrownWolf Corporation is the oldest Serta licensee, proud to say we are the sole manufacturer of Serta Futon Mattresses! Serta Futon Mattresses feature Cottonique. Cottonique combines selected grades of cotton with polyester fibers for a unique, durable upholstery blend that outperforms and outlasts traditional cotton batting. As a result Serta futons are more resilient, more comfortable and yet surprisingly light. The Cypress futon mattress contains a 4\" spring unit and so there will be more of a bounce to this mattress. The spring unit is surrounded by 2, 1\" foam pieces that provide supple, body conforming comfort. The Serta Cypress is a 8\" mattress built for years of comfort. It is constructed with 3 layers of heavy weight cotton fiber blend that surround the foam and innerspring unit. Machine lace tufts and true box casing construction complete the Cypress. This Cypress futon mattress is covered in an antelope upholstery grade fabric and is full size, 54\" x 75\". All Serta Futon mattresses are compressed, rolled and boxed which makes for ease in shipping and installation.",
