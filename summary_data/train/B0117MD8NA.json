The link removal tool was incredibly easy to figure out and I took out 3 links in no time. My first order of this item got lost in transit somewhere, but I was able to get my money back almost immediately and turned around and rebought it and I am pretty happy I did.",

As for the band I really enjoy it and feels great on the wrist. It has held up some everyday use and just a few scratches.",

It *doesn't* make a very satisfying click when closing the clasp; instead it just makes sort of a crunching metal sound, that doesn't give you much confidence that it's closed. The bars that slide into the Apple Watch aren't very flush and protrude a noticeable amount on either side. So overall...just ok.",

Cons: I didn't read the directions the first time I bought one of these bands and I broke three of the four replacement pin removal pins before deciding I should read the directions. Make sure to line up the pin and tool exactly and it works well. I would definitely buy this band again.",

This band reminds me of older Seiko bands with an improved clasp system. It actually requires you to press on 2 tabs to release the catch.",
