We try to take him out every time he wakes from a nap, but sometimes are a bit late. These washable belly bands are lifesavers! When he has an accident, these bands soak up the urine and keep it away from his skin, while preventing leaks and staying dry on the outside. We also love the large velcro band that allows us to fit it perfectly to his little body, which is slender near his back legs and larger around his belly. Will be purchasing another set! Thank you!",

      "text": "This is my second order for the Luxury Dog Wraps. My dog doesn't mind wearing them and they have been an answer to my problem. They are absorbent, do not leak and are easy to clean. I would recommend buying more than 3 (I now have 9 wraps) because I change them often and wash them by hand or machine and want them to be totally dry before I put one back on him. I only wish I had found these years ago but am so happy now that our home is dry and happy! :)",

I rinse them off, soak in detergent water and then rinse off and plunge in vinegar and water and rinse again. sounds like a lot of work but not really. Hang to dry. You can machine wash too but Hand washing is better I think. Only gave 4 stars cause somehow my dog will slip these off. Tried going tighter, but he got them off more often. So I put them on just tight enough to keep them on. This must be more comfortable cause he slips out less now.",
