Or it's not flagging when the highway speed is 55 mph and you're already driving at 60 mph. You can preset limits for small roads and highways but it's not enough as there are small roads that have the same speed limits as the beltway especially in Maryland.",

    "description": "Linxup is a 3G GPS tracking device for companies, fleets, and personal vehicles.\n\nUse Linxup GPS trackers to quickly identify driver locations, reduce FUEL usage, increase efficiency, review driving history, and monitor driver safety & performance.\n\nThe Linxup GPS system makes it easy to take advantage of powerful GPS tracking capabilities.\n\nLinxup GPS tracker simply plugs into the OBD II port of any car or truck manufactured after 1996.\n\nThe web-based GPS software lets you track vehicles in real-time and review driving history on an interactive map with vehicle GPS details on direction, speed, stops, and more.\n\nLinxup GPS trackers also have a native mobile app for iOS and Android. Monitor driving activity and the location of your tracking device even when you're not in the office.\n\nBuilt-in GPS tools allow you to monitor safe driving habits such as speeding, harsh braking, and rapid acceleration; text and email Alerts tell you when a driver speeds, brakes abruptly, accelerates rapidly, tampers with a GPS tracking device, or uses a vehicle outside of authorized hours.\n\nThe GPS system creates a driver safety report card that summarizes and rates each driver's activity and compares it with the other drivers in your fleet.\n\nThe GPS system also allows you to track and monitor vehicle maintenance activities over time. Set up geofences (virtual boundaries on the Map) to identify important locations and monitor when your GPS vehicle tracker enters or exits these locations.\n\nLinxup GPS trackers can reduce FUEL usage in your vehicles by as much as 20% per month by monitoring and coaching your drivers to reduce speeds and eliminate unnecessary vehicle idling.\n\nOnly operates in the United States. \n\nWhat are you waiting for?\n\nGet Linxup GPS trackers and start saving today!",
