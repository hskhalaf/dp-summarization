Actually better than our other microwave but it is a bit small. Fine for temporary use. And the price was less than we'll end up paying to repair the main microwave (probably about $500 parts and labor)",

The only thing that I find a little bit disappointing is the weight of the microwave oven, I just wish it was a little bit heavier. Needless to say it seems to be working very fine and I highly recommend it. Purchase during the summer of 2019.",

Here's a tip to the manufacturer's- dont put bells on microwaves and save that money for something else like pay your workers more. The silence is wonderful. And the reason I gave this 5 stars.",

I'm going to contact the company to see if they'll fix or replace it since it's still under the one-year warranty. Panel is simple enough to use, but the microwave is pretty noisy. I wouldn't buy this product again mainly because the interior light is unreliable.",

The stated dimensions are actually taken from a concave shape in the side and the back of the box. The width dimension at the opening is slightly smaller than stated, approximately a half inch. This is only a problem if that stated dimension is critical for your usage. In my case, I will be cooking bacon on the stove.",
