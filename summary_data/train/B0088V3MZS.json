I'm hoping by ordering directly from IT Cosmetics ill get the original product I fell in love with.... TO BE CONTINUE.",

This might be good for contouring but for someone who has dark circles this concealer is no longer adequate for concealing. Don't buy.",

My QVC sample tube was a lot smaller and creamier after warming a bit of it up on the back of my hand before dabbing it under my eyes. The colors were off as well. I was also very disturbed that the new tube I received here was less than a third full. Disappointing to say the least, hence my two star rating. I felt cheated out of the product.",
