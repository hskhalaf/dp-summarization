I am a very on the go person so it is nice to be able to get all the benefits of fruits without having to take the time to eat them all. And I have even noticed that I have lost a good amount of weight in my stomach since I have started using OJC. I wish I had exact numbers but I did not weight myself before hand. So if you are looking to feel healthy and look healthy, buy OJC and start drinking it now!",
