If there is ever a remake of this planner, a spiral-bound book would be a serious upgrade. It's a pain for me to find my place again and again when referring to my schedule for the day. It would be way more helpful to have it lying open to the desired page when I need it. Otherwise, it would be a very useful planner. It's disappointing.",

I have never bought a homeschool planner before but used regular planners, an extremely simple lesson planner and used many free ones online. This one is just right with daily spaces for more than one kid. I love how much space and the Extras section for noting improvements, field trips, books. The calendar area allows me to keep track of everything in this one book! The only thing I would add is maybe an area for curriculum purchase planning for the following year and/or a pocket to keep things like letters from the school district, etc. Definitely buying again.",

I have 3 children, two of which are doing school. The planner accommodates up to 6 children so I could easily add educational activities for my toddler if I choose to. The planner has a section for yearly goals, monthly glances to assist with planning around major events and then daily activities and assignments. I complete the plan for each school week and then glance at the activities for each day. I haven't tried other planners but this will forever be my go-to planner as long as it's in print.",

Although the pages are useful and you need many \u201cweekly\u201d organization papers to finish out a year, I would not recommend this to anyone other than a person who has no experience planning anything (not just a homeschool schedule).

It also gives me a good record (by checking off as we go) of what we've missed or chosen not to do. Using a calendar alone just wasn't good enough. This helps more to fill in the exact activities and classes, then cross check before making plans in our actual Google calendar. Starting this practice is probably the best thing to come out of 2020!",
