I live in Asia so these are nice because I have to constantly take off my shoes when going indoors. I have worked out in theme once or twice but prefer laced shoes for that. They provide enough support for being on your feet all day or chasing down a sprinting toddler but I wouldn't run any sort of race in them. I added so Dr. Schols inserts to them, now they fit like a glove feels like I am walking on air",

Sole is extremely comfortable and the upper fits the name. Its just like a sock. Some people here say theyre not durable, but I accidentally took mine on a hike (forgot my other shoes at home) and they held up. No rips or snags. I was never sure about these until I got a pair. They're incredible. If you order a size 13, you get a perfect fitting size 13. These usually go for $90-150, I was extremely lucky to find them for $35 on here brand new!",

I love that they just slip on, they are comfortable, and airy. I never wear socks with them and they do not bother my feet at all. I also get some nice comments on the look and color of these Nikes's. This is the second pair that I have and the only thing that I don't like it that they are a bit pricey for me.",

I would recommend these to anyone who wants comfortable shoes. I have over 30 different pairs of shoes and these are in my top 5 of most comfortable along side my Adria's ultra boost and yeezy 350.",

Once I got them reconnected, I realized they are not meant to be used every time you wear the shoe.
