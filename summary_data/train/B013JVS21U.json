Buyers should make sure the that this unit is equipped with an 8' diameter duct. You really need this large size to move this amount of air. My house had an existing 6\" duct that I had to climb up into the attic and change to 8\". The lights could be brighter, but this is an awesome value buy! This thing has lots of suction power!!!",

The fans (squirrel cage blowers) move a considerable amount of air. The noise level at max setting (4) is louder than I'd prefer but it's not louder than the old (and, weak) one that it replaced. It has 4 speeds, not 3 like the description currently says. Which is a nice bonus. The LED lights are not terribly bright but sufficient. They will definitely need replacing. I am not sure how high of a wattage those housings can handle but something MUST improve there.",

Only the round exhaust is kind of short when put it through the hole in the cabinet. Therefore it made the connections with the extension hose harder.

The hood is not easy to install. One person cannot install alone. (But they do tell you this in the description.) We needed different hardware. Screwing the hood into our cabinet was not a good option. If we had left the screws in the hood, then the sharp screws would have been in my cabinet. We also did not feel that the hood was secure. We had to get bolts and install from the cabinet down into the hood. After installed, we are happy with the way the hood looks and operates.",

My only complaint is that this product weighs probably 2X as much as other similar fans and the install is difficult for one guy.

The stainless steel matches our new kitchenaid appliances almost perfectly. Hopefully the dependability is good also. Definitely recommend this unit.",
