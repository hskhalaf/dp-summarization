I have had CM Storm and Razer keyboards, and this Logitech G213 Prodigy Gaming Keyboard is by far the best and my favorite keyboard to date, and not over-priced either (cough Razer!). The color zoning is great, especially when gaming, which I ended up finding more useful than anticipated. The software, not required but recommended, is intuitive, but very lite and unobtrusive. We all have different want, needs, and likes, but for me this keyboard hit the mark.",

The RGB is not individually lit (which is something that isn't glaring in the item description), is limited to 5 vertical slices for RGB, and the overall brightness leaves a lot to be desired. Especially when paired with a G203 mouse which is BRIGHT in comparison. This is an overwhelmingly average gaming keyboard and for the price isn't terrible, the multimedia keys are a welcome addition even, however I'd recommend putting your extra dollars into a non-RGB Keyboard with better switches or multimedia options.",

To switch function keys from being ordinary F1-F12 to programmable button, a special button next to F12 needs to be pressed. It work the same way as Caps Lock, Num Lock or Scroll Lock. The disadvantage is that if your game requires the use of Function keys, to use programmed macros you have to constantly switch their mode. A set of dedicated keys would work much better than adding dual functionality to Function keys.",

Cons: Logitech software is spotty, sometimes it does not save your lighting preferences Keyboard is a little on the bigger side but it should not deter you. I only list it as a con because the image may make the keyboard appear smaller than it actually is.",

I also really like the media control buttons. Design is also very clean. It's not too boring but not TOO gamer-y. Definitely recommend if you're looking at this price point.

However, there is a real problem with quality testing here and Logitech has lost my business with this keyboard. I got the first one, and the WASD keys did not work at all...bit of a problem, especially for gamers. The second one worked fine for about 2 months and then the spacebar key became very unreliable and had to be pushed down hard for it to register. Add to that the unwieldy support software and the glitch prone LED lighting...just can't recommend this keyboard. Had such potential for the cost...but it's manufactured cheaply and is clearly not quality tested.",
