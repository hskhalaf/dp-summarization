I used this product on my Porsche 911 wheels, diluted as specified on a cool day in a garage (i.e., no sun or heat to speak of) and it chemically etched my rims within about 30 seconds. Just look at the picture, this chemical etching is dry and smooth to the touch, even though they look to be dripping with grease. They are totally ruined and will need to be replaced at a cost of about $7,000! Yikes!!!! Do not let this happen to you, I don't know what they put in this stuff, but I wouldn't use it on a rusty wagon.",

I'm sure there is a bulk generic version that's much cheaper, but it lasts so long I don't bother.",

The instructions say to dilute, but that sort of defeats the purpose of selling the product in a spray bottle. I got around that by spraying the engine bay little with water, immediately applying the degreaser and waiting about 60 seconds before rinsing. The after picture shows a little water on the air filter, but the cleanliness and color is legit. I dried off the engine cover prior to the photo. Looks awesome!",
