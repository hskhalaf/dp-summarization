This particular foundation absolutely great with coverage. She has post inflammatory erythema and the True Match Foundation does a great job at covering up redness and evening out her complexion. We haven't had a problem with the foundation caking. The great thing about this product is that you don't need to use a lot of product for coverage. Each bottle will last for quite some time and it has SPF in it!",

The only reason I gave this foundation four stars is because I am simply a person who prefers foundation that has a very thick texture. I also found the foundation to be messy and hard to get out of the bottle without making a mess since the texture is a bit watery and it does not have a pump. Other than those two things it's a great foundation.",

I have a yellow undertone and i don't exactly love it, but i thought the logic was to get a warm tone.. it fits terrible makes me look darker and more yellow, but that was my mistake. Will be buying a neutral tone for sure next time to kind of correct the yellow instead of empowering it.",
