Outside texture seems good, not as thick as my previous wallet, but that is fine this way it will contour to my body. There are plenty of card slots and this reduced the bulge as all cards are separated. I replaced the chain as it is not sturdy but I anticipated this. I purchased the wallet for its functionality. I am am biker so I purchased the wallet so I can lower its profile and not feel the bulge when riding. I will update my post in the future after I have risen with it for a few thousand miles to let you know how it is holding up.",
