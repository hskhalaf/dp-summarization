Normally the expiration date is stamped on the bottom of the box, however this box has a label covering it that I cannot remove without pealing off the cardboard (shows Jan 2020) - but I can't confirm if that's the manufacturer date or one added for inventory purposes. Gave 2 stars only for the price and delivery time, however I will not purchase again from here.",
