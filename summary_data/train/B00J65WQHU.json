I guess I am in the market for another router again and this time I can assure you it won't be NetGear. So basically, a complete waste of $$.",

If you use a router/modem provided by Cox, you have to give them a call to provide details for the new device to make it work. Using 2 bands definitely makes a difference, especially in a densely populated area - effectively gives you 2 wi-fi connections with different passwords. Gives a lot of flexibility with multiple router options and convenient interface. Will pay for itself in about 12 months or so (you will not need to pay for the lease of the provider's modem/router).
