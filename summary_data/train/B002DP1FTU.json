Sound quality is great and the comfort leaves a little to be desired, as it can get a little uncomfortable if you keep them on long enough, but in my mind the quality of the sound is enough to make up for this. The cord is long enough to let you move around with relative freedom without feeling like you're going to get unplugged or erode the wires.",

I have four pair of these phones for musicians to use in my project studio and everyone seems to be impressed with the audio quality and \"fit\" of the Shure SRH440's. They are holding up well to the \"less than gentle\" treatment they are given session after session. Overall, I've never had problems with Shure products, which seem to be well designed and properly manufactured for long and reliable professional use.",

      "text": "I love these headphones, sound is great (as expected from all the reviews I found online). They're a bit heavy so I can feel the pressure on my head and ears after a while of wearing them but it's no big deal (this would have taken off half a star but Amazon won't let me do that). The heaviness also gives them a sturdy feel and they are padded which helps. They go all around my ears so they're truly closed and don't really allow sound to leak in or out too much. Since the cord comes off and they bend they are pretty portable. Overall I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good pair of headphones.",
