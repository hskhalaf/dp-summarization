I am very upset with this purchase. It is supposed to be a Solar watch but it does't keep time at all. It just is a piece of beautiful junk. And the battery cost almost as much as the watch. Yes it it is solar and battery. Very poor customer service on someone. It is costing me $92. 00 to get it fixed",

According to Seiko, if the watch runs slowly, you need to place it in a sunny place for several hours. My wife did this multiple times, being careful not to let the watch overheat. It still runs extremely slowly -- as in 2 to 3 hours behind the correct time, after wearing it. Seiko's documentation makes no allowance that the watch may be bad, or the battery may be bad. It is either accurate, or you need to place it in the sun. There is no middle ground. I would return this if I could.",

In the end this watch was utterly useless and a waste of money. I\u2019m back to purchasing battery operated watches that are actually reliable.",

The size of the face is great as it is easy to read, (about the size of a quarter and then the crystals around that) but not too big for a small wrist. The mother of pearl face is even prettier than the picture shows.",
