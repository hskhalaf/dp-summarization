Cushioning is much more firm than my previous Saucony Triumph Iso 2 shoes and am feeling that in my knees after my first long run, am hoping its just an adjustment thing otherwise will use for shorter runs only. Overall, probably best suited towards slimmer runners with fairly narrow toe area. That not a criticism, just a statement of opinion.",

I can see no reason for the gel pulse 8 to be any different I am hoping that the half size bigger allows me to use the supplied insole.
