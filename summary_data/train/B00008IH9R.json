Does not work like your typical coffee pot with the burner keeping that pot of coffee hot then shutting down automatically after 2 hours or so. My observation was that it heats up, brews the coffee then shuts off. So the coffee cools fairly quickly. For large groups it works well but if you have a group getting together for a full day you need to make a half pot and after a few hours make another half pot.This is not insulated. But it does work well and brews a good cup of coffee!",

The holes are rather large and even with a course grind, it was falling into the water. I cut a small square in the coffee filter than spread it on the bottom of the percolator coffee holder. No grounds in the coffee! It was easy fix. Everyone loved the coffee! Highly recommended if you make the adjustment.",

There were some grounds that escaped, but with any percolator you will get the same few grounds that end up in the last cup of coffee you pour out of the pot. If you need a portable, manageable pot that can brew up to 42 cups, I think you will like this one just fine!",

I've since used it to make coffee and also pulled out the filter piece and used it to keep other drinks (hot chocolate, cider, etc) warm. You have to really clean it well, especially around the nozzle, but I'd highly recommend it.",
