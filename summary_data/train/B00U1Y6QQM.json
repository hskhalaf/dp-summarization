This is warm enough to grow bacteria, but not nearly hot enough to heat food to a safe temperature. After 6 hours in the solar oven, my baked potatoes were still raw, although a little warm. I had to finish baking them in my conventional electric oven. The product is useless at best, and unsafe if the user does not check the food's temperature with a food thermometer.",

Being that it's winter, I haven't really tried to do full on cooking with it yet (highest it's reached so far is 200). For warming up cold food (I have a weird love of hot bananas) / reheating leftovers, this thing is great. While you'd expect it to be a very dry heat, it surprisingly holds quite a bit of moisture in (and I'm in a desert). I rarely eat anything I don't cook, but I did get to test this once on reheating pizza from the day before and I'm convinced it was actually better than when it was fresh.",
