I don't know if these squirrels are ultra smart because they also quickly discovered that chewing off most of the wood lid and the top few inches of the plexiglass front makes reaching the food super easy. Now we have very fat lazy squirrels and food that's not protected by the elements, but it doesn't last long with our greedy guys.",
