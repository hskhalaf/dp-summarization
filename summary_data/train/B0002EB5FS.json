      "text": "As a drummer I have five cowbells and a set of chromatic cowbells in my percussion arsenal. The Latin Percussion Mambo Cowbell is hands down my favorite \"go to\" cowbell because of its beautiful lower tone. I own a vintage Rock model cowbell, a Deluxe Black Beauty (high pitch), a Black Beauty Senior (mid pitch) and a Salsa Cha-Cha cowbell (high pitch). if I could only afford one model cowbell out of the entire LP line up, I would definitely go with the Mambo cowbell. If you need one that is a little bit more \"open\" and \"airier\" then consider the LP Prestige cowbell.",

All LP cowbells are crafted from premium quality steel and specially developed Tooling with careful attention given to the tolerance levels. A large variety of LP bells offers different pitches and sound characteristics designed to meet all musical needs and fit into any genre. All mounted cowbells feature the famous forged eye-bolt clamp assembly with oversized wing nuts that provide secure placement on 3/8\" Diameter Mounting rods with only finger tightening.
