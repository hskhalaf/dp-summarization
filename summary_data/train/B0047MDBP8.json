That may take a little longer, be patient. The stuff will get them.",

A couple of days ago we noticed ants (very tiny, don't know what kind) crawling around on our bathroom sink area. I remembered we had this product and put it out. It got scary because then we saw hundreds of ants making the journey try out this product. Next day.....zero ants and none since. So don't be alarmed if putting this out attracts even more ants because, in our case, they won't be back. I ordered this so we would have some on hand if ants ever reappear. Highly recommended!",

    "description": "Size:eachTerro-PCO is a liquid borate bait that instantly attracts and kills ants and their colonies. Terro-PCO is easy to use, has no unpleasant odors, may be used indoors and outdoors, and comes ready to use in pre-filled bait station-- this means no drips, spills, or messes. Ants will come to the bait station, enter, feed and then return to the colony to share the bait and therefore spreading the active ingredient to others. Terro-PCO is also a green pesticide that is safe around people and pets. Terro-PCO is a liquid borate bait that instantly attracts and kills ants and their colonies. Terro-PCO is easy to use, has no unpleasant odors, may be used indoors and outdoors, comes ready to use in pre-filled bait station-this means no drips, spills, or messes. Ants will come to the bait station, enter, feed and then return to the colony to share the bait, therefore spreading the active ingredient to others. Terro-PCO is also a \"green\" pesticide that can be used in Green Pest Management programs. As a borate-based product, Terro-PCO has a very minimal mammalian toxicity and targets specific pests. This reduces the repercussions on people, pets and non-target insects helpful to the environment (such as butterflies and honeybees). Also, Terro-PCO is applied only where needed, further reducing any unnecessary impact to the rest of the environment. And since it is long-lasting, less product is required for a successful and effective Green Pest Management program. How do I use the Terro PCO Ant Bait Stations? Place baits, label side up, near ant trails or close to where ants are numerous. Place additional baits anywhere ants may enter the home. For best results, use seven baits to ensure sufficient supply for the ants. Monitor regularly for activity but do not interfere with the natural behavior of ants. Replace with additional baits when first set is depleted. Once ants are controlled, replace baits every three months to keep ants from returning.",
