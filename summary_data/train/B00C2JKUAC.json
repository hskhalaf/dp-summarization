The seat help up perfectly with no damage. All buckles and the chest plate were still in place and fastened after the accident.",

My only complaint is that they should have made the straps thicker. The straps have two sliders that snap into a crotch strap buckle. The sliders can easily reverse position if the strap folds or twists while you're hooking up the buckle. You then have to fold the strap and move the sliders to get them orientated correctly. All in all, a very minor inconvenience when compared to our grandson's happiness and safety.",

The only thing I don't really like about it is that the center clasp is on the cheap side - I wanted to swap it out with my old car seat but they aren't compatible. The cupholders are solid, unlike the snap-on ones that were on his old carseat, and the cape is a nice feature - he loves to wrap up in it like a blanket. Would definitely buy again, but am hoping they will be adding another Superhero to their lineup so we can have something different in each car.",

I hope we can afford to buy her new one now as once car seats are in an accident the must be disposed of. I recommend this car seat!",
