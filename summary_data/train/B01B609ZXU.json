There is a little room if you want to add a small pouch for your rail lube, string wax, cocking rope etc. we also tired my son's Barnett Quad Edge S and it fits also with plenty of room since it is shorter than the sniper 370.

It was compact, yet roomy enough for the more modern crossbows like the one I have. I did get a few more pieces of closed cell foam and used double sided tape to add a bit more padding. I do think this is the only negative about this case, and one Plano should consider in future designs.",

Which wasn't hard there was no padding around it at all. so nothing & no holes in the packaging big enough to have the latch fall out. Going to see if I can get a replacement Latch from Plano.

Given how loaded the car gets when hauling hunting gear, I really like having a hard sided case rather than a soft case and this one works well.
