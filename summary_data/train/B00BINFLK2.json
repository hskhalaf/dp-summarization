() The weight of the camera (including the battery and a memory card) is 7.3 ounces. () The size of still-image files (jpeg) is between 4MB and 5MB. () The camera needs a reasonably modern memory card. If you have an older card (say, Class 2), it may be too slow, especially if you are planning to make movies. () The flash has a manual pop-up button, and then needs to be manually \"folded\" back into the camera, which a minor inconvenience. The camera does not pop it automatically.",

The pacific beaches and waterfalls were hard to capture because if the fogging. In the southwest parks in the desert the zoom didn\u2019t do much. The camera didn\u2019t take good crisp clear pictures of any quality, even the lights in Vegas were too much for it. This shouldn\u2019t have been labeled a Smart camera with how badly it uses the resources built into it. We used our phones at many locations and got better pictures than with this camera. Very disappointing experience.",

It has a ton of cool features, which I'm sure you've already read about them all, such as sending pics to Facebook, etc. Perhaps we haven't played around with the settings enough, but the pictures that we've taken with the camera don't seem all that great. To be quite honest, the picture quality seems almost on par with some of the newer cellphones. But I will fully admit we haven't had the camera that long, and perhaps we are using the wrong setting or something. Just seems like the picture quality would be a lot better for a camera like this.",

If the person holding the camera moves even the slightest bit, the picture will be blurry, so it's got to rest on something, which necessitates a tripod. Wifi feature works great with my iPad mini. Video is pretty good, though that's not what I bought it for. Zoom is surprisingly good. If you've got a steady hand or a tripod, you should definitely get this camera. This much camera will usually cost double the price.",

    "description": "Color:BlueTake crystal-clear photos and stunning video with the WB250F Smart Camera from Samsung. With features such as a 14.2-megapixel backside-illuminated sensor and an 18x zoom lens, the WB250F gives you the creative freedom to take great photos even in low-light situations. And with built-in Wi-Fi, you can easily and quickly share your best shots.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nTake crystal-clear photos and stunning video with the WB250F Smart Camera from Samsung. With features such as a 14.2-megapixel backside-illuminated sensor and an 18x zoom lens, the WB250F gives you the creative freedom to take great photos even in low-light situations. And with built-in Wi-Fi, you can easily and quickly share your best shots.\n\nThe 14.2-megapixel BSI sensor is optimal for low-light performance. View larger.\n\nA brilliant 3-inch touch display features easy navigation. View larger.\n\n14.2-MEGAPIXEL BACKSIDE-ILLUMINATED CMOS SENSOR\nThe WB250F is equipped with a 14.2-megapixel backside-illuminated (BSI) CMOS sensor that gathers more light than conventional sensors. This allows you to take properly exposed images in low-light situations. With the Low Light Shot feature, the camera will automatically merge three continuous shots into one clear photo.\n\nSHARP 18X ZOOM LENS PROVIDES PLENTY OF RANGE\nThe built-in lens has an 18x zoom range so you can easily frame the exact shot you want and get in close to the action when necessary. The lens starts at a wide 35mm-equivalent focal length of 24mm and zooms all the way to 432mm. With such a large zoom range, you'll have no problem getting everyone into the photo or zooming in on something far away.\n\nCOMPOSE SHOTS ON A 3-INCH HYBRID TOUCH DISPLAY\nOn the back of the camera is a brilliant, 3-inch display that lets you compose and review your photos comfortably and accurately. The display has a hybrid user interface that lets you use either the five-way button for menu navigation if you prefer traditional controls or your fingers if you prefer touch controls. Either way, the intuitive navigation makes setting controls and sharing images a snap.\n\nFULL HD VIDEO RECORDING\nThe WB250F captures lifelike video at 1,080p Full HD resolution. The camera shoots video in the H.264 format, which allows you to record for longer than cameras using MJPEG video.\n\nWI-FI CONNECTIVITY FOR EASY SHARING AND FACEBOOK UPLOAD\nThanks to built-in Wi-Fi, transferring your images and sharing them no longer requires memory cards or cables. You won't have to worry about running out of space, either.\n\nWith the dedicated Direct Link hot key, you can quickly connect to Wi-Fi networks. Once connected, you can save photos and videos directly to a computer or cloud service as you shoot. Print photos wirelessly or share them with your friends instantly by uploading them straight to Facebook or YouTube. With dual band Wi-Fi support, you'll have faster and more stable connections to the wireless networks around you.\n\nCONNECT TO YOUR SMARTPHONE FOR MORE FEATURES\nThe WB250F works with Samsung's Smart Camera App (for iPhone and Android), which lets you instantly pair your camera with your smartphone and gives you features such as AutoShare and Remote ViewFinder.\n\nWhen AutoShare is activated, all the pictures you take on your camera are automatically sent to your smartphone. Remote ViewFinder turns your phone into a viewfinder and lets you preview images, adjust camera settings, frame the scene, and tag the shot location from up to 30 feet away. When you need to take a group shot with yourself in it, Remote ViewFinder makes it easy.\n\nCLOUD SERVICE BACKUP WITH MICROSOFT SKYDRIVE\nNever worry about losing your photos, even if your camera is lost or stolen. If your camera is connected to Wi-Fi, the WB250F will automatically copy the images you take to a Microsoft SkyDrive account. This feature not only automatically backs up all your photos, but also lets you easily make more room on your memory card by deleting shots without fear you'll lose them.\n\nSMART AUTO 2.0 FOR SHARP SHOTS EVERY TIME\nThe Smart Auto 2.0 feature automatically analyzes the current shooting environment and chooses the right mode to give you the best possible picture. And Smart Face Recognition remembers the faces of up to 20 of your friends and family and automatically focuses on them first, so your important subjects are always clear.\n\nPRODUCT DIMENSIONS AND WEIGHT\nThe WB250F measures 2.43 by 4.18 by 0.85 inches (H x W x D) and weighs 0.41 pounds.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\nWB250F Smart Camera, Li-Ion battery (SLB-10A), power plug, USB charging cable, wrist strap, start-up guide, and warranty card.\n\nWB250F SMART CAMERA\nCOBALT BLACK\nAT A GLANCE:\n * 14.2-megapixel BSI sensor for optimal low-light performance\n * 18x zoom lens provides versatile range\n * 3-inch hybrid touch display with easy navigation\n * Built-in Wi-Fi for easy sharing and data transfers\n * Captures Full HD Video\n\nSelect your shooting mode with the rotator dial. View larger.\n\nAutomatically send photos to your smartphone with AutoShare. View larger.",
