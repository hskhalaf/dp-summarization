I'm replacing for one with WAY MORE positive reviews.",

I've used it on sliced fruit, crumbled cheese, bricks of cheese, various meats (cooked and raw), and it vacuum seals them all with ease. I hate to waste food so being able to prolong the quality and expiration date is amazing. I haven't used the scale since I don't really have a use for it I bought this model because of the price and brand. I read reviews on other, cheaper food vacuums that said spending a little extra on a Nesco was a better investment and so far I'd have to agree. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",

Not a big deal; just seems that it should be able to run on the same source as the machine. the batteries are included so sit is really a non-issue. In any event, operation is straightforward. You can use any brand bag that fits. It is fast and efficient. Very pleased with this Nexco sealer.",

I love the fact that it has a scale on top too. It is simple to use and seals quickly. The one star ding is for the terrible quality bags that it comes with. I had to go and purchase a different brand because 4 different bags that I sealed (and double sealed two), had air back in them within 20 minutes. The new brand bags didn't have these issues. I would highly recommend and purchase again. I'm just sorry I waited so long to have one!",
