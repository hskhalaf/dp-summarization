The fans are put together with double sided tape it seems like and they keep coming undone which is a bit irritating. I'm going to have to staple them so they stay in a circle. 2. The tassel banner takes a bit of work to put together and the string it came with to string through the tassels and hang is very flimsy and broke twice when i was putting it together. Other than that I was very pleased with the order.",

The tassels were much easier to assemble than similar products I\u2019ve bought in the past and were elegant and pretty. We paired these with pale pink and white striped plates and napkins that were edged in gold foil, and they looked lovely together. I highly recommend this product; well worth the investment if a tasteful, elegant shower is what you have in mind.",
