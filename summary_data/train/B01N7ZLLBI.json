      "text": "I've purchased at least 5 refurbished unlocked phones and all of them have arrived in good contitions except the one I bought from Mobile Shop USA. The phone was faulty and the screen failed the moment I splashed some water on it (the phone is supposed to be water-resistant and be able to withstand a splash or two). My conclusion is that the phones that they provide are not quality products and should not be certified refurbished. I encourage buying unlocked phones just avoid buying from them. I bought another Samsung S7 Active from another provider and it has worked perfectly; I have actually submerged it fully in water and nothing has happened.",
