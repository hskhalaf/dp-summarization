Finally got to try them out this weekend! They were both awesome! We have some pretty good surf relative to Florida here at Flagler Beach. Lately with Northeast winds, they waves have been even higher! The boards were SO much fun, and performed wonderfully. Rode the waves till I was exhausted! Highly recommend this company!",

I didn\u2019t know that. This product came with that advice. I\u2019ll put it to the test during an upcoming beach vacation.",

My kids barely used it; my son basically laid on it and paddled himself across the pool.

      "text": "I bought 8 bodyboards and this is the only one with a defect. This board developed a large bubble under the skin after one trip to beach. Unfortunately since this was a Christmas gift, the beach trip was beyond the return window. An email was sent to the vendor but no response was received. Do not recommend due to negative reaction by vendor.",

      "BPS STORM Bodyboard Pack comes with a Super lightweight Body Board and fantastic PREMIUM coiled bodyboard leash (MRRP $16.99 on its own), plus a set of fin tethers to make sure you don't lose your swim fins. The premium and super comfy coiled leash will keep your board attached to you at all times. PLEASE NOTE: Pack includes one bodyboard, one leash and two fin savers. Leash and Fin tethers will be at the very bottom of the board wrapped in a tight bundle underneath the plastic wrapping",
      "HDPE Slick bottom to intensify the performance driven by the board. It does not only add strength, but it also makes the bodyboard a resistance-free riding for improved speed and maneuverability. Its EPS core, bottom rear channels is for great execution and a crescent tail to enhance it more. Please check the size that will suit you by using the recommendation chart on the pictures",
      "When you purchase you will be receiving printed instructions included w / the board written by us (with photos of course!) on how to install your leash and use your fin tethers. We'll also tell you how to look after your STORM Body Board by leaving the board 'white side up' when in the sun. (This is the same for ALL 'soft' surfboards, Body-boards and SUP's as this stops air pressure building up within the board).",
