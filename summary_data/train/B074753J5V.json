I read the safety instructions and thought this would be a safer than a heat lamp but now I'm not so sure. I believe the problem was that the mat had rolled up partially and the parts that were touching melted the plastic cover, maybe if it is kept totally flat it would be safe. I used this in combination with a thermostat controller but also had issues with it getting hot enough, it seemed barely warm the other times I had checked it.",
