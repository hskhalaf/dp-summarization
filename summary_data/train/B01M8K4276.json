The acid test -- when I introduce it to Princess-SweetiePie as soon as the weather gets a bit warmer --- she's been exiled to garage with a pad, heater, food, water & litterbox till the warmer weather permits using the cat-house awaiting on our raised deck. .",

My daughter and I were able to figure it out but we messed the roof hinge up by not putting the hinges on first and then the side rails. there were no marking on where to place the hinges on the roof and the sides of the roof. overall product is okay. I would say size wise if you are looking to put 2 small dogs in this then go for the next size up. We have a wiener dog mix and a small poodle and they are cramped.",

We bought this because it had the insulation which was a joke and did not fit in the house that was a nightmare to try to get that to work and it still never fit right so the roof never laid flat. Overall it provides shelter and was easy to put food in. Held up in the cold weather under a deck I\u2019m not sure how it would hold up if it were to get wet. This definitely saved some lives.",
