Add in nursing, and I was pretty much a dry husk. but I also have super sensitive skin. Most everything makes me break out, and holding my baby all the time, I needed to be extra careful. This grape seed oil is PERFECT! It provided the moisturizing I needed for my dried and cracking skin while not causing me to break out. It is also super light weight and non greasy. I actually think my skin looks younger after a few weeks. I little goes a long way too, so you definitely get your moneys worth with a bottle.",

Maybe it's the oil in my eye, but my undereyes look lighter to me Update: Didn't realize I had already left a review, but I came here to say that I love grapeseed oil! Apparently I thought this would help lighten my undereyes? -Shrug- Anyway, I mix ~60% Grapeseed oil with ~40% Neem oil and apply 5-7 drops of that mixture AM and PM. Grapeseed oil's high linoleic acid content has really helped my skin not get so clogged up. If I don't put enough grapeseed oil into my mixture, I feel like I can tell. Definitely will keep using grapeseed oil!",

I am a young 62 and am fortunate that most people think I am at least ten years younger when they meet me. Don't write many reviews unless I find a stellar product and this is one of those products.
