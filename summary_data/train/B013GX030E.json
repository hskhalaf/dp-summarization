      "text": "This is nice for a cheap Chinese-made watch box. At first, I was happy because the box presented my watches handsomely. After a month, I realized my automatic watches were not running accurately. Well, guess what? The metal engraving plate on the watch box front magnetized many of my automatic watches! It took several trips to the jewelers and over $150 to de-magnetize my watches to realize this. Bad design flaw.",

I liked the Glencor with 24 slots and the drawer, but I don't wear any other jewelry than my wedding ring, and have my closet organized already, so the space consumed wasn't justified for the storage gained. This box, however, slides right into where the 6 pillow version was, and simply takes up 2x the depth. I love the carbon fibre look, the hinge is just as good as the 6 pillow version and it works just as well, I just have more space for my watches!!! Now, that means I'm likely to go spend more money on timepieces!",

It was packaged well, constructed of nice materials, seems solid and sleek, but understated. My *only* suggestion would be for Glenor to consider another location for their logo which appears etched in the silver plate on the front. It's fairly quiet, but would like the design to stand on its own\u2014maybe even remove it entirely. If not, perhaps very small in the lower right corner of the plate or on the back side where the hinge is located.",

Of course, there is no winding for automatic watches, although a movement cradle, if developed for the box would in fact work. The quality looks sufficient for my purposes: convenient watch storage. The charge for the box was reasonable and it appears that it will hold up for quite a long time, properly cared for.",

It has plenty of space for the watches you want to put in and strap pillows are reassuringly well put together, as is the entirety of the box. This is not something that you're going to have to worry about falling to pieces in six months. Overall I fully recommend this as a five-star buy.",

The watch cushions need to fit snug otherwise they may scratch up the watches if you accidentally or intentionally move the watch box. Should have realized this earlier :(",

Not really an issue but just a nitpick that would have been a good feature (the hinges and weight of the door itself are enough for this to not really matter regardless). Not perfect, but a good enough display case for the price.",

Not a great problem to have but seeing I saved some money on a quality and beautifully made watch box maybe I can invest that cash flow into getting some more wrist candy. The glass top allows you to clearly see all the watches and show off your style and personal taste in luxury wrist wear. Highly recommended for a young guy looking to show off your watches without dropping a big price tag into building a custom box.",

The top of the case is plexiglass where you can view your watches without opening the case, although some reviews stated it was glass. It definitely isn\u2019t glass.

This set holds up to 12 which allows me the ability to purchase more watches for him (lol). He loves the glass see through part and proudly displays his \"nicer\" watches (as he calls them). I really love this purchase and may end up purchasing a box for myself.",

I had to laugh when my husband calls them by that term). The clear top allows him to see his watches clearly and keep everything protected. It is a win/win for both spouses because he likes displaying the watches and I like how it keeps them organized. This is a must-have product for anyone who has several watches.",
