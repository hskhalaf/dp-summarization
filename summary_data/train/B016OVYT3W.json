I put the eye masks in the refrigerate overnight and wear them as I\u2019m getting ready in the morning a few days a week. It is so refreshing! I find that the days I use them, I barely have to wear any make up and it gives my under eyes a nice fresh, glossy look. I am very happy with this product and am a frequent buyer! They do tend to slide down as you are moving around/getting ready.",
