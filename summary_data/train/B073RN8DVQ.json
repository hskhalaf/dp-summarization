I wear them a lot in the winter and when doing around the house construction and when it is wet or nasty outside. They are extremely easy to get on and off. They are some of the most comfortable shoes I own. After a year of wear they are still in like new shape. Love them, would buy again.",

No arch support and very limited cushioning. The grip is plenty good but your feet will be screaming at you by days end. If you do get these I recommend some 'gel' insoles at the very least and get your size in the wides.",

They have put up with mud, mulch, sand, stone, grass clippings, brush, asphalt inches of rain and high temperatures. They look very ugly now as you can see from the photos.

Since I have had them I have gone on anywhere from 7-14 mile hikes on very rocky terrain and the boots have held up very well. Excellent choice!",
