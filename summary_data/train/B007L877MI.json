The selection of coffee and beverages is awesome, even if it might be a bit less than K-Cup (I think). Basic feature like Auto On/Off and temperature make it simple to use and convenient. For some reason, it took over 40 minutes to warmup the first time I started, making me think I had a DoA unit. However, maybe it was just cold from the shipping because once it went through, it was back to the normal 3-4 minutes of preheating. It's been a week now and I'm very happy with it.",

I especially like the sweet tea cups and the freedom of making a 10 ounce raspberry mocha for myself to enjoy on the way to work. I am an inexperienced coffee drinker. So the Vue has made it so easy to try a lot of different coffees and teas. I bought the Vue really with my husband in mind because it will brew 18 ounces of coffee at one time! Buy the plastic small pitcher also. It lets you brew over ice twice. (The brew over ice carafe)",

Pros: 1) Great tasting, like traditionally-brewed, coffee. 2) Coffee strength and volume are adjustable. 3) Temperature is adjustable, and can be very very hot if desired (ouch!). 4) Great-looking brewer! Cons: 1) Can not fit travel mug under spout. Keep in mind that most mugs can hold 14-16 oz, and if you get a giant mug, you can hold the full 18 oz. 2) Limited availability of Vue cups, but they are worth it, since the coffee quality is better than K-cups. (Keep buying this model, and the availability will increase).",

We looked at the Tassimo machines but the coffee is not widely available so we decided to go with the Keurig because it did everything and we can find the cups everywhere. The machine has been everything she has wanted and more we even found a reusable cup at bed bath and beyond that allows you to use your own coffee grounds which makes things nice. Everything the machine makes it makes well I highly recommend it",
