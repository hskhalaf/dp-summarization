      "text": "I have bought over 5 over the last 3 years and love the idea of well stirred coffee, and foaming. But the travel mug battery department does not hold the batteries tight so it does not work till open and fidget. The cup lid has a habit of splitting down to he center often, and customer service doesn't reply to your enquiry at times. Cup still looks good and keeps coffee hot but the novelty of the stir is lost with remorse.",
