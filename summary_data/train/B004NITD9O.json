While it appears to be a rare one NOT leaking from the oil reserve, its chain did come loose after only making a half dozen cuts of a four inch limb. The chain seemed dull nearly from the start and had a nasty habit of cramming debris into the drive gear housing after that same initial exercise, which also absorbed and blocked proper dispensing from the auto-oiler, making the bar smoke after only seconds of work from lack of lube. Obviously I should've learned my lesson from a WORX lawn edger, which went up in smoke after less than a full season's moderate work.",

The standard bar oil is much too thick. It doesn't lubricate the bar and chain so the wear is accelerated greatly. Second, the automatic chain tensioner can get clogged and non-functional. This happened to me cutting up very fiberous wood (a big Yucca). The tensioner clogged and the chain became very slack. Hanging down below the bar. Luckily I saw it before it flew off and injured me. This happened twice so it was not a random thing.",

It is well balanced and handles deftly. The only issue I have is with the amount of bar oil it comes with. There is not enough to use the saw right out of the box according to the instructions. At the time of purchase it should be flagged as needing bar oil so you can buy it then rather than have to run to the local hardware store before using it. That was very annoying.",

      "text": "I bought this 16 inch chainsaw because the biggest tree I needed to cut down in my yard was 14-15 inches thick. This is my first chainsaw. The saw came with the hand guard in the \"stop\" position, so the saw cannot be started. To enable the saw, you must pull the hand guard all the way back (towards your hand). After I figured this out, it was easy to use. Also, every time I release the trigger, I also push the hand guard forward to disable the saw. In my use, I had to add oil about every half hour. The saw weighs almost 12 pounds; I wish it were lighter (like 10 pounds).",

It is well-designed and not difficult to use for a cautious novice clearing overgrowth along a yard perimeter. It's not horribly noisy and the safety features are good.",

It's not a flimsy light machine, it's heavier than I expected, yet it cuts through branches in lightening speed that my gardener fails to see. I never thought I'd be excited about a chainsaw, but I am with this one, it has no smelly GAS odor since it's electric and I'm happy.

    "description": "The WORX 16\u201d 3.5 HP 14.5 Amp chainsaw is a cut above the rest. For starters, the exclusive WORX patented tool-free chain replacement and auto-tensioning system eliminates the headaches faced with most other chainsaws \u2013 no lumberjack experience necessary to operate this chainsaw! The auto-tension system includes a single, oversized knob that automatically secures the bar and chain and maintains proper tension while you\u2019re working. The auto-tensioning system also extends bar and chain life by eliminating any chance of over-tightening. What's more, all-metal dogs at the base of the 16\u201d bar help add stability during cutting, while an easy-to-lubricate sprocket on the bar nose helps preserve the life of the tool. Powerful enough for your toughest jobs, WORX electric chainsaws produce anywhere from 3.5 peak horsepower. The WORX 16\u201d chainsaw also offers gas-free, hassle-free operation. Different from gas-powered chain saws, this electric chainsaw doesn't require you to mix oil and gas or deal with difficult startups. And unlike the competition, WORX features an automatic oiler that provides constant lubrication to both the bar and chain along with a 6.75-ounce oil reservoir with an oil level indicator. Designed for safety and comfort, this WORX chainsaw includes a built-in safety chain brake that stops the chain in seconds whenever improper contact is made, protecting you in the event of kickback. Additionally, a rubber over-molded rear handle and ergonomic full-wrap front handle let you work in full control and comfort.",
