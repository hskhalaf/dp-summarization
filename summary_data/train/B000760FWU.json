Although it was a trial and error effort to find the best location for them. At first I placed one in front and one in back of each axle wheel. There was still a bit if rocking. I then moved them closer ro each corner of my trailer frame. Bingo! My trailer feels very stable. Note that these are for stabilizing purposes only and it isn't meant to be used for lifting your trailer. It even says so right on the frame of each jack.",

One each on the front corners of the frame (there were already stabilizer jacks at the back) made our camper rock solid, and I didn't have to install any hardware. When done, the support comes out of the base, and the bases stack neatly so they hardly take up any space. When I got them I wasn't even convinced there were four in the box until I opened it.

However with blocks under the base and between the pad and trailer frame the 10cm range is good enough to level the load over reasonably flat ground. Adjustment is easy from about 25 to 35cm (10 to 14\"). The rotating pad gives good support and won't put too much force into a small area on the trailer. The aluminum base is light but strong and stable. I use the stands to take the full weight off of my trailer for the winter.",

Therefore just as you are getting it tight the entire jack will rotate and wobble which could cause the cup to fall off the trailer frame. Do not buy this product thinking you are getting a great price on a good RV jack. You are getting a threaded rod with a handle and a base. I would be disappointed if I had spent a lot of money but for the price; whatever.",

Makes moving around inside the camper much more pleasent if someone is trying to sleep. I only use two fo them but I might just use all 4 for a week long camping trip.",

The stands are a bit smaller then expected, suppose I could have looked at the overall dimensions more carefully. I needed to shore them a bit being that the trailer is on un-level ground to begin with however they work just fine on our 2007 Aljo. Small, lightweight design, break down fast and easy, and a snap to store. I gave the bolts a light coat of oil to help slow any rust being they are not galvanized.",

These will take most of the tire roll out that allows the bounce and movement in travel trailer tires and frames. These are small, light weight and adjustable. Nothing will take all the movement out of the travel trailer, but these drastically reduce how the kids shake our trailer. I highly recommend these if you want to reduce the bounce and shake from your travel trailer too.",
