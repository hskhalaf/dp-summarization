I have been taking these biotin supplements since September 9th and today is November 2nd. So almost two months I've been taking them. My hair grows so slow. I definitely feel though that I have gained some length going from chin/shoulder length to well past shoulder length in this time frame. I take one supplement every single day. I don't know if it's actually helping my hair grow but you can see it definitely has grown so I'm giving this 5 stars and will continue to keep taking them.",

So I ordered this vitamins and I couldn\u2019t be happier within a week I noticed I was hardly loosing any more hair. My nails are growing twice as fast as before and they seem to be stronger. I will definitely keep buying these vitamins. Try them you won\u2019t regret it.",

      "text": "This product NO LONGER contains carrageenan, they have updated to better ingredients. With that said, this has caused me break outs too. Cystic ones. After doing some research, I've learned that it's the Biotin itself, and not this particular brand of biotin that is causing break outs. This can be countered by taking a dry vitamin A and E supplement, and making sure to drink plenty of water. Perhaps also look at what foods heavy in biotin that you're eating, your body only needs so much. There are lots of articles online. This product did help my hair and nails grow faster, did nothing for my skin and had to start taking vitamin A with it. Now all is well.",
