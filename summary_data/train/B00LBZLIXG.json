Initially I was looking to get an ultrawide monitor but now that I see the size of this I'm glad i didn't. The build quality is great. Everything feels solid and the bezel is tiny. Controls for the menus etc are good however I would personally say the power button is a little close to the menu ones as I've turned it off while I've been tinkering. The resolution and refresh rates are great too. Games look so much better than before. I'm suprised at the difference it's made. Very happy so far and will write back if anything changes.",

No degredation, no problems, ulmb/gsync/od works perfectly. Comes with stand pre-fitted so you just take it out the box and plug it in. (Not tested 3d-vision). Great monitor, not had other monitors of this calibre but this is fine for me, can definitely tell the difference from my syncmaster t220 xD. Reccommend+",

      "text": "This screen is nothing but amazing. 144 FPS 3D vision at 2560 x 1440 (First monitor to go 3D Vision beyond 1080p) - Say no more. While it's not 4k, it is 144 FPS and that makes a huge difference on online FPS games. The color is good for a large TN panel GSync is awesome too, when you are running games at the higher res, it smooths it all out and dips in FPS below the 144. That said, I would like to see this monitor in Freesync side by side to compare the dfference as you are paying a premium for GSync. GSync is well worth the money IMO but obviously free would be better.",

The power supply died after 7 months and so called Asus customer support (will likely be a small department judging by the lack of 'support' they do), won't change the PSU because I bought the monitor from a company in Italy through Amazon UK. They are slippery characters to deal with, left me with a lost temper. They seem to forget the PSU still has their branding on it, is their responsibility no matter where bought, dodgy, very dodgy indeed. Do yourself a favour, buy another brand.",

Only thing is that the manufacturers power cable is faulty, when your screen goes to sleep it just doesn't wake up, you have to unplug it and plug it back in. Didn't want the hassle of sending the whole screen back just to get a new plug for it so I bought a 3rd party replacement power plug and now it works fine. Does give off a bit of heat, even at 50% brightness, very power hungry screen. Enjoy",

The monitor itself for both work and gaming is amazing the level of detail and the fluidity of the display is truly a seminal experience, a word of warning however you need serious graphics horsepower to enjoy this monitor to its fullest expect to need a high level sli set up (ie gtx 970 sli) or something like the new TitanX to really be able to utilise this as more mundane graphics cards solutions are not going to push over 120 frames at this resolution without pretty much everything being on low (or they might not at all).",
