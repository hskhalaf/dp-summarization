The ones I'm replacing are a different style that has been discontinued. I purchased the 9M which is what I have always bought. These are a little too short. All the other Keds I own (that fit fine) were made in China, these were made in Vietnam. Don't know if it is just the style or if a different method of sizing is used between the countries. They are made very well and would recommend buying them a 1/2 size larger. I'll be returning them and reordering them i a 9 1/2M.",

It bothers me a lot and I could clearly tell they when I first took them out of the box. Anyways, I still love them. Cute shoes, maybe I'm just crazy.

I could definitely upgrade the laces, they are about average quality. Others pros include- good toe protection, fairly waterproof, and good amount of comfort if you are on your feet all day.",
