I've tried pumice stones and healing balms and gel socks, but this $5 bottle of foot cream blows everything out of the water, especially if you apply it every day after your shower and put some socks on. I've been doing it for years now and me feet look like they get daily manicures. You dont need a lot and it lasts forever.",

Honestly I just searched foot lotion and this price seemed reasonable enough to spend on a lotion that I might not like. It was very thick and definitely did its job of moisturizing my feet after using the Amope, but I didn't care for the smell. It was very bland and I would have preferred a little bit of a smell. Nothing strong, but at least something. That's just a personal preference, so if you don't mind having not much of a scent to your lotions then this one is great for getting your feet nice and soft.",
