This unit runs all day. I put water in it about 0730 and I am dumping water out 9 hours later. I can see the constant \"smoke\" so I know it is working. I love that it uses a usb (as well as regular plug) because I have few outlets and mostly use my laptop at work. I highly recommend this.",

I'm absolutely thrilled with the performance of this diffuser. It's completely silent and diffuses for about 6 hours with about 1/2 cup of water. I really didn't think I would use the light mode, but it is one of my favorite features. This diffuser (with my favorite oil blends) offers a completely relaxing/stress reducing experience.

The design is not optimal either. In my picture the red circle is around a well of water that will never diffuse because it is so low. And where the arrow is pointing a bubble has started forming at the center spout that stops the diffusing mist. The only thing I like about this is the size.",
