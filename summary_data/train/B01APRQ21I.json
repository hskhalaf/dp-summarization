      "text": "I've worn Merrell's for years now - the rule with them is if they don't feel right immediately out of the box, they are never going to be right. And these definitely didn't feel right. They are tight along the top - hard to get your foot into. And then they are loose around the width and shorter in the toe area. Just don't have the same fit that any of my other Merrell shoes have had. Going back tomorrow. Can recommend the Merrell Jungle Lace AC+ though - those fit like a dream!",

      "text": "These are great lace-ups. I'm on my feet all day and the support they give is wonderful. In fact, I had to walk a few miles to work a few weeks ago and these were the perfect shoes in which to do so. The first few times I wore them the leather felt a bit stiff but it softened right up after a few wearings. I love the look and the color is different... different in a good way! The grey-blue slate color goes with most of my wardrobe and is interesting without being loud or gaudy. Finally, these shoes are a step up from sneakers so they are unquestionably work appropriate for the high school where I teach.",

I ordered a size 10; I usually wear a 9.5 but after reading the reviews (on other websites) I thought it would be best to go up 1/2 a size. The stiffness was addressed on other websites, but the reviewer stated that it did soften up quickly. Unfortunately I just found the shoe extremely uncomfortable.",
