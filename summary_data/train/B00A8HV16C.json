      "text": "I've been using SharkBite connectors for many years so when I decided to use PEX tubing for my new bathtub/shower installation I needed a PEX cutter. I didn't want to spend too much money because I probably won't need it again once the installation is complete. I usually use copper and soldered connections because of their durability but I wanted to see how PEX tubing worked out. I gave this cutter only four stars because you must pay close attention when cutting the PEX tubing or the cut won't be square. Without something to keep the tubing in place while cutting it's very difficult to get a good cut.",

It's apparent there is zero quality control in the manufacturing process. I'm surprised SharkBite would put their name on this product. I have used other SharkBite products without a problem, but this makes me rethink using any of their products if they go through the same \"quality control.\"",
