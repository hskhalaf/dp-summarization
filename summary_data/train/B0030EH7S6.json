Nothing shoots out from anywhere no holes for food to get through. It\u2019s quiet it\u2019s easy to clean up it does get waste buildup but takes seconds to clean it up!!! I can 100% tell you this machine is the best. We\u2019ve tried machines from $60 to $200 and they were all terrible especially the more expensive machine that was the worst. You will not be disappointed if you order this machine. I did the leg work for you !!! Extremely satisfied!!!",

I will stick with my Green Star masticating juicer. It cost more money up front and takes longer to extract the juice but the pulp is very dry.

There is no marking or writing to tell you which is correct and it's not clearly mentioned in manual either. Initially I ended up putting it wrong and no juice will be able to flow thru.

Of course this depends when you use soft fruits such as mangos and oranges. Other than that it is about average to clean it after each use and can be ready to go within a matter of minutes. I would certainly explore the purchase of this juicer over the Breville and other brands from the practicality and speed variability it has.",

    "description": "Item Display Length:19.0 Inches| Display Height:12.0 Inches\n\nCUISINART CJE-1000 JUICE EXTRACTOR\nEquipped with a 1000-watt powerful motor, this easy-to-use juice extractor makes it exceptionally convenient to enjoy fresh, healthy fruit and vegetable juice from the comfort of home.
