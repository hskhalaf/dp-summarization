Wash our clothes, spin the water out, hang to dry. Saved us tons of money. Took 7 weeks for our household goods to arrive to Hawaii. Don\u2019t expect to do large loads or the dryer to dry your clothes completely. It just spins out the water then you air dry them.",

It does have its downside like manual drain and fill and small extractor area but it is what it is. A perfect unit for any camper or small apartment. Nice and quiet as well. I bought for my RV but I will say I sure wish I had this unit when I was apartment living. Also great for students\ud83d\ude01",

Use a good detergent and don't overfill it because it's not a large washer and you'll be good to go no more trips to the laundry mat/ family members during this time of covid . It actually could save lives because your not being exposed to others and your washing in the privacy of your home ! It's worth it get it like yesterday!",

The drain hose also leaked and needs to be either placed flat or in a downward position to drain. Very messy! I am planning on returning the product. Also, the manufacturer included a flier for support with the address of pyleusa.com/support which does not work. There is not a support feature on pyleusa.com and this product is not listed at all on the site.",
