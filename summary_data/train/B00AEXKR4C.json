I think the vent holes can get blocked if you're not careful, but paying attention to how everything is working together on your face, should prove useful. Also, since the foam is removable, it possible that it can get knocked out of alignment. This happened once, and it was immediately obvious to me. I straightened things out and everything worked great again. These are a nice, comfortable pair of glasses at a great price.",

Also, once on, ear protection pushes the bottom of the glasses away from the bottom of my face and digs the earpiece into my ear allowing dust under the glasses. When I put these glasses on, I was amazed at both the comfort and function. Not only does the soft gasket sit comfortably on my face but the earpieces almost disappear under my 3M hearing protection. Working with a table saw, circular saw and router, I saw no visible sign of dust under the gasket. Worn for a total of two hours straight...the only small noticable deficit was that they fogged occasionally.",

These tend to angle down slightly, compared to other safety glasses (ex. Uvex brand fit me fine).",

The fog build up on these is also very heavy, so it's make it very difficult to see while wearing them.",
