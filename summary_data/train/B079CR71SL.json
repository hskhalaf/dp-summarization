It self leveled and provided a flawless, glossy, level surface. I lather/rinsed/repeated 3times to get a good 1/4 inch thick surface. I purchased some cheap, disposable plastic tubs and a wooden paint stick. Cleanup was a breeze. Just throw bucket and stick away.

      "text": "Cons: this resin is very thick - so it's hard not to mix in a lot of air bubbles, that are impossible to eliminate. Tried to mix it with a drill and by hand - both methods resulted in a huge amount of bubbles. It's not like with other, more fluid, resins: bubble will not come out by itself - you need to blow or torch it out. And the instruction says just that. The problem is some of the bubbles are tiny and only seen on a bright sun that is not present where I'm working. Pros: this resin is very clear",

It was for the best because a second coat made it look much better. Be sure to cover right away. 320 grit works good if you want to add more, and be sure to sand every square inch or it won\u2019t bond.",
