      "text": "Bottom line: This is a good tool but the 8CR13MoV seems like it could be harder for everyday use. However that is offset by the price. Pros: The compact design Inexpensive compared to competitors Useful for opening boxes 5 tools in one, strap cutter, bottle opener, two wrenches and standard screwdriver Cons: The standard screwdriver is very thin, making it not as useful as a screwdriver. In order to give the tip a wider profile I ground it down Cover is not very secure and easily lost The steel is not wear resistant, so you'll need to maintain cutting edge with a small round sharpener",

I like the mix of tools including the O2 bottle wrench. I don't know how many times I've dropped the O2 wrench and had to scramble trying to find it in the grass, rocks and etc. while we were working. Great backup to have in case the wrench decides to vanish or break.",
