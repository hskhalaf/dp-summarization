It's well-made, the cutting tools are easy to attach to the pilot drill, and I was amazed at how quickly the tools cut through wood -- really almost like butter! If you are a professional and you need to drill a lot of holes in studs or joists, this toolset will pay for itself the first time you use it, IMHO.",

The plugs come out easy as the carbide teeth are wider than the sidewall of the bit and they use a spade bit in the center. I accidentally started one with the Dewalt Drill in hammer mode and the hole cut even faster. These are like other hole saws in their ability to, unlike self-feeds, to cut holes on an angle. The largest CON is: These leave a ROUGH hole. Lenox is still my go to hole saw when neat holes are needed, but they take more time as it's harder to get the plugs out.",

I had to do it in two steps due to the depth but other than that it performed great! I also like the fact that they slightly oversize the hole sizes. For instance a 4\" dryer pipe needs a hole slightly larger than 4\". The big hawg kit had a 4 1/4\" hole cutter that left just enough slack to easily get the vent pipe through. Finish it off with a little foam to make it air tight and it's done. Good set of cutters.",
