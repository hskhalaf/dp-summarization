We contacted the seller and they took it right back and gave us our money back. They were the nicest people ever. And he says he really loved the ball, even though he couldn't use it. So while I can't tell you whether or not the ball would have helped him finally bowl a 300 game, the seller is terrific and I wish they sold cat food. Because, well, cats.",

Timeless is the first release in our all-new Signature Line, an unprecedented and versatile series focusing on one-of-a-kind products.

The combination of these unique attributes gives the ball a fast-revving benefit like the !Q Tour with the hitting power of the Hy-Road. The inception of the Dual-Drive was born of a sprawling development process that has spanned years. This could not be achieved without placing a weight block of specific size and shape inside of another weight block. The outer weight block incorporates strategically placed geometric shapes that, in conjunction with the inner weight block, establishes a new standard in bowling ball motion \u2013 faster revving action with a higher level of energy transfer at the pins.
