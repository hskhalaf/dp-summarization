My car has an AUX input, so this device connects easily and simply, with better audio than going through FM. The display screen is not great -- the song titles are hard to read -- but it's OK, and it's certainly better than nothing. Plus, at this price point, I wasn't expecting a smartphone-quality display. Also, my device included a card that gave me an 18-month warranty, as long as I registered on the Nulaxy website.",

Unlike so many FM transmitters and Bluetooth devices, this one has excellent frequency response and as best as my picky ears can tell, very low distortion. Bluetooth pairing to my iPhone is fast and easy. My only nit is that the unit appears to be drifting in frequency when it's left in a very hot car. But I would absolutely buy this thing again.

      "text": "After reformatting a flash drive (this transmitter reads only FAT file systems, not NTFS), this works fine for playing music from the drive. I had to reset the frequency a couple of times, but I finally found one that was truly clear, and there was minimal buzz. It seems like the closer a frequency is to getting transmission bleed, the more static or buzz there will be. The bluetooth pairs well with my Android phone, and it takes calls with good clarity. It's a bit squirrelly with outgoing calls -- I haven't got it to work yet, despite trying what I think are all the options.",
