      "verdict": "HUF proudly brings in Brad Cromer\u2019s debut pro model, the eponymous Cromer. A flat-out minimalist skate silhouette, the Cromer is precisely and stylishly pared down to only what\u2019s necessary for skating. It also exhibits nautical styling (echoing Sperry designs), which is accentuated by the rubberized sturdy toe cap.Perhaps the Cromer\u2019s biggest feature, the rubber toe piece runs around the suede upper, extending the foxing tape. This improves durability a lot and helps the shoe retain its shape longer. Priced at $75 apiece, the Cromer proves to be a good deal to pass up.",
      "pros": [
        "The HUF Cromer has mostly racked up five-star ratings from reviewers who have praised its sterling quality",
        "Getting a pair is so budget-friendly that some shoppers say they couldn\u2019t pass up on such a good deal",
        "Its simple, classy, nautical-inspired silhouette has appealed to most customers",
        "The majority of testers like how comfortable and chill the Cromers are when skating and hanging out afterward",
        "Many skaters are impressed with how well the Cromer holds up with daily shredding",
        "A lot of reviewers say that it breaks in completely and gets so flexible after just one session",
        "This pair looks so versatile that one can go from the skate park to a dinner date later on them, according to a couple of user reviews",
        "At least one skater has pointed out that the eyelets are set more to the top to prevent lace breakage",
        "Quite a handful of shoppers share that the Cromers have become their favorite pair, adding that they\u2019ve bested their Vans shoes",
        "The Cromer delivers much boardfeel and long-lasting grip, according to some skaters"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "The Cromer is not suitable for high-impact skating as it doesn\u2019t have sufficient cushioning and padding, according to some reviewers",
        "Several users remark that it lacks arch support and recommend replacing the insoles with thicker ones",
        "Quite a handful of skaters observe that the shoe sits quite low on feet, which makes the ankles feel exposed and vulnerable",
        "A few wearers say that the end part of the shoe digs at their Achilles heel",
        "Some colors don\u2019t appear the same in person as they do online, according to some shoppers"

This is why you should buy these Cromers: - the toecap is no joke, it makes your shoes last longer. - these have vulcanized board feel, and they're not too bad for jumping down s***. - You're supporting a core skate brand. - they break-in in one sesh, and then they are super flexible. Btw this isnt somekind of paid review, i bought em with my own cash. Get these shoes and get your hellride on.",

Probably more yellow than picture but \"tanny Olive\" is not a good descriptive color name. I would give it 4 stars if my son didn't hate yellow shoes... He's keeping them to skate in since he won't care what happens to them and yellow color won't matter much.",

The internal heel counter also features a strategically placed canvas binding that is designed to lock the heel in place. Branding and details were inspired by Brad\u2019s affinity for 90\u2019s noise bands and \u2018shoegaze\u2019 cover art.",
