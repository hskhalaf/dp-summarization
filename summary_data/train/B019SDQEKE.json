I'm blond(ish), so I find that the tint emphasizes and defines my lashes with a natural look that fits my lifestyle (over 40, working mom). BUT if I do get to take my lashes out at the end of the day, I can add a black mascara on top and get a dramatic evening look. Just a fabulous product, especially if you are fair and don't want to look like you have false eyelashes on at a 9am meeting or playdate.",

When I saw this I was happy to see brown and the brand is great but it states on the box only that to apply regular mascera after the primer after 6 hours!! Who has that amount of time to wait. I tried it and waited a hour and by the time I put on my mascera my lashes went from separated to clumped. Benefit is a great product but this mascera is not. It doesn't work well as a primer at all. Maybe a regular mascera only but not that great kinda disappointed",
