A lot of people mentioned that they got half a size bigger than their normal fit & that this worked for them. So, I followed suit. Ran twice in them & found them fractionally large though very comfortable & well cushioned. With my propensity for tripping at the best of times, I decided to use them as casual shoes & they have fitted the bill perfectly! Not using them for my original purpose, but very happy with them nonetheless!",
