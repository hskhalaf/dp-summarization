But the quality of the picture is much improved over my previous ancient PS2..they must have changed something..still using same large screen..Panasonic 30+incher etc...That could change of course..someday..I might go back to playing some console games..I quit console games years ago and just stick with PC gaming..but who knows..I'm not so good with the controller..had hand surgery..easier for me to play games with a keyboard and mouse. Goodluck",

Customer support has not helped and repairs cost $100+. If you are going to buy this make sure to buy a warranty as you'll need to repair many many times a year.",
