I believe it has a two year warranty and am waiting to hear back on what they want to do. Up until a few days ago this was a 5 star product especially for the price.",

Ended up spending more time waiting for the p.o.s. to reset itself than actually tilling.

Unless you have an extremely large area or need to go deeper than 6 to 8 inches I can\u2019t imagine why you would rent a tiller for $70 when you can buy and own this one for about $95. If you rotate the wheels up you can dig even deeper which is what we did when we were planting several potted plants. Highly recommended",

The foam-covered handle was comfortable with little to no annoying vibration on the hands. Tillers were easy to clean by hand...cannot rinse it off as it's electric. Cons: It is electric and your extension cord will be a constant challenge keeping it out of the path of the blades. If you plan on using this often, consider a gas engine model.",

All tillers are dangerous but as light as this is pulling it backwards you need to use extra caution. It does not till real deep but its adequate for a home garden and does not require the maintenance that a gas powered tiller does. Recommended.",

Chopped through hard-pack like butter, and slices thumb-sized roots no problem. Update: after several weeks with no rain, tilled part of my front yard with no problems. The ground was hard as a rock. Pro-tip, keep an eye on the cord. A bit of a hastle, but well worth not having the burden of gas/stabilizers/winterizing/oil/engine maintenance.",

For $100 I couldn't be more than happy with this. I used the machine to dig out the entire edge of the mulch bed. You can see the land has a lot of rocks underneath to get through. It did take a beating but I'm sure it will tackle a bunch more projects around the house when I am ready.",
