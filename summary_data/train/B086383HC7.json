The i3 hasn't slowed down anything I've thrown at it and yes it isn't fanless but the fan can only be heard under really heavy use in an almost quiet room. The only issue right now is there aren't many USI stylus available to buy but that isn't really Lenovo's fault. I don't see how at this isn't the best Chromebook for the price that you can buy.",

Her only issue is the maximum volume of the speakers isn't quite as loud as she'd like, but she is hearing impaired.

I played BTD6 (android store); the game looked worse than the PC version and it dropped frames. I understand the Chrome OS doesn't work the greatest with Android apps.

Glad I did. It's solid, fast, great screen and has a great feel. The 4gb is not a problem. I'm not seeing some of the other concerns here in some Amazon reviews. Lots of Pros...no Cons.

But this 13\" version is only compatible with one HP pen that is not in stock anywhere. Also, I was expecting Linux availability, since it's an Intel CPU. But that option is not showing in the settings menu. So if your kid is expecting to play Minecraft, they're going to be disappointed.",

The chrome OS is much faster than Windows and seems way less buggy (plus you don't have to worry about any virus protection). Excluding any CPU intensive gaming, I think this computer can handle almost everything my brother will need from it. For the price/quality this is really a great deal.",
