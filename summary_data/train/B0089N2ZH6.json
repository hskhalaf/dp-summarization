If you don't know what EMS is you won't get an explanation for this adjustable feature unless you hunt around on-line. The Min - max- average-differential function only works in scan mode; no memory in hold mode. I wanted to compare two engines side by side on a boat, looking for differences between the two in order to uncover early problems. This unit will not let you take two discrete readings and compare the difference.",

I might not be using it to measure the melting point of various space-age materials but it's nice to know that it can tell me exactly how hot my boiling pot of oil is so I can make tasty french fries. Thanks Fluke!",
