Commenters also enjoyed how easy it was to put on and take off because there were no laces that needed to be tied. It was designed as a walking shoe, but that did not stop others from using it as fitness footwear because it was deemed supportive.",
      "pros": [
        "A vast majority of users commended the comfort offered by the Ryka Felicity because it helped to relieve pain caused by bunions, arthritis, corns, plantar fasciitis, and other foot issues",
        "A significant number of shoppers thought that the trainer looked cute and went well with their everyday clothing",
        "Droves of testers appreciated the snug fit of the upper and claimed that lengthwise, the footwear ran true to size",
        "Though marketed as a walking shoe, numerous folks wore this model when using the treadmill or the elliptical because it provided the needed support for the said activities",
        "The slip-on style pleased a lot of people especially those with mobility issues that made it hard for them to tie laces or deal with straps",
        "Plenty of wearers enjoyed the lightweight construction of the merchandise because their feet did not feel weighed down",
        "The footgear\u2019s ability to accommodate custom orthotics resonated well with multiple consumers who wanted more cushioning or better arch support",
        "Several individuals noted that the knitted upper kept their feet warm during cold weather"

      "cons": [
        "Some purchasers criticized the sole unit because it quickly got dirty and the material wore out fast",

I wore these shoes for a couple of days before a trip to break them in a little. I took a trip to DC and decided to wear these shoes. After ten hours of walking, these shoes completely wore down on the bottom and my feet are covered in the most painful uncomfortable blisters. The bottom of the sole is now soft and thin and close to having holes from being so worn down. I am completely disappointed and not satisfied with this shoe. Buyer beware. Will not be buying Ryka products again.",

      "text": "I do wish amazon could be able to get ryka\u2019s shoes in extra wide widths. You see, I have a brace that I wear on my left leg, from the foot up to my knee. I just cut the plastic that was on the heel, cut off the tongue that was under the laces, and replaced it with sweatshirt material. TaDa!",
