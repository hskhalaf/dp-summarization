The product was reasonably priced and that greatly influenced my decision to buy it. It contained all the basic colours I wanted and simple instructions for beginners. The paint is easily removed from the skin and doesn't stain my daughter's face. I bought this set to be able to paint my daughter's face and allow her to paint her own designs since she kept using any marker or pen to do so. It is a great starter kit.",

It's a lot like watercolor paint, you get way more than it seems. I do suggest getting a small spray bottle filled with water to use with the paint. Spray the paint, swirl with brush, then paint away. This kit comes with everything else you need to get started.",

Two of the lids were off the paint containers but the paint was not damaged nor were the lids damaged or cracked. I guess I was lucky & won't have to be troubled with an exchange.
