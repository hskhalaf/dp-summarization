I was able to easily mount it upside down with the marker tray inverted on the top. It matches kitchen cabinet nicely. The reason I only gave it a 4 is because the faux wood finish looks like it would mark easy if one is not careful with it.",

      "text": "Board is very attractive and is functioning great at this time. One complaint is that a clear sticker with the Lorell emblem was placed on the wood portion of the frame. When removing it, it pulls up the dark varnish. I opted to leave the sticker on the frame as it is less noticeable since the type color on the sticker is black and the frame is dark then to leave a patch of bare light colored wood if peeled off with the varnish attached.",
