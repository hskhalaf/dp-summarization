Here is an excerpt from that email and I hope it helps others. You can edit your home page to not show you certain things on the Echo Show 5: 1. Go to settings 2. Open Home & Clock 3. Home Content There you can turn off things like - Rotate Continuously - Discover Trending Topics or anything else you dont want to see",

This only seems to work when I am within 1 foot of it.
