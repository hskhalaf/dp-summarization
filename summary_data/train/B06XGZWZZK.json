There are 3 exits for the lower area 1 on one end and 2 on the long side. I'm not sure this would be comfortable for a big kitty in getting in and out of, but they would like the \"upstairs\" balcony. If tight on window space and have multiple cats, 2 could enjoy using without crowding each other's space.",
