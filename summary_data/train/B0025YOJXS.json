After only 3 days I saw a significant difference. His ears cleared really fast, the dark gulp started to dissolve and I realized that he wasnt scratching his ears as much. After one week there is almost no gulp to see. Iam very happy, saved alot, cat is also happy!!! :-)",

      "text": "My rescue English Mastiff had prescription drops that cost a fortune and did nothing for him. Mastiff's big ears are like leather tents: they hold heat and moisture and it can be hard to deal with their ears. I changed his diet (a big cause of ear issues) and began using Zymox. Best product for him. Now I only administer as needed: hot, humid days (Michigan) or if he happened to get them wet. Turned him around in under 2 weeks. Important to get the \"plus\" with the hydrocortisone, which eases inflammation. Definitely recommend. Safe and effective.",

My pug is prone to both seasonal and food allergies. While I took care of the food, I cant stop the seasons from changing. ZYMOX used to work great. My dog with get an infection, 2 weeks of ZYMOX boom all cleared up. However after about a 2 years and 4 ear infections the process does not work. I even tried using it for a month straight (as the website advises) and the infection remains. So I say give it a try if your dog is new to ear infections, but dont expect long term use.",
