We have some other Evenflo products and have been happy with them, so though the low price of this worried me, I decided to give it a whirl. I'm really glad we did! My parents-in-law have a hand-me-down Eddie Bauer pack'n'play, and I think this one is way better. It's lighter, easier to assemble and break down, and it seems perfectly sturdy. We don't use it a ton, because my daughter doesn't like to be confined, but it's perfect when I need to take a quick shower or run the vacuum.",

I recieved a different side pouch than what was pictured online, and on the box, and it took me forever to figure out that it goes on the opposite side as the changing pad, theres a thin black strip that has hidden holes for the side pouch straps to go in, once i figured that out i didnt feel the need to pull my hair out lol",

Materials were course and it was difficult to assemble and get all the parts locked in place. The bassinet base was very hard, almost no cushion at all. We had intended to use this as a gift but are glad we pulled it out to look at it first as we ended up returning it.",

Closing it is trickier than a Graco, and trying to wrap the mattress around the closed playpen is almost impossible...it isn't big enough to go all the way around so I have to sit on it, and I'm sure the velcro I struggle to attach will rip sooner than later as a result.",
