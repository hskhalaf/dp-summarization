The problem was covered under the normal Canon America warrant and the camera was returned in better condition than when I sent it! I was out $12 for insured shipping to them, but everything else was covered. -------- This is a very good point and shoot digital camera! I tested cameras from all of the major manufacturers and decided on this one for my wife for one simple reason - the shutter lag time is almost non-existant. It's almost like using a film camera. Picture quality is decent, as is the movie quality. If you want a fast reacting point and shoot digital camera, this is it.",

I have had it for about 4 months now and I am not a serious photo enthusiast but for taking everyday family pictures this is a great camera. Pictures come out very good in most lighting conditions, the lcd is very large and bright, battery life is excellent. The on/off button is a little small and sometimes hard to press but that's about the only gripe I have.",

    "title": "Casio Exilim EX-S600 6MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Silver)",
    "description": "Casio Exlim S600 silv dig.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe Exilim Card EX-S600 is the next evolution in this popular line of ultra-slim card-sized high resolution digital cameras. In addition to 6-megapixel photos, a major addition to this line is the EX-S600's ability to reduce camera shake instantaneously when recording quality MPEG-4 movies. The EX-S600 comes in silver, red, and blue.\n\n The EX-S600's ability to take state-of-the-art movies instantly and easily adds to the versatility and fun of this powerful and high quality digital camera. The EX-S600 fits conveniently in any pocket to go where ever you go, ready to quickly capture special moments. No matter how spontaneous the situation, the Exilim engine's Anti Shake DSP reduces blurring caused by shaky hands and/or moving subjects, and the Auto Macro and Quick Shutter functions ensure that photos are properly focused.\n\n In addition to enhanced resolution, the EX-S600's 3x zoom and increased battery life allowing up to 300 shots per battery charge provide significant photographic flexibility. The BEST SHOT menu includes the new Revive Shot, created specifically for taking digital pictures of old album photos. Revive Shot adjusts for obliquity as well as brightly refreshes faded colors. Whether framing a shot, reviewing images, or watching movies, everything is brighter when displayed on the adjustable 2.2-inch LCD--approximately twice as bright as previous models, making it ideal for outdoor use. Small enough to conveniently carry wherever you go, the EX-S600 has one-touch buttons that allow quick start up of the camera to view images and take pictures, as well as one for taking movies, all designed to quickly capture special moments. The EX-S600 connects easily to a TV or PC via the multi cradle, which also doubles as the battery charger.\n\n The EX-S600 continues the Exilim Card tradition of offering cutting-edge technology packed into a small, slim, and stylish body. With high-quality photos, advanced movie recording capabilities, and a tremendous range of remarkable functions, Casio once again exceeds expectations by providing a conveniently portable means of preserving memories to be cherished for a lifetime.\n\n \n\n Exilim Card EX-S600 Main Features \n\n High-Performance, Card-Sized Highlights\n\n\n6-megapixel CCD makes for high resolution picture taking Ultra-slim digital camera with a retracting 3x optical zoom employing high-density packaging technology resulting in a 16.1mm thickness (thinnest point: 13.7mm) The Super Life Battery allows up to 300 still pictures per charge on CIPA standard The Super Life Battery provides 1 hour 50 minutes of movie recording per battery charge The Anti Shake DSP (digital signal processor) reduces blurring caused by shaking hands or moving subjects The bright new digital interface TFT LCD 2.2-inch screen is easier to see when using the camera outdoors Convenient and Multivariate Functions\n\n\nRevive Shot refreshes faded colors of old album photos, bringing them back to life in digital format When photographing subjects with multiple focus points, the 9-Point Multi AF function takes simultaneous meter readings at nine different points, automatically selecting the best ones, resulting in a clearly focused shot The Quick Shutter function reduces mistakes by facilitating simple and easy high-speed focusing The Auto Macro mode allows for automatic switching between macro mode and auto focus mode Perfect pictures and movies can be taken using one of the 34 different BEST SHOT settings Assorted High Quality Movie Functions\n\n\nMPEG-4, VGA (640 x 480 pixels), 30 frames per second enables high quality movie recording The movie stabilizer function instantaneously reduces camera shake when recording movies (camera shake reduction achieved electronically) One hour of movies can be taken in Normal mode using a 1 GB SD memory card The Direct Movie function instantly starts movie recording with a press of the Movie button The Snapshot-In-Movie allows you to take a snapshot during movie recording Using the MOTION PRINT, movies can be converted into a series of nine or just one snapshot for printing The Past Movie starts movie recording from 5 seconds before the Movie button is pressed The Short Movie enables movie recording for up to a total of 8 seconds, adjustable before or after the shutter is snapped The USB cradle not only charges the camera battery, but is also a simple way to connect the camera to a PC or TV to enjoy photos and movies with no need for additional equipment Enhanced Quick Responsiveness \n\n\nOnce powered on, the camera is ready to take pictures in approximately 1.0 second After the shutter is snapped, picture is taken almost instantly, with only an approximately 0.007-second release time lag High-speed picture playback of approximately 0.1-second intervals The DIRECT ON button function allows quick startup in both shooting and playback modes",
