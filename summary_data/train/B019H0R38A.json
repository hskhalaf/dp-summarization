Cons: - Although the blue color is pretty, it scuffed up and got dirty on the first flight. Darker color suitcases hide the dirt/scuffs but the blue color doesn't.

Only once have I had a zipper broken (a little one that apparently caught on something - the airline reimbursed me) and recently the brand label came off. That matters more to Samsonite than me. It comes in different colors so you can find it easily. The only way I have ever destroyed one is by having my cat pee on it. (She was mad that I left.) Perfect suitcase!",

It's pretty slim even when you pack it fully.

I used it for an international trip and found that it was extremely difficult to move around. I ended up pushing it with both hands and, even then, it kept going to the left side. I was literally pushing and pulling and, if I was on carpet or had to go over bumps, like those for the blind, it took even more effort to keep it going. It was very irritating and exhausting to manipulate in the airports. My son had a different bag the same size and it moved so effortlessly! I was so envious!",

You can get it under the seat, but not a lot of room for your feet. So you probably would be more comfortable to put it in the overhead. Love the spinners. I have the 29\" and the 25\", too, and have found the spinners help when the bags are packed full and heavy. I can handle them pretty well. (I'm 71 years old.) Even up and down stairs. Have a couple handles so you can carry two different ways depending on the room you have to maneuver.",
