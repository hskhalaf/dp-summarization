He can ride it around our yard with no issue and the push button on the handle ensures that he doesn't \"go\" accidentally. My only word of caution to other parents is that it is on the small side. My son is in the 20th percentile for height and weight and he has very little (if any) room to grow on this thing.",

On careful inspection the plastic attaching the tire to the axle mechanism was cut unevenly and causes friction not allowing the tire to spin like the opposite tire which interferes severely with the steering mechanism. The only solution is to remove the tire and axle attachments or hack saw the plastic to the proper level. I have been working on it for 2 hours so far. Fisher Price has a web site for troubleshooting, but there is no related topic. All the quality control people had to do was spin the front tires before placing in the box to catch this problem...",

He was very excited when he saw the Batman stickers but the icing on the cake was a personal name plate on the back. The look on his little chubby-cheeked face and the huge hug was priceless!!!!",
