It's especially fun when it takes you so long to pull the wipes out of the top that your baby starts peeing all over the changing table because you weren't looking.",

When I put them in dry and added water, they weren't wet when they came out. With cloth wipes, the top 1-2 are nice and warm, but the lower ones are a little cooler. The cooler ones are still warmer than room temperature, and my two year old doesn't seem to mind. And, I tend to use only 1-2 wipes at a time anyway, so it's not a huge deal.",

The opening on top is hard to use if you use dry wipes that are folded in several layers. 2. It only warms up a couple of the wipes I use: 3. Can dry out the wipes if left in there for a long time. You can just add some water though to get them moist again.",
