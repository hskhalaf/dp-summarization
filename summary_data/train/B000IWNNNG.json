The Oakley was so cheap my sister had doubts if they were authentic. also I compared them to my 3 for $ 25.00 chinese made sunglasses and the oakley was not a whole lot better. Seems I paid for the name. if this is the trend for sunglasses I might as well go to the swap meet and buy the cheap garbage they sell.",

The crankshaft sunglasses at least felt american made!! Pics to come later!",

    "description": "Oakley Gascan sunglasses feature two lenses that are cut from the curve of a single lens shield, then mounted in the frame to maintain the original, continuous contour and offering an unparalleled peripheral field of vision. The look is so unique, Oakley customized its corporate logo just for this eyewear. Each pair of Gascan sunglasses sport Oakley's famous Plutonite lenses that block 100% of all UVA, UVB, UVC and harmful blue light up to 400mm. The Oakley Gascan's lightweight O Matter frame offers premium comfort while Oakley's three-point fit system retains the lenses in precise optical alignment eliminating the pressure points common in sunglasses that wrap around the ears.",
