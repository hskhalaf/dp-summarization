      "verdict": "The Ride 9 is Saucony\u2019s go-to versatile trainer that juggles responsive cushioning, flexibility, support, and smooth transitions in one go. Saucony tweaked some of the things in the latest version of the Ride to give a smoother and more responsive feel than the past instalment. It is light enough for up-tempo runs or for marathon racing, but delivers enough cushioning for everyday running. Several experts are already tipping it to be one of the best trainers of the year.",
      "pros": [
        "The Saucony Ride 9 impressed most of the reviewers where comfort is concerned",

        "The new Tri-Flex outsole enhances ground contact and flexibility",
        "Saucony adds the Everun as the top sole for more consistency in the cushioning",
        "A good number of runners appreciated the superb traction from this shoe",
        "It is available in narrow and wide widths",
        "It has excellent support, according to a handful",
        "Durability is not compromised despite being a relatively lightweight shoe, according to several testers",
        "It is a versatile shoe that can handle almost all types of distances under different speeds",
        "Breathability is another strong point of the Ride 9"

      "cons": [
        "The fit is a bit narrow, based on some runners\u2019 observations",

        "A moderate number of Saucony Ride fans were hugely disappointed that the spirit and performance of this well-liked shoe are no longer around in this latest version",
        "Some loyal fans of the Ride were upset that the shoe can no longer accommodate their orthotics"

I knew enough to purchase a 1/2 size larger, which I am glad I did. The issue for me with Saucony vs Brooks is two fold. First, I find the toe box to be too narrow. Downside to that is purchasing a wide shoe and the toe box is too wide. Second, the padding isn't what you would expect for a comfortable ride. These perform more like a corrective shoe in my opinion. I ended up sending them back.",

I get changing the \"upper\" style, colors and new materials in the footbed, but the actual size should stay consistent IMHO. They do fit pretty well compared to my Ride 8's, but these are just plain longer in length. Not necessarily a roomier toe box, just longer. It was an easy fix, I had a new pair of Sof Sole Athletic's in waiting, I usually swap out the original insoles at 100 miles or so. So with those and a little tighter lace, it is indeed a nice RIDE. The EVERUN is no joke either, fabulous response.",

The cushioning and relative stability do not disappoint, but a shorter than expected last with more narrow toe box than other models leave me wondering whether I can use the 8.5D US shoes over long distances of 20+ mikes to train.

I tried boxing in them and my feet slide around inside of them so I bought some mat shoes and kept these for running or walking and not as much lateral moving, pivoting or sliding of my feet. I've had them for a couple months now and they are still in good condition.",
