Finally, you have to weigh over 100 lbs to push enough air to shoot the rockets. Please parents shy away from this product and don't waste your money",

Definitely something we will use time and time again as long as the mount and balloon hold up.",

I ordered extra rockets too from Amazon. Make sure you order the core t rockets for the right launcher--I believe Amazon carries three versions-- all cool! I think it is as exciting for adults as it is for kids. We laugh so hard in anticipation and racing to see who can retrieve the rocket first.",

The packaging says it's for older kids but since the rockets launch depending on how hard someone can step on the bladder it's works for all ages in my opinion. Our 3 year old doesn't pack much power so he can only send the rocket 15' at most into the air which is perfect for a child of that size. An adult can really send it sailing though.",
