      "text": "OMG love the stroller. We got a 3 wheel one at our baby shower that my wife picked out. We could barely fit it in the trunk, and it did not have shocks. This thing was a fraction of the price, and so much better. Folds and fits in the trunk super easy. Has cup holders and good storage space. The quick connect works great with the car seat. The wheels are FOAM RUBBER, not plastic, like some people said. Love the shocks. Just all around great!. Our other one cost $300 and came with a car seat. This one does not come with a car seat, but you can pick up the same car seat on here for $60",

It has a strap to lift it up into the trunk and I can also do that with 1 hand. The infant seat clicks easily into the stroller. Over all I love it. I do wish the space between the cup holders was a little deeper. I've had a few items bounce out and my phone barely fits. I have a small phone with no case, so it does fit. You can push the stroller and steer it with one hand- easy to move.",

However, the basket bellow is too small, doesnt carry much. I like that it is easy too fold but my fingers get caught a lot. Also I could be doing it wrong but when you fold it it doesnt lock into place. So when unfolding it just bursts open in a clumsy way.",

It\u2019s made with quality materials, easy to navigate, easy to assemble and easy to fold up. It\u2019s a little bulky, but probably all durable strollers will be. It\u2019s simple to click in the Graco infant seat into. I\u2019m expecting it\u2019ll be a reliable stroller for my little one to use as she grows. Just wish it came in a girly color.",

I agree it is very lightweight and I love that I can fold and unfold it with one hand. I would return if I felt like going thru all the hassle.
