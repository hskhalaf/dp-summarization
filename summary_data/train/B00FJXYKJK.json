Love the dark color of this one as well opposed to bright red and blue ones ... not something I would ever care about in a regular shop but wanted one that was aesthetically pleasing AND could get the job done. I use this for building guns. It's def. and overkill for that but better to have it then to have one thats too small.",

I had it back in service the next day, and with the understanding that I probably also need a bigger vise for drivetrain and suspension work I think it will last me a long time doing 75% of what I need a vise for.",

The screw that drives the in and out motion of the jaw also seems pretty sturdy as goes for the massive bar used to turn it. Overall, definitely worth the price.

I believe this is the same vise as the Yost BV-4 and the Wilton 11104, though with a different paint job and a very slightly different swivel base.

    "description": "Size:8 in.\n\nThe all-purpose medium duty TEKTON 8 in. Swivel Bench Vise is the benchtop work horse your garage or shop can't live without. Whether you are repairing vehicles, metalworking, or assembling parts, you can work better, faster and safer knowing it is properly secured. Just lock it in and thread, fasten, build, bend, shape, or sharpen it with confidence. Made from 30,000 PSI cast iron, durability and dependability are built in. Put your project in the sure grip of the replaceable non-slip serrated steel jaws and it won't budge. For forming and shaping metal pieces, the polished anvil offers a smooth, consistent work surface. Rotate the vise around its 120-degree swivel base and you can position your work in just the right spot. Once there, dual lock-down nuts keep it in place. Turn the sliding T-bar handle and the jaw glides smoothly along the Acme-threaded main screw without binding or chattering, even as clamping pressure increases.\n\nSpecifications:\n\n * Material: Cast iron\n * Jaw opening: 7-3/8 in.\n * Throat depth: 3-7/8 in.\n * Anvil size: 5-1/2 in by 6 in.\n * Swivel: 120-degree\n * Tensile strength: 30,000 PSI\n * Weight: 77 lb.\n * Mounting holes (3): 1/2 in.",
