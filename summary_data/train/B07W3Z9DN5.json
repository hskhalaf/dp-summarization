The only thing I need to do is remember to order my next pair(s) in size SMALL. I ordered my first pair to try them out, in a size medium, and the 'heel' pocket sits way above my ankle, and I have to fold the tops over so they don't go up past my knees. I'm 5' 4\", slim calf, US women's size 8.5 foot.",
