I could afford it and couldn't wait to get it I was extremely surprised and pleased with the craftsmanship and care that went into the manufacturing process for this tool. I would put this caliper up against any of the high dollar ones. Still making saw dust, Marty Gillan",

The digital display/interface is self explanatory. There is a on/off button, a zero button, and a 3rd button to toggle between measuring in millimeters or inches.

Whether or not it's actually exact down to .001\" isn't relevant to my needs. It is consistent, and that is what accuracy really is. All measuring tools are glorified pieces of string. If you understand that, you understand consistency between measurements is the key. I use it for clearance measurements, measuring both pieces rather than the clearance itself, and I get consistent measurements from this caliper. I'm happy with it and would recommend it for anyone who understands the difference between vernier calipers and micrometers, and knows when to use each.",

One thing I love about these that I haven't seen in any other cheap pair of calipers is the fractional mode, where instead of measuring anything below 1 inch using decimals, it automatically converts it to the nearest fraction with a denominator of base 2 (the lower number is 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, etc.). I'm in the US so everything below an inch is usually designated in fractions of an inch, instead of mils/thou (1/1000th of an inch). I use these for measuring things to 3D print accessories for, and so far I have had no problems using them for that.",
