I'll probably still use my smaller case when traveling, but this is great for taking my Switch to use at someone else's house.",

Also like the others, the shoulder buttons do get pressed down causing a constant drain on the batteries even if you turn your Switch and controllers off entirely. I imagine the N550 would be a better case since it is listed as being the thicker of the two, but a lower product number should never be the superior product. Instead of wasting time and money trying out the N550 I returned this and am getting the DACCKIT case. I saw two favorable video reviews about that one.",

Everything fits well (save for if you have sleeves or grip slips covers on your joy cons or the switch itself (everything fits SNUGLY normally).

The handle is comfortable to hold and the inner pouches have a decent amount (albeit cheap feeling) of protective foam. The only issue I've had is that the front pouch that holds the Switch itself is a little too tight where when removing the Switch it can sometimes leave smear marks on your screen. As long as you have a good screen protector on your screen though this is not really a problem. Overall I've been fairly impressed with this case and it holds my Switch and two extra sets of controllers and an extra set of Joy-cons with room to spare for extra games and cords.",
