That's something I had a big problem with on my LG Tone. Overall I'm happy with the product. I do hope a future version will have retractable earbuds... or at least a way to magnetically anchor the earbud(s) to the device (vs the other ear bud) when not in use. Sometimes I just want to wear 1 earbud without the other flopping around.",

Once I resolved that I was able to connect with multiple devices at the same time. The battery life is pretty good depending on how much usage. I am able to use it for a full day typically while using it frequently for phone calls and occasionally for music. The transparency mode does bring down the audio volume which I didn't realize at first but that does make sense. The noise cancelling does work.",
