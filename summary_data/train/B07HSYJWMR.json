Connectivity is as reliable as any other Bluetooth devices I've used. I was able to go for runs without them falling out of my ears. The most important note I have is that the right earbud stopped charging after three months. I tried resetting, tried cleaning with compressed air, no luck. But, I scratched the contacts on the earbud with a paperclip vigorously, and it now works again. So... probably a design flaw that something builds up on those surfaces, but hopefully that helps somebody get more life out of their investment.",

It won't power up at all. I've tried turning on and off, putting back in case, re-charging (they are definitely charged). You can't even reset it because it simply won't power up.

I should've learned from past Anker purchases, but these are just awful. Never again. Terrible ear buds.",

I called Anker and they agreed to replace them under warranty. Here is where the fun starts: I received my replacement pair today, I unboxed and charged as recommended. The left ear bud was completely dead. Called for yet another replacement and the representative admitted that they send returned products as warranty replacements. If you are submitting a warranty you may receive my broken pods back. MAKE A BETTER PRODUCT TO BEGIN WITH, CROOKED COMAPNY",

But with less than half price of the top brands in the market, I guess we can't be too picky. To be precise, I am 98% satisfied with this pair of ear buds.",
