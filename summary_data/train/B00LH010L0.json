The Galaxy S5 Mini matches the regular S5 in name and looks, but not in specs. If you're after a comfortable to use phone with the Samsung name and enough power for everyday use, it'll suit well. For a true compact flagship, look towards Sony's Xperia Z3 Compact.",

      "text": "When I bought this phone on November 2015 I expected to be brand new. A week ago it started to be really slowly and wasn't working like it used to. So I decided to do a data factory reset, after that the phone didn't work anymore, it only works with WiFi, I can't make or receive calls, my phone is always on \"emergency calls only\" mode. I realized that the IMEI code wasn't the same that appears under de battery of the phone, so it turns that the phone is a refurbished phone. It doesn't work anymore, I hope an explanation for this. You sell cellphones as brand new when they aren't",

Being an international version, there is no warranty, unfortunately. I enlisted the assistance of different tech blogs to see if we could remedy the problem, to no avail. The phone features were great, but the phone itself was not very sturdy. If you do decide to purchase this phone, be sure to get a sturdy case to protect it.",
