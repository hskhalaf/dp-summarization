It is recommended to shake it first and then spray as it separates. I love how it sprays. It's an even, fine mist. It smells sooooo good, just like watermelon. Do I feel hydrated after using it? For a bit but I dont think it lasts. I also wonder if I should put it in the fridge and use it as a cold mist. That could feel great on the face. Will continue using and update if things get better.",
