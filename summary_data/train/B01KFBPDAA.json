      "text": "These are my 1st set of LED headlights - coming from 10+ years of using HID lights across multiple vehicles. I am impressed - instant on, great color temperature and very easy to install. These are the real deal, easily as bright or brighter than any 35watt HID kit that I have ever used before. Put these on my 15' Jetta - what a difference, changed the whole look of the car AND increased night time visibility 10 fold over the stock halogen. Very satisfied - I even bought a second set for my fogs - I am not going back to HID, LED is here to stay. Hats off to Auxbeam for a great product.",

I bought these and the high beams 5009's. Like I've said so far so good. UPDATED So one of my headlights just stopped working. They aren't even a year old. They are bright but they don't seem to last long. I now spent 30 bucks for a set of bulbs to only have 1 work.",

So it would be a good idea to re-adjust the headlight after installation. Anyways the build quality is consistent on both the H11 and H4 and is a simply plug and play. Also to note that the H11 has a label on the connector which says ' + ' and ' - '. (i always thought H11 could have been plugged in any orientation, hmm.) Also to note, the fan located at the base of the bulbs isn't loud at all I hope to get a long life out of these :). I would recommend this product.",

These expensive LED lamps only lasted about 11 months before one of them failed, used only in a warm climate on decent roads. Considering the initial cost, I would not recommend them. They're really bright, and the color is easy to get used to, but they cost too much to be replacing on an annual basis.

The plug is not \"keyed\" so it is possible to hook these up backwards and have them not work at all. Led lights are polarity sensitive and that's not indicated at all on the plug or packaging.",
