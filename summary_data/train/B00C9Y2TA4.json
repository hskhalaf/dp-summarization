Plenty of HDMI inputs, but one thing I don't like - it doesn't have a optical audio output, it does have a digital audio output, but it's not an optical connection. I like the built in Netflix application - I was hoping to see a built in Amazon prime at some point",

The TV is now dead less than two years after having been bought, it just died while watching a movie and has remained dead. I tried reset but it doesn't seem to help. Let's see if the SquareTrade warranty on this is any good.",

PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER.\nAnthony5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent TVReviewed in the United States on October 27, 2014Verified Purchase Definitely an amazing TV for the price. I use this primarily for gaming and web browsing as I have my computer hooked to my TV. This TV does have a true 120hz display which makes it perfect for PC gaming above 60 hz. At 60 hz you need to edit the HDMI setting in the input settings category as auto and video produce major input lag. Speaking of, I am able to downsample using my PC the display will handle a resolution of 2880x1620 and if you can manage to run games at that resolution they are absolutely gorgeous. This TV has excellent picture quality and fairly accurate color representation, will definitely be buying another TV from sharp when it's time to upgrade.Read more One person found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Tony4.0 out of 5 stars Nice TV, decent valueReviewed in the United States on January 24, 2014Verified Purchase good, clear picture. The default color saturation is way over the top, so it takes some time to find a balance that works. Plenty of HDMI inputs, but one thing I don't like - it doesn't have a optical audio output, it does have a digital audio output, but it's not an optical connection.\nI like the built in Netflix application - I was hoping to see a built in Amazon prime at some pointRead more Helpful Comment Report abuse Brandon Bayer3.0 out of 5 stars Takes time to get rightReviewed in the United States on February 25, 2014Verified Purchase Although the picture is great I have had to spend way too much time on the phone with Sharp customer service to help with issues. I also had repairman come to the house who setup netflix on my sons wii I can't get it work directly through the tv. Not sure if you can have it both ways but it would be niceRead more 2 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse MR RR MCNAB5.0 out of 5 stars Great TVReviewed in the United States on December 26, 2013Verified Purchase Having a few issues connecting to my Bose Suround had to order cables and adapter for surround sound. Good picture quality and fairly easy to set up.Read more Helpful Comment Report abuse J. Macmaniman5.0 out of 5 stars The best in this size rangeReviewed in the United States on December 6, 2013Verified Purchase In my opinion, Sharp is the best brand. Why do other brands need so many different, barely-distinguishable versions of the same size television anyway? Simple... so they can make some poorer quality or with marginally-different features.\n\nPicture is crystal clear, and I love the small border around the screen. Does everything I wanted and then some. VERY SATISFIED.Read more 3 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Megaan Pelaar4.0 out of 5 stars Good Quality Smart TV for a Smart Price!Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2014Verified Purchase I am very happy with the quality of this TV. The picture is amazing and has a good sound system already built in. I really like the Netflix app that the smart system featutes. I wish there were a wider range of apps for the Smart system, but besides that I love it! I would recommend this to anyone wanting a reasonably priced Smart TV.Read more Helpful Comment Report abuse gadget_freak1.0 out of 5 stars Constant restarts and now deadReviewed in the United States on May 22, 2015Verified Purchase This TV has good screen but sadly it is plagued with constant restarts. The TV just restarts for no reason randomly. I don't watch TV a lot and never bothered to claim warranty repair on it. From what I see based on reviews it would not have helped either. The TV is now dead less than two years after having been bought, it just died while watching a movie and has remained dead. I tried reset but it doesn't seem to help. Let's see if the SquareTrade warranty on this is any good.Read more One person found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Chad Byard5.0 out of 5 stars Fabulous!Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2013Verified Purchase Fabulous TV!
