It was SUPER easy to install and is sturdy enough to support all of my shower essentials. The depth of the hook provided exactly enough clearance to allow the caddy to hang flush against the shower tiles and the matte black finish matched perfectly with the black caddy I purchased from Target. Zero negatives about this item, it's excellent!",

I didn't want to drill throughu brand new tile, so I decided to try and trust the glue provided. I followed the directions exactly and was surprised that it all actually worked. The little hook has been holding up wash clothes for a month now without an fuss. I gave it a little tug in the beginning to see if it was really attached, and it didn't even budge. Nice nickel color, not going to match your chrome kholer mixing valve exactly if that is a concern.",

All of them --including these -- are exceptionally well made and durable. They really are 304 stainless steel: no rust, no spotting, no corrosion. And not just the actual accessories, the screws and mounting brackets are stainless steel also. I've spent twice as much for bathroom accessories from internationally known names that were not half as nice as these. I highly recommend them. The designs are elegant, the quality is exceptional. The price is low for what you receive.",

These parts are polished to a high luster to pass easily for a chrome plated finish, which is what I was looking for. The only thing to be aware of is that this general style of towel hook is more 'slippery' than the old school coat hooks that have two pointy prongs. But if you double up on the thickness that goes between the post and the wall, it will stay put without problem. And we tried this with both hand towels and bath towels and both worked fine.",

I noticed A LOT of negative reviews complaining that all of the mounting hardware was not included. I believe that is because those people did not realize that the mounting bracket is attached to the hook itself when shipped. It is only necessary to use the allen wrench to loosen the bracket from the hook and you are good to go. It might be worth the shipper making that more obvious to purchasers who are looking for the mounting bracket.",
