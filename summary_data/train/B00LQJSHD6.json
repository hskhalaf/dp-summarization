Only one thing, some apps drain the battery quite fast - Facebook being the worst one. And you have to be careful not to have too many apps as these eat up the 16 GB memory but it is happy with a 64 GB memory card. I am so pleased with this. I was so happy with this tablet I bought a cheaper non-sim one for a relative as a present and she was sooooo happy too!",

I have used a Kindle HD Fire up until now, and the Samsung is far more capable, with access to Google Play, which is the Kindles major annoyance. Looked at IPads, a lot of money, but are they better?",

It's incredibly thin and light, and robust enough to have survived 4 months of said other half dropping it on the floor twice a week.The display is the sharpest I've ever seen and the tablet is very responsive. As a caution, please check seller feedback before you purchase. Amazon don't seem to be selling these directly any more and the second unit I bought turned out to be an import that didn't speak English without a great deal of persuasion. Some functions do not work at all.",

The screen is amazing for video and photos too (cant work all the time). Organising and viewing photos has become so easy I actually enjoy it for the first time ever! Probably the best thing about this as I can now easily see all my thousands of pics with a swipe - so much nicer than on the laptop. Love this Tab.",
