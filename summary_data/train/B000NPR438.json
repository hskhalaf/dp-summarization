It's just made to sloppy tolerances, apparently. When I compare it to my more expensive, name-brand adjustable wrenches, the difference is obvious. More expensive wrenches will have a solid, smooth movement of the adjustable parts, resulting in tight, consistent jaw openings. That isn't how this wrench works, unfortunately. That isn't to say this is not a useful tool. I couldn't find a 4\" adjustable wrench anywhere else for anywhere close to the price.",

I don't always want to invest big bucks in a tool I might only use a few times, but I really hate spending money on a tool that is so poorly made that it doesn't work well! Tekton has become my goto brand in those cases. This crescent wrench is a great example. The spiral adjustment mechanism turns easily but is not loose or sloppy. The tool is nicely finished with accurate inch and metric opening size rulers etched on the jaw. It worked great for my plumbing task, unlike the more expensive noname wrench I first bought for the job.",

I bought the 12in for the name, and the 15in for the price, expecting that the 15in wouldn't get as much use as the 12.
