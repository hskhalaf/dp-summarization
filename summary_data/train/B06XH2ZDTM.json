So I am on my way and will try hard to continue to follow the very clear growth instructions for these little guys and will attempt to update this journey as the seeds and I move onward together. Exciting for sure! The kit is a quality product with clear instructions and I am very happy with my purchase. I will do my part now and see how good of a miniature arborist I can be!",

THATS IT ! It\u2019s up to you to grow these trees & if your lucky or have a green house in 1 to 2 years you will have a tree big enough to start trimming , cutting & working on it to create a bonzai tree. The chances of this happening with this kit is almost laughable. Go to a nursery , buy a small type tree/bush thats already strong & ready for you to create a bonzai.",

I have never grown anything before so it feels good to have something. Watering is a little concerning because I want to give them enough but I don't want to soak the pot and get mold. Delicate balance. Update: 1 jacaranda has come up!",

I would keep them outside at all times, but not in direct sunlight. Otherwise they tend to mold. I highly recommend this kit!!",
