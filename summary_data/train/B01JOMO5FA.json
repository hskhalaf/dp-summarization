While in use it hasn't given me any issues yet, but it seems like it might which is worrisome.",

      "title": "Broke after a couple years",
      "text": "I bought this in February 2018 and the internal burr just broke (ie. split in half) today (May 2020). You can find replacement burrs for about $8 on here: replacing one less-than-ten-dollar part every couple years is probably an acceptable tradeoff for most people. It's also not the easiest to clean: you have to unscrew and disassemble a lot of small parts, and if you grind up something other than coffee, you might find that stuff will stick to the jar for the rest of its life. Other than that, this has been a pretty nice coffee grinder. It's especially nice for the Aeropress: the jar with the grounds tapers into the tube very neatly.",
