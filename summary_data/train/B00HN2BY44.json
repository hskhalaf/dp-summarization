However, the insole on both shoes were poorly glued down and can easily be lifted out. Also, the nylon on the top of the shoes, above the toes, has dark permanent crease marks where it folds as you squat or bend over. These dark crease marks appeared on the very first time I tried the shoes on and walked around the room. I will be returning these shoes and looking for something different.",
