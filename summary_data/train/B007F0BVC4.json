It has an impressive traction, minimal support, and little foot protection. It also received negative comments because others found it to be less durable and uncomfortable. In summary, the shoe still needs some improvement but it is still worth-trying.",

Posted on Vibram's FB page and they said to contact the retailer (amazon only has a 30 day return/exchange policy, so that would be a no-go) and if that didn't work to call their customer service. So I call and the girl tells me Amazon is NOT an authorized seller in their book and as a result there is absolutely NO WARRANTY AT ALL against faulty products. So I'm SOL. This was my first pair of FiveFingers and I promise you it is also my last. Garbage!",
