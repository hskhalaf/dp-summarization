The quality of the crayons are not up to Crayola standards, very waxy, and just disappointing. It\u2019s very embarrassing to give a gift that has a torn box and poor quality. I recommend not purchasing. And what\u2019s with all the damaged product, Amazon?",

But the crayons smell a little strange, which I don't much like, not like the crayons of yesteryear. And they don't adhere to the paper the way I remember from long ago. The effect is rather mottled, which is fine, but not what I expected. Also, the colored wax (which is what crayons are) flecks off onto the paper, so that's sort of a small nuisance. So those are the reasons why I gave an overall three star rating.",

This set also has 32 glitter crayons to make the set a full 152. It also includes a crayon sharpener that has the shavings go into a box (like a pencil sharpener) so that it collects them instead of them getting everywhere. Great value for price.",

The carousel swivels for easy selection and hours of fun. Plus, $12 for 152 crayons is a heck of a deal. You pay almost $10 for the 96 set. I purchased a few of these sets for my children and one for myself. Great deal and of course the quality of Crayola crayons is phenomenal compared to the off brands.",

My son didn't seem as excited about it as my daughter, but he's not into drawing and coloring as much as she is. I like that it keeps all the crayons in one place, and they can easily find which color they are looking for without digging through our old tub of crayons and spilling them everywhere. Also makes clean up easy now that every crayon has it's on place, they use one and put it right back and grab another one. Feels like it's made out of nice plastic, not to flimsy.",

There is no cover for these crayons, so if you wanted to store them somewhere where other things may be placed on or against them, prepare yourself for some extra colorful marks.
