They took his name and told him if it happened again he could get charged for falsely calling them. Idiotic set up! I would have given it no stars, but I had to rate it somehow for the review.

It has features like an FM Radio, flashlight, SOS buttons, camera, Internet search, etc. While some of these \"features\" can be partially deactivated by clever programming, they can also mysteriously turn themselves on and off again. For example, pressing the scroll down button turns on an FM radio. There is no way to prevent this. To turn off, you have to press the \"Exit\" soft key or \"hang up\" button. Try explaining that to your elderly mother. Why do engineers always feel that more is better? I wish someone made a dirt simple flipphone with none of these added \"features.\"",

At the second store, they looked it up online and said it doesn't work with their network, pure and simple.

      "text": "We purchased this phone for my 89 year old father-in-law. It synced with his hearing aids automatically so he can hear what is being said and it is easy enough to use that even with only one working hand, he is able to make a call. The only problem we have experienced is that he can't put it in the charging dock hard enough for it to begin charging as he no longer has that much hand strength. However, overall it is a wonderful choice for someone with limited hand coordination and hearing difficulties.",
