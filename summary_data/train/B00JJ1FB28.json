Mixed up the ThoroFlush as directed, poured into the core using a funnel and then blowing into the tubing I connected to force it in...did this until red started to trickle out. Let it sit for 5 minutes, flushed it, repeated with a 10 minute wait. Flush it out completely, refilled with 505/50 pre-mix, and checked the hoses. Both were hot, heat was working great and I can say this stuff really works! ;TLDR... It works, and is worth it over any garbage Prestone product.",

Clogged the heater core almost completely; probably clogged part of the radiator too but I couldn't tell. I used the flush precisely as outlined in the directions. I did however, dump the antifreeze and flushed with distilled water before adding the flush chemical. The end result was spectacular. After 3 years I now have heat in my truck...and you need it here in central Ohio. I highly recommend this product!",
