      "text": "This is a game changer for bass fisherman. I love that I can walk from my truck a short distance to a spot with it fully inflated. I already have my waiters and boots on, I just walk to the shore slap on my fins and shove off. I can now get to the shore areas where the fish like to hold up and as a result I\u2019m catching a lot more fish. Always wear a PFD, stuff happens fast and once your waders fill up you can\u2019t get back on the tube. Be safe out there and tight lines y\u2019all!",

      "text": "Overall float tube is great. I wish I would have known that it does not work well in cold weather. I used the tube once and it worked beautifully before the lake froze over. Stored it partly inflated to use it the next year in CO. Went to inflate it and had over 20 holes in the bladders. The bladders on this particular model become brittle in freezing weather; any crease developed into a hole. I contacted outcast and their customer service is impeccable and they warrantied the bladder and had them replaced. They had notified me that the fat cat series have a urethane bladder that hold up better in freezing temps.",

      "text": "Own two older float tubes both considered to be state of the art in their day. This tube blows them away. A bit heavier than standard float tubes, but floats higher and propels far easier. Sitting higher does expose the tube to the wind however. Thicker bottom seems to give more protection from punctures. Inflates much quicker and easer. Overall, I consider this tube a real winner!",
