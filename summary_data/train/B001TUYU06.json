I decided to down size, primarily because after having to replace all of my household goods, I needed to control my spending. Anyway, I use the drawing tablet for stand alone drawing as well as use it in conjunction with my 3D art. I was concerned that the small Intuos 4 was not going to be large enough to meet my needs, but I was wrong! Not only does the smaller size better on my desktop but it just works so well. I saved a fair amount of money by going to the small size and yet it meets my needs perfectly.",

The active area on this is the size of a small notebook which is what i draw on anyways so its perfect for me. I didn't like the scratchiness of the active area but i solved that by cutting up my nexus 7 screen protector and slapped it on and now its super smooth and i would definitely recommend this to anyone making an upgrade from bamboo or any other older model like myself.",

I tell you, its like night and day. I first want to mention the texture of the surface on the Intuos4. Its like writing on textured paper a bit. Slightly rough that gives the feel of drawing which is something I was really looking forward to witnessing. I compared surfaces and the Intuos2 was like drawing on glass. Way too smooth. Okay for its time I guess but people just did not have anything to compare it to. Now they do. If you can afford a large, invest in it.",

This is the large model and it really feels like moving around a sketch pad having the larger size. I highly recommend this tablet for anyone who has sketched and wants to go digital.

Ordering was easy, and delivery was quick. The new tablet is great to use, and has many features lacking on my old tablet from the mid 90s. I am very pleased with this product.",

I bought the Intuos4 Medium refurbished, and am happy with it. Things that work well for me -- the 'wheel,' the short-cut keys on the left, the using a stylus bit. Minor issue -- sometimes the brush size is off; maybe Photoshop and the tablet have trouble communicating so while the circle indicating how large the brush or eraser is is huge, the actual stroke is much smaller. Not a huge issue, in that it usually gets reset again or I just hit undo, but definitely a minor inconvenience!",

    "title": "Wacom Intuos4 Large Pen Tablet",
    "description": "Size:Large| Style:WiredWith a new design and features inspired by members of the professional creative community, Intuos4 redefines the pen tablet experience. Featuring Wacom\u00bfs new pen tip sensor technology and 2,048 levels of pen pressure sensitivity, the Intuos4 pen captures the most subtle nuances of pressure, allowing you to dynamically adjust exposure, brush size, opacity and more. User-defined ExpressKeys activate frequently used shortcuts and modifiers, while the accompanying, illuminated ExpressKey displays on the medium, large and extra large models, provide a constant reminder of each key\u00bfs function. The finger-sensitive Touch Ring quickly controls up to 4 different functions such as canvas rotation, zoom, scroll, brush size and more\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe large Intuos4 tablet is perfect for creative professionals who work in large format or who are trained to work from the shoulder or elbow. With 102.5 square inches of working area, this tablet provides a generous workspace. The large has eight ExpressKeys with illuminated displays that provide easy reference for your assigned functions. \n\n\n\nLike all Intuos4 tablets, the Intuos4 large features Wacom's new tip sensor technology to deliver an even finer level of control. You can initiate pen pressure control with only a single gram of pressure and a feather-light touch. With 2048 levels of pressure sensitivity and 60 degrees of tilt recognition, the Intuos4 pen simulates like never before the natural feel and accuracy of working with traditional brushes, pens, and markers.\n\nProfessional photographers, designers and artists agree: Intuos4 pen tablets speed production time for photo editing, design and art creation. When working with digital assets, there isn't a more natural tool than a pen for increased comfort and control.\n\nIntuos4 redefines the Intuos pen tablet experience, thanks to a new design and new features inspired by members of our professional creative community.\n\nWHAT'S NEW WITH INTUOS4\n\nSlightest Nuance\nFeaturing Wacom's new Tip Sensor, Intuos4 now captures the slightest nuance of pen pressure, starting with only a single gram of force. Switches, Where You Want Them\nUser-defined switches are preset to \"right-click\" and \"double-click\" or can be set to your most commonly used functions. Working Under Pressure\nWith 2048 levels of pressure sensitivity, Intuos4 gives you the creative power to dynamically adjust exposure, brush size, line weight, opacity, and more. Ergonomic Ahhhs\nIntuos4 is the most comfortable Intuos tablet yet. The slim-profiled tablet has gently sloping, easy glide palm rests that provide complete support for working on all areas of the tablet. Natural Feel\nThe Intuos4 Grip Pen features a new contoured barrel designed to minimize grip effort, reduce stress to your hand and wrist, and otherwise emulate the feel of your favorite writing instrument. Peek Inside\nThe new pen stand not only functions as a convenient pen holder, but also provides a handy twist-off storage compartment containing pen nibs and a pen nib removal tool. Who Says You Can't Take Shortcuts\nSet up your ExpressKeys to activate your own unique, time-saving shortcuts and modifiers in each of your applications. See your settings change in the illuminated display areas as you switch between applications. Your Settings at a Glance\nOn Medium, Large and Extra Large tablets, illuminated displays provide a visual reference to each key's function. On the Small tablet, just press the default ExpressKey to display the settings on screen. A Turn for the Better\nThe finger-sensitive Touch Ring provides intuitive control of scrolling, zooming, brush size, canvas rotation or layer selection. A central toggle button allows you to control up to four different functions in each application. Software, No Less\nIntuos4 owners are entitled to download their choice from a selection of titles by industry leaders such as Adobe\u00ae, Autodesk\u00ae and Corel\u00ae. Reversible\nThe innovative, ambidextrous design of Intuos4 allows you to maximize the productivity of both your hands. Having the ExpressKeys and Touch Ring on the same side of the tablet ensures that they are perfectly positioned for use with the hand that is not holding the pen. Many Accessories\nTo complement your Intuos4, choose from a variety of accessories including the Grip Pen, the Classic Pen, 6D Art Pen, Airbrush, Inking Pen, Pro Accessory Kit and more. \n\n\nUSE YOUR INTUOS4 TABLET'S NEW FEATURES:\n * Quickly and professionally edit photos and create digital artwork with natural pen control\n * New pen tip sensor technology lowers activation force and captures every nuance of pen pressure\n * 2048 levels of pen pressure sensitivity for precise pressure control\n * User-defined ExpressKeys\u2122 & multi-function Touch Ring put time saving shortcuts, modifiers, scrolling, zooming, and more at your fingertips.\n * Illuminated ExpressKey displays provide a constant reference each Key's setting\n * Custom radial menus for rapid navigation\n * New Precision Mode simplifies detail work\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\n\nIntuos4 large pen tablet, Intuos4 Grip Pen, Intuos4 mouse, pen stand, ten replacement nibs (five standard nibs, one flex nib, one stroke nib, and three hard felt nibs), nib extractor, 2.5m USB cable, Quick Start Guide, installation CD (includes tablet driver software and electronic user manual)",
