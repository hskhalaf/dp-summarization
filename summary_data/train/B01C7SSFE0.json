I have have one other ann chery trainer in the 3 rows of hook version. I will say this 2 row version fits me much better because i have a short torso but if you are taller or have a long torso go with the three row version! Hope this helps someone because they are very different in length",

It rises just a lil bit at the bottom not to much as long as I have it on the right hook.I put it on 4 times during work no results yet but I do need to be more consistent.

My waist is 31 inches and I bought this according to the size chart pictures from the company in the other review (not the size chart by the product). I bought a 2xl (40inch) and it fits great and has room to go down as my waist shrinks (hopefully). The color is bright pink as pictured. It is not long, it only covers the midsection and not lower tummy bulge, so you will need to choose a different product if you want it to cover low abdomen. Hope this helps!",

Going your size or a size smaller it will be very hard to put on. It won't give you an hour glass shape unless you already have one hidden under your fat. Trust me I know that too. Glad that I have an hour glass shape",

It does run short if you are on the curvy/plus size. Yes indeed you will feel the difference within a few days, especially if you cut-out any sugars and have a exercise regimen. After you wear the sports cincher you can move up to the Ann Cherry Latex Waist Cincher, which of course it is especially long on the torso.

The only con I must state is due to the flexible \"bones\" not connecting from the top and bottom, they tend to curve in at those areas which creates a little potruding layer of back fat above the trainer. (In the second picture, you can sort of see the lump. Wouldn't reccomend wearing it under a tight shirt). Overall, the quality seems pretty good for the price, so I'm satisfied with my purchase :)",

Take it to the gym or for a run outside and let it add impact to your healthy lifestyle routine. Here's how it works. You wrap the band around your midsection. This action creates compression in your core, stimulating thermal activity and ramping up perspiration. This process allows toxins and impurities to exit the skin, while mobilizing fat cells. Put simply, the band helps ensure that your workout is working for you. The band itself is constructed from a latex core with a soft cotton exterior and interior lining. It sits at your waist, extending to the upper abdominals. Two columns of hook-and-eye closures allow you to size the garment down with you. Felix boning anchors the cincher and prevents migration. If you've been thinking about adding a supplement to your active lifestyle, you'll love the power the workout band by ann cherry brings with it",
