Dents in many pieces. Welding is very poor quality as some pieces are broke or non existent. The cylindrical axle on 1 wheel was completely missing. Bends in screws on front prevent closing and locking. I would not recommend this product. Nervous to fire up as the pieces don't align and it's clear their are gaps that will cause heat lose.

This is a big problem as the box weighs over 120 pounds and I have to take it back to the UPS center. The time and effort for this smoker is really not worth it and trying to contact amazon is virtually impossible.",

Also, on a long cook, there is really no way to empty the ash from the fire box. I have relegated this thing to a cold smoker for my country hams. It works pretty good for that.",

Other than that, it's a great smoker. The heat is distributed evenly, the temperature is easy to maintain, and the gauge of steel (thickness) of the main chamber is perfect for holding heat!!! Overall, I'm giving it 5 Stars. Great investment!!!!!",
