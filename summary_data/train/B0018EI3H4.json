Now after having it installed on my system for a couple months, I can fairly and honestly say I prefer this product over the later. My system runs faster and smoother to the point you can't even tell you have an anti-virus software installed. That is until you venture into troubled waters, then it responds like you'd expect and easily handles the situation without a miss. I'm sold on this version, so unless they mess it up, I'll certainly renew my product next year. I rate this 4.0 Stars",

I had uninstalled the Panda but the AVG was so hard to uninstall I had to have it done. Then the Kaspersky is a bit old-fashioned; you have to do a lot of rebooting. Luckily I had read other reviews and did NOT uninstall the Ad-Aware, because it erases all the spyware the Kaspersky does not eliminate.",
