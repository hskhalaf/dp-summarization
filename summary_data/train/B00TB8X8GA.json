Also if you don't care for the chroma Keyboard of the Newer blade 14 this is for you. But if you want the chroma keyboard get the newer one. (I know I wish I waited a bit longer for it but had no idea it was coming). Probably best to stay away from the razer blade stealth because of all the performance sacrifices that had to be made and has a much higher screen resolution which I imagine will kill battery quicker and/or not perform super well.",

Some fan noise with peak graphics demand, but that is to be expected. My only constructive input is these new ultra screen resolutions can really make some windows interface things too tiny by default, especially for anyone at the age requiring bifocals. I would buy another Razor laptop after this one.",

Also, if you tend to voice chat your friends while you game, make sure you have headphones with a built in mic, cause they can hear your fans loud and clear!",
