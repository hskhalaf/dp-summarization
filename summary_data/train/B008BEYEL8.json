I've used Macs for years but this is my first laptop so maybe I don't have the experience with other laptops to be qualified to do comparisons, but I'm happy with my purchase.

I also like the DVD player and having connectors that Apple has discontinued. It's heavy, yes. But it's a trade off I can live with. I don't know how much longer these discontinued models will be around so don't hesitate.",

The computer is freaking slow even though it's \"new.\" It's most likely refurbished, but without any real improvements. I would advise people to spend that extra $100 to buy a mac from an actual Apple store. At least they have warranty and free returns if you are not happy with your product.",

Will try another, if it's bad, it'll go back too before I go to a different vendor. I like this model, newer models are light but are stupid light on features.",
