I ordered a half size bigger than normal and one size wider but, it still wasn't enough room for comfortable walking and they pinched the heel, toes and sides of my foot. The toe of the shoe is very narrow. I find these to be very, very small sneakers and I may try ordering a full size larger and wider. Maybe that will do the trick!!!",

I bought them at the end of July, but at the beginning of autumn they started tearing on the surface, although I did not wear them too often. In the photo it is possible to see that they look nice and like new. I bought similar sneakers in Tenerife, wore them almost every day and they did not tear at all! So, this purchase disappointed me and I do not recommend these sneakers.",
