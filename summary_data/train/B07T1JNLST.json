      "text": "Extremely fun game! You have to like rythmic based games or be competent at timing or you'll have a bad time. As you literally cannot move or attack unless you time them to the beat. Liking the Zelda series is a plus too. Music is fantastic and the controls are tight (gives you options to calibrate video and sound if your TV is off, similar to guitar hero). Solo is fun and 2 player is even more fun. Especially when you figure out that you can \"accidentally\" kill one another with boulders, flame rods and chickens. Never played the original Necromancer, but been having a blast with Cadence of Hyrule so far!",
