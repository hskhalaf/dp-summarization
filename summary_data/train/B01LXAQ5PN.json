The carrier design itself is very well made, sturdy so that it doesn't collapse on itself, and the material is very nice.

My kittens are 7 weeks old and their claws are all over the thing but not a scratch to be seen on it (compared to my chairs and sofa covers who are singing their last song) I have seen rewiews saying that when expanding the carrier and unzipping the soft walls there is only a zipper from inside but it is inside and outside! The only sad thing is that when taking down the sides they are a little too small compared to the expanded area.",

I'm amazed they were attracted to it.",

My Tinkerbell absolutely loves to ride and hops into her carrier to let me know that she is ready to ride. The fold down sides are fully padded and allow a lot more space when you are not \"under foot\", especially during plane trips. The breathable sides are designed to be both comfortable and safe as well as eliminate most of the feeling of being restricted. If you have never tried a dedicated pet carrier other than the hard sided type, this is the perfect place to start - and finish.",
