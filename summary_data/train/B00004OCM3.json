Sadly, they broke, so I thought I would try Oxo. My Oxo products are wonderful -- not these tongs, though.",

I would only use these for grabbing large items or a single specific item(e.g. steak). The design is terrible for trying to serve pasta or salad. The fit and finish and material is all top notch. A redesign of the tongs to have most of the tong touch instead(parallel) would raise my review to 5 stars. I ended up finding a silicone tipped Tongs that I really like which are parallel and work great for serving.",

Hence buying new ones now. The old ones will stay outside next to the grill. Other than that, they look the and work the same since the day I first bought them 5 years ago.",

The one I got was pretty good, so I decided to order a second one. The rubber parts on the second one was different than the first one I ordered. The rubber parts was shorter and not as comfortable as the first 16-in tong I got. So one star off for that and for not being able to predict which type of rubber grip will be sent with your order.",

      "text": "These are some heavy duty tongs. I used to have short, wire tongs that I would always get my hands burned with when making a steak or felafel on the stove. Now I use these all the time along with a splatter screen and have no more issues with oil getting all over the place, including my hands. I haven't used these on a grill outside yet, but I'm sure these would be perfect for that. I love how they lock, as well. Push in the tag to release, pull out to lock, which is great for storage and for the dishwasher. Overall, very happy with the 16'' length vs the 9'' and 12''.",

This stainless pair is also easier to clean than our nylon version, so I actually prefer to use it in the kitchen now too. Just a very well thought out product that performs perfectly!",

    "title": "OXO Good Grips 16-Inch Stainless Steel Locking Tongs",
    "description": "Package Quantity:1| Size:16-InchLifestyle\n\nAMAZON.COM\nSometimes overlooked as a valuable kitchen tool, tongs serve a variety of kitchen duties: tossing salads, flipping cutlets in a frying pan, snagging stubborn pickles from a jar, and more. These tongs are constructed of brushed stainless steel for easy cleaning and durability. A locking mechanism closes the tongs for easy storage, and provides a large loop for hanging. The Good Grips line features durable, nonslip flexible handles on every product. Ergonomically designed to fit the palm comfortably and softly, the pressure-absorbing processed rubber handle puts less tension on the hands, while providing an outstanding grip. Made from the same material as dishwasher gaskets are constructed of, the handles are slip-proof, wet or dry, as well as dishwasher-safe. Good Grips products are moderately priced and have won the Tylenol/Arthritis Foundation Design Award. --Laurie Notaro",
