Second, they are prone to whistling. The second unit whistled at any speed above 6, cool or heat. Returned that unit. Finally with a working third unit, realized that regardless of Automatic or Manual, if in Heat mode, will only remain on for 9 hours at a time, after which will just turn itself off entirely. If you depend on this to keep a room warm, you will come back to a cold room. Not worth the money.",

So I email Dyson for this issue with the fan, first, they will give you some instruction to troubleshoot. Then they will ask you for the purchase proof, and from here, they pretty much gave the middle finger! They call \"Amazon\" an unauthorized dealer, therefore, the warranty on the fan is voided. BUY IT FROM BEST BUY, AT LEAST YOU WILL HAVE WARRANTY!",

Would not recommend for use in nursery or room where you are not physically present as temperature cannot be changed via app or voice, but only by remote which only works with direct line of sight. Also product grossly misread the room temperate at ~ 3-4 degrees higher than other 2 temp sensors in the room and as a result keeps trying to cool an already cold room. Dyson support is very unhelpful claiming product needs 6 days to calibrate and nothing can be done until that amount of time has passed. Definitely not worth the $$$.",
