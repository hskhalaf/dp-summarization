      "text": "I got these for when Chaco sandals might not be as appropriate. What I quickly found out was that these are much more versatile than I thought. These work with jeans, khakis, shorts, etc. They're a great all-around shoe, with classic style, and the great Chaco footbed. The true test came when I traveled with these. I wore them all over the place and walked several miles a day in them. They held up well and still look great!",

      "text": "I bought the CHACO MENS DAVIS LACE LOAFER in a size 10 for my 20 yr old son to wear for college classes and general wear. He likes the fit and the support--- he prefers a more flexible sole. The shoe does seem to be a little more wide than others through the toe box and arch area. The heal seems to be a typical fit. The color and style are very versatile and go well with various clothing styles. They can be worn with or without socks--- I would recommend no show socks.",

      "text": "Got these shoes for my husband about three months ago- according to him they fit great, very comfortable. He wore them around the house and at casual Fridays at work- nothing taxing, no heavy use. This morning he noticed a tear along the sole. I usually associate Chaco with having high quality, especially since I paid 90 bucks for these shoes. I could have spent 40 at an outlet mall for an off brand and gotten a comparable shoe that would have lasted longer. I hope this is just a manufacturing defect that doesn't affect other people because it really is a nice shoe- just can't recommend.",

My son stepped on my foot and left a shoe mark. Other than that they are great! Well made, and comfy. I usually wear Birkenstock\u2019s so to find a closed toe shoe is nice.",
