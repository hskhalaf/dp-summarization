However, some of the reviewers think that the shoe can feel a bit tight, which somehow constricts their movement.",

Second, while the box says 10.5-2E, indicating a wide, it feels as narrow as a regular shoe. Third, the \"fresh foam\" under my sole is so ungiving that the rock-hard arch support just pokes uncomfortably into the bottom of my foot. There were also minor cosmetic manufacturing issues, such as glue visible at the front of both shoes. Overall, a huge disappointment!",

First run after walking for a full day to have the shoe 'mold' to my feet a bit as some alluded to, around 5 miles in felt first metatarsal starting to scream like it had a few years back when PF kicked in. Was really hoping it would indeed mold some. Nope. Painful to run in. Had to return to inserts on this one while using these regular shoes to hang out in. Will stay with Brooks Revel and Hoka Cavu for real running.",
