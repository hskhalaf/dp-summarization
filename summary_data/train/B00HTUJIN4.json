I purchased 3 or 4 different types until finding the compressionz sleeves. They are, by far, the most comfortable, most effective and better looking sleeves on the market. They are high quality material and do not tear like some of the cheaper sleeves I've tried. I highly recommend the compressionz sleeves for anyone with lymphedema.",
