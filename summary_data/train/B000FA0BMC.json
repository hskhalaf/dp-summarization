In comparison, Bessey is just better: the clamps are well made, have no play, are easy to release and reposition, and the plastic caps don't come off constantly and can withstand some abuse. Their fancier clamps with larger clamping surfaces, such as UniKlamp and REVO, are pretty sweet, too.",

      "text": "The clamp doesn't work. When you twist to apply pressure it loosens a notch on the ridges along the main rail. One by one it widens as you continue to twist. It's possible this one is defective but the ridges don't seem deep enough to hold much pressure at all",
