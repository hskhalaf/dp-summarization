This case provides grips like a controller and the material is floppy so it comes off easily. Now I actually enjoy playing in handheld mode much more. I got the black which is very nice. i highly recommend. Also it comes with multiple color thumb grips. Great deal! Matches my mario odyssey red switch",

It does not fit in the dock in this, but it does still fit in the nintendo brand cases (I have the sheika eye case).
