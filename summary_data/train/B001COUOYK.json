I've only used it once since purchasing (purchased a couple of weeks before this post)--had 18 cans in cooler with ice--ice hardly melted overnight! No regrets on the purchase!!",

I don't know how this cooler is different than any other cooler except if we'd have put ice in our Coleman- it would have been gone at the end of the day. Three days in and we'd have had very warm drinks. I am very pleased with our YETI. We have coffee mugs and thermal drink coolers- love all of them!",

However, it is cumbersome, heavy and does not have wheels. The igloo cooler we have had for over 15 years is light weight, has wheels and a handle to pull. This Yeti cooler doesn't lend itself to transporting it around to any locations. Unless you have someone strong who doesnt mind lugging it everywhere. And that is even without filling it. Also, the walls are quite thick, which likely helps with insulation, but that also reduces the storage capacity of the cooler and makes it heavy.",

Yes the weather was cooler, in the high 60's low 70's, but again, frequent opening the ice chest (we camp with several little ones, and they constantly open and close it!), still kept ice longer than other similar ice chests. Overall, my opinion is that you get what you pay for. I'm happy with the product and would buy again if I had the need for another ice chest.",

We put a 20lb bag of ice in it on a Thursday afternoon and there was still a large chunk of ice in it on Sunday night!!! It sat outside in the full sun the entire time in 80 degrees temps. I was skeptical to buy a yeti but I am so glad I did. The only thing I do not love about it is the weight once packed, it is too heavy for me to lug around so my husband has to do it.",

Many road trips are ahead so I added the bear proof lock and security cable so neither fierce animals nor unscrupulous thief's can make off with it.",
