It is heavier than I expected (being aluminum) but much lighter than its fiberglass cousin. Well constructed. I also purchased the Louisville Levelok Ladder Leveler Kit. Only problem is that a couple of rungs are damaged (picture) but didn't notice until I drilled the holes to mount the leveler kit. They're still sturdy and usable, but would have returned for the price I paid if I'd noted it earlier.",

Its just hard to raise it and not mark wood siding so you can't just slide it up the outside wall. If it were vinyl or brick it wouldn't matter as much. I would certainly purchase this ladder again. I read another review about the ladder having a small dent and this one did too. I am not worried about it though as this is a ladder to get work done not to look nice as a centerpiece.",

Be sure to check yours well when it is delivered because returning it is SO much more trouble than refusing delivery. The ladder *is* somewhat heavy, but it is because it is a BIG ladder. It's actually is fairly light for it's size. A welcome addition to my stable.",

This model offers very strong rung locks and heavy duty feet. The only issue I have is they leave some sharp edges and burrs on the cuts they make in the manufacture process, but a few strokes with a file takes care of that. Overall, I would rate this ladder very good and worth the extra cost.",
