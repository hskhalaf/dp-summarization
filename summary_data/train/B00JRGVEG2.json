My boys are constantly building and playing. This is a must buy! My son is 2.5 and can just now snap them together like his bigger brother.",

That is especially true if more than one child is playing with them. The 200 piece set was good because it had a lot of basic pieces. It is the perfect first set. The pieces are sturdy. They are bright. I also bought a plastic container with a lid to store all five sets and I laminated the instruction sheets. This summer, I let my niece have the Tinkertoys to help entertain her children over the hot summer months. The children play with them a lot. I like the plastic Tinkertoys.",

It's not possible to build any of them. The box we received was new with all parts contained in two sealed bags. Well, all parts but the four grids.
