      "text": "I became very worried after ordering because I didn't see all the 1 star reviews. Once I received it I immediately used it, and was instantly relieved. There's one part I left out, and that is I read the instruction manual. It does not have an off switch, but you can turn the all the way down, however as per the manual you should unplug it when you're finished ironing. I primarily purchased this iron to press my collars and for sewing. My only hesitation about using it for my slacks is the size. It's small and compact- exactly the reason I bought it. Don't pass this up because most people haven't figured out how to read a user manual.",

I set it to the highest setting and the iron is ice cold. I've tried leaving it on for about 10 minutes at the highest setting and still cold.

I haven't seen any dripping yet, but it's still new. My only real complaint is the lack of an off switch for STEAM. There are times when you want maximum heat without steam, like starching heavy weight fabrics. On this iron, the only way to get that is to empty the water.",

There are 3 levels for no moisture and 3 levels with moisture. When you got wrinkly clothes like us, the moisture levels work great, they output a lot of moisture so the clothes get almost steamed straight. This works really good, and really good price.",

Maybe they called it no drip because it splashes instead. Walk away and buy something designed by people who know what they are doing.",

There are no fancy buttons, no bells or whistles but it gets the job done. It's not huge but a little bigger than the irons you might find in a hotel, it works better too. It's just a simple bare bones, light weight iron.",
