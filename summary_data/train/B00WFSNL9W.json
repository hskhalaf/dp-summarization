About 20 miles into the trip that tire went flat and dumped both of us into a busy intersection. Later, I found out 'you can't patch Chinese tubes'. No known adhesive would hold on their rubber compounds. These tubes are made under a license from Goodyear and are patchable. Now, I hope I never have to, but my grandson will get a puncture (I'm reasonably certain) in one of his bike tires at some point.",
