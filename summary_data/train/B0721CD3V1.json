Don't expect alot of support, like a modern running sneaker. The fit and comfort level is very similar to a canvas Chuck Taylor sneaker, if you can relate to my reference. Very good shoes for walking and casual wear. Met my expectations as I expect a good casual wear shoe abd not a performance sneaker.",

My husband has a tendency to walk on the insides of his feet, has had 7 knee surgeries, and has virtually no arch. Finding shoes for him is quite a task. Not only are these shoes stylish, but they also provide great support and limit impact (especially considering this is a dress/casual shoe). Nice craftsmanship. Color is true to the photo. A perfect addition to any man\u2019s wardrobe as you can dress them up or down. Overall, great shoe!",
