Camera functions well, and takes some pretty nice pictures. Haven't extensively tested the capabilities yet, but for a nice little travel camera I'm impressed. Really like the manual functions, and the customization you can do. RAW shooting was a must for me.",

Also the lens is nice and fast, and the menu seems totally intuitive and easy to navigate. I also really like the fully costomizable options on the dial. Great camera for the money. Also there are some nice accessories to add to this camera making it a street photographers dream. I am very happy with my purchase.",

In street photography you do not have the time to center the subject, so the Snap function uses the focus distance you set and takes the photo. Also the subject tracking is another great feature. It is very quick in finding the moving object. It quiet, but not as quiet as the Fujifilm X20.",

The little unassuming GR offers great image quality, thanks to its wonderful lens and large sensor, with easy to use controls. It's also very ergonomic, even for larger hands, which makes it a joy to use. Clearly it was designed by a photographer for photographers. Don't mistake this camera for another consumer oriented point and shoot. Highly recommended.",

The dng raw files have incredible depth and tonal range, the lens is sharp and I really like the features of the camera. Macro mode and the intervalometer are used extensively, along with the built in 2-stop ND filter. Another great feature, which lends heavily to image sharpness is the removal of the low-pass filter on the sensor. One improvement I'd like to see would be a more intuitive zoomable live-view focusing system.",

    "description": "Building upon an award winning series, the RICOH GR categorically redesigns the digital compact camera with its newly developed wide-angle lens and 16-megapixel APS-C size image sensor, all built into one of the smallest bodies in its class.

Whether you're looking for a second body to count on as a trusty sidekick, or simply want big pictures from a small camera, the GR will redefine your photography. Designed for maximum holding comfort and operational ease, all control buttons are laid out for easy access with the right hand. Supported by its large sensor and the advanced imaging engine, the GR offers high sensitivity shooting from ISO100 all the way to ISO 25600 with minimal noise.",

    "feature_bullets": [
      "16 megapixel APS-C CMOS image sensor offers low-noise characteristics, super-high resolution with no compromise in image quality or color accuracy.",
      "The advanced GR ENGINE V imaging engine offers high-sensitivity shooting with minimal noise and the GR's anti-aliasing filter less design produces supremely high resolution, color-rich images.",
      "The GR's fixed wide angle 18.3mm F2.8 GR lens, equivalent to 28mm in the 35mm format, provides high resolution images with edge-to-edge sharpness. With its nine blade diaphragm, the GR lens produces a natural Bokeh effect at larger apertures.",
      "Despite its large image sensor, the GR has a compact and portable design. Its casing is made of a lightweight magnesium alloy, while its exterior design retains the style typical of the GR series.",
