When I contacted the seller, they promptly responded, noting their product had a 1 year warranty, and sent me a replacement, at no cost. Upgrading to 4 stars for the excellent service! ORIGINAL REVIEW: I had really high hopes for this. First few times I used it, it worked great! Used less than a dozen times, since purchasing it in May 2020, and it is already broken! Despite not being rough with it, one of the collapsible folds has a tear in it! Absolutely unacceptable!",

Unfortunately, I didn't notice it was falling apart until just after the return window. Waste of money. :( I have had a Prima Pets collapsible bowl for years and have not had similar issues, so it's not a phenomenon with collapsible silicone bowls. This Bonza one is just garbage.",

Perfect size for larger dog(s), the coated top is very easy to clean (much easier than the rubber ones), and the way it's weighted keeps it from tipping over from the weight of the carabiner even before you add water - then again when the bowl nears empty. My dog likes the extra 'face room' even though she will usually only drink a little - easy to manage by just unfolding to one crease! I just hate that it's manufactured in China - hence the 4 stars (we can do this in the US!)",
