Looks like I better finish my glass of bourbon before I get started- Heyyyyyyyyy so uhh.. these ice cube trays are pretty sweet man. Legit though, they\u2019re just some good ol\u2019 fashion ice cube trays. Did i mention they make ice!!??!? But don\u2019t be fooled, they require a freezer to perform the freezing operation. All jokes aside, once these bad boys have the solid form of water in them, all you have to do is give them a little opposite bend from each side and voila!! Frickin ice cubes babyyyy. Perfect for people who like their drinks extra cold...because it\u2019s ice. Yeah.",

I bet the larger size cube combined with the harder plastic is what makes them harder to get out of the trays. As you can see on the photo (rubbermaid to the right in the photo) you could stack 5 rubbermaid trays in the same space that these trays can stack 4. Overall, I prefer the rubbermaid trays.",

      "text": "Two of the four trays work as expected. Water freezes into ice, and the cubes pop out with a gentle twist. The other two are another story, however. On these two trays the ice sticks firmly to the plastic, and it takes more energy to break them free. The ice is adhered so well to the plastic, that the cubes shatter into fine pieces when breaking out, making them virtually useless. Very strange. We thought this would go away with subsequent washings, but it seems to be a property of the plastic itself. How do you mess up an ice tray?",

      "text": "Writing a review about ice trays seems a bit odd, but I have to say. I am an ice snob. I have to have a full bin of ice and I don't have an ice maker. I have tried every ice tray out there on the market and have had issues with them all. Ice won't come out unless I wet the bottom of the trays, or the ones where you push them out with your thumbs needs way more strength than I have. These trays Are The Best! Over filled, under filled the cubes pop out with no effort at all. Finally, my daily ice chores are now a breeze... YES...BUY THESE TRAYS!",

The trays are stackable and dishwasher safe. One 15 ounce can of pumpkin is more than enough for 1 tray, filled to the top. The contents are easily released from the tray with a twist or two. I've also used these for small portions of frozen fruit, and have seen in other reviews that they work well with baby food. The trays are excellent value for the money, and should last a long time.",
