The only down side is when I rotate the holder vertical it pushes into my leather seat.

It is also very easy and quick to put the phone on it. You can also tilt and adjust the angle as you wish. We have been using this product for two months and everything has been perfect.",

My only complaint is that it only fits on the front headrests of our car, and not on the rear headrests due to the bars being closer on the rear. It only retracts from one side, so it\u2019s a fairly limited range of movement that it has. We originally bought it to mount an iPad between our two rear facing kids in the backseat, but it didn\u2019t fit on the back seat headrests. We ended up just having to wedge it under a headrest, but it still held up the iPad so in the end it did the job, just not as well as I would have liked.",
