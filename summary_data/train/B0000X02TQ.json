Out of desperation, I tried Pepcid AC, it did absolutely nothing for my reflux ,NOTHING, the only thing it did was make me feel anxious within an hour of taking it for some reason, it just made me feel jittery. I will not buy it again, there is no point, it didn't work, I am just hoping the Zantac figures out where the carcinogens in their pills is coming from so that they can get it back on the market, SOON!! ~Robert's Wife~",

Then MD said to try Pepcid AC 2 pills at bedtime. Which worked after a few doses. It's important to follow all recommendations for heartburn relief. Like raising the head of your bed, stop eating and drinking 3 hrs before bedtime, don't lie down after eating, eat small meals, no chocolate or coffee or tea or soda or smoking or liquor or spices or greasy foods, don't bend over eating, etc. It took 5 weeks for my heartburn to totally go away. But w Pepcid I did feel better after 3 days.",
