This filter is quiet, the suction is just a small hole on the bottom and the waterfall effect is so pretty. Fred is curious about it, but swims quickly away when he feels the pull. So far, so good!",

I recommend leaving the filter off for the first few days, so enough bacteria builds up to make the water good for your goldfish.

It's got enough space for the heater and filter (I used a different filter than the one included) and the footprint is small enough to fit on my cube shelf, so my betta can hang out and watch us as we go about our day. It's still harder to maintain than a 5 gallon tank, but that's true of all small tanks. All in all, as long as you're okay with the extra maintenance required in a smaller tank, this is a great choice.",

However after the second time of one of them jumping over into the others side, I knew I needed separate tanks, and something bigger. This is a great looking crystal clear cube. I followed the advice from several other reviewers and replaced the filters with better ones. I also added heaters and used clear plastic packaging to cover the larger openings on the lids. So far these tanks seem to be doing their jobs and our fish look healthy and happy.",

It's the perfect size (even though a betta technically needs 5 gallons) and lets my betta explore more than before. However, the \"whisper\" filter it comes with is nice; it's just louder than the previous one. Overall, this tank is awesome; might just need to upgrade the filter in the future.",
