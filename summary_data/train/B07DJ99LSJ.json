Regarding assembly difficulties - I'd say you need very basic common sense to put it together the first time and then just consciousness thereafter. Regarding strength - I wonder what on earth people planned to use it for. It's clearly a pack carrable light duty table. It cannot handle a side load because it's not designed to. Use it for a camp side table to support a couple plates, drinks, etc and break it down, pack it and go. I'm pleased.",

I certainly won't be backpacking with it, but it's still relatively light and compact compared to the traditional folding type. I took one star off due to the finish. It has a grimy, unfinished look and feel to it. Not like the anodized color tables. It was also scratched up a lot, but I'm not too worried about that since I'll likely be adding a lot more.",

Light weight, super quick and intuitive to setup, and seems like it will be sturdy enough to hold a camp stove fine (main reason for purchase). Was going to buy a similar item from a trusted outdoor brand for twice the price but decided to give this a try. If this holds up to field use I consider this a great deal. Only thing I could ask for might be a bit more secure looking closure on the carry sack and maybe a small carry handle on the bag too.",

I just sit in a low to the ground camping chair or on a creeper though. I had originally bought it for backpacking and it is lightweight but fairly bulky and honestly extra weight I didn't need to lug around. Makes for a great car camping addition though.",

The vinyl is not good for hot items, is prone to tearing, and the bolt holes that attach the table to the legs become loose/stripped quite quickly. While this design still encorporates fabric-covered elastic and plastic grommets, the design seems quite sturdy and I could see how the table could be re-strung if the original shock cord/elastic breaks. This table was a big hit on the last camping trip. It sat in the center of the chairs and held the stereo and the lantern. It would make a great side-table as well.",
