My only issue, is that the microphone prices up on my earlobe, and is uncomfortable. There seems to be no adjustment for that. But it's early and I'm working on fit. As for sound quality I was concerned because I was replacing a very expensive microphone, and this has excellent sound quality. All in all I would recommend this microphone.",

This headset sounds as natural as any of the subminiature models, and seems to hold up okay over time. I cringe seeing how the talent heaves the more expensive headsets around, so it is a little comfort in knowing that if this headset falls off, it does not cast all the profit off a gig to replace.",
