They have never gotten wet or been mistreated in any way; yet the colour is fading and therefore making them look shoddy and cheap. I've had other brands in the past... had a pair of Globes for almost 6 years with no loss of colour at all. Comfortable, but I will not be purchasing this brand again due to their fading issue.",

I really love my vans, but I figured a shoe built for extreme sports lime skate boarding and offroad bmx riding would be the last shoe to warp, come undone, and shred the shoe support I to what feels like crumpled cardboard. Besides that great shoe. Maybe my machine operates at a higher temperature than most. I would just cold wash in the washer, then air dry.",

They're meant to be trainers not formal shoes!! Checking Van's website they've recently started doing comfort versions of this shoe at a higher price, so it looks they've upped the price for what they use to be and made a downgraded version at the normal price.
