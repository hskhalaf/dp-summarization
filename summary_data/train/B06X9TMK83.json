The lights are extremely bright and even work at a distance if your vanity sits further back. The mirror itself is a pretty rose gold and has a sturdy thick plastic outside, inside mirrors are nice quality, and the close up mirrors are nice. It\u2019s super thin and space saving too! Easy to travel with and assemble. Would buy again no doubt.",

It is a lighted mirror with smaller magnifying mirror panels on the right side. Here are the drawbacks, though... If you wear glasses, you may find yourself constantly repositioning the center panel, as the embedded LEDS cause glare. The magnifying (2x and 3x) panels are only on the right side mirror. This makes it difficult to see the left side of your face unless you contort your neck in an awkward angle.",

If you hold your finger on the sensor it dims just as described. This set up is, in fact, light weight. I'm not sure how sturdy it is. I have rated it 3 stars, at this point, primarily because it was advertised as rose gold and is very much a copper shade instead and not very appealing to the eye.",

I decided I wanted to return it, but unfortunately was 12 days past the cutoff. I haven't traveled with it, but the base is next to impossible to remove once you attach it. Also, I guarantee that the lights will turn on in your suitcase during the trip, so if you do buy it, bring extra batteries.",

We're not sure how long the batteries will last because we have it connected to a power supply but it's just as bright with NEW batteries as it is when connected to the power supply. I'll edit this post after we take a trip and test out the battery only option.",

It's light and folds up, but is a weird shape. Unless you have a massive makeup bag, you'll have to pack it separate. The magnification is great when trying to put on lashes or do detail work.",

The plug in is located at the bottom, not the back like shown in pictures. If you want to avoid the problem, leave it unplugged as I do, except when using it. Mirror is plenty great without using the light anyways!",

      "text": "The LED lighting seems like a good idea but in actuality, it's too harsh for good use in applying makeup. It's also nearly impossible to open the tri-fold design without getting fingerprints all over the mirror. I do like the fact that its design makes it compact when folded and put away so it doesn't take up a lot of space.",

As soon as I turned on the mirror lights, I heard a snapping sound and the lights became instantly dimmer. I turned off the light and opened the back panel, only to find that 2 of the 4 brand new batteries were leaking potassium hydroxide. Very disappointed with this defective and dangerous product. I would not recommend and I will be returning this immediately.",

I was worried the mirror would be broken cuz sometimes that happens during delivery but it was perfect! Delivery was also fast but because it snowed a lot of peoples packages got delayed in my area. But if it wasn\u2019t for that I would have gotten my order in two days! Also just a warning it doesn\u2019t come with batteries lol",
