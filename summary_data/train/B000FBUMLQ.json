With glass, I get the ease of cleaning, avoid plastic 'bad stuff', and can see what I am storing. All of my Pyrex products have been amazing.

Only thing to note: if you use these for baking purposes, the bowls are a little bit shallow, so trying to use a mixer can get a little tricky or messy (but it's totally do-able). They're typical 5-star Pyrex quality, I've had mine for 4 years now with no chips, cracks, scratches, or issues. I don't usually wash the larger ones in the dish washer (they take up a lot of space), but the smaller ones have gone through the dishwasher without incident. Totally recommend these!",

When the wife asked what got into me that i purchased kitchen stuff, I told her I had to because I was depressed so I went shopping. That diffused the encounter, so she said I totally understand because \"that's what i do when i am depressed\", success.",

Made of clear Pyrex glass they allow me to see what's inside. The lids close tightly, are colorful, and are perfect for refrigerator storage. The bowls are microwave, freezer, and dishwasher-safe which makes them extremely versatile. The only one minor inconvenience is that the bowls do not have a pour spout but that is very minor. Strongly recommend for price and value.",

Affordable, solidly built with a good weight, lids included.. this is everything i was looking for. The colorful lids also indicate what size mixing bowl it goes with, which is a nice touch! The bowls also nest for storage.. awesome!",

      "text": "I do not like the rim around the bowls; the rims are flat and protrude over the edge of the bowls, but this may have been done to create a tight seal with the lids. The lids fit tightly, much better than an older Pyrex bowls set I have. I really find the large size essential for making my overnight waffle batter. I love how the lids are marked and color coded with the bowl cup volume. The bowls are plain glass, but could pass as serving bowls for a casual meal. I recommend this, and the price was amazing!",

Now the box is big and heavy and I didn\u2019t unwrap expecting to return so I don\u2019t want to return the whole set, but would like to replace the chipped bowl! They seem good otherwise. Strong and heavy. The lids don\u2019t fit super tightly though. Definitely not spill-proof, but I\u2019m ok with that.",

They come sparkly clean from the dishwasher, but I wash the lids by hand just to be safe. Also, unlike plastic they don't stain or retain smells. Great purchase, much cheaper on amazon than in stores.",

Because this set comes with lids, the bowls can do double-duty as both mixing bowls and food storage containers. I've also used them to bring food to parties. The lids fit well and are labeled with the bowl capacity. The bowls have all the benefits of being Pyrex, meaning they're glass with no chemicals, can be microwaved, don't absorb smells/food, etc. There are 4 sizes in the set, so one is always appropriate for whatever you're doing. They nest within each other, so they don't take up too much space in the cabinet.",
