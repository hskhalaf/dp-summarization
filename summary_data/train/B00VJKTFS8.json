Sometimes the Spanish is a little hard to grasp if you are unfamiliar with the language, but as everyone knows - with kids you'll hear it at least 500 times so I'm sure I'll catch on!

Dora sings in both Spanish and English which is nice and Perrito bobs his head as he walks. He can also dance. There are several other things Dora and Perrito can do, as long as the leash is plugged into her hand.
