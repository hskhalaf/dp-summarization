I would love for it to be able to pump warmer air than it does. But it works rather well, and will warm up my 500-sq ft garage in about an hour and a half from 30 degree to 65. I mounted this over my work bench and have it angled to be pointing at where i'm usually standing, so even if I just started working in the garage, and the entire garage is cold, the area where i am standing is quite pleasant.",

I have a rather large 2 - car garage, around 540 sq. ft. and no special or extra insulation. It heats the garage to 67 degrees easily. As a matter of fact I have to turn the built in thermostat down to a cooler temp. If I had it to do over I'd choose the model that has a wireless remote control. Then again, I'm disabled and need help to reach it. Would I recommend it; YES. Wound I buy another one; in a heartbeat!",

I wanted a heater so I can work on cars in the winter and this does it and more. On full blast you will be in shorts and a t-shirt sweating. I used 10-2 wire and plug to an existing welding outlet so I can unplug it when needed.",
