So after suffered, wasted time a bit this became quite good product. Samsung Tab A on other hand is more expensive and all works like a charm from the starters. Good luck choosing the one that suit your needs and budget and finding balance. Price wise and quality wise this tablet is great, so if you have some patience fiddle a bit with it it is every penny worth.",
