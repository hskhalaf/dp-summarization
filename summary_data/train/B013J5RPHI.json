She struggles with negative thoughts about herself and most visits we have had are going in circles about her self doubt and insecurities. She is an amazing young woman but her illness won\u2019t let her see that. I bought this in hopes to help shift our conversation during our visit. It was just her, myself and my husband and we played two rounds. It didn\u2019t take long to get the hang of it. I do think it would have been more fun to play with at least 4 people but three worked fine.",

It's also a good way to offset the every day business environment when so much attention is on fixing problems. For once they got to say good things about one another, and serious think about what strengths everyone brought to the work we do. Very positive, and I don't think they were faking it more than a little. It is scary to be real together, but healthy and far more productive than pretending to be perfect with one another.",

It has enough structure that the game is clear while allowing for a lot of creativity for people to share with one another. And it's not all serious... we've had tons of laughs playing it as people see things in one another we don't see in ourselves- enlightening any humorous! Fun to replay even with the same group. -Signed either a Fair Goat or a Witty HedgeHog :)",

So far I have played this game with 4 families and children ranging from 10-17. Each family has reported loving the game with several parents become emotional when describing why they chose certain cards for their children. I also been incredibly helpful for parents to also see how their children view them and help them bond. Overall great product! i have recommended it to several clinicians i work with. I look forward to continue to use this game in future with my clients.",

We are going to do it with the grade school age kids at Christmas. This was a wonderful way for us to articulate wonderful things we see in one another.",

No competition as it is not intended to have a winner. Everyone just was able to feel good. FYI it was all adults playing the game as well. I think we all need to hear positive feed back from peers as adults as well.",
