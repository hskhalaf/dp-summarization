The radio is easy on tuning, and it is light weight. The only thing I would suggest to the seller is to make sure on the bottom of the radio, switch the power source from AAA to Lithium-ion before box it. I thought it was not working after charging for hours until I see the switch.",

There is a switch at the bottom to use AAA battery or the battery itself. You can charge the device via usb , solar, or hand crank. It will charge your phone too. It comes with a micro usb cord.

This came with astonishingly good instructions, was well packaged, and arrived on time. Sound quality is decent enough, although it\u2019s not something your gonna want to jam too for any length of time. This is in my Bug Box now and hopefully holds a change for extended periods.",

We had one night when there were tornado warnings and I slept blissfully UNaware, while my neighbor told me she spent half the night in her laundry room! Called Amazon and they took care of it for me. I've purchased another brand and it works perfectly.",
