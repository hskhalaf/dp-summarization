Two of my daughters have expensive digital SLR cameras in the $1,500.00 range which are around two years old. The SX110IS takes better photos! This shows how fast technology is moving. My wife is an artist and enters contests via a photo of her paintings. Taking an excellent photograph of an original oil painting is almost impossible. My wife has even hired professional photographers. The SX110IS absolutely takes the best photos of oil paintings that I have ever seen. The photos aren't just a little bit better, but a whole lot better!",

Only thing is that compared to cameras like the Elph or the CoolPix, it's bulky and she doesn't like carrying it around while just sightseeing. I'm hoping she'll give it to me when she's done and I'll get her a \"cute\" camera instead!",

I compared this with a Nikon and another Sony and it seemed to have the best balance between features and cost and I wasn't disappointed. Picture quality is flawless, digital 'face finding' focusing is pretty cool. Battery life seems good and the fact that it takes AA batteries is actually a good alternative to the Sony which has a proprietary battery pack. The slightly larger than minimal form factor is actually a help in providing a solid grip on the camera while still allowing portability.",

I'm sure there are bertter cameras out there, but if you want a great camera at a great price, this is it. The only downfall, which could be a perk, is that it uses 2 AA batteries.

The camera feels good in your hands. The only negative I have is that it chews and spits out standard AA batteries in a very short period of time. Rechargables are the only way to go.",

The digital image stabilization does a great job of keeping your photos blur-free too. The only downside is that the CCD is a bit noisy.

    "title": "Canon Powershot SX110IS 9MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black)",
    "description": "Color:BlackFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n From a 10x optical zoom lens to advanced Canon technology that automatically gives you the best shot, the 9.0-megapixel PowerShot SX110 IS packs impressive value. Advanced Face Detection Technology automatically sets focus, exposure, flash and white balance for beautiful portraits and group shots. Sharp, steady close-ups are easy with the powerful zoom and Canon\u2019s Optical Image Stabilizer Technology. The slim and modern-looking SX110 IS is sized to go everywhere, and you\u2019ll never miss a detail with the big, bright LCD screen. \n\nPowerShot SX110IS Highlights \n\n\n\n10x optical zoom in action Zoom in for sharp, steady close-ups with Canon\u2019s 10x Optical Zoom lens\nThe PowerShot SX110 IS has a 10x optical zoom lens that makes it easy to get the inspiring, emotive close-ups that will make your images lasting keepsakes. This magnificent lens gives you the power to shoot distant subjects with razor-sharp precision and stunning lifelike color. So you can brilliantly capture a bird high atop a tree, a child\u2019s winning goal from across the stadium or a school play from the last row. Plus, thanks to Canon\u2019s highly sophisticated Optical Image Stabilizer Technology, even at maximum zoom, every image is rock steady. \n\nThe PowerShot SX110 IS is equipped with Canon\u2019s acclaimed Optical Image Stabilizer Technology that automatically detects and corrects camera shake -- one of the leading causes of fuzzy or blurred shots. Even when zoomed in, you can get the steady, crisp, brilliant images you\u2019ll be proud to shoot and share. And Canon\u2019s Optical Image Stabilizer Technology is convenient to use. It functions perfectly with or without a flash. \n\nDIGIC III Image Processor with Genuine Canon Face Detection AF/AE/FE/WB\nWith DIGIC III, your images boast superior quality, the camera operates at top efficiency and battery life is enhanced. What\u2019s more, DIGIC III enables Canon\u2019s Face Detection, Motion Detection Technologies and Red-eye Correction to give you better, more true-to-life people shots. Simply press the shutter button halfway down, and the camera automatically pinpoints the faces in the scene and chooses the ideal focus point. The camera controls exposure settings and flash to keep every face looking bright and natural. The camera also selects and sets the optimal exposure and ISO settings automatically to keep everything looking sharp and clear. Red-eye Correction can be handled in-camera, in two ways. The Red-eye Correction during shooting uses the Face Detection Technology to recognize and remove red-eye from images as they're taken, before the file is written to the memory card. It's also possible to correct red-eye during image playback, using simple settings in the SX110 IS's menu. \n\niSAPS Technology is an entirely original scene-recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos, iSAPS works with the fast DIGIC III Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy, as well as exposure and white balance. \n\nCapture great shots with Face Detection AF/AE/FE DIGIC III features Face Detection Technologies, giving you the best possible results in any shooting situation. Face Detection AF/AE sets the focus point and exposure for the faces of your subjects. Face Detection FE adjusts the flash to correctly illuminate your subject to provide the best balance between your subject and the overall scene, eliminating the common problems of over and underexposed faces. Face Detection WB means the camera concentrates upon faces when calculating white balance for the best possible skin tones. Face Select and Track lets you highlight one face among several in a scene, and the camera concentrates on that person, even as they move around the scene. Face Detection Technology is a powerful contributing factor in Canon's Motion Detection Technology. Simply press the Face Selector Button, then the selected face is double-framed and tracked when the face moves in the frame. \n\nMotion Detection Technology works in the background to instantly evaluate how fast your subject is moving. It automatically selects and sets the optimal exposure and ISO settings to keep everything looking sharp and clear. This feature provides higher ISOs when you need it for action-stopping shutter speeds. But when no movement is detected, it sets lower ISOs for excellent color and detail. Life doesn\u2019t give you second chances to capture special times. That\u2019s why the PowerShot SX110 IS features ISO 1600 and High ISO Auto settings that reduce the effects of camera shake and sharpen subjects in low-light situations, giving you greater shooting flexibility. \n\nRed-eye Correction provides three options for removing red-eye from subjects in flash pictures.\n1) The Red-eye Correction during shooting actually identifies and corrects red-eye in human subjects as pictures are taken.\n2) The SX110 IS can be set to automatically detect and correct red-eye during image playback.\n3) You can manually locate any red eyes in a scene during image playback on the LCD screen, and command the camera to remove them.\n\n\nSlim, modern shape and a big LCD\nTake your camera everywhere with this new slim design and large, bright 3.0-inch LCD. You\u2019ll want to have your PowerShot SX110 IS with you wherever you go, and a slim new design makes it easy. Subtly rounded for an easy grip, the camera exudes modern elegance and simplicity. The back panel\u2019s neat, intuitive interface includes a luxuriously big 3.0-inch LCD screen. And the LCD screen\u2019s quality is as impressive as its size: you\u2019ll get an exceptionally clear, bright view of all your shots, and enjoy a conveniently wide viewing angle for showing off your pictures to friends and family. \n\nAA batteries for power anywhere\nConveniently, you don\u2019t need to worry about running out or recharging of batteries. Since AA-size batteries can be purchased at any store, simply get new ones locally -- no special power adapters or chargers are needed wherever you go. \n\nA wide range of shooting modes to capture anything Now you\u2019re free to concentrate on what really counts -- your subject. With the large simple-to-operate Mode Dial, all you have to do is turn to the setting that best matches the scene you\u2019re viewing through the lens. The PowerShot SX110 IS does the rest. It chooses the perfect exposure, aperture and flash. Or if you want to flex your creative muscles, choose Manual Control and do it all yourself. You\u2019ve got Special Scenes Modes to handle a wide range of common shooting situations -- effortlessly. \n\nWith 20 Shooting Modes including 8 Special Scene Modes, you\u2019re ready for whatever shot comes your way. \n\nThe Complete Print Solution\nThe PowerShot SX110 IS's Print/Share button makes direct printing easier than ever. Simply connect the SX110 IS to a Canon PIXMA Photo Printer or SELPHY Compact Photo Printer or any PictBridge compatible photo printer, press the lighted Print/Share button and print! Also use the Print/Share button to transfer images to a computer (Windows and Macintosh). \n\nPrint your own ID photos in up to 28 different sizes or use the Movie Print function to output multiple stills from a recorded movie on a single sheet with a Canon SELPHY Compact Photo Printer.",
