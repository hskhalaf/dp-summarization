      "text": "My first experience with this hairspray was in a salon. I absolutely loved the scent. I'm very sensitive to smells, so I mainly bought this for the scent, which is the best (most tolerable) I've ever smelled for a hairspray. It's got a vanilla-musky scent to it, which is very distinct. No disgusting chemical smell. I also like it because it's a flexible hold hairspray, so it doesn't make your hair crunchy or sticky. It gives you just enough hold and lasts for a decent amount of time. I don't care about the price because I don't want to smell like chemicals or cheap \"grandma's church perfume\" hairspray. LOL I'd recommend this for that alone. It is pretty great though.",

Unfortunately for me, I'd ordered in advance to make sure I didn't run out and didn't open the cans until day 32 -- 2 days after the deadline for returning a product. My fault but still, out a lot of cash. Going back to Nordstrom. Amazon needs to watch quality of their vendors and now I'm leery of trusting them as much. Sigh.",

I have long straight hair that doesn't always hold curl but I used it today after using a curling wand and the curls lasted pretty much all day.
