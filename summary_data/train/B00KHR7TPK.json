We initially bought it for travel, but I love it even more than our bulky swing / rocker seat we have at home. My baby doesn't nap super easily, and he napped SO well in this thing. I wish we had discovered it sooner - it could have replaced quite a few(more expensive) baby gadgets. My husband said some reviewers noted that it tips easily... and while it can tip easily while empty, the weight of the baby makes it nearly impossible to tip... so not a worry you should have.",

      "text": "Okay product. The incline is a little too steep for a newborn that is lacking in head control. The steep incline causes newborn heads to flop slightly forward, which can cause airway occlusion. As the baby grows and gains better head control they do enjoy sitting in this bouncer, and playing with the toys on the bar. The toys are double sided, sturdy, and spin around. The colors on the seat are bring and stimulating, and the vibrating feature is handy to sooth gassy babies. Assembly is easy and takes about 5 minutes.",

When the babysitter needed one, I bought a different brand/type (rocker style) and he was like \"yeah, no, can I have the same bouncer?\" So I bought a second one and we used this until about 5 months when his 99 percentile fat booty started making it sag and we had to give it to another baby.",

The one problem we do have is the \"vibration box\" just slides into the front part of the chair, and occasionally dislodges and falls out. I feel like it should be in more securely.

They both function the exact same way (a chair for a baby) only this one is lighter and easier to bring around the house to different rooms. The fun lion fabric is loved by all the toddlers that visit us too. They all crawl in and sit on the chair so i know it will be able to be used by our daughter for the next couple of years. Amazing value for the price.",

I wish it was a little more reclined but I\u2019m sure when she is a little older it won\u2019t be as bad. Definitely recommend this for about 4-5 months plus. Not really the greatest option but it works for what we needed and hoping she will be more comfortable as she grows.",

When the baby gets too big for this, he'll move on to something else so he won't be in this for very long but it is so helpful to be able to put him in it, knowing he's secure and I can do something else with my hands besides hold him (although that's no so bad either, just hard to do when I'm washing dishes.) It also makes it easy to talk to him as I go about my routine.",

Also, it takes c batteries, which are not exactly something I have lying around the house. One extra step of going to get the right batteries can seem like a lot with a newborn!",
