Their imagination allows them to enjoy the classic nerf darts where I just wish they performed better. These Rivals series do perform better. Our 7 year old picked this Atlas out. It shoots 2 balls at once, which while not really helpful, is really cool.",

      "text": "Guns are great and lots of fun when functioning correctly. They jam pretty easily if you do not operate the cocking mechanism all the way forward and then back to the original position which sounds logical but it is pretty easy to short it. This leads to the balls getting stuck since it shoots 2 at a time. This can be difficult for younger kids to do since the gun is long and the mechanism is fairly strong. It also seems to shoot at different distances which may be the balls colliding but I couldn't tell.",

It is easier to load, cock and only shoots one ball instead of the Atlas which releases 2 balls with each shot making it very difficult to aim and also a lower velocity when the ball comes out of the gun.Also cheaper. The Apollo does come with fewer balls but those are very inexpensive on Amazon so just buy 25 or 50 extra and let your kids fire away!",

The first shot sounds extremely intimidating and I almost regretted buying it for the kids, but the bark is worse than the bite and it doesn't hurt to be shot by the little balls. A spontaneous Nerf war broke out and the whole family enjoyed battling with this and the Nerf Zombie Strike Doominator Blaster. Definitely recommend this one for kids and adults of all ages. You may need to assist the kids with loading the balls at first, but they'll get the hang out of it pretty quick.",
