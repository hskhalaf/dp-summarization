I thought it was no big deal I'll just order a new one from Hamilton Beach. Nope. They don't offer replacement parts except the racks and rotisserie pieces. They expect me to throw a perfectly good piece of equipment away for what would probably be a $5 part of it were available anywhere which it's not. So what was a 5+ star review is now 2. Hopefully epoxy will fix the knob but that shouldn't be necessary",

Oven was used 3-4 times a week. Wish it lasts much longer (ie Kenmore Waffle/Pancake Cooker for over 30 years, Teflon - easy clean up and heavy duty Stainless steel - Sears Purchase)",

While that isn't the fault of the oven I do have issues setting the temp without having to put my face 6 inches from the dial and turning the timer dial can be absolutely impossible if your hands aren't completely dry. They really should have put some grooves or something on the dial for grip. In the end it works but I wouldn't buy it again.",

I dropped one star due to the outside being a bit too hot during use. Not a fire hazard, but too hot to touch. I recommend this oven.",

    "title": "Hamilton Beach 31103A Countertop Oven with Convection and Rotisserie, Metallic (Discontinued)",
    "description": "HAMILTON BEACH COUNTERTOP OVEN WITH CONVECTION & ROTISSERIE 31103\nSmall enough to fit on your kitchen counter, but large enough to help you prepare for any meal or party, the Hamilton Beach Countertop Oven with Convection & Rotisserie boasts full-size oven performance in compact, energy-efficient form.Designed with both kitchen style and practicality in mind, the Countertop Oven with Convection & Rotisserie is portable and countertop convenient. It's packed with versatile cooking options that range from baking cakes to crisping cookies to broiling salmon to roasting an entire 5 lb. chicken, roast or pork. There's no need to spend extra time cooking separate meals for the pickier ones, either. The wide interior and adjustable cooking racks provide double the space for cooking multiple foods at once.What's more, this oven is ideal for anyone, anywhere and anytime. It can replace the microwave in your office, offer easy cooking access for the elderly, serve as a staple for apartment dwellers or provide snack enthusiasts with a little added treat.\n\n\nPRODUCT FEATURE BENEFITS\n * Uses 49% less energy than a typical kitchen oven\n * Extra-large capacity accommodates two 12\" pizzas, two 9\"x13\" casseroles, two cake pans, two sheets of cookies or a 5 lb. chicken\n * Easy-clean, nonstick oven interior\n * Includes two oven racks, large enamel-coated baking pan, small baking pan and broil rack\n * Broil rack also stacks directly on small baking pan for roasting meats\n * Includes rotisserie accessories: rotisserie lift and forks with rod (skewer) Slide-out, full-width crumb/drip tray\n * Easy-to-read temperature dial on front control panel can be adjusted to desired or pre-set temperatures\n * Easy-to-read function dial on front control panel can be adjusted to four pre-programmed settings: BAKE, CONVECTION, BROIL, ROTISSERIE\n * Power indicator light\n * 2-hour cooking timer with audible tone and automatic shutoff\n\nGIVES YOU THE CHOICE OF BAKE, CONVECTION, BROIL OR ROTISSERIE\nDon't want to heat up the entire kitchen or slave away over a hot burner? No sweat \u2013 the Hamilton Beach Countertop Oven provides extra capacity for second oven convenience as well as four ways to cook: BAKE, CONVECTION, BROIL and ROTISSERIE.\n\nA 9\"x13\" baking pan can be found in most kitchens in North America, used for making everything from lasagna to brownies. Not only does this oven fit two 9\"x13\" pans at once, unlike conventional ovens without convection technology, the Countertop Oven with Convection and Rotisserie comes fully equipped. Instead of having heat come from just one central area and no fan to \"stir-up\" or circulate air evenly all over, this oven's convection technology utilizes a top and bottom heating element and a built-in fan to distribute heat evenly for a uniform temperature. That way, bakers can choose between traditional baking \u2013 ideal for cupcakes, cakes and soft baked goods \u2013 or convection baking \u2013 ideal for a crispy pizzas, cookies or even taquitos. Use the rotisserie feature for roasted chicken, beef roast or pork roast. Note: Only upper heating elements will be on during the rotisserie mode.\n\nTIPS & CARE\nBefore cooking with the oven, always PREHEAT for approximately 5 minutes. Check pan manufacturer's directions for oven-safe rating. Do not cover the crumb/drip tray or any part of the oven in aluminum foil (causes overheating); however, use of aluminum foil to partially cover casseroles or some foods is acceptable. Visit foodsafety. gov for more safe cooking temperature information.\n\nThe full-width crumb/drip tray slides out from the front, allowing easy washing. For the best oven performance, cleaning should be done regularly. Unplug first and allow oven to cool before interior and exterior cleaning. For interior cleaning: wipe oven walls, bottom tray and glass door with a damp, soapy cloth, but do not scratch or damage heating element tube. Repeat with a damp, clean cloth. All removable parts should be hand washed in warm, soapy water as well. For stubborn interior stains, use a plastic scouring pad. For exterior cleaning: wipe oven walls with a damp cloth, but do not use abrasive cleansers or metal scouring pads; this can scrape/scratch the surface.",
