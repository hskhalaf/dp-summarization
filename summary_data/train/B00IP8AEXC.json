Bottom line: The seat is great when you have more than one vehicle. It's light weight, and you don't have to tether it in, although it's recommended to do so when not in use so it doesn't become a flying projectile in an accident.",

Today when he fell asleep he just slipped sideways on the seat still strapped in twisted in the seat belt, this was not a safe situation.

She is 9 years old and about 60 lbs. It is perfect for her. It felt hard when we pulled it out of the box and I was worried she would say it was uncomfortable, but she is loving it!! For the price, can't beat it!",
