We affixed the velcro stickers to the tips of the arrows and the darts. Sometimes the arrows wouldn't stick, but they usually did. It was a fun game for all ages! I wish they made a bow that was the same size, but was more generic so it didn't seem like it was girl-themed. My 12 and 14 year old brothers had fun with the bows too.",
