I wanted to use this in conjunction with my Amazon Echo, and WHEN it worked... it was great and cool. But getting it to connect to the network in the first place took an entire day, and after moving it, I am unable to reconnect. Not to the device its self or to get it to connect to the network. It was a sad sad waste of money... I will have to find another solution. DO NOT BUY!!!",
