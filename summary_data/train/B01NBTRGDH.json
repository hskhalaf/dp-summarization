The legs snap into place and stay locked so I don't have to worry about it toppling over or they fold back under when I'm not using my computer. Also good for my iPad when I'm watching movies or playing games. Only suggestion I have is something on the legs. They fold around and the edges seem to be a bit sharp, so I'm thinking a pool noodle should do the trick. I used the noodle, as you can see and just cut like six-inch pieces. Cut a slide out of it and slipped it on and it works perfectly.",
