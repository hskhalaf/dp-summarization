Turning the front of the stroller doesn't even get the wheels to fully turn in the right direction even with about 15lbs of dog on board.

      "text": "For the price this stroller is fantastic for pets. It has a clip inside to keep your pet in place. Very sturdy construction and has top to keep your pet out of the sun. For the price, the quality of the stroller is equal to pet strollers that cost at least double. People have complained about the wheels and I understand that because the wheels are hard plastic. The are fine for smooth surfaces but for the price of the stroller they are good and what you should expect. My dog absolutely loves this stroller",

They seem to like it, as they peek from out the basket (with the mesh still zipped on to prevent them from jumping out), and it looks snug. I have three cats and they all fit comfortably.",

This is her first stroller and thinks its grand especially with the pink/white polka dots. Evee loves the super comfortable ride. Now she can go to alot of cool places with the family. I'm sure she loves to be able to see mom right thru the back screen mesh. Her dad had no problem putting it together and before she knew it, she was enjoying her ride. Wheels are a good size too! This stroller is perfect for 5 yr old Evee. She weighs 14 lbs and has plenty of room. Her friend, Tucker, also liked the ride!",

The storage underneath, and the drink holder also come in handy. Easy to steer, and good on all the terrains we've encountered. Great stroller!",

It would have been better if there was also a pocket on the back under the cup holder. The worse feature is the zipper on the front screen. The zipper for some reason is in an awkward position, making it difficult to zip it. I should have spent more for a better product.",

My 6# and 10# shih tzus fit comfortably inside with room to lie down (as long as your dogs like each other!) the enclosure zips up completely or can be pulled all the way back to fully expose the area where the dogs sit.

It's simple to open and break down...and it comes fully assembled minus the wheels. Which are easy to get on. I haven't found any defects in the fabric or the zippers. Will update if needed once I use this more.",

Cons: (1) the handle is not adjustable, so anyone 6 feet or taller will likely have a sore back from bending over; (2) the wheels are plastic, which means any imperfection in the surface will greatly affect the ride quality; and (3) the small wheels cannot easily traverse divots in the pavement/sidewalk.",
