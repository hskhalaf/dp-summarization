It has been a terrific upgrade in both quieter operation and smartly throttling the fan speed to control temperature. Its way lighter and far less bulky than the other fan. The display unit is impressive and really the only inline duct fan display it its class right now. I didn't have any issues programming it to work with a temperature range or installing it. In fact, I liked this fan so much, I ordered an 80mm fan from the same company.",

Very easy led controls and easy to follow instructions. I had to leave my grow tent open cause the fan output kept ballooning my tent but this isn't a big deal. The temperature control is the best part for growers who have a hard time managing the temp of the grow room. Thumbs up to AC Infinity, must have. Even though I'm a beginner and this is my first grow room, you can't take any shortcuts, your plants will thank you.",

The whole package is well thought out with everything included. For the price compared to others and the included display, it cant be beat. For my application, it is set at the 3rd setting(9watts) that is pretty much whisper quiet. it can move serious air at the higher settings Only issue, would rather have display wireless, less wires. Have ordered their products in the past and will continue to use their products. Top notch!",

For example, I chose 80 F and 60% humidity. Instead of keeping the temp/humidity below the threshold I chose by being \"smart\" and adjusting the fan speeds incrementally keeping the temp/humidity at bay, it waits until it reaches the threshold then goes full blast until it gets one degree/% below the threshold then stops blowing completely. As you can imagine if using in a grow tent it doesn't take long to get back to your thresholds with no fan movement, so its a constant \"quiet/loud/quiet/loud\" experience.

      "text": "I was having issues with my tomato plants and realized the lack of air exchange with the outside was the issue. I have plenty of air movement in the tent, but not enough exhaust and intake of fresh air. This fan setup is not only incredibly functional, but beautiful as well. It's well engineered, quiet, and moves a ton of air. Speed settings 1-10 provide plenty of flow options. TBH, the 10 setting nearly implodes my tent even with both bottom vent flaps open... you can see the walls sucking inward! Really like the fan, and it's greatly improved my grow. Awesome product.",

This product actually looks like it was manufactured this century and not like battered tin cans like some other brands.

It will make the fan last for years to come compared to cheap 20 dollar speed controllers you use with the cheapest 80 dollar fans.

The only \u201cwish\u201d is that it would allow a wider range of cooling. What I mean by this, though it will keep your temps below the high setpoint adequately, it should cool down maybe 10 degrees before the high temp allowing a large enough margin of time to reintroduce CO2. As it functions now, It will cool it down only 2 degrees below high temp limit, essentially turning it on more frequently removing the CO2. Just having a larger temp buffer would be advantageous.",

    "title": "AC Infinity CLOUDLINE T6, Quiet 6\u201d Inline Duct Fan with Temperature Humidity Controller - Ventilation Exhaust Fan for Heating Cooling Booster, Grow Tents, Hydroponics",
    "description": "Inline Duct Fan \n\nA smart inline duct fan designed to quietly ventilate hydroponic grow rooms, boost heating/cooling to rooms, circulate fresh air, exhaust projects, and cool AV closets. Featuring an inline mixed-flow design, the duct fan can maintain airflow even in high static pressure applications. Contains an EC-motor with PWM-control for a quiet and energy-efficient performance. Includes an intelligent controller that features advanced programming and functions. Complete kit includes one duct fan unit, one thermal controller, one corded thermal probe, two duct clamps, installation manual, all necessary mounting hardware, and all necessary mounting hardware.\n\nIntelligent ControllerThe controller can be programmed to adjust fan speeds to respond to varying high and low temperatures, and humidity. For ventilation applications, the controller can be set to run continuously or triggered to run at customizable speeds when given power, due to its backup memory capability. Additional features include a countdown timer, alarm system, and eco-mode. Includes a detachable 12-foot precision probe that is water-resistant. This EC smart controller can power and control two inline fans of any size like this CLOUDLINE T6 with an S4.\n\nQuiet and Energy Efficient DesignFeatures an EC-motor that is controlled using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation). This technology enables motors to be able to run smoothly at extremely low RPM speeds without generating additional heat or noise. In addition, the duct fan uses a mixed-flow design using a stator blade and dual hydrodynamic wind circles. This gives it a high static pressure rating, enabling it to deliver airflow even in applications where air movement is being restricted. The motor houses dual ball bearings rated at 67,000 hours which allows the duct fan unit to be mounted in any direction. The unit is IP44 rated to be highly resistant to dust and liquids, and performs well even in harsh environments.",
