I got them for my mom who was visiting me in orlando and her transitions didn't get dark enough for the intense sun here plus, while we were at Disney world, she didn't want the hassle of having to remove clip on sunglasses every time we'd go into a store or indoor attraction, only to have to put them right back on. each set of sunglasses comes in a little plastic case, keeping them safe if you throw rhemcin a backpack or purse and there are different uses for each one. this was a great buy! they were delayed in shipping for two days for whatever reason, but the products themselves are awesome!",
