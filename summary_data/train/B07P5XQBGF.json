The audio performance is strong across a wide range of music styles, video syncing is accurate, waterproofing is better than many of its rivals, as is battery life. The only spoiler is the touch-sensitive controls, which can be erratic at times. Stroking rather than tapping helped, so if you adopt that technique then these earbuds could be an excellent buy.",

Every time the headphones are taken out of the case I have to forget the device on my iPhone, turn off the Bluetooth and then pair them again, which is very frustrating. Also the instructions say that you can put the right earphone away in the box and then when you tak it out they will reconnect, they don\u2019t. I again have to put both headphones back in the box, take them out at exactly the same time and re do the connection as mentioned before. This is very disappointing from this brand as it used their products before and they were amazing.",

In short pretty excellent all round performance.

I can\u2019t discuss the sweat or water-proofing as it hasn\u2019t rained and I don\u2019t gym. Charging and set up is simple. Packaging is nice without being overly fussy and includes everything you need to adjust fit and fully charge everything. For under \u00a350 you can\u2019t go wrong!",

Other bluetooth earbuds I've tried have randomly cut out a lot while walking or turning my head, these have not yet done that (been using these for just over a week, others did it immediately). Only downside I've found is they somehow amplify rustling background noises, for example while I'm on the train commuting, I can quite loudly hear papers and plastic bags being rustled by others louder than I would hear them without the headphones. It's not a show stopper, but can get annoying sometimes if there is someone doing a lot of rustling!",

Funny things can happen if you are in an environment where there's lots of Bluetooth going on like on a bus or train. They may disconnect. I've had odd experiences with weird sound after going well out of range but easily fixed with return to charger unit. From the pictures I wasn't expecting the case/ charger to be so tiny.

However, the other side hears a lot of echo during phone calls, so you need to be in a very quiet room in order to be able to use these for phone calls. Another criticism is the charging box/bay feels a bit light and flimsy compared to other products at the same price range.",

They don't isolate as much noise as I'd like, but I wouldn't expect it to be perfect for the price. I'd maybe get a cord to tie them together as I lost the left one when I fell off my bike.

Dont get me wrong maybe once a week the right one will drop out for a second but other than that they have been great. My only grip is they do slip out my ear slowly when walking even with the biggest ear buds. Would love it if they could add the sports hook to later editions.",

I'd briefly looked at Bluetooth headphones before but had been put off either by the price or the poor battery life. For \u00a328 these look good, sound great and (especially combined with the charging case) have excellent battery life. I can't fault them other than I found the supplied buds quite uncomfortable so have replaced them with some spare ones I had from other headphones but that's a small complaint.",

The buds themselves are of an okay quality but the case could do with some improvement, again being the clumsy person I am, have dropped the case a few times which makes the buds go flying. The led charging indicator isn't very clear but does the job. For a cheaper alternative I can't fault them, you get what you pay for.",

The sound is good, they do a great job of blocking out external sounds and had decent bass. Making calls is ok, a limitation of these buds means outside they will pick up on wind sounds.

      "text": "I've had these nine months, and for most of that time they've worked as expected: no connection issues, good sound quality, etc. However over the past few weeks, even after multiple factory resets, the earbuds just will not connect to each other. I can use each individually, with the same sound quality as before (albeit mono rather than stereo), just never both at the same time. I've tried on multiple phones and laptops, so I know its the earbuds that are at fault. Shame really. Has to be 1-star as I expect headphones to last many years, not just a few months.",

I can't believe the quality of these earpods. I'm listening to songs I've heard thousands of times and getting a new found love for them and noticing things I've never heard before.
