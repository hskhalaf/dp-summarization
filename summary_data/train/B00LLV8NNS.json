No matter how well I do the rest of my makeup, without a good blush I look wan and sick and people ask if I'm ok. But most blushes wear off so easily. This product is awesome because it lasts all day, which is exactly what I was looking for. It's easy to apply (it has a doe foot applicator) and there is time to blend it in before it dries (a problem with other brands I've tried). Absolutely recommend!",

I can finally kiss my boyfriend and drink from a nice glass without transferring color. Best to exfoliate lips before for even coloring because it is truly a stain, and you can layer for bolder color which is so nice. And it's the first stain I've ever tried that doesn't totally dry out my lips. It isn't drying at all. Wears well under lip balm. Just leave it on for a few minutes to set and soak in before doing anything else. I'm totally cheap and this was worth the $15.",
