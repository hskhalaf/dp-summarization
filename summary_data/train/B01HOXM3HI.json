Get yourself a cheap pair of less flashy eastons for those long BP sessions, and leave these babies for raking on game day!",

They fit perfectly and after over a month of use I've had no issues with any tearing or ripping (I pull on my gloves A LOT, weird habit I have). The only thing I didn't expect was the red dye from my bat to transfer to the white on the palm of the gloves...I've only ever used black batting gloves so I didn't know that would happen. So, regardless of how old your bat may be (mine is over a year old), keep in mind that color of the tape on your bat could transfer to the white of the palms",
