I sharpen knives on the side and have the tools to correctly sharpen about anything. After a very light sanding to remove the dings, I applied my buffer. The buffer wheel actually created a bur on the steel which tells me that the steel is very soft, but easy to sharpen. The cutter works very well and if I only use it on my poly cutting board, I should not have to sharpen for a long time.",

It fits nice and snug so it stays on while in our utensil drawer. The other feature we like is that the handle and blade are one piece so there's nothing that will come apart or loosen up. This design also makes for easy cleaning. Don't think we could be happier with this cutter.",

No rolling back and forth with a dull wheel. I also like this because if and when I need to sharpen, it will be super easy to sharpen. Th blade cover is a great so I won't worry about slicing myself grabbing it out of the drawer. Good quality at a great price.",
