      "text": "These 2 margarita glasses arrived quickly & safely. Both glasses were perfect upon unpacking. These are beautiful, substantial, solid & artisan. The blue stripe around the rim of the glass is perfect. These 16oz glasses are stable & will hold a substantial drink. Feel great in my hand & delightful to look at. One glass was 1/4\" higher than the other, but who cares? They are gorgeous & who will notice when filled with margaritas! I prefer the artisan quality to show. Seriously buy these glasses. They are classy & fun & make a statement among your bar & glassware.",

The other glasses seem sturdy and good looking. I will change to five stars if I can get a fourth, unbroken glass.",
