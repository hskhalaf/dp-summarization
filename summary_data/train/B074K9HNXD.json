I've turned off things I didn't need and I lock the screen so that my shirt sleeve or water in the shower hitting it doesn't start bringing up menus. HR accuracy is better if you change the data recording to every second. It is very programmable and I use it to record bike rides, walking and weight workouts. The Garmin Connect app is really nice and it also works great as a watch.",

Hasn't connected in over a week and they tell you not to bother to call because there are too many problems as reported by users so they are not providing phone support. - Exercise data? Not accurate. -Intensity minutes? Not accurate. - Steps? Not accurate. - Battery? Pathetic. Timekeeping? Seems to work as a watch...but that feature wasn't even important to me!

I did the recommended hard reset of the watch but to no avail. However, I'll probably get a replacement this one, hoping it's not defective because the features and app and tracking are all without peer. I used to have a Samsung watch, and while that is a better smartwatch that's easier to use, Garmin has far better running and exercise tracking while still having good smartwatch functions like notifications and such.",

      "text": "It sucked for working out... It wasn't tracking my heart rate and steps properly, therefore it wasn't tracking my calorie burn properly either.. I called both Amazon and Garmin. Garmin did some trouble shooting...it seem to work for a couple of days...then it started doing the same shit all over again.. I had to return it!!!! Had it for almost a month...and it started acting up almost immediately after buying it.... And that was my second vivoactive in 6 weeks!!! Wish I could give it a zero/no star for working out... IJS!!!",
