It's just that simple. Let sit on counter a few minutes and it pops right out. if you run water over it, you'll cause cracks. Love this gadget. Highly recommend you use it and get it right the first time.",

The first time I overfilled and the ball was out of shape also, as the instructions say freeze for ONLY four hours and no more. The only thing I did differently was to use distilled water and boil, let the water get to room temperature, fill the mold, then froze for the required time. Take a look at these photographs!

They are necessary for Old Fashioned drinks or sipping bourbon. However, they still don't last that long in the glass.",

It simply is a matter of physics and the properties of H2O and energy of changing from a solid to liquid.",

The issue is that the ice spheres are really difficult to get out of the molds unless you run water around the outside to loosen them up. This seems kinda at cross purposes with the original purpose. Thing to note; if you glass doesn't have a lot of liquid in it and the spheres don't float up a little, you can end up with them kinda blocking the glass. Perhaps this is more of a stylistic than a functional complaint. But on the other hand, I'm now using 2-inch ice cubes and as far as I can tell, the ice spheres really do last longer.",

These work perfect for me... they are durable.. they make large round ice cubes and are easy to fill and empty. Though I do run a bit of warm water over them as I am removing the round ice cub. Have used the first set endlessly since day one... and now with two sets I can keep a nice supply on hand.. A good buy and I enjoy them and everyone that comes over... wants just ONE ice cube.. but one of my giant round ones...",

Now, however, I seem to be finding an oily film floating and several chunks floating on my drinks. I only use bottled water to fill them, and that hasn't changed. I think the freezer is breaking down the silicone. I still use these, but I rinse the cubes really well after I take them out of the molds. Unfortunately, that melts a lot of the cube away, making it much smaller than before.",
