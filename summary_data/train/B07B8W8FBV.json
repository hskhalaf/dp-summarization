This one has a tan base and some splattering of the same color atop a white base. More like a beige white. It isn't white white. so it is muted in color. But, it also is striking in its simplicity. I will be redecorating all over my house and this will be prominently displayed. I will keep it clean and not put anything in it.",

I collect LARGE vases - many floor sized between 3 and 4 ft. This isn't large even for a table top. In fact, it's downright small. The neutral colors are attractive but again, unlike the description, this isn't stone, this isn't anything other than a clay type composite. Overall it's a decorative enough item but the given price would make it seem far larger and more appealing than it really is. Overall disappointing.",

In addition, it\u2019s very neutral in design and tone and, thus, is easy to coordinate with the style of almost any room in the house. I keep ours on the front landing because it deserves center stage. The vase also makes an ideal housewarming or bridal shower gift.",

Upon arrival, I find it is about a quart in size with no cover and watertight, even if the glaze is a bit spotty. It is molded, not hand.thrown. There are three buttons on the bottom so it will not scar furniture. Since it is art, the glaze pattern will be a bit different from the picture, but you get the idea. Mine has less brown. I personally like it, and will award five stars, and think the price is fine, now, but would not invest more.",
