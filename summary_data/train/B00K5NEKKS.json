These are plant based so my expectation is I will not have any adverse side effects and my bones will thank me for giving them the boost they need.",

When talking about bone loss, the increased risk of osteoporosis should be of major concern. Some of the statistics should bring this home: Osteoporosis leads to 1.5 million fractures per year - mostly hip, spine and wrist (National Institutes of Health); Osteoporosis afflicts 52 million Americans (National Osteoporosis Foundation); One in two women past the age of 50 will break a bone due to osteoporosis (National Osteoporosis Foundation); By the year 2020, half of all Americans over age 50 are expected to have low bone density or osteoporosis (National Osteoporosis Foundation). Over the years, clinical studies have underscored the importance of calcium and bone health, including a New England Journal of Medicine study showing that taking calcium and vitamin D supplements tends to improve bone density and maintain strong bones and teeth.\n\nWHAT CAN YOU DO?\nThere are several things you can do to fight bone loss. 1. East more calcium-rich foods. 2. Exercise more. 3. Supplement your diet with a quality food-based calcium formula. That's why we created mykind Organics Organic Plant Calcium.\n\n\nMYKIND ORGANICS ORGANIC PLANT CALCIUM AT A GLANCE\n * Certified USDA Organic & Non-GMO Project Verified Calcium from Plants - Not Crushed Rock \n * Certified Vegan, Gluten Free and NO Synthetic Binders or Fillers \n * Certified Vegan Vitamin D3 from Lichen and Vitamin K2 MK-7 to Promote Proper Absorption \n * 800mg Calcium: Plant-based Calcium from Organic Algae \n * Small, Easy-to-Digest, Easy-to-Swallow Tablets",
