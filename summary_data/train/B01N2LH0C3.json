The fabric is textured and the overall cushioning is firm. Some may find that sitting in it for a long period of time gets uncomfortable. I bought an ottoman to go with it, so it works out great. Assembly doesn't take long, but you MUST pay attention to which leg goes on which corner. The legs are angled, so if you put them in the wrong place, the holes will not line up.",

Late tonight I went back and chair is now only $30 more. What the heck Amazon! This was very frustrating- I had to return the chair",

The fabric looks robust and the legs look great too.",
