The phone case is thick, but I quickly got accustomed to the size. The covering scratches a bit easily, but I\u2019ve dropped my phone many times and my phone still hasn\u2019t cracked so I\u2019m very happy.

First, the New Trent case is dual-sided, so it wraps the entire phone, leaving nothing vulnerable. This Spigen case only covers the back, so if you drop it face down (even with a screen protector), the chances that it will crack or shatter the screen is still higher. While I love the convenience of the card holder and the pink cover, I'm perfectly willing to sacrifice aesthetics for practicality. So, to people looking for a phone case that is durable and reliable, I recommend New Trent's!",

I always have my phone on me and having this case eliminates the need for carrying my wallet/ purse around. The case has held up well. I actually bought another one because the first one I bought is a bit worn on the back at this point (over a year of use) However it still functions properly. The back slides out easily and secures back in place nicely. The case is not bulky at all. And I think the price is very reasonable. I highly recommend this phone case.",

To my dismay, I was unable to fix it. I found that there were cracks in the case side as well. This is totally unacceptable for an item marketed as a protective case. It is USELESS as protection for a phone. Feels like I just wasted my money!!",

That didn\u2019t happen. It\u2019s nice looking, (I got the rose gold), and seems sturdy. I\u2019ve already used the cover to hold my license, a credit card, and some cash, and it works great. Mind you, this is definitely not a replacement for your wallet, as it would not hold more than what I listed, but it is a very convenient feature., and at a great price. It also holds the phone securely. Would buy again.",
