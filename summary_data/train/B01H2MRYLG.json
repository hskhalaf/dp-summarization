It performed admirably in a variety of training activities. However, not all purchasers were satisfied with the product. The lack of upper support and the unusual tongue design put off some of them. But the overall feedback on the shoe was more on the positive side.",
      "pros": [
        "A significant number of athletes stated that the Asics Gel Fit Yui was competent during HIIT, circuit training, plyometrics, Zumba, and Jazzercise sessions",
        "The comfort provided by the trainer was immensely lauded by people who spent long hours standing",
        "It also pleased many training enthusiasts with its lightweight and breathable nature",
        "Several wearers welcomed the padding around the ankles",
        "A user mentioned that the outsole handled the twists and turns of dance-based workouts very well",
        "Another reviewer appreciated the fact that the trainer was easy to put on and take off"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "There were complaints about the tongue, which appeared to be too small that it left gaps on the sides",
        "The mesh upper failed to provide sufficient support for several users",
        "it was apparently too stretchy",
        "A handful of reviewers warned that the orange color in the picture turned out to be bright pink or red on the actual shoe",

One thing I wish I would have realized was that the sides do not give lots of support, I use them for jazzercise and wish I had more side support. Aldo, I didn't even pay attention to this so I can maybe help someone else. The lace holes are actually elastic, so I'm curious to see just how long they last. Others say they are more pink than the color shown, I would have to agree. Overall I really like this shoe, just some things I wish I would have realized. Also, the company I used was great.",

This is my first time buying Asics so no review points off for the sizing since it's not their fault. Giving 4 stars instead of 5 because the color of the peach-looking shoe I ordered is much different in person. It's definitely hot pink. The image here is drastically less saturated, making the overall coloring misleading. I'm going to keep/exchange the shoes because they feel great and the color is not a deal breaker. Regardless, the seller should have an accurate photo posted.",

The fit is closer to a normal tennis shoe than my fit for a running shoe (which I size up to account for swelling). Some people commented on the length of the laces but I haven't had an issue; I tie a double knot and everything fits just fine. I would recommend these to a friend looking for shoes to lift in.",

      "text": "Liteweight material, however poorly constructed. There was still a gap between the tongue and sides of the shoe when I laced it up tightly. Provides very little support as the material of the shoe is very soft. Also, looks kind of cheap for the price that you are paying...might as well spend a few more bucks for Nike trainers. I'll be returning these.",
