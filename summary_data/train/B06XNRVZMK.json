I have always used string trimmers to edge and for that purpose it is just about useless. The tiny guard above the spool barely does its job then trimming and allows debris to go just about anywhere. Edging is all but impossible because the handle does not rotate and upside down, the guard becomes even more of a no-show. If I don't maintain an exact cutting angle, I get peppered with debris. While I'm sure that's entertaining to a watch, for serious work this turns out to be a pretty useless machine.",
