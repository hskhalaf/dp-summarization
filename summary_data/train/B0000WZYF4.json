I finished putting it together and wondered why it would not open/close too well. I noticed a rivet missing and found it in the box. It's not that I can't fix it but for this price ehhh it should be a quality product. Doesn't secure well and water will get in. Just got this thing like 2 hours ago. Already requested a refund. First and final Thule product. In the pictures I have the side with the rivet missing and the other with them secured.",

I got the advice (perhaps here on Amazon) to keep heavy items in it to help keep it stable on top of my car, and that seems to have worked well. I'm so glad I bought it and will use it for many years to come. AND I feel cool with it on my car!",

The other less expensive one on Amazon is probably a better choice and it has decent reviews. If I didn't have a Thule roof rack and this wasn't an open box deal, I wouldn't have brought it. The other ones on here could fit the Thule roof rack, but it's like buying all the same appliances in your kitchen to match, even though it's not necessary.

Also, the 2 large screws did not fit into the plastic supports, so I had to buy 2 screws at the local chain hardware store. It wasn't easy finding a suitable substitute. Now, I like the finished product. I think that the company should proof their kit better; you have to assemble the whole thing yourself.",

Compatible with all Thule rack systems, as well as round bar and most factory racks, they allow you to get your gear out of your car and onto the top of your roof - saving precious interior space, keeping moisture out of your vehicle when hauling snowsport or watersport gear and securing items that would otherwise roll around during transit.

This nearly tool-free mounting system allows you to attach your rooftop box to virtually any roof rack in minutes. Each corner of the Sidekick has a series of four pre-bored holes aligned along the length of the box. Included U-Bolt hardware is slid up from the bottom, across the crossbars of your rack and into two of these four holes. Once through, the hardware attaches to one of the four supplied knobs. Simply twist the threaded knob to get a secure hold that you can count on, and easily remove as you please. Also included as part of this system are all the hardware needed. Because of the pre-bored holes, the Sidekick requires a minimum spacing of rack crossbars of 23\u215d\", and a maximum spacing of 32 1/16\". \n\nSIMPLE USE, STOWAGE AND SECURITY\n Once Thule's Sidekick Rooftop Cargo Box is installed it is extremely easy to use.

No warranty is given for defects caused by normal wear and tear, cosmetic rust, scratches, accidents, unlawful vehicle operation, or modification of, or any types of repair of a load carrier system other than those authorized by Thule. \n\nABOUT THULE\n Thule was founded in 1942 by the Thulin family, when Eric Thulen, a true lover of the outdoors, put the Thule name on a pike trap he designed and began to sell in Scandinavia. It wasn't long before he added other practical items to the company's portfolio. By the 1960s, the company began to concentrate on car-related products, including its first roof rack. The Thulin family sold Thule to the publicly listed company Eldon in 1979, and it has continued to grow both organically and through acquisitions ever since. The Thule Group is a world leader in providing transport solutions for an active life.",
