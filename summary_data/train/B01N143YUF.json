Pool seems very sturdy, for the price it should come with a ladder, as it is I had to buy one. Adults can get in and out okay but kids have to be hoisted. Pump is okay so far,had minor leak that I fixed with some rubber bands and tightening the screws. No major swimming as it is small but overall we love it. Perfect for toddlers and older kids too.",

Total investment with pool upgraded pump and vacuum about 1k. Worth it to keep the kids busy all day lol!",
