It offers many of Altra\u2019s renowned technologies like the ZeroDrop and the FootShape technologies. With the 6th instalment of the Instinct, runners can get a shoe that has ample protection for many miles on the road, intense workouts in the gym, and easy recovery sessions. It is a versatile workhorse that can take on different tasks, especially for those who are working around a budget.",

      "text": "This is a great shoe for people who want a more natural fit. By that I mean, heel on par with the toe (no heel raise) - just like natural walking or running. Or... I mean a wider toe box than heel. Nearly all running shoes have a wider heel than toe area - yet naturally we've evolved to spread out our toes for balance. There's a little bit of cushioning; so not like the \"barefoot\" shoes out there - a tribute to the fact that nearly all of us are used to wearing cushioned shoes when running. I highly recommend if you're looking for that \"natural fit\"",

If you do commit to these style of shoes, be prepared to toss every other shoe you have since they will feel so much more narrow. Hope these last.",

Used it as a walking shoe while at Disney world and my feet felt great. I love this version so much I bought the blue and black color schemes as well so I can have a rotation.

The only reason it is not 5 stars is that parts of the tread began to fall off around 45 miles in. My experience with Altra shoes is generally 200-250 miles before signs of wear. These started\u200b prematurely. I'm not saying don't buy, just be aware that Altra uses very soft rubber and it can break down quicker than average shoes.",

      "text": "They have just arrived and I put them on. First impressions, before use. I've bought them half size up from my usual 10 and didn't regret. Spot on. Toe box is nice and wide. The best part of the shoe is the sole. It's got rubber layer and seems to be well designed, great cushioning. Disappointed with the rest of the shoe. Cheap materials all over, bad workmanship, too short laces that I had to replace immediately as they could hardly be tied together. Once I put my new laces on, that was the best quality material you could find on the shoe. Cheat, cheap, cheap.",

However, I hold this against it: I've only gone 45k in them in 2 weeks over 6 runs and the sole looks like it's several months old. I'm nervous about how long it will last, although the build quality appears much improved over the 3.0. The sole is wearing out way too quickly. I just bought these shoes!!!",
