I do not recommend to use as a daily outdoor kennel while away due to not anchoring down. Such a great product!",

As to the height, be aware that the metal is only 40\" high, so you're not going to walk in it, but is lightweight enough to pick up one side and move it to clean up the area underneath. The sun cover adds to its strength and shields the sun nicely.",
