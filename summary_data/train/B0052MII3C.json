The DeWalt website states and shows a hard kitbox not a bag. Everywhere I look online it shows the hard case. So it appears the same model number comes different ways. I contacted DeWalt and complained. They are sending me a hard case for free. Maybe Black and Decker can add some info as to why the different cases. I do like the drill. Maybe they should have a different model number for the different cases.",

It came with a battery, charger, storage bag all for a price less than the same item at Lowes that did NOT include the bag, battery or charger---it was the unit only.",

Additionally, they do not accept regular drill bits - only hex bits. Since I purchased this drill a few months ago, I have used it on several screwing/drilling projects around my home where a standard drill will not fit. I am sure that it has its limitations, but it has performed well (good control and plenty of power) and has been a pleasure to use. I definitely recommend this tool for your home workshop. I wish I had one years ago.",

It had trouble driving screws into wood where my regular battery drill (Hitachi 18 Volt) had no problems. This drill would simply stop turning due to lack of torque. It would not drill through more than one stud without removing the wood chips, where my Hitachi had no problem. I'll keep this drill for the special uses, but not try to use it for anything else.",
