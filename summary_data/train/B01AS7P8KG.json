(Not to mention the price would have to be around $45 to be Ti.) But as I said above, these do work and they seem to be a non-branded version identical to the popular Madison Supply ones, at half the cost. But the marketing lie still bothers me...",

This makes the lower blade very thick, which will make it difficult to get under bandages. So I sent it back and quickly received a replacement. It had the exact same defect. Sending this one back for a refund. Too bad. Other than that it was just what I wanted.",

Titanium is not magnetic. Only ferrous (iron-based) metals are magnetic. I've had them for three years and there is no indication of rust, so they are probably some form of stainless steel. However, because the seller(s) / manufacturer are lying about them being titanium, it's hard to tell what kind of. If they are stainless they are probably a 304 SS, which is decent. 316 is much better, but is also non-magnetic secondary to how the atoms are arranged. So, they aren't \"the best\" of steel if they are steel at all.",
