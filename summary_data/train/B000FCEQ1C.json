So when I opened this I was so happy to see that it was actually in great condition and very sturdy for such a cheap product price wise. I am very happy with this purchase and im happy i took the chance on this product.",

I've had it up for about a week with 3 boys that use that bathroom, and so far it's still on the wall without any problems.",

However, I have found you can find these at local home improvement stores in the $6-$8 range.
