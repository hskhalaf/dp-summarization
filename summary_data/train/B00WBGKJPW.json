I'll pay the extra fifty cents to get a brand that doesn't feel the need to bash an entire demographic as unworthy of consuming their products.",

My other half likes Angel Hair pasta specifically for the thinness and is not overly fond of linguine because it is thicker. This \"Fini\" pasta fit perfect into her taste as well as mine. We have made this pasta al dente as well as softer. With either you still get the texture of a linguine plus almost any variety of sacue/gravy will adhere very well. If you love pasta you will not be disappointed in either the flavor or the value. Yes, I highly recommend.",

The pastas are reasonably priced and the quality is great - it's a staple I'll continue keeping in my pantry.",

The thickness of the THIN SPAGHETTI is just right for my family. We love this product. It cooks in 5 minutes, and is just right. Today I discovered that the outer box was water damaged. So I changed my overall rating from 5 to 2 due to the water damaged that probably occurred in shipping.",
