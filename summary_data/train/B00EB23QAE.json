While I had to push harder on the drill than the impact driver, it was much faster. I started using it on drywall screws with a drywall bit. While annoyingly loud, it does this job well.",

    "title": "Milwaukee 2462-20 M12 1/4 Inch Hex Shank 12 Volt Lithium Ion Cordless 2,500 RPM 1,000 Inch Pounds Impact Driver w/ LED Light and Fuel Gauge (Battery Not Included, Power Tool Only)",
    "description": "Color:Original VersionImpact drivers are ideal for driving large fasteners like lag bolts through porches and other thick materials. With the Milwaukee M12 Impact Driver, you\u2019ll be getting top-of-the-line performance in a compact package. You\u2019ll be able to drive what you need while maintaining control with the greatest amount of comfort. Its rubber-molded pistol grip increases friction between the tool and your hand, enabling optimal handling in slippery conditions. Beyond the comfort, there are tons of features packed in here that make it a step above the competition. Most powerful of all is the unit\u2019s motor. It can drive fasteners with up to 1,000 inch pounds of torque at 2,500 revolutions per minute. With such a lightweight unit, this is tremendous power. There are also internal electronics that allow cross-communication between the tool and whichever M12 Redlithium battery is powering it. This allows the tool to monitor itself for overheating, and it powers down before it can be damaged, a feature unheard of in other 12 volt impact drivers. Beyond that, you get LED lighting on the front to brighten your workspace, and an LED fuel gauge on the side to let you know how much work you can do on your charge. Wherever you work, with Milwaukee by your side, you\u2019ll be getting the job done properly.",

      "LED LIGHTING: Keep your work subject illuminated with the trigger-activated LED light panel located above and in front of the trigger. Its location prevents any shadows from being cast by your trigger finger",
      "ONBOARD FUEL GAUGE: LED lights on the side of the impact driver let you know, in increments of 25%, how much battery you have left",
      "AMBIDEXTROUS BELT CLIP: Whether you\u2019re right or left-handed, you can keep the included belt clip attached on the side of the driver that is most convenient for you",
      "REDLITHIUM TECHNOLOGY: This driver has internal computer technology that communicates with RedLithium batteries powering it. It enables cross-communication between the two systems, keeping the tool\u2019s motor from overheating or drawing more power than it can handle",
