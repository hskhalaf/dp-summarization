First off the Mimikyu card has the same art as the Guardians Rising card, but with a different holo pattern and promo numbering and the pin is absolutely adorable! Thinking about getting a second box just so my wife can have one too. As for the booster packs, I ended up with a reverse Holo rare, a GX Ultra Rare and a Secret Rare! Definitely the best collection box I have opened yet!",

He doesn\u2019t collect the boxes and was pretty happy to receive them. The HP is pretty low on all of these, and he has a lot of Poke\u0301mon cards to begin with (including legendary, GX, etc.)...but he didn\u2019t have any of these. Out of all 3 booster packs, he only ended up getting one duplicate. The two stars is because of the damaged item.",

I especially like that the image used for the pin isn't the same as the one used on the box (but you can see that in the product photo).",
