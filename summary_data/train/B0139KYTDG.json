It's well built, it looks awesome, rides smooth, shifts smooth, has quality components, the seat is comfortable, and the seat, and front and back wheels are quick release! The tires are a cross between mountain bike tires and road tires so they are very versatile. Very nice bike and I am so happy with my purchase. I highly recommend this bike to anyone. Oh, also, you sit more upright which is not hard on the back at all, and the grips are nice and cushy on your hands.",

We bought the men's version last year (seen in photo) and have been very pleased with the quality and performance. The seat and handlebars adjust so you can get the right fit for about anyone. We live where we can ride down state park trails and I have not had any trouble going down the dirt and gravel paths. Shifting is smooth (as long as you shift before putting any weight into it), and assembly was done in under 30 minutes.",
