My father was impressed by it and said he wants a wet shaving set like this. It feels very sturdy and heavy, and gives off an expensive and classy feel. For the price, this can't be beat. If you're looking for a starter wet shave kit, this is the way to go. One thing though, the boar brush gives off this very odd and unpleasant smell when shaving. This is my first wet shave kit so I'm not sure if every boar brush gives off this smell. But that's not keeping me from loving it.",
