I can 100% see this protecting my device from scratches. I had the 3rd series and it got so scratched I wanted to try this out to protect my 4. It fits perfectly. I recommend it. I was very iffy because it had no reviews but it looked and sounded more official then the other screen protectors claiming the 3 and 4 are the same size and using old products. I can see this is made for the series 4 edge to edge",

THE TRICK IS: after you removed all moisture and have aligned the film properly, put the watch (remove the band first) inside one palm right in the middle and cover with other palm and press and hold it down for at least 10 min. it is shown on the instructional video but they didn't emphasize on the importance of this past stage - it will allow all the edge glue perfectly around the curved edges of the screen. hope you find it helpful. good luck!",

I installed it on two separate occasions and had no air bubbles. Another issue I had was that if I put a case on the watch, it causes the protector to shift therefore causing some bubbles on the side.

I can't keep going thru \"free\" replacements that cost $10 for shipping or replacement at a local kiosk, so now I have 5 backups thanks to the armor suit that comes with 6 protectors. I think these are better suited as they will keep scratches from happening without cracking like glass. Time will tell but I'm happy so far.",

I have scuffed it several times (better than scuffing the actual watch face), and the scuffs clean off very easily with soap and water. (The others I have tried would not clean up, so you have to live with the scuff or constantly replace them). Very clear to the point that I cannot tell that my watch has a cover. Easy to install.",

This product, the ArmorSuit MilitaryShield Screen Protector, along with a clear case that protects the asides of the watch and is open on the face. Does the job well. In addition the screen protector is very easy to apply with good instructions. I also feel the 6 pack is a very good value.",
