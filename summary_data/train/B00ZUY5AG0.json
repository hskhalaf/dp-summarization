However, its imprecise fit did not appease the others. All in all, the Vasque Inhaler II GTX is an averagely priced light hiker that has qualities to look out for. Those with a wider foot, however, must look somewhere else.",
      "pros": [
        "Based on a handful of expert reviews, the Vasque Inhaler II GTX was indeed a lightweight hiking boot",

        "Some users acknowledged how the Inhaler II GTX kept their foot dry after wet encounters",

The 7.5 is so short, I feel my toes touching the front of the shoe. I can only imagine how small the shoes would feel during or after a hike. Unfortunately, the next size up is about twice as expensive as the size I bought, and outside my price range. I imagine these would make a solid hiking tool for someone who could find the correct size in a suitable price.",
