It is not meant to do a full house dusting, it is to quickly blow the dust off of your screens, electronics, maybe a ceiling fan. (extra bonus, blow bugs away). If the product is not used correctly that is the users fault.",

Good volume of air so it cleaned out dust quickly. We just made sure to not spin any fans. This will make future cleaning MUCH easier and faster.",

We don't have as need for all of the attachments most of the time, but they are great to have on hand for certain things.",
