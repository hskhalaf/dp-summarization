My brother in law raved about his Grizzly so I bought mine. What a good investment. I was a little concerned it only had two knives instead of three but soon found out that was not a problem at all. This machine does the job without even hesitating. It quickly has become my favorite shop tool.",

The only thing that can be done to improve it would be to have some kind of dust collection attachment. I usually have a box setup at the outfeed end and it catches about 90% of the chips coming out but it would be nice not to have to worry about it. I have many grizzly machines around my shop and I have been extremely happy with every one of them. I used their customer service twice (for other machines) and they have gone beyond my expectations both times.",

I opted for the matching stand which it fits perfectly upon. The blades/knifes are a solid 1/8\". It fired up and took a odd 2x12 and after a dozen passes, had a perfect 5/4 stock piece!

It turns out that the Craftsman model that I was replacing, though not a rugged, was much smoother running and produced a nicer finish. I was very disappointed in the Grizzly, I just couldn't believe that it would have such a cheap universal motor on such a well built piece of equipment.",
