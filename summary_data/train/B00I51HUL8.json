Will be keeping. These are pretty good headphones for just production, I can tell cause every song (without vocals) sounds beautiful, But with vocals is a whole other story! For some reason the vocals always sound muddy in these headphones. No matter what type of song the vocals feel underwhelming and hurts my ears.",

However, that sole commentary found them lacking in presence, to which I would add they exhibit no semblance of life or sparkle whatsoever. In fact, Sennheiser's calling these \"flat\" is in fact an understatement; harmonics easily heard using other equipment are swallowed whole down a long tunnel. Two pieces of good news, however: Amazon's return policy; and I've now got a whole new degree of appreciation for my B&W P5's. I gave the HD6 MIX two stars only because my sample might simply be flawed--given the price, I certainly hope so. PS--Sadly, my Etymotics leave Sennheiser as much in the dust as the B&W's.",
