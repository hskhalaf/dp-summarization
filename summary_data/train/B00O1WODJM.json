We haven't run them hard enough to tell the difference. I like the smaller form factor than the higher voltage models. I like the feel of the Hitachi much more than other 12V models I've looked at. I've had good luck with a charge lasting a reasonable time. And it has plenty of power for around the house projects. I also use mine extensively in my woodworking hobby. Overall this is great tool for around the house.",

The batteries have also kept up, and still hold a charge for several hours of assembly (I assemble grills & furniture for a living). My only caveat is that the black rubber trim along the handle has been (for some time now) coming loose, and the stretching and deforming makes it hard to re-attach with adhesive. Kind of annoying, but - other than that - a pretty decent screwgun for the price.",
