When my 98 year old aunt said she hand washes dishes so that the warm water will soothe her aching hands, I knew this was the gift for her. She usually gets angry at gifts I send. A gift card is the worst offender. But these gloves, she adores. The Arthritis Association endorses these. The combination of compression and warmth makes all the difference in pain levels with no side effects. The open fingers allow for sensing, picking up, and holding items skillfully while the hands are warmed and soothed. I am a retired RN [and therapist] and strongly endorse these. My auntie likes them. Case closed.",

      "text": "Ever since the beginning of 2016, I suddenly had a pain in my fingers. It would start the moment I woke up, and got so bad that it would take me 5-10 minutes just to be able to flex my fingers. If I didn't use/flex my fingers after a while, it would again stiffen up. After using these gloves, I immediately felt some relief. It's been only a few days, but while I still have some joint/bone pain, my muscle stiffness has been greatly relieved and I have regained flexibility in my fingers. One thing that I never realized before using the gloves was how swollen my fingers were. Once using the gloves, my fingers were noticeably thinner.",

They work very well, they protect the neuropathy from touching anything. Also they are not too hot and the grip in them is nice and firm but not too tight. The only complaint I have is for some reason the ring finger and the thumb are cut a lot shorter and therefore do not protect those areas.",

I've tried less expensive ones that look similar, but they just don't work as well. I keep rubber gloves handy to slip on if I'm working in the kitchen so I don't have to remove them. When they need washing I just toss them in with a load of clothes. Love these gloves!",
