I was a bit concerned about the 5400rpm 1TB drive, but the Optane totally takes care of the data transfer lag! Add in a heat flush button, awesome styling, and perfectly placed buttons and this thing rocks. I can play every game I've wanted to and almost all of them on full settings. It's light and durable and has enough inputs to go with anything. Best laptop I've had in a decade!",

The computer is lightning fast with the 8th gen 15 (runs faster that a 7th gen i7) and after getting all the updated completed, this thing runs super smooth. This is definitely a great budget gaming laptop and amazing workstation laptop for those of you that want the best of both worlds. Strongly recommend the 8th gen i5 version of this computer!

This computer she loves, she can play her games, have a ton of tabs open and running on her browser and many other things going at the same time without slowing down it at all. It boots up extremely fast which suits her needs perfectly. only drawback is the lack of a disc drive but luckily we had portable drive we can use to install with when needed.",

I would definitely recommend this laptop as a cheap but high quality gaming laptop!",

It gets as warm as you would expect but is by no means uncomfortable to use. The screen tilts back far enough to sit on my couch or bed and the viewing angles are pretty decent.
