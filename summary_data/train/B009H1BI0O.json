      "text": "Internet stops working if you ever reset it unless you repurchase widows 10. The battery is inaccurate. It can't even connect to the keyboard it comes with. The virtual keyboard has issues. I could go on and on about all the problems it's no wonder they don't let you return it! It's seriously not even worth the plastic it's made out of. I took a knee to this abomination and put it in the trash where it belongs. The only regret I have is ever purchasing it in the first place and if I got my hands on another one I'd break it as well. Please don't purchase this tablet unless you really want someone to suffer from it.",

It really hums along with the i5, and can do any task you throw at it. This is in another league from the Rt tablet I own, which itself trumps the IOS and Andriod tablets. If you are thinking about the W700...get it!",
