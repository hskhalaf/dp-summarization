This also makes it look like you can put the labels on the front of the pockets but they are thinner and rounded so they just pop right off. I can bend them around it but it's not nearly as pretty and they pop off. So you have to put them on the bottom of the shelf at the front - which works as long but again - isn't as pretty as the one in the picture. So it's worth it over wood, but its a really tight fit and not exactly as pictured.",
