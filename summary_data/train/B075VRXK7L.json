      "text": "This is a Qi-qualified normal speed charger that can handle two phones. Since several people have asked, it does not charge the Apple Watch; the charging coils are too large. When it is plugged in, it illuminates two bright blue LEDs, so bright that tape alone didn't block them and I had to attach pieces of black plastic. It reliably charges my family's iPhones (8, 8+, and X), although the smaller phones sometimes have trouble aligning to the large coils. The advantage of safely charging two phones at once outweighs all the disadvantages, in my opinion.",

So we decided to test it out, which is what the picture is that I've posted. As you can see, the pad doesn't charge very well. We've had it plugged into the wall socket just so you know.",

Charging works great, even with my leather Apple cases on, or my husbands generic rubber/plastic case. If you have a magnetic phone holder (in your car), the metal piece that attaches on or under your case will now allow you to charge wirelessly (as expected). But I don't remind taking it on and off. The charging station itself is really light, I just wish the power cord to the wall was longer, kind of limits where I can put it.",
