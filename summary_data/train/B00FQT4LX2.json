After putting two bags into trash cans in my kitchen (hidden behind cupboard doors no less) the entire house smells of sickly sweet febreeze. It's practically comic how over-the-top the chemical treatment is here. Yuck. I seriously have come back to amazon today to buy new trash bags into which to throw these awful, awful trash bags. Cripes, just smelling my hands 20 minutes after putting the bags in, and the smell is so powerful. Perhaps this is a manufacturing error...???!!!?! YUCK!",

I'm actually disappointed that it isn't a strong headache smell like people claim lol. It doesn't mask the whole smell of the trash can because afterall it's trash but it sure does do more than a regular unscented bag. I'd say by 75%. Good enough for me!",

The first version of this we purchased held up very well, we could place the bag in our basic standing trash can with a tight seal, and it would not break a seam. However, this most recent purchase has resulted in about a 1-in-4 failure rate when placing the bag in the receptacle. Only the top-most portion of the seam beaks, and not the entire length of the bag, so we still use them. It's just a little sad to see the tie-string portion of this bag to have gone down in strength.",

      "text": "May I never, ever, ever buy this again. Disgusting, very strong, very persistent, overwhelmingly fake chemical floral odor, hangs throughout the room and house after opening a bag. Also tends to rip easily around the drawstring tie band when you try to snug the bag up to close the bag. I bought for the good price and odor shield sounded good, but I will likely throw away before I\u2019ve even used a third of the box, nullifying any economic advantage.",
