My husband is 6'4\" and was able to get full view by tilting back a little. Much better than my fun house wall mirror. It took 5 minutes to assemble. Is very sturdy, yet not too heavy, so it can be easily moved. Checked thoroughly and no cracks, nicks, or warps. Beautiful accent piece. Design and color go perfect with my bedroom furniture. Dark cherry finish looks exactly like photo. This is a great value for such a nice piece. Worth every penny. Now I can leave the house with confidence of knowing how I actually look.",

Ours has survived a few moves and a couple of years now. Mirror dimensions are accurate as advertised, but just keep in mind that after setting it up it does seem a little short.
