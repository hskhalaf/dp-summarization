      "text": "LaCie is the premium brand of Seagate. It is a very stylish and elegant portable drive that works perfectly. It is one of the very few drives that has a USB-C connector on the drive itself. It works perfectly to perform Time Machine backups on a 2018 MacBook Pro. The unit comes with two cables, USB-C on both ends, and USB-C to USB for compatibility with older devices. Speed of operation is very fast. The LaCie 1TB external drive is Highly Recommended.",

      "text": "I purchased this a little over a year ago for my new MacBook pro. I've had two main issues. 1. The cord would come loose all the time. If I shifted my computer even a bit, the disk would eject. 2. The disk doesn't work at all now. My computer recognizes that it is there but it won't mount which means everything that is there can't be used. I've troubleshooted everything LaCie has told me to do plus other solutions but none of it is working. The last hard drive I used for my old computer is still working 5 years later. I would not suggest this hard drive to anyone.",
