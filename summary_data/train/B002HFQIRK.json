Seven years later, in 1891, Karl supplied the Swiss Army with its standard issue Soldier\u2019s Knife. After the death of his mother in 1909, Karl Elsener introduced the brand name Victoria and the iconic Cross and Shield emblem is registered as a trademark. With the advent of stainless steel, Karl Elsener coined the company\u2019s name, Victorinox, by combining his mother\u2019s name with \u201cinox\u201d, an abbreviation of the French word for rust-resistant steel, \u201cinoxydable\u201d. After World War II, the \u201cOriginal Swiss Army Knife\u201d began its successful progression around the world and enjoyed exceptional popularity. In 1989, Victorinox entered the timepiece business in the United States under the brand name \u201cSwiss Army\u201d. Ten years later, Victorinox joined the Travel Gear market, partnering with TRG Group in St. Louis. And in 2001, Victorinox fashion was introduced in the US to further capture the brand\u2019s essence of practical luxury. In 2002, in order to promote global unity, the Victorinox Swiss Army timepiece brand was launched internationally. In 2007, Victorinox set up Victorinox Swiss Army Fragrance AG, and in 2009 Victorinox Swiss Unlimited was launched. 2014 marks Victorinox Swiss Army\u2019s 130th anniversary, and each Victorinox Swiss Army product embodies the spirit of the Legendary Original Swiss Army Knife, a universal symbol of Functionality, Innovation, Quality and Iconic Design.\n\nBrand Values\n\nFUNCTIONALITY\n\nOur Victorinox Swiss Army timepieces are designed to optimize their usefulness. Functionality ranges from easy-to-read dial designs to sophisticated professional functions. Every design detail is purpose-based. Functions are never add-ons or embellishments. The goal is to create watches that are timeless.\n\nINNOVATION\n\nVictorinox Swiss Army constantly enhances its timepiece lines with new design elements and innovative functions while seeking creative ways of upgrading existing components to enhance their capabilities.\n\nQUALITY\n\nVictorinox Swiss Army timepieces are designed and manufactured with the same rigorous attention to quality as the brand\u2019s legendary Pocket Tools. They also meet the highest standards of the Swiss watchmaking industry. The quality controls and testing that every timepiece undergoes (material, movement, assembly, finishing, etc.) allow Victorinox Swiss Army to offer a three-year limited warranty.\n\nICONIC DESIGN\n\nThe Original Swiss Army Knife is one of the world\u2019s most functional pieces of design. Victorinox Swiss Army timepieces share this icon\u2019s spirit and heritage. They are multifunctional precision instruments engineered to last, yet also timeless and contemporary in design.\n\n\n\nSee more \n\n\nPRODUCT DETAILS\n * Is Discontinued By Manufacturer :No\n * Product Dimensions :5.91 x 5.91 x 5.91 inches; 1 Pounds\n * Item model number :241348\n * Department :Womens\n * Date First Available :March 22, 2004\n * Manufacturer :Victorinox Swiss Army\n * ASIN :B002HFQIRK\n\n * .zg_hrsr_item {list-style : none};\n * Amazon Best Sellers Rank: #2,600,496 in Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry (See Top 100 in Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry)  *  #1206060 inWomen's Shops \n    *  #15955 inWomen's Wrist Watches \n   \n   \n\n * Customer Reviews:4.4 out of 5 stars22 ratings Stainless steel case with a stainless steel bracelet.
