She has certain toys though that she loves chewing to calm down before falling asleep, but often have to be replaced because she goes through them at a decent pace.

      "text": "My 70 lb boxer-lab mix destroys just about anything you give him, and the powerful chewers variety of nylabones are the only things that withstand him! He loves this toy, he seems to enjoy the texture of it. It's heavy and durable and he plays with it often and it's holding up fantastic, just like his other nylabones. The only downside to these is that they become pointy and sharp after being chewed on, but that's easy to look past for the job it does occupying my pup. I'll continue to purchase these toys.",

The only con if I had to pick one is that it is a little heavy, like too heavy to throw inside.",

I am glad that we got him this and recommend it to anyone else that has a strong, aggressive, chewing dog.",
