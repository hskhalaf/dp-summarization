      "text": "I have been using the vacuum cleaner from past 4 years and it has worked great. I believe it works better on carpets than harder surface. Needs better maintenance (proper cleaning and timely change of filters) for good performance. It is a good vacuum cleaner for this price point. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is on a tighter budget. Most importantly it cleans the stuff. The only thing that it lacks is a little bit of less suction power but for me cleaning the carpets it gets the job done.",

You don't have to worry about the supply of paper bags in future, whether the size is right for your vacuum cleaner and so on. The handle at the top of the dirt container is also thoughtfully designed. One can carry the machine using this handle. Does not take up a lot of space when folded away. Overall, the machine is very handy, lightweight, very powerful.",

Instead of something I can easily take out and clean with, I thought, I would go for something that appeared more powerful. It is large with almost no suction. Bottom line: BUY SOMETHING ELSE!

The only other thing that I don't like is the filter setup. It gets clogged very quickly and decreases the suction strength of the vacuum.

      "text": "We bought this vacuum last year when we moved into our new apartment that had brand new carpeted floors. I have major dust allergies so a powerful vacuum is a must. It picks up dog hair, dust, and a whole bunch of stuff that lives rent-free in your carpet. We vacuum weekly, sometimes more, and the amount of stuff that it sucks up is amazing! Keep in mind that this is BRAND NEW carpet - we are the first to walk/live on it and sometimes we have to empty the container to continue with the rest of the house. It's gross and awesome at the same time. Highly recommend. Don't let its compact size fool you. It's a beast.",

The cord was of an adequate length and the special attachment was great for smaller jobs. It was inexpensive, so I thought I had found a great buy. It worked well for about two months and it suddenly stopped picking up anything from the floor when I vacuumed. It would have been too much trouble for me to send it back, so I just tossed it. I guess I really got what I paid for that time.",

It's not really great on pet hair on the fabric couch and it is rather bulky for getting into corners. His apartment is all hardwood and some tile - it does the trick enough where the place isn't completely grimy. If you have a home, animals, large apartment or any combination of those this is not the vacuum for you. This is a good dorm vacuum or quick picker upper for small jobs. Basically, this isn't an adult vacuum and it's not for clean freaks. It's \"good enough\" for small jobs.",

FYI- it picked up just as well as my $300 vaccum that broke after a year. I have a large home with a basement, will buy another one for the basement.",

Overall, it is worth the money but I think I would spend the extra bucks and get a better unit in the future,",
