I have been able to test most of the bulbs in my house and find out if they really have the energy savings they claim (based on amount of light output). Pretty surprising results. Most of the CFLs in my house actually were putting out less light than my LEDs (and use more electric doing so). Great to have a meter to measure them!",

I have a lot of plants indoors, such as orchids, carnivorous plants, etc. There is a large range of lux, from 100 to 10,000. This allowed me to check the lux my plants were getting and allowed me to move them accordingly. As I live in California, I do not want my plants to be burning under the intense sun. It's very intuitive and easy to store (as it comes in it's own box). Nice product and pretty cheap. Edit: This is really good for light photography as well",
