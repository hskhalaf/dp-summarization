They are warm and waterproof - IF you put tension bands around the ankles. The ankles flare out so much that water just pours right into the pants and travels right up to your butt. So that's not so fun. I wish they were tight around the ankles to prevent that happening. Otherwise they do the job without being too rigid or horrible to get in or out of, even if you are a 3X.",

I am a 156 lb female who is 5' 11\" and the XL fit me perfectly. They would be a tiny bit too big if I wanted them as scuba pants, but I am using them for kayaking so I wanted a little bit of moving space.
