For example, I can take pork ribs and after removing the silverskin, spread yellow mustard on them and then shake a mixture of these spices over each side - then onto the smoker. Haven't tried to win a competition yet with them, but I bet that I could get close. Also - take any of them to a set of pork chops on your grill just as they start to brown up and you'll have the most delicious flavor and color added to them. Yum!",

I am extremely disappointed: These are basically colored salt. The salt overpowers any of the added flavors and spices in each flavor. Campfire Smokey Sea Salt has no smoke or campfire taste. The Smoked Cherrywood has a great smokey aroma but zero flavor other than salt. I can only suggest falling back to my favorite goto spices and rubs; McCormick's Grill Mates \"Sweet & Smokey Rub\". Weber's \"Gourmet Burger\" and Weber's \"Roasted Garlic & Herb\". Happy Grilling!",
