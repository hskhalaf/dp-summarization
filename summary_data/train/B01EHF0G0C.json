I add some canola oil and rub the chain around. You'll need to find a place to keep the chain because it'll be oily and I don't clean it each time. But I find the chain easy to clean (just let it lay in the dish water for a while and rinse.) For really bad caked on layers I use \"steam\" cleaning, but that's seldom when I keep up with this tool.",

It cuts cleaning time in half, normally when cleaning Cast iron it takes a while because you have to scrub with hot water, a sponge and elbow grease, and when you think it's clean it's probably not. This chain is nice because it won't scratch or remove the seasoning on the pan which means you don't have to season it as often. 5 stars for sure!",

I then used this \"wonder product\" and was amazed these tiny little circles stripped away the grime. Truly impressive. I was not paid for my review so, order yours today and become a believer!",

I bought the largest size, smaller ones might work as well, but I like the large size for the increase in scrubbing surface. I only use oil in a cool pan and then scrub out the pain with the chainmail. Wipe the excess oil and grime out of the pan and then wash the chainmail scrubber in hot, soapy water and hang dry. The patina in my pans aren't affected and scrubbing with oil makes it that much better! I would definitely buy this if you are looking.",

It works great for all the pots and pans used for induction cooktops: cast iron, steel, and magnetic stainless steel . I don't like to use soap so what I do after using a pan is fill it up with some water, turn up the heat, and put this Chainmail Scrubber in the pan. Once the water starts to boil, use something (spatula, chopsticks) to move the scrubber around. This method gets rid of all the stuff stuck on the pan. Best of all, when the scrubber gets dirty you can throw it in the dishwasher.",

Also, it tends to transfer some uof the mess to the user's hands; problem easily solved by wearing kitchen gloves.

It's so easy to use, just drop in the bottle, maybe a little soap and water, and just gently shake and move around, it should remove all that gunk. And it has a great ring to hang up and drain. I've only had it a few days so Idk how durable it is, but if it's stainless steel, it should last. Seems pretty well made.",
