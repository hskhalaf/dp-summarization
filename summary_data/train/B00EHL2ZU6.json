Your probably saying one ounce is no big deal, but when you make a Keurig Gevalia Caramel Macchiato or Swill Miss Hot Chocolate, the water alone is 8oz. and the powder flavoring overflows the 9oz. cup. 10oz. would definitely work. Returning them tomorrow.",

I wanted something that wasn't double-walled/vacuum-insulated because feeling the temperature of the drink on the hands is part of the experience. These look premium enough that they add a hint of class to whatever you're drinking too. For the price, these are great. I will add that I only hand-wash these. I'm not sure why other reviewers' mugs break (I'm sure some shipping issues are part of it; shipping glass is always dangerous), but I always recommend washing by hand if you'd like to avoid that.",

All the tableware goes through the 'quality qualification laboratory' where all kinds of control and testing instruments designed to replicate daily use are available. Controls are also in place at each step of the manufacturing process in order to intervene on the production line, as early as possible to ensure optimum quality, purity and safety.",
