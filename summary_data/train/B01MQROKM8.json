I adapted tubes from a long gone canister vacuum, so that high, low or inaccessible places could be easily reached. The hose fitting(s) is larger in inside diameter than the usual standard vacuum cleaner hose, but, a little tape on the mating part of the accessory solves that problem easily, so, that you can use other vacuum accessories that you may have as well for even greater utillity.",
