Lots of spaces for books, lap top, etc. The North Face is a very reputable brand and I've had great experiences with other products from them. I have high hopes this bag will last awhile.",

One thing I do recommend thought, is that if your going to use this backpack for school, do not place it directly on the ground. Since it is a very sturdy backpack, a part of the bottom will rub against the floors very hard and begin the tear. This backpack has so many pockets, so it\u2019s great for storing everything you probably need. Not expensive either, but I still don\u2019t see myself buying another anytime soon because of how durable these are. Highly recommend!!",
