Nothing sticks, basic batter recipe can use some improvement, the machine does not get too hot during baking. About sticking - it only sticks when you use too little oil. If you compare the health impact of donuts baked with 3 tbsp of oil and deep fried - the choice is obvious. Good luck and happy baking time to you!",

      "text": "I read prior reviews that many did NOT like this donut maker. I was a little upset when I received it and it was a \"mini\", however, after the partial refund was offered.... I decided to keep it. The donuts from the basic donut recipe came out perfect! We made some dipped in butter and cinnamon sugar and then again the next day, with glazed. I LOVE IT! Highly recommended, I am not sure why people are saying their donuts are \"runny\". If you follow the instructions for recipes that came with it... It works great!",
