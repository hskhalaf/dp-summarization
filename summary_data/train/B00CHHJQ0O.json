The polishing cloths, air bulb thing (which is great for dedusting records), spray bottle and other sundries are absolutely essential for keeping good maintenance for your camera and other tech hobbies. I totally recommend it. I do wish the little storage bag was a little more accommodating for the air bulb. Great bargain for less than $9!",

The only issues were the the bag has a small (unnoticeable unless looking for it) tear on the side seam and the blower had a little excess plastic, but it was easily removable.",
