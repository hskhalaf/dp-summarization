It came with an off brand charger, that pushed 1 amp. Phones this new need MINIMUM 2.4 amps to obtain a good healthy charge. This phone is not factory unlocked, it has a Verizon logo clear as day. Because it is charging so slow I havent even been able to turn it on to see if it is carrier unlocked.",

I will mention I was a little annoyed when it arrived and it had Verizon branding all over it, but it is indeed unlocked and works with my TMobile SIM no problem.

I found out that it is because T-Mobile will not officially support WiFi calling or texting from devices not purchased directly from them. Yes, they released an app for blackberry devices, but it will ONLY work for blackberry devices that you bought from them. FYI. I still love the phone, but I am just not especially happy with my carrier ;)",

They brought back the trackpad with physical buttons which is a nice touch. The keys are well-sized and laid out, the display is decent at best (nothing to brag about). The camera is surprisingly sharp. The overall build quality of this device screams \"Professional\"; it feels very solid in the hand. All in all, a decent device for a decent price. My only real gripe is Blackberry OS 10, but I don't think it's fair to review this phone based on the software, since software spans across several devices.",

The only reason this device gets a 4 and not a 5 would be because of the lack of applications compared to android devices. Even with the amazon store you are still limited.

      "text": "Have been wanting to jump back into a Blackberry after leaving for an Iphone a few years back. Considered the Passport, but the size was just a tad tolarge for me. However, the classic is just right in 99% of what I was wanting to get out of a Blackberry (OS is smooth, keyboard is PERFECT, screen is crisp and clear). The only reason I give the Classic a 4.5 and not a 5 is for the App defeciency although with Snap it can be resolved. Overall very pleased and highly reccomend to anyone wanting to jump back!",
