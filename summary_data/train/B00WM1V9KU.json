I'm not even going to try that as I have no way of trusting that this won't happen again in 2 weeks. I did not heed the 1 star reviews when initially buying this product. Do not make the same mistake I made. I'm never buying Onkyo again.",

There is no lip sync setting on the receiver. Also, the Bluetooth takes forever to connect, which was one of the main reasons I bought this. When it is working, it sounds great. As expected.

      "text": "Heavy duty and nice unit, but felt like this receivers confusing menu interface was dated from early 2000's, it was extremely difficult to use (and I'm very tech savvy) I purchased this unit because I needed the dual HDMI outputs for projector and TV. I got it it work well, but it took way too long, instructions really didn't help much. The remote is like a rubix cube trying to just switch inputs was so difficult, then switching outputs was another astronaut job! I hated this, and felt the Onkyo was so primitive. It did provide good power for my Monoprice speakers, the bass was outstanding. Sounded superb.",
