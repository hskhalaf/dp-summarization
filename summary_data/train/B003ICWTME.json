It looks like they try to scrape along the seam in the factory to smooth it out but they did a pretty bad job. Returning. Disappointed.",

The structure isn't hidden beneath cloth, and the tight radius on the bottom curve means you can really get your rock on. It's easy to clean and hard to break. No flimsy dowels or Styrofoam in this one. Just one solid plastic unibody that can take some punishment. This thing is a daycare-class toy.",

Can't wait for my daughter to see it tomorrow morning under the tree!! I had this when I was a child and it is the most amazing rocking horse I ever had. It's super fun and you can go really fast too. Yes, this rocking horse can tip over but you have to be rocking like crazy to get to that point. Overall I recommend, worth the price.",

It's two plastic pieces that are melted together, but the seams are completely off alignment and it looks like someone tried to smooth it out with something sharp and damaged it while doing so. I would advise buying this in a store where you can open the box and inspect it before purchasing. Terrible craftsmanship.. so disappointed in Little Tikes.",

It's all plastic so there's nothing on it to break, which is a huge plus. Great quality and this will get plenty of use from our family.",
