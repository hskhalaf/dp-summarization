No accessories apart from a charger (note two pin \"shaver socket\" charger, not UK 3 pin mains plug) and a cleaning brush. Little disappointing that there is no indication on the shaver as to battery status so, although Braun claim it runs for 4o minutes you have no warning that power is going to go if the battery runs out. However, overall can't really complain too much.",

However one down side is that the product I received actually came with an EU plug instead of a UK one so I had to buy an adapter just so it can be used, maybe that's something I could sort out with support but other than that it's an amazing product in my experience.

Sucks that it only has a 2 pin charger so had to spend and extra \u00a35 on a converter plug, but it tells you that's what it comes with so it's your choice, it's still great for the overall cost in my opinion.",
