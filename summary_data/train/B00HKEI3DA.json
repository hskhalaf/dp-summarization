Though notably dated to 802.11ac arriving on the market, more expensive systems appear to have gone \"antenna crazy\" with MIMO; This device gets decent coverage with internal antennas. Well designed and sleek. Inclusion of two USB allows for file & print sharing. (I had a 9 year old HP usb only printer). Untested throughput on USB 3 port. As 10Ghz networks still haven't become mainstream, this product should be future proof for a couple years.",

      "text": "Purchased in July, 2015...Experienced same issue as others reported; worked for a few weeks then began to start dropping connections randomly. Drops became more consistent as time went on...from hourly down to minutes. Finally got to the point where it was unusable. Went through numerous troubleshooting steps, resets, and a firmware upgrade...nothing fixed. Submitted a case to TrendNet support to see what they can do, 3 yr warranty. Hopefully just a bad unit and they'll replace or provide a refund as I'm outside the return window with Amazon.",
