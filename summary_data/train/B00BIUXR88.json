Also, both orange and grey carabiners are identical in shape, so I don't have to worry about which one goes to the wall and which one to the rope (bent gate = rope and straight gate = wall). Only bad thing about those are, they are a bit small and are little ackward to clip in, but since I'm not a professional climber, it doesn't really matter if I have the best equipment or not. Perfectly fine quick draws for a hobbist climber",

They are a little smaller than some other draws, so if you have large hands and you're used to larger draws, you might not like these. Also, as with other wire draws, the gate can snag lightly on your rope as you're cleaning a route. If that's a big deal to you, solid gate quick draws might be a better option.",

Anyone who is looking for a great 6 PACK! it's not even 5 like some others, but a SIX PACK should totally get these!",

However, I would not now recommend them after using them for a while; out of 12 draws, the rubber grommet that holds the rope end 'biner has broken in seven of them. This is with only very light use. Once they break there is no real fix, other than to cut off the rubber and use tape to secure the biner. Serious design flaw.",
