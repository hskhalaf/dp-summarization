I get a perfect straight like that I can blend or leave alone. At such a great price, I'll definitely continue to buy it.",

Long last and quick & easy to apply for an eyeliner. doesn't smear, but i often put liquid eyeliner on top just to make sure that i will not smear.. i applied just once a day at upper at lower eyelids before going to work, and it last all day. very intense dark black, which I love ^^",
