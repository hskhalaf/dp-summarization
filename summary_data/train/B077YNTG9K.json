      "text": "Had been thinking to get a cleaning robot for a while, and I finally got this home. The major reason is the mopping function included. As a vacuum cleaner, it's incredibly quiet compare with the others which means I can use it whenever I want without bothering my neighbors. The mopping function is also great that It won't leave the floor so wet and slippery. It's simple and easy to use. You can also download an app and synchronize the robot and control it while you are not at home. The technology is really improving our days, saving me time on cleaning.",

Avoid this model, it is not worth the trouble. Get the N79 instead.",

It include 4 different cleanning modes, gives you flexibility of building your own clean type.The Mi robot can only support one. The app is straightforward, easy to use. So far I am very satisfied with it. Good product and recommend it if you need mop and clean the floor simultaneously.",

So mopping the kitchen automatically doesn't work so well... the mopping mode seems to work best when I use spot clean and baby sit the thing... its just disappointing that it can't automatically detect carpets and area rugs... seems like a flaw in the mopping algorithm to me.",
