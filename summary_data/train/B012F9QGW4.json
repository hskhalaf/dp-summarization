Plus even though it had the pre-measured option for grinding beans, it was never consistent so ultimately I gave up and measured by scoop into the coffeemaker every morning.

It has a large reservoir compartment (where beans go through the burr grinder) which closes securely. It grinds up to 12 cups at a time. Depending on the type of coffee and coarseness of the grind, some static cling can happen and can get a bit messy. However, I don't have an issue with my brand of coffee. There is hardly any mess to clean up. Every once in a while, I will brush off the accumulated fine grind from the opening from the grinder to the container. Really an excellent product, especially for its price point. Highly recommend!!!",

It states - change the grind adjustment wheel when the appliance is operating and secondly, \"0\" is for a coarse grind and \"4\" is for a fine grind. I believe this contradicts the two \"grind\" pictures that are displayed on the grinder. So, to find your ideal grind, make sure appliance is running and, use the numbers and ignore the pictures Or, if you are a picture person, make sure appliance is running and \"flip-flop\" the pictures to find your ideal grind..",

Unfortunately, it also burns the beans a bit because of the high speed blade (the groundbeans actually come out hot). I bought this to replace my broken kitchenaide burr grinder.

A few months later, I've already ordered another Baratza so that I can get rid of this one. Here's why: 1. It's MESSY. Coffee grounds everywhere. 2. Very inconsistent grind size; not good for an espresso maker. 3. It's small.",
