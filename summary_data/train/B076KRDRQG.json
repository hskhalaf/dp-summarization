The micro sd slot is harder to get to, as I have to unscrew a panel now to access it, but I solved this by using a card with more storage space.",

That said, Nintendo's whole \"screen lottery\" is unfortunate. As far as the 3D functionality goes, I guess I'm in the minority who thinks it's a useful, cool feature. To be fair, the head-tracking on the New 3DS models is what makes the difference. 3D functionality on earlier models wasn't as good.",

    "description": "Edition:SNES Classic| Configuration:without AC AdapterThe New Nintendo 3DS XL system combines next-generation portable gaming with super-stable 3D technology and added control features. Take 3D photos, connect with friends, and enhance your gaming experiences with added amiibo support. The New Nintendo 3DS XL system plays all Nintendo DS games. Nintendo DS games will not appear in 3D. AC adapter sold separately. New Nintendo 3DS XL uses the same AC adapter as the Nintendo DSi, Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo 2DS systems. 3D Mode recommended for Ages 7+ Includes download code for Super Mario Kart (Super NES). Battery endurance: The battery endurance times are estimates. They will vary depending on factors such as the software being played, the amount of data received by wireless communication, and the ambient temperature. Using the camera features may also reduce the battery endurance times shown below. The screen brightness setting affects the battery endurance time. Keeping brightness at lower settings can prolong battery life. If you tap power-saving mode ON, screen brightness and color gradation will automatically adjusted to match the displayed images, and battery consumption will be limited even further. If you put the system in Sleep Mode when not using it, you can reduce power consumption while still being able to send and receive information from StreetPass and SpotPass via the wireless communication features. If the system is fully charged and put into Sleep Mode, the system\u2019s battery endurance time in Sleep Mode is roughly 3 days. The power LED slowly brightens and darkens while the system is in Sleep Mode. NOTE: Depending on the software you are using, sometimes pushing the Sleep switch will not cause the system to enter Sleep Mode. In these cases the power LED will remain steadily lit. (For example, when listening to music with Nintendo 3DS Sound.)",
