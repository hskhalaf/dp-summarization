Using it in games like F1 2016, Dirt Rally and Project cars, creates for a very solid experience with plenty of feedback. For each game I generally have to tweak the brake pedal to reach full braking power a little earlier as it is hard to fully depress the pedal. It feels nice though, but games generally seem to expect you be able to fully depress the pedal to get 100% brake and that's pretty difficult to do. Fortunately it's pretty easy to fix in each game.",

Also, I feel like the force feedback makes the steering extremely heavy, I had to turn it down to at least 40% just to make it feel realistic.

The leather wrapped wheel feels great and the large paddle shifters are fantastic! The pedals are heavier and feel more like real car pedals than the ones I previously owned. Some users complain about the stiffness of the brake pedal, but I happen to like it. I haven't used the clutch pedal yet, as I don't own the G29 shifter.",

So what I'm left with is two completely worthless Driving Force GT wheels. This new wheel is great, but offers nothing to me that the old one doesn't. I believe this to be a scam by Logitech to sell more units, and my only way to vent is to my fellow Amazoners.",

There is one major design flaw which is the brake pedal. The spring and rubber used for the pedal's resistance is far too hard and requires too much force. This can be modified as shown on youtube but it voids your warranty. Another issue that I can't seem to solve that happens occasionally is throttle sometime cuts out when you have it all the way down. This has happened to me right before the finish line which is frustrating lol but overall I've had way more fun with this wheel than frustration. Would recommend",

      "text": "When you combine this wheel w/ a racing stand, your whole experience changes; however, on its own it's still an absolutely a fantastic buy. I've spend hours already on this, and not just w/ racing games across xbox or pc, but even my raspberry pi retro pie arcade - playing the old formula one games. This buy is an investment, but it's a fantastic investment. Metal brush, sturdy, leather - i love it - absolutely love it.",

A little bit noisy when it clips and grinds...but that can be corrected via settings and custom profiles if annoying. Force feedback is strong and works great. Build quality is there. It even has a new car smell when opening the box. Very pleased for $200.",

The response in the wheel makes it feel like you\u2019re sitting high in the cab of a Kenworth W900, or whizzing by in a formula 1 race car. It has very good, high quality leather wrapped around it which adds to realism and gives it a nice grip to hold onto. It works well with both PC and Xbox, and I advise buying the shifter with it because it works great with the shifter.",

In my opinion this steering wheel could be more expensive than thrustmaster t150 pro and it is even cheaper!",
