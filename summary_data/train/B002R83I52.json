In summary would not recommend it go for other options.",

After two more weeks the second one broke in a similar way. I sent him photographs too. So money wasted and as it was for a college association we had a lot of trouble.",

Suppose it would also work for a Shaun of the Dead costume. I don't care for all the decals, but a few minutes with a razor blade fixed that. It's not too heavy, which is good for me as I will carry it around in a golf bag with the rest of my gear. I've never had another cricket bat, so I don't know how they compare. Cons: You gotta know what a crumpet is to understand cricket.",

The bat is excellent quality and we have had so many positive comments on it and we have referred many people here to buy their own. My husband is in the US Army and alot of people that have played the game couldn't believe how good the quality was for the price. I look forward to buying another in the future for myself to learn to play against him!! Thank you for the great customer service and excellent bat!!",
