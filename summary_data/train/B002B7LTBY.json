Secondly, when I googled how to use it I found there were a lot of complaints. I was able to start pumping air into my tires but my 66 year-old arms were worn out when I finished. Presta valve leaks. I guess maybe \"just a few pumps\" works for a he-man but I was pushing really hard to inflate. Mind you, I'm a nurse who works and moves very heavy patients and equipment around so I'm not frail. Still .. I can't recommend this.",

Of course, the cap is not available for sale on the manufactures web site.

Gauge is easy to read, the needle settles quickly, and there is an indicator to make it easier to see when you have reached the desired pressure. The dual head is incredibly easy to use. It locks on quickly, doesn't leak, and you don't have to change anything to switch between Presta and Shrader valves. I highly recommend this pump.",

It's kinda big and hard to wedge into spaces like stroller tires, the locking lever is stiff and has to be moved opposite the direction of installation on the tire valve.

Usually end up wiggling the fitting or repositioning it several times before it will work right.",

Second, it is NOT a high volume pump. Prepare for a workout if you're filling up MTB or other wide tires. You'll be pumping for a while. It works okay as a pump to throw in the car to top-off your tires, but as for a main pump I still just wind up using my little air compressor at home.",

Overcoming all that, it does a great job and has a built in gauge that is easy to read and seems reliable. The valve head fits both Schrader and Presta valves without any adapters.

The last pump I had from wally world I swear I only used 5 times before the connection of the tube to the pump popped out. and the screw holding it to it stripped while trying to reattach it. Quite frustrating. But as far as this pump goes, the quality is great, worth every penny paid for it. I have used it several times, one of them to pump up an excercise ball for my wife (it comes with the attachment for such). I tell you what, using this pump was way faster than using the pump that is provided with those things.",

Also VERY good price for a quality pump.",

Gauge is easy to read & accurate to about 1-2 lbs. compared to the readout of my digital tire monitor. Shaft & base are made of metal & so far seem very durable. The air connector head can accommodate both presta & schraeder valves & even though I currently only use schraeder, I glad I have the option; also has the needle so that you can inflate your (foot/basket)-ball CON: It is a bit difficult to lock the connector head onto the valve but NOT enough to be inconvenient or make you unable to use it.
