Once the unit is turned over and before you start swinging the hammer, I would recommend placing one (1) support piece at the front (top) of the unit (use some of the Styrofoam in the packing) and two (2) more pieces where the 2 permanent shelves are installed about 1/3 and 2/3 of the way down.",

I hammered too hard (without even trying), which caused some of the dowels to pull out and one of the particle board joints to tear apart.

I don\u2019t suggest this because it puts stress on the joints between the shelf pieces and caused mine to crack making it wobbly. I pulled the shelf apart and hammered the joint deeper into the board, so it\u2019s fixed. But hindsight it shouldn\u2019t be laid on it\u2019s front at all.",

I ordered this and was amazed at how easy it was to put together. (Note: I added wood glue to the slots and along the sides that fit together to insure a good, stable assembly.) The whole thing was standing in about an hour, and the best surprise is that ALL of my old cassette collection fit inside, using all the shelves and making two parallel/horizontal rows on each shelf. For the money, could not have asked for more!",

It\u2019s pretty sturdy, had some trouble assembling at first but I got the hang of it after a bit. It\u2019s a good cheap solution for a manga shelf, but will only hold six shelves of books\u2014 which isn\u2019t that bad! I think the extra shelves are for if you wanted to use this for tiny media like CDs. Overall good buy!",

I ended up with 6 shelves.The base footprint only takes up 13\", so it fits in small spaces. I used wood glue with the wooden dowels, just to give it that little extra tightness. I also used the wall mount kit to attach it at the top to the wall. As it sits very close to my Sony big screen(65\"). I would recommend this unit to anyone looking for a nice looking DVD holder and the price can't be beat either @ only $36.68. I also had extra shelves & supports left over.",
