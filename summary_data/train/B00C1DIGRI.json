I received a new-in-the-box, unoepened, AT&T Logo-branded (on the bottom) yet fully-unclocked Blackberry Q10 Model Number SQN100-1 with Blackberry OS 10.2.1 installed. I used Blackberry Link for Windows to upgrade to the latest Blackberry 10.3 OS which includes the Amazon App store. It works great! Nice little phone, the camera is also pretty good. I also bought a little leather slide pouch for holding it in your pocket or purse. Signal / Telegram also work on this phone but require some creative installation work (downloading APK's from unsigned sources).",

I think the Classic is a good phone (the optical mouse button is too small and inset too much compared to a curve - difficult to use) and would be perfect for someone coming from a iPhone or Galaxy and going back to a keyboard. You can't really one hand a Classic but you can with a Q10, and I have large hands (i can palm a basketball). Love the Q10.",
