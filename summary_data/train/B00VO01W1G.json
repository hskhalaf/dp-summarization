      "text": "I have NEVER had such fantastic service from a company. They truly have the best warranty and they definitely stand by their word with their 100% lifetime warranty. I had purchased a pool net and at the time I thought it was a bit expensive but I decided to try it anyway. Four years later it started to come apart at the top of the net. I contacted the company, they didn\u2019t even want a picture of the net, and just sent me a brand new net. That is truly exceptional service. I will purchase from them again because the quality and replacement warranty is well worth the initial price. Thanks ProTuff!",

We get really bad monsoons where we live in AZ, and recently a particularly nasty dust storm came through and blew several of our pool items not just through our yard but into neighboring yards. Needless to say, the net survived almost totally unscathed. Which is pretty impressive, through close to 35-40 mph winds. However, it did get punctured so we decided to pursue a warranty claim which was astonishingly easy. 4 questions through facebook and now our new one is on the way. I'm so impressed. Thanks ProTuff!",

I noticed a very small tear in the bottom of my net this summer and remembered that this net had a Lifetime Warranty. I contacted ProTuff Products and the customer service was great. They promptly sent me a new net! It's rare that companies stand by their products with such a Lifetime guarantee!",
