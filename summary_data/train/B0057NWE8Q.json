Watched a few videos first to make sure I understood how to use the contraption, then practiced once on a spare tile. I'm using the cheapest white 3x6 tiles from Home Depot that cost about 15 cents each and this cut clean with a nice, satisfying snap. Not sure how it would hold up over a large flooring job but can't see why it wouldn't. It feels solid and has a nice heft to it. No problems at all and worked well.",

You need to have a little \"know how\" or skill to use tile cutters so buying a cheaply made one with lots of plastic parts which are not very stable doesn't help. I suspect you could replace the cutting wheel, but it wouldn't even be worth it since the actual unit isn't very good. For me, I got just OK cuts, broke some tiles for a small area. Don't even think of using this for big jobs, back splashes, bathrooms, floors, etc. Spend some money on a quality DIY homeowner one.",

I snapped the rest by hand and will try a different brand if another tiling job arises.",

If I press any harder I think the cutter will break. 5/16\" ceramic subway tile - it cuts it easily, but the problem is that the cut line is 1/8 off the cutter's marked center, making it very hard to cut accurately. It's useless for my project so I am sending it back.",

      "text": "This is a nice tile cutter for the price. Seems sturdy enough - I would say it was a very good value! Held the tile in place nicely for accurate scoring. But I bought some REALLY cheap tile (69-cents per square foot) and despite my best efforts with this cutter - that stupid tile wouldn't cut straight. Kept breaking along arced lines - ACK! Took the tile back to the big-box retailer I bought it from, where they cut it with their wet saw (and admitted it was awful tile). So the moral of this tale is that even a nice tile cutter like this might not work with cr@ppy tile....LOL!",
