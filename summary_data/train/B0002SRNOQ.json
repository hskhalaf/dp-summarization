Not an average job as the floor boards were in tough shape. Also had to sand a good amount of paint and wood filler. For some reason the sander ceased up after the project. Could have been the condensation build up that was not cleared out, but no real way around it unless you take the whole unit apart. Happy enough with this sander though to purchase another one for other projects. Cuts through wood filler with no issues and leaves professional like results.",
