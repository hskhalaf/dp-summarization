It was not usuable. and 2 of them had the vacuum seal broken so that they were squashed when they were plastic wrapped for shipping. At the price of each loaf of bread, I was out ALL of my money as they all had to be thrown away. Could have used them for breadcrumbs, but that's pretty pricey! Have just attempted to reorder and if they do not arrive OK (sloppy preparation for shipping), I will be cancelling my subscription.",

To two interesting concerns I don't understand: why WOULDN'T all gluten free breads be frozen anyway? To me, it's mandatory as a matter of course. And I always toast my gf bread, too, whether I'm eating it as a meal supplement or sandwiching. \ud83d\ude07\ud83c\udf37\ud83d\uddfd\ud83c\udfb5 Update: Feb.25, 2019 HOW DISAPPOINTING!!!\ud83d\ude1e The price for these has almost doubled to an unreasonable price.

      "text": "Overall, this is a great bread if you\u2019re gluten free, and have allergies to milk and egg. This is probably one of the most \u2018realistic\u2019 breads we have found. There are a couple of drawbacks. It\u2019s expensive (not just on amazon). Sometimes we\u2019ll find large holes in the loaves making many slices unusable. Sometimes, they will vacuum seal the bags so much it smooshes the loaves and that makes the whole loaf basically unusable. That\u2019s probably the most frustrating as the slices become this 2x2 inch dense piece of gross. This is still my go to option for GF bread, though.",
