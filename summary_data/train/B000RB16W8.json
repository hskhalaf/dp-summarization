I also would believe this much heat generation means it's terribly power inefficient.",

It works great and till now I've got no complains. The rpm is a bit slower than designed because in my country we have 50Hz current, but I let it roll one day more on each step, so the stones came out fine. Nice hobby and great machine!",

It's water tight - I have yet to notice any leaks - and is also quiet enough that I can hear the steel shot rolling around inside more than I can hear the motor. Required maintenance seems pretty straightforward based on the instructions included in the box. It's performed perfectly so far, but I've only used it about five times. I haven't had it long enough to comment on durability, but based on what I've seen I would definitely recommend this product.",

It's very basic and it doesn't have an on-off switch, which would have been nice, but I guess a person just makes do by unplugging it.",
