      "text": "I bought this light for my Mom who is 80 and having a little trouble seeing things clearly. It is a bright light and very flexible - exactly what she needed. Sometimes she wants to use it to see her hand-sewing and other times to put her puzzles together. It is perfect for both. Easy to put together and operate and is very flexible. The weighted base will prevent it from falling over easily but not too heavy so she will be able to move it.",

My main complaint, though, is the quality of the light itself. It is a very cold harsh white, white. It feels like I'm in some sort of institution with those horrible fluorescent lights. At least it is dimmable, which is a nice feature, but that kinds of defeats the purpose. I will keep it since it's too difficult to pack up and send back, but it's definitely not what I was hoping for.",

It's really like a true color light that shows the colors you are working on perfectly. I have just recently bought 2 more of these lamps. One for our bedroom and one for my outdoor craft room. What else can I say. I love these lamps!!!",
