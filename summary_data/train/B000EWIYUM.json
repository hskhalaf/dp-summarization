Not put off by dumb machines, I tried several changes in the default layout. It seems the layout the Creative believes is the living end, AIN'T! I had to change it to AVI and the Intel Indedo video compresser and changed the audio compresser to MPEG layer-3. Best it's little heart, within range it follows me around when I move in the chair, keeping me centered in the picture. I like that. I was this close to sending it back (*) because I had a problem!",

The installation was easy, the image is clear and the directional live audio feature that they have, works great. When I video caht with my friend, he says that the image is clear and the frame rates are fine. Also, if there are others around, the directional live audio feature only picks up my voice. The software bundle is very good compared to the other cameras out there. Overall, I'm very happy with my camera and highly recommend it.",
