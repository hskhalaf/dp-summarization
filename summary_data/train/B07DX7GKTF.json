These glasses immediately felt think and heavy, similar to something you\u2019d get in a byob restaurant. I usually like Riedel but being extra clumsy, I was hoping for something a tad more sturdy while still being stylish. These were indeed sturdy but looked cheap. So in the end, I\u2019m glad they arrived broken so I was easily able to return them and get my money back. Would recommend if you needed to buy in bulk for a restaurant or event or if you like your glasses thick and heavy.",

Wine is noticeably different in these glasses than some cheaper options. They are priced so I won't panic if one breaks and they are dishwasher safe.

Probably will not buy again as there are many other types of wine glasses to try and this one was not all that impressive.",
