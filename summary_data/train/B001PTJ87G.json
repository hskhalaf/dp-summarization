Also, for them, the durability was consistent and the overall quality was superb. Many neutral runners recommended this road shoe. On the other hand, the fit wasn\u2019t very agreeable to a few of those who tried it.",

Shoe is comfy, but the shoelaces are extremely annoying. These things come untied at least a dozen times a day (I am not a double knotter) because the laces are so slippery. And if the soles get wet, bw prepared to squeak your way across whatever floor you're walking on until you dry the bottoms. Went from every day shoe to just a gym shoe now.. I would definitely buy another pair. But wouldn't spend more then $50 on them",

I wore them hiking up the Andes mountains and every day walking through towns with paved streets, cobblestone, and dirt roads. They were comfortable on every surface, the cushioning was great; and being so light weight it was a nice after doing so much walking. Even after getting dirty with all the use they cleaned up very easily and still look just about brand new. I would definitely suggest these sneakers to anyone!",
