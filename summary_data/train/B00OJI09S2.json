The box was way too large for this item and should have had a lot of bubble-wrap or something else substantial around the tree, instead of one longish piece of paper and the plastic bag the tree came in. Lucky for me the mug tree arrived in one piece.",

    "description": "Color:Satin NickelFree up valuable cupboard space with Euro 8-Mug Holder from Spectrum. The mug tree holds up to eight of your favorite coffee mugs or teacups, and each branch tilts upwards to hold each mug securely. Create a countertop coffee station with the mug holder, or clear up cabinet space by moving extra mugs to your counter. Display your collection of teacups, or store your glass or ceramic coffee mugs on the counter. Mug tree holds cups by the handles, so the holder can accommodate a variety of cup sizes at once. The solid steel base sits evenly on the table without tipping or leaning. The clean, curved lines and fresh finishes look at home in a modern kitchen, yet the looped handle fits into a traditional design scheme. Equipped with stoppers on the end of the arms, the mug tree does not allow cups to slide off. The looped handle makes it easy to move the mug holder from your kitchen countertop coffee station to a hot chocolate station in your dining room and back again. Organize your tea supplies and coffee accessories near your mugs for easy access to your morning cup. Made of sturdy steel.",
