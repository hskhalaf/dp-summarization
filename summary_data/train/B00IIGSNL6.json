I knew this wasn't normal so I contacted them and they sent me a new one within the week. The service was great and they responded promptly., The second one is just right but when I rock back and forth, there's s squeaking sound coming from the bottom of the chair and that's annoying! It's comfortable but still not perfect with the squeaking. I paid money for it regardless and would like a recliner that is...\"just right\"",

Replaced by the company, for free with no issues but it took a little time. In fact, massage is stronger than I expected for the price. What I don't like is the chair is full of static. I've tried rubbing it with dryer sheets and have a humidifier going 24/7, but it's like wearing a wool sweater as far as shock factor. It is comfy and reclines fully.",

It is also very, very comfortable. Yay Amazon! You may be taking over the world, but at least in my short-sighted opinion, I love you!",

The back completely broke (it didn't come apart, it broke), the wood snapped in it where bolts holding the metal brackets were secured. My husband weighs less than 200lbs and is the largest person who sits in the chair. The wood in the back of the chair holding the supports broke. We had it 9 months when this happened. It was sat in on average once a day for 30 minutes (sometimes not reclined). It wasn't used hard/abused. Very disappointing. The fabric did wear very well and it was very comfortable. However, the internal components and structure need redesigned and worked on!",

We looked over the chair quite thoroughly very well made, nothing broken and no bugs as other reviewers mentioned. Very happy with this purchase and would recommend it. Plan on getting another one soon. Delivery was estimated between the 12th and 17th but got it on the 11th. Save yourself the extra $400 on those other brands, this one is fantastic!",

I love the rocker function - the chair does not swivel. The cushions are plump and firm. I believe, the chair will hold its shape and firmness. Lastly, the vibration works well, but it is louder than I would like. I don't see myself using it. Great chair for the price.",

Also, the color is slightly darker than the photo. The one flaw I saw was that recliner has four feet that might damage carper or flooring underneath.
