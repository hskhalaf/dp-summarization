Just fill the water, add coffee, position the carafe and push the button. Housekeeping likes the flat sides and top that are much easier to clean then the many curved surfaces of most coffee-makers. Also, the choice of colors allows matching to decor - making the rooms look much more unified and gives the impression that this is a more expensive 'custom' upgrade to the rooms. Will update after more feedback - but looks like I'll be ordering more.",

It was good for about 6 pots of coffee, will just end up in a landfill. I'm really bummed",

It still makes very hot coffee which was always a great feature. Bella - I am very unhappy that my coffee now gets cold after 2 hours!",
