Secondly, my hair was not as hydrated & healthy after using compared to the original product that I used. I should have returned it long ago, but I guess I'll see what kind of integrity this seller has after seeing my review.",

My hair is a lot softer, and it doesn't frizz nearly as much! Plus, the smell is really nice. It is a good sized bottle, so even with very frequent use, it goes a long way! I will definitely buy this again!",
