The router is easy to setup and use and the Netduma team are always available should you have any issues. I'd pay $1000 for this router so $300 seems like a sweet deal to me!!

I had much better luck with an $80 TP-Link. If you search online for the problem you can find others with similar issues. It seems like a lottery if yours will be fine or not.

The Nighthawk app does not allow me to disable internet to a single device as I was able to with my previous Netgear router.

I won\u2019t mentio there name but they had a good concept. Just not enough handle everything in my household. Upon hooking it up the interface and everything gave me goosebumps. I was excited all over again to have WiFi. This is a superior device and would definitely recommend this product.",
