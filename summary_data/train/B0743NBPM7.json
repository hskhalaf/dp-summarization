Mine came and wouldn't even function for a single blow. I tried three different batteries and every time I try to turn it on and use it the screen comes on and beeps for a few seconds max before turning back off. The screen shows a battery icon that is almost empty even with fresh batteries. And now they won't take it back or refund. Don't waste your money.",

After having three drinks, I waited as directed (20 minutes), blew again, and it read a .08. (I'm female, 5'6 and weigh 140). I let my friend who hadn't drank any alcohol blow into it after I blew the second time, and it read accurately for him (at .00). So far, the product seems pretty accurate and I have no complaints whatsoever. It's awesome to have an estimate of where I'm at regarding my blood alcohol content for a great price. I'll be gifting this to my friends as well.",
