My barely 100 lb. daughter uses it a couple of time a week and I just noticed that many of the cords fell apart. So if you use it and it falls apart, that's not covered.",

Just be warned... you can really fly high in this thing and launch yourself. :-) It's quiet, it's durable, lightweight, but a bit larger / taller than the standard typical spring style mini-trampolines seen most places. If you are in the market for a mini trampoline, I'd recommend that you just make the investment on this. It's going to outlast the cheap ones and be way more fun... if you're going to use it indoors, it's actually going to be quiet enough to use around other people.",

It is very well built and sturdy, and bounding on it is so effective an exercise for our legs. Different from many other exercise, it is fun and allow us to behavior like a child again! So we can get sweaty without feeling working hard. I expect to enjoy it more especially when the winter is here and we cannot go out walking and jogging anymore. I do hope its surface can be slightly bigger as we need to be cautious when doing jumping jacks. Anyway, a great investment in our health. Strongly recommended!",

I would have to say that sometimes it hard to keep your self balanced. so maybe a bar is good to have if you want. i dont know if this model has a bar. the bounce is amazing. better than my cheap one. Its kind of tall so again watch your balance. lastly, its just me or maybe some people but seeing that the cords are visible its kinda scary and my brain tricks me into thinking it might break but most likeley it wont. Great product.",

The base of the jumping area is very small. It's a start in the right direction but I think there is one that's more expensive and seems to have a larger base area for jumping and it doesn't have that \"stiff\" feel to it. I will keep searching.",
