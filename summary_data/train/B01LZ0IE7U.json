It has virtually everything I was looking for but in one bag. I have several, couldn\u2019t find one that I liked. Too flimsy, too small, etc. This one hits the spot. Already received compliments too. I thought I would hate the brown, love it. It is a dark chocolate brown. Again, this bag is a steal. You can tell it is quality. You won\u2019t regret your purchase in my opinion, I sure didn\u2019t. Zippers are strong, heavy duty. Just a good bag.",

The pull on one side has separated but even worse, the zipper itself is tearing (which may have contributed to the pull separating; see the photos). I can't recommend the bag although you may get lucky and get a tougher bag or not use it the way I did. For the record, I carry a 13\" MacBook Pro, an iPad, a Kindle, an umbrella, and a the MacBook's power cord, plus papers and pens and stuff. I don't think that's overstuffing the bag by any means.",

It is a nice looking bag and the leather feels of good quality. A few months after my purchase, the hardware on the sides of the bag that connect to the longer shoulder strap warped and are unusable, so it must be carried by the short handle on top. When I purchased the bag the site noted a 3 year warranty. Can you help me get the hardware replaced so that I can carry this as a shoulder bag as well?",

Until the hardware broke, I was very pleased with this bag and 6- to 7-day-per-week use. I use it a lot, but there is hardware available that would last longer with such use. I'm still using it after doing a temporary fix (I've reattached the strap using a keychain ring).",

      "text": "This briefcase was a gift for a student working on his masters in business and he was thrilled. As we hoped and he affirmed, it strikes the right note between going to classes and an internship. The authenticity of leather is confusing these days, but this case definitely looks and smells like the real thing. There is plenty of room for his Macbook Pro, plus notebooks and textbooks. The interior zipper ensure that the contents aren't visible when the flap is opened. The shoulder strap is removable. I looked long and hard for several days for briefcases on Amazon, and this Samsonite case was definitely the winner.",

They just wore out and the shoulder strap is useless. I originally rated this 5 stars, but I removed one because of the swivel design on the strap. It's kind of cheap and destined to defintiely fail. Hoping I can replace the strap. I'll update here if I can.",

Other reviewers have commented as well that because of the man-made material, the shoulder pad keeps wanting to slide off the shoulder since it is too smooth. The problem was easy solved for me by buying a pair of self-adhesive rubber anti-slip shoe sole pads for less than $2 here on Amazon. I put those on and the problem is gone!

      "text": "This is a very nice and soft leather product. The color is a natural brown leather color, not as shown in the image. I'm still getting used to carry my laptop using the shoulder strap which feels quite uncomfortable since the strap keeps slipping off my shoulder. I used to carry a backpack which distributes the weight equally so you don't feel the weight that much, but now I'm want to look more professional and stylish by carrying this quality leather case. Hope the style will trump the uncomfortable weight issue (and I don't want to look like a messenger if I wear the strap across the other shoulder).",

My only dislike is the shoulder strap pad; it does not hold well on my shoulder & allows the strap to slides off. A nuisance when you are carrying other stuff. I have found that I must cross chest the strap, which is a nuisance of it's own.",

Little things started to fall apart. One of the clasps was the first to go. The pin holding the button would start sliding out of place, making it hard to open. Then the fabric around the velco closure for the laptop section started to rip. Finally, the zipper for one of the main compartments pulled away from the fabric. At around $100 not an expensive bag, but don't count on it lasting more than 18 months.",

The size is perfect as it fits all kinds of stuff and the pockets are well designed without there being so many things get lost.
