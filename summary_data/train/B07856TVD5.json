Ok, it is made of plastic, but surely the company would stand behind their product? I contacted them multiple times and was ghosted after their initial response. Don't get this one unless you want to add more crap to your local land fill. I suggest getting a metal can crusher from a different company who will stand behind their products.",

I had bought a metal one, and it was a piece of junk. This one doesn\u2019t bend at all, and the pull down and pull up is very smooth, doesn\u2019t bend or shift, and the self-dumping of the can to the bin is all one motion. It only crushes 12 oz. cans, and not 16, but I don\u2019t have many 16 oz. cans. The quality is excellent. I\u2019m positive I\u2019ll have it as long as my last crusher of a different brand but made of the same materials, which was 20 years. Highly impressed!",

It fits securely, and the crushed cans almost always drop directly into it. Every once in a while one catches at the top, but can be dropped into the bin by hand easily enough. The bin holds a good number of cans. Both the can crusher and the bin are well made, and serve their purpose well! Very pleased!",

Pretty sure it came from China. That one had broken on the first can I try to crush. I have crushed well over 100 cans with this product, and it works quite well. One of the things I really like about this model is that it automatically dumps the crushed can in whatever you set beneath it.",

My husband likes that the unit is enclosed enough that the soda does not splash out and make the wall around the unit all sticky. Because of that feature, we have it conveniently mounted in the laundry room, so even the grandkids are able to reach it and crush the cans - which they actually think is kind of fun!",

The problem was in packaging, as a small crinkled piece of tape was used to stick the loose screws to the back of the plastic crusher. Then the shipping box had cracks in it, so the screw apparently came loose and fell out during shipping. Missing hardware seems to be the norm these days no matter where you purchase products. So far the crusher works great. Time will tell as it is made of plastic, but seems to be sturdy.",

I used better anchors in the existing holes (ones rated to 75lbs) and haven't had an issue since. This proudct crushes cans very small and is VERY easy to crush without using a large amount of force.",
