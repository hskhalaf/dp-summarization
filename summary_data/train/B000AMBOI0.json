I opened it up and the wire connection to the coil spring had a poor solder job, causing an open connection. I fixed it and it works perfectly now. Resistance of the load is 11.2 milliohms, just a bit less than the normal 12 milliohm target for 12V @ 100 amps. I'll probably wire in a jack to plug in a DMM to get high accuracy voltage measurements that aren't possible with an analog panel meter, so the state of charge can be more easily determined.",

Open-circuit voltage is OK and quick, and specific gravity test with hydrometer gives good indication of state of charge. This tester puts a load on the battery that indicates its ability to actually deliver, since internal impedance will rise near the end of life. A good item to have if you are wondering about whether a battery should be replaced. Easy to use and quite well made.",
