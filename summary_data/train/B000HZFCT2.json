      "text": "It is a genuine Microsoft receiver. it appears to have at one time been paired with a wireless controller in a blister pack, but separated by a third party seller and sold by itself for console use only. My old receiver mysteriously stopped working with no signs of wear but well beyond the manufacturers warranty. I did not want to take a chance with a diminished functionality knock off, which appears to be what the other wireless receiver that is selling on amazon is. I assume this one will mysteriously quit working after two years, but by that time i will own a different generation of controller.",

It's probably a bit like buying a Gucci bag made by the same guy with the same materials in China but no longer having the \"official\" Gucci seal of approval. Make sure you don't lose the installation CD that comes with this - I can't seem to track down online drivers, so if you don't have the CD then you may not be able to install it again in the future.",

I advice using Ethernet over WiFi to get the best picture quality. This saved my 7 Xbox 360 Controllers I was gonna leave setting in the dust. (Yes! 7 controllers! Long Story)",

The one con, and the reason I only gave it 4 stars, is that there doesn't seem to be a good way to turn off the controller without removing the battery pack. A minor inconvenience, it will also time out after a few minutes of inactivity. Overall I'm very happy with the product.",
