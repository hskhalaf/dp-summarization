It seemed impossible that a block of salt can have so many positive effects on so many different aspects of a persons mental and physical wellbeing. I am here to say I am a believer. I suffer from seasonal depression and I'm a night shift worker. This lamp works miricals. I've felt more energized and more well rested. My mood is much more happy and my body feels much better. Also this is a beautiful lamp. The pictures don't do it justice and it fits perfectly on my bedside table. I live the dimmer feature so I can decide how much light it emits.",
