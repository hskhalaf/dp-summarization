It's very gentle and doesn't hurt her fingers at all.

After getting this motorized nail file, our nail grooming time is cut down significantly. The motor is very gentle and very, very efficient. I thought it might be too hard but I tried it on my finger and it's extremely gentle. Amazing product that manicures baby's nails without the danger of hurting them!",

I made my husband clip them but he would get frustrated because her nails are so tiny. Well her nails were getting ridiculously long so I went to amazon and came across this file set. As soon as I got it in the mail I went to file my girls nails and it was SO quick and easy! I had her nails trimmed to the perfect length and shape in minutes! I love this product and will use it until she can clip her own nails haha.",

It almost makes a U shape of the nail. I now just cut them and use this to soften the edge.",
