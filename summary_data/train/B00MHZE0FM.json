For years I gave her PJs from Victoria Secrets - but the quality of their product has declined, while the price has increased over the past few years, so I decided to try PajamaMania. I am VERY pleased and will be returning to them again in the near future (Valentine's Day is coming!)",

This year I ordered my sister some of these and I know she will be as happy as I am. The quality of these is excellent. The flannel is really a nice quality too. Highly Recommend!!",

After machine wash and tumble dry, they shrank a little in length and now are perfect. The sleeves still come down to my wrists. Something to consider, if you want easy care wash and dry, select the size accordingly to allow for shrinkage.",

If I have one tiny quibble, it's that I like a pocket on the pajama top\u2014preferably two\u2014and this brand does not put pockets on the chest. But these jammies are so beautiful and comfy I'm not just overlooking that, I'm practically forgetting that's usually a deal-killer for me. Highly recommend!!",

From the crotch to the ankles, the fabric is simply weak and shredding more as I touch it. Do not buy. cheap cheap!",
