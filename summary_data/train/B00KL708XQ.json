In the process of installing the replacement cabinet, we found that the side mirrors were also broken/cracked. Fortunately, we hadn't sent the 1st one back yet. So we were able to scavenge the side mirrors to complete the job. The installation instructions were confusing/frustrating. It took 2 people 5 hours to install. Swearing all the while. Had to go to YouTube to finally figure it out (go there first!). The cabinet is very heavy. The installation is hard. But...it is now installed and it is beautiful. Fingers crossed that it doesn't fall off the wall.",

The contractors had no trouble at all installing it. The three shelves adjust and there's a lot of space inside. Mine has been installed into the wall but there's enough room that I could hide a stick on toothbrush hanger along the edge under the mirror face. Overall, this was a great buy.",

We have decided to keep the two we have as the big mirrors are fine but again the side mirrors are broken and we will either have to have more cut here or do some other creative fix.
