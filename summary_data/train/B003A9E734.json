It is everything the other five-star reviews stated: simple, solid, streamlined, good-looking and functional. We needed it to provide reading light to our window seat and sofa, and brighten up a dark room. Each light turns on independently and can be angled in any direction. One bit of advice, use warm toned bulbs if you don't want stark lighting.",

Half the time a light doesn't come on, then magically it will come on by itself. The reverse has also happened with lights that initially came on, then died for no reason. I suspect there's a short in the electrical wiring, but who knows. I will throw it out and avoid buying products from this vendor going forward.",

I like that I can control how much light I need (1-3 bulbs on at a time). It's also nice I can aim them wherever I want. My lamp sits on carpet and it's very sturdy. It was super easy to put together. You just pull the cord through and the pole connects in a few different pieces. Then you just pop the cones for the bulbs in and voila!",

The threaded tubes were solidly built, but once fully assembled I noticed a slight bend. Nothing major, but not a perfect fit. Also, one of the lamp heads has a hard time staying in the position I put it. Other than that, it looks modern and chic in my home studio room :)",
