Before the glasses were left at school but this certainly helped plus the dinosaur figures made it that much easier for him to want to keep them on. The material is strong and the band is stretchy, but not so much where it would be easily lost. There hasn't been any loose strands or tears and its been consistently used everyday since day of purchase. Great retainer for a great price.",

Since every kids head is different I measured the band for this review: *Total Length of Band - 13 inches (this includes the length of the band on both sides that is folded over to hold the glasses ear piece). The material is pretty stretchy and can stretch to a full length of 15 inches. *2.25-2.5 inches on either side of the band is sewn narrow to accommodate the glasses. Depending on the size of your kids head you can insert the glasses ear piece all the way into the band or just partially. Width of Band - The band is 3/4 inches wide at the widest point",

    "title": "Croakies Kids Eyewear Retainer",
    "description": "In 1977 a ski patrolman came up with an idea for an eyewear retainer that would grip his shades through all kinds of alpine adventures. He grabbed an old wetsuit, some sharp scissors, and a good idea, then he made the first pair of eyewear retainers. The ingenious device was based on the design of a Chinese finger trap. Croakies are produced in the USA at their production facility in Bozeman, Montana. Having been used by all types of people, doing all kinds of activities all over the world, Croakies were then introduced to SPACE. They became standard equipment for the crew on the space shuttle in 1990. Croakies uses top quality components to create all their products. They build Croakies eyewear retainers with a number of different materials but all offer durability, functionality and style. Croakies is all about getting out and exploring life\u2019s big adventures. \u201cLove Life. Play Outside.\u201d",
