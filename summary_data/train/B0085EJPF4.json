      "text": "Got this as my 1st humidor (had several loaners over the years) and didn't want to spend a mint on one. Looks nice, the hygrometer tracks (was a little of but easily adjusted) and has adjustable shelves to hold a variety of cigars. Did an initial seasoning and loaded it up with about 75 cigars- would NOT maintain consistent humidity! Fought and cussed and was getting very dejected thinking it was not sealing properly. Finally calmed down and realized the cigars were settling and after a little over a month, settled in perfectly. Noob mistake; I now add DI water to the humidifier about once a month now and it hold very stable. Great for the money!",

Since the humidor was not actually seasoned, I cannot review neither verify its quality as far as performance is concerned, that is keeping humidity to the expected levels. Going back to the hygrometer, this is a very cheap and inaccurate hygrometer and cannot be calibrated easily and accurately. I would expect, based on the high user ratings, that the humidor would come with a high quality hygrometer. I am disappointed at this purchase as I had high expectations, again based on the user reviews. I am not recommending this humidor.",

Even with multiple Boveda 69% packs and other hydration systems, it never gets above 62% (according to my recently calibrated digital hygrometer). Either save up and buy a decent humidor or just get a tuperware box. Not worth paying this much for a poorly crafted wooden box.",

Even though it said it wasn\u2019t necessary, I seasoned the humidor with Boveda seasoning packs and had no issue. The analog hygrometer was a pain to calibrate, but after some work I was able to get it to match my digital hygrometer. Personally I have a Govee Bluetooth hygrometer inside the box, which is a great addition and let\u2019s me see RH and temperature data down to the minute for the precious 30 days. Thrilled with my purchase, and highly recommend this humidor.",

I spent 2 week meticulously seasoning with bovida packs and it dried them up without properly seasoning (yes, I used the correct amount for a humidor this size....4 of the 84% seasoning packets). After it failed to season properly, I added a few shot glasses full of distilled water to help the process along. Still it doesn't season. After taking these measures and watching it for weeks, it clearly isn't going to work. I attempted a return to find that I'm 1 day past the return threshold. Of course I am! Would not recomend",
