On the plus side, they dim as much as incandescents, unlike most LED bulbs which only get a little darker when fully dimmed.",

My only disappointment is the cost. Found a comparable 6pack at Walmart for $3.97. The cost here on Amazon was 3x that. Also, on a lamp that normally has 3 dimmable settings, this bulb seems to skip from low to high with a single touch, completely skipping the medium light setting. Not a huge deal but something I noticed.",

      "text": "Compared to the other led bulbs I have throughout my house, these have a very noticeably lower refresh rate. It's to the point were it's causing a tiny bit of dizziness and headaches. Easiest way to describe a low refresh rate is, if you move your hand quickly back and forth under the light it gets a strobe light / screen-door effect making any faster movement under the light disorientating. Another side affect of the low refresh rate also means any video recorded under these lights has slow moving rather large black scan lines.",

This is a shame because brightness was the single most important factor in my purchase -- hence the 2-star rating. If you want very bright bulbs, go elsewhere.
