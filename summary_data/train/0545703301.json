    "description": "LEGO Chain Reactions is packed full of ideas, instructions, and inspiration for 10 LEGO machines that spin, swing, pivot, roll, lift, and drop. Each machine alone is awesome, but put them together and you get incredible chain reactions. Then, combine the machines in any order you like to create your own chain reactions. Our team of experts worked with educators and 11-year-olds to invent the machines, then wrote a book that teaches the skills (and some of the physics behind the fun) kids need to create their own amazing chain reaction machines.\n\nOur book includes 33 special LEGO elements that combine with basic bricks from your collection to make your machines go. But don\u2019t worry that you won\u2019t have the right bricks; we worked with the folks at LEGO to make sure you\u2019ll need only the most common bricks, and that there are plenty of substitutes. The result is a chain reaction of fun, as one thing leads to another\u2026 and another\u2026 and another.\n\nComes with: 78 page book, 33 LEGO elements, 6 LEGO balls, 6 feet of string, 8 paper ramps, 2 paper pop-up signs, 1 paper funnel ramp, 1 paper flag, 1 paper bucket, 1 platform\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nFascinate your friends by completing an ordinary task in an extraordinary way. Learn to build 10 LEGO machines that can swing, pivot, roll, lift, and drop. Then connect, rearrange, and experiment with the machines to create a chain reaction. With this book in hand and a handful of basic bricks from your LEGO collection, the only other thing you'll need is a little imagination. Includes 80-page book of instructions, 33 LEGO pieces, instructions for 10 machines, 6 plastic balls, string, paper ramps, and other components.",
