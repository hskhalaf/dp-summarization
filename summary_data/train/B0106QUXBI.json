I paid over $80 for this product to receive it packaged in plastic; and not in a nicely prepared Morphe box. The brushes seemed cheap like knockoffs and immediately determined they were knockoffs after pulling one out of the the plastic sleeve and the handle coming unglued from metal base of brush! I was so disappointed!!!",

I will purchase more Morphe brushes in the future.",

I let them air out a few days then washed them with my beauty blender soap. They were bleeding a black color, even after 3 washes. :(",
