It is the only dry food that Zoe will consistently eat and the amount of protein in it keeps her vibrant and healthy. Plus it does not have all those nasty elements and dyes like most other dog foods. Being grain free is very important for dogs, especially given their predisposition to grain allergies (something which Zoe has unfortunately developed worse over the years of eating cheap, grain-filled dyed food). Keep your pup happy and healthy with Wellness and they'll thank you with many a wag of the tail. :-)",
