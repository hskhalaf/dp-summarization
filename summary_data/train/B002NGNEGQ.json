Thankfully, this one toasts very evenly, our most important criteria. (how hard can that be?!) Two very long slots hold the longest slices of bread, but also hold 4 regular slices at once, if desired. Easy controls, consistent temperature, easier than our last toaster to remove bits of toast from the bottom. Extra thick bread like bagels also fit easily, and are held centered and toast evenly. My only complaint is that the lifting function does not raise short slices enough to grab easily.",

Also, because it isn't strong enough to spring up you have to take hold of the handle and pull the toast up. Definition of our insanity? We never fail to be disappointed by this quirk!",

Like other reviewers mentioned (and as the photo indicates), the red finish is shiny as opposed to matte, but I like the shiny finish much better. Yes, it's plastic, as other reviewers noted, but I don't think it's cheap looking. I like the way it looks so much that I leave it out on my counter. I'm very pleased with my purchase.",

Two slots was not a deal breaker as it is only my husband and I. Glad i made the choice I did",
