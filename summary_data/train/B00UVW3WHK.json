It's super lightweight, easy to open and close, very easy to maneuver, and very compact. I know it's a little crazy to have multiple strollers , but believe me, this is a must have in addition to your travel system..",

PROS: Very lightweight, folds easily, fits in the back of our Jeep Cherokee with room to spare, steers nicely, large basket underneath for diaper bag/groceries/whatever. CONS: Wheels are kind of plasticky so they're a little on the bumpy/noisy side when not on perfectly smooth ground, no little compartment between the cup holders (the Snap n' Go stroller has one), every so often the folding mechanism catches. Overall, for the price, I would definitely recommend it!",

One downside\u2014I wish the sun cover went down a little more as the sun does enter the searing area depending on its angle (an issue in summer months when I began using this).",

Granted that I am using this thing pretty hard, if it makes it another 2... 3? months, I'll be surprised. Graco doesn't make replacement parts for this stroller btw, so if it goes down, this stroller is toast. That said, it's been doing it's best for all I've put it through.",
