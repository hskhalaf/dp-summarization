There's a number of standard building pieces included that this could be a starter set or an add-on if you already have some. There's one light unit (kinda wish there were two) that can be constantly changing colors or can be set to one color. It has a recharging cord included which is so much better than needing to replace the batteries when we forget to turn it off!",

She enjoyed from the first night! What's unique about this one is that they get so much joy out of making their own nightlight.... And it's rechargeable! So the only limit is really their creativity.... And how much time they have in a day!! Lol. Small improvement that could be made is to include a pouch for storage of the pieces. None is in here, so have a storage strategy in mind.",

They are even fun for adults as I found myself spending a bit of time thinking of new ways to join them. The light is nice and changes colors, but I was under the impression that it makes all of the pieces bright. This is not the case, especially if you put the structure on a non-reflective surface. I think I would rather have bought the non-lighted set which offered more pieces. Still pretty awesome though.",

Plus the older kids have fun making the different shapes and playing with the lights and shadows. I do think it is a bit overpriced though, esp considering there aren't that many pieces in it. So I'd recommend trying to find it on sale.",

I did call amazon about it and they were able to send us a brand new one. Hoping that my son will enjoy these when he comes back for another visit from Italy.",
