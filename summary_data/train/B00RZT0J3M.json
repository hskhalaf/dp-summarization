      "text": "Love this piece! And it is very classically chic and sophisticated. The only issue is that the cross bars in the back vibrate together when put together. We put a napkin in between them to keep it from clattering but plan on putting some felt on there. It is very sturdy and well put together. I can't speak to assembly, my boyfriend put it together but he said he didn't have any issues.",

The assembly was very easy as well. The 2 items are very sturdy and it's not that cheap wood that we often see. I was very happy to see this when I unwrapped them. I would recommend this to anyone else looking to purchase a good piece of furniture.",

      "text": "This shelf is awesome! Love the look and the quality. I bought it for our record collection which are very heavy and tend to make shelves bow, but this shelf is plenty strong enough to hold them without issue. We had to modify it a little so the records would not fall out the ends. We drilled a hole on the top through the metal and on the bottom and inserted a rod we picked up at the local hardware store. Works like a charm and looks amazing.",
