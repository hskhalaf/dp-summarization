I downloaded my content to the drive and it worked normally for about 24-hours. After 24-hours the drive became very unreliable....it would disconnect from my computer for absolutely no reason. This action troubled me so I purchased another backup drive and I've spent nearly 10 hours transferring my data off the Seagate hard drive....during this process it has shutdown more than 50 times during my attempts to transfer data. Attached picture is from when I left the hard drive unattended for an hour....the drive continually connects and disconnects without user input.",

Your XBOX will ask you if you want to use this as a media drive or format as a game drive. Once formatted you'll have about ~7.2TB available for game storage. (After over-provision: This is normal for ALL drives) So if you're looking for a matching black hub drive this will work wonders for you. The only thing missing is the fancy Xbox branding that the whitehas on the chassis.",

If it can't reliably backup, it's a risky purchase. I've had a lot of problems with Seagate drives. They fail often and are very susceptible to power failers: even with surge suppressors.

Tested with both files and Blackmagic. The small file read/write is pretty abysmal. Further, its sleep is unpredictable. Start a large file restoration from the cloud and occasionally it's gone to sleep, forcing the entire process to start over again once I wake it. Would not buy again, but it'll do the job of serving as a backup to my backup.",

Only problem is that every now and then, when copying large groups of files or large directories to the drive, the drive seems to spontaneously un-mount itself as a USB drive, interrupting any copying or downloading. But then pretty quickly the drive is re-discovered and re-mounts--not sure why this happens... I have one other of these backup drives and it does not behave this way. Doesn't happen all the time, only intermittently. None of my other USB drives have done this. (Is mostly an inconvenience, rather than a deal-breaker.) Otherwise, drive seems fine. The 2-port USB Hub included in the design is also helpful.",
