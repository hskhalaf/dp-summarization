I truly wish this product worked as advertised as I have been looking for a reasonably priced device to record OTA programs but this is not it. Amazon needs to improve their technology and R&D before I would buy or recommend this product to anyone.",

      "text": "I just bought the Fire TV Recast, got it set up and have watched it live and recordings for two days. I am really disappointed in the low-def picture. When my antenna is connected directly to the TV the picture is clear and high definition (1080 p). Running it through the Recast converts it to a low definition picture. I was not aware Recast had that issue. I will most likely be returning it.",

I wanted to record 10 hours continuously of different shows. I had to manually start each recording and at the end of each show it stopped without me telling it to stop or keep going . It needs to have programmable start and stop times on the smartphone interface. To me it is useless.",

I like that you don't have to switch tv inputs, to go from streaming channels to live tv. But the menu driven system and poor image quality is a deal breaker.

The places this unit falls down are the confusing interface and the lack of any ability to watch a recording while it is recording (for example watching 15 minutes behind live so you can skip commercials). If Amazon continues to update the interface they will have a really nice product.",
