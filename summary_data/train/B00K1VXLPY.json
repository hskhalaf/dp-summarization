Apple informs me that the battery should be guaranteed for a minimum of 2 years and should certainly perform fine until then. Mine hasn't.",

Beautifully light and quick to respond when opening up or returning to a sleeping screen. Good price. It is a USA model but I expected this. It doesn't bother me. When needing a \u20ac or \u00a3 sign it's option +3 for \u00a3 and alt -2 gives the \u20ac. Simples! It's an Apple Mac what's more to add?",

Switched on, worked for two or three minutes (just long enough for me to think how great it was), then the screen when black and three beeps sounded - catastrophic memory error. The lesson? Go to the Apple Store!",

Comes with 3 pin UK charger and US keyboard which doesnt make any difference to me (there is no \u00a3 sign on keyboard but once you set up your keyboard as UK at the start up then it's option+ 3) Delivered in 4 days. So far i m happy with the product. Super fast, sleek and battery lasts 6-7 hours easy! Once i get used to new OS; i dont think i will be going back to slow and confusing windows 8. Seller's communication wasn't great as i asked for a tracking number for parcel but never heard anything.",

It looks great, very fast (puts my old one to shame!), and long battery life. Perfect for students like me. If you're used to Windows for so long then it might take a bit of getting used to, but it's definitely worth the switch in my opinion. Also if you're confused by the advert like I was, it came with the latest OS.",
