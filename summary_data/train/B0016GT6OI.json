These are nice heavy little speakers, you can tell they are made of quality without even looking at the logo and expecting polk to be what it is already. Packaged well, and these lil' guys drive hard for you. They hit so nicely in a sealed box, and don't miss a beat. I am happy qwith these, I hope they last.",

      "text": "I used this driver to replace the driver in a Infinity SSW-10. I wired it so as to be a 2 ohm driver as the old driver read 1.8 ohms. Close enough. It fits almost perfect and it sounds great. Hard hitting and very punchy. Works well with the existing amp in the SSW-10. I was thinking about replacing the old foam surround in the old driver but for a few dollars more I got this driver and I believe it is a better higher quality driver with a rubber surround that should last for many years. Highly recommend.",
