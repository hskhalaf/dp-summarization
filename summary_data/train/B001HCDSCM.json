Consumption of omega-3 fatty acids has been found to support healthy blood pressure and triglyceride levels, as well as promote overall heart health. That's why the American Heart Association recommends eating at least two servings of fish per week. Each daily dose of Everyone's Omega Fish & Flax delivers 502 mg total of omega-3s-the equivalent of two servings of fish-including 200 mg of EPA and 175 mg of DHA, two of the most crucial omega-3s. Everyone's Omega Fish & Flax only contains small fish species that have been caught in clean water, free of environmental pollutants. For increased absorption and easy digestion of the fish, the formula includes a blend of lemon, parsley, rosemary and triglyceride fish oils.
