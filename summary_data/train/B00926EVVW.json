Still has a great taste (almost sweeter maybe, hard to tell), consistency is still nice and thick like a shake, and the stuff just works! I always seem to rotate back to Syntha-6.",

Not the absolute best but I've certainly had far worse. Kind of a bland flavor which is good I suppose so you don't get sick of it quickly. I like to ad a heaping tablespoon of PB2 along with 10oz skim to improve the flavor a bit. I never mix protein in water because that's disgusting to me so I can not comment on how it tastes with water alone. The syntha 6 isolate doesn't taste as good as the regular syntha 6 of course but it's still way better than a lot of powders.",
