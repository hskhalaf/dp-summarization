After breaking it in for roughly 100hrs, the smile I get on my face every time I put them on says it all. Crisp crisp beats!! Drop notes, base, acoustics, vocals are all perfectly calibrated. This is the best present my boyfriend ever bought me. Plus, the price compared to others in the same arena is unmatched! I can't say enough about these headphones! You won't regret it. Just break it in!! Enjoy!!",

      "text": "Ultrasone headphones have their own singular sound and I\u2019m a fan of it. Less fatiguing than other headphones due to their positioning of the drivers, these emit a wonderfully natural sound. Rather than seeming like you\u2019re listening to closed headphones, these feel as if you\u2019re savoring speakers in an acoustically optimized room. I\u2019ve enjoyed a few live recordings that literally did sound truly live thanks to the design of these cans. These headphones also excel when listening to movies, creating a wide auditorium atmosphere. I\u2019ve bought many headphones in the past, but Ultrasone ended my quest for perfection. I reach for these each and every time.",

I like a wire extender that I sometimes use to connect headphones to my TV. They allow me to escape from occasionally noisy street/neighbors or maintain silence when I want to watch something during the night. The only problem is a wire length without extender. I feel that it's not long enough for me but anyway it's not a big issue.",

Couldn't agree more, I feel like these are ideal for EDM/house... they don't sound too great with other music like rock or anything lyric based but for my style of music, I couldn't be happier. Great bass and sounds perfect with electro. Love the comfort too, fit perfect for me. Only question now is if I need a headphone amp or not, I run it out of an HP laptop with the beats audio so I think it gets enough power as is.",

My previous pair was a set of Sennheiser Pro HDs, and while they were about the same, if not a little bit better than these Ultrasone, I didn't care for much about them save for the superb sound quality.",

If you are going to be active I would not recommend.

I never thought I had a large head but my one issue with theses is the tightness of the fit. Not overpowering but mildly annoying. Overall, I now spend more time listening that I have in years because of the enriched sound.",

    "description": "The exclusive design of the closed-back Ultrasone HFI-780 is accentuated by the polar-silver color. The HFI-780 contains all Ultrasone technologies such as S-Logic Plus, ULE and safer hearing. The HFI-780 is developed from the studio sector and is distinguished by a frequency response that is specifically tuned for DVD and gaming. Sophisticated home theater and music enthusiasts are overwhelmed by the impressive sound that makes it appear as though you are listening to speakers placed meters away. Gamers are impressed by the exact sound reproduction, making the gaming world come alive. The low frequency ranges are raised in order to reach the highest possible synergies with DSP-Systems like Dolby Headphone and Yamaha Silent Cinema. Through S-Logic Natural Surround, the sound moves out of your head and into the room around you. Direction and distance are more easily perceived, giving the illusion of being at a live concert. With just a pair of Ultrasones and your favorite audio device, you can have genuine 3-dimensional aural enjoyment. The HFI-780 is equipped with thicker ear and headphone pads, and comes with a new velvet carrying bag.",
