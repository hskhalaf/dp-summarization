      "text": "I've always loved the classic look of these particular Sperrys and the ease in cleaning them. Just toss them in the wash with a capful of bleach, sun dry, and you're good to go. I wear a size 14 B (my feet aren't wide) and normally wear these with no-show socks though sometimes without. Either way, there is quite a bit of room in the toe area than I'm not used to with my other nice fitting shoes. It almost feels like I could have gone down a size. With as much confusion there is on the fit of Sperrys, I highly suggest at least trying the pair locally before ordering, or ordering from vendors that allow returns for fitting.",
