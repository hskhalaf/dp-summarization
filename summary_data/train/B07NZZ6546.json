That small pizza pan might just hold a 5 inch pizza. My mistake! I just was expecting normal size pieces. Air Fryer/Baker/etc. is probably going to end up in the closet somewhere. It would take more work than it's worth to make so many batches to make a real meal this way. Again, my fault for expecting more from this product and the accessories I bought for it's use.",

So I ordered this, knowing there would be some pieces I don't need but the price was right and I think it was a good purchase. The air fryer is a great appliance, I use it to cook all kinds of crispy foods like French Fries for instance, and it's great for reheating a lot of foods, many of them come out better than the first time because they're crispier. Anyway, I think the accessories will make my fryer handier than ever.",
