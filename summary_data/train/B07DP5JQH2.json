I applied to my back and arms after exfoliating (used a lotion applicator to get my back) and there were no streaks at all. Very easy product to use. I have VERY sensitive facial skin and used this with a half and half mix on my face, and it worked so well. Would not recommend using on your face if you wear any makeup- do it at night only.",
