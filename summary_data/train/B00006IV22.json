I've actually been getting my hair dryer faster with this than my usual dryer (probably because it's much lighter), so I've ditched my normal dryer for now and have been using this exclusively.

Make sure you hold it about 12 inches from your head. It's not as noisy as my old dryer, but it does seem to have a high-pitch ring that will linger for a few seconds after you turn it off.

It worked really well on my hair which is thick and can be difficult/time consuming to dry. It fit into my carry on and was easy to travel with. I would def recommend this product to my friends who travel a lot.",
