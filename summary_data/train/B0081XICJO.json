I added her favorite blanket to the bottom and she jumps in it herself. Great for our upcoming camping trip for when she gets tired on hikes. Posted some pictures so you can see bag and dog size.",

I might try to cut them and re-sew the ends to eliminate the excess. Construction seems high quality. The storage is very minimal. I bought the Amazon warehouse used/Very Good. I assume it was a return. It appeared new but clearly had been removed from the original packaging and then stuffed back in.",

It did NOT which was a huge plus. I kept it with a little water on the floor board of the back seat and it did not leak, spill during the trip. The dogs had no problem drinking out of the bowl, it's compact and great for travel. Glad I purchased it to replace the one I had.",

He's so happy in this one! So far it's comfortable for me as well. The cross straps and waist strap are great. It needs to be pretty tight to keep the dog upright but the clips make it easy to do this.",
