      "text": "I've had this pan for a few months and have made muffin tops every two weeks. I use a light coat of shortening on the tray to assure easy removal of the cooked muffin tops (as recommended in the literature that came with the pan) and it works wonderfully. The pan is super easy to clean and easy to store. It's necessary to have a cookie sheet underneath the pan to move it about and put it into and take it out of the oven as the pan is thoroughly flexible and will not stay flat unless supported from below. If you like muffin tops, this is a great pan to use.",

What a waste of time making my muffins, baking, only to find out I have to throw everything out. Ridiculous!",

The muffins dropped out when I flipped the pan, and after soaking for 5 minutes the pan cleaned up easily. When I first got the pan I was worried because the cup size looked smaller than the metal one I already had. But I baked the same packages of muffin mix in this pan that I used with my metal one and the cups in this pan were more than enough to handle the amount of mix. VERY happy with this pan. Will try some other similar products from this brand.",

      "text": "For some reason I was expecting a pan for normal-sized muffins.... these are enormous, and there is no taper to the bases at all (I should have taken a better look at the picture). That being said, the pan is great for personal-sized quiches and frittatas. This hasn't had vigorous use, but seems pretty tough. It's nice to be able to push items out instead of trying to gently pry them out with a knife. Overall it's not what I expected, but it's not bad.",

    "description": "Style Name:Jumbo Muffin PanMrs. Anderson\u2019s Silicone Muffin Pan is perfect for baking muffin recipes, cupcakes, popovers, and mini cheesecakes. Made from 100-percent European-grade silicone, Mrs. Anderson\u2019s specialty bakeware offers the same quick food release and easy cleanup as FDA-approved silicone but is even more flexible and durable to maintain its original shape and non-stick qualities through more uses. Designed with ample support to stand on its own, yet flexible enough to unmold foods with a gentle twist. Subjected to higher standards of testing for a superior food grade silicone, European-grade silicone baking pans maintain their elasticity and flexibility longer, and are stronger and more durable to withstand everyday stress and strain, like twisting to unmold and release foods, yet bounce back to their original shape. Their non-stick property is maintained through more uses than other baking molds in an even wider range of temperatures, from -40-degrees to 500-degrees Fahrenheit, for an amazing baking experience every time. Mrs. Anderson\u2019s Silicone Muffin Pan is easy to use. Simply place it on a cookie sheet, pour in batter, and bake according to recipe. Great for baking muffins, cupcakes, popovers, mini cheesecakes, making gelatins, and more. Safe to use from freezer to oven, microwave and dishwasher. BPA free. Includes instructions. Flexible and naturally non-stick to release foods with ease. Dishwasher safe for easy cleanup. Do not use knives, scrapers, brushes or cutters. Never cut in the pan.
