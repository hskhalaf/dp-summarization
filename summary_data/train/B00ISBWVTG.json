When I went to re-oder them, I found these, and decided to give them a try. I can't say enough about them. They seem to feel a little bigger & a little thicker, and I am glad I took the chance to make the change. They also tear from the roll very easily & open easily also. So I am a happy pooper-picker-upper. I will probably reorder these when I run out next time.",

Actually, they are just plastic with an additive that is supposed to make the plastic break down more quickly than ordinary plastic. It's not even clear that the additive works. And in any case, the bags are still plastic, and they will just break down into plastic microparticles. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be anyone who makes true compostable/non-plastic poop bags, so these are maybe the best you can do unless you want to use wax paper and plastic bags.",

Very convenient and makes the whole process a lot more efficient... especially if you're in bad whether or have your hands full keeping fido under control. The scented bags smell pretty nice too.",

I use them for daily scooping of litter boxes, so that isn't a problem for me. So far so good, well scented, strong enough and I like the biodegradable factor.",

They tear apart easily and open easily for the most part (except for those cold and dark nights!).

This is a good thing since it can be a bit overpowering, especially at first once you open the package will all 30 rolls throwing their talcum powder smell at you.
