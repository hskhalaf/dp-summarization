The low light performance is better than the more recent compact cameras I've since brought and I've found the GPS feature to be very useful. My only gripes is that it takes a minutes for the GPS to acquire a signal and that the the details of low light photos have a certain fuzziness that is different from other cameras. Still, I like how it is able to capture details in low light that is only exceeded by DSLR cameras.",

Add in a memory card and a spare battery, and you can go for a week-long trip and take your fill of pics and movies. I like the fact that the battery comes out for recharging - no worries about a battery going bad! My first camera was stolen, and I bought another one just like it because I like it so much!",

The panoramic shot is very useful. Have yet to test the video feature. Not a huge fan of the Sony photo management software.

Video is in HD and impressive, and looks like video shot from a true video camera. Overall this is a great camera and can be found at a good price.",

Ricoh introduced a behemoth a few years ago, but shutter delay, size and other problems discouraged our analysts from ever using it more than once. This Sony is a winner. Over the next couple of months I plan to run some comparisons on GPS accuracy between a handheld Garmin 76SCX, an Iphone, and this Sony. From early trials, I expect Sony's accuracy will be sufficient for our analysts' geo-locating needs, plus it is an easy camera to use.",

Taking low light pictures without a tripod is pure magic. And its smart mode is really smart. The panorama mode is great. The camera is so compact, it compares to many smartphones in size and weight. I can carry it easily in my pocket. Having the option of using SD card is great. I would suggest that you get a 8GB or 16GB card for storage if you plan on taking HD video's. Would recommend this camera very highly",

We have a Mac and we are able to plug the sd card into a card reader and all the photos go into iPhoto and the video (in avchd mode) into iMovie.

It was a good camera just that I wasn't happy about using memory stick and since then I started using Canon, which have been awesome. I saw this camera in the Gold Box deal and was happy that Sony finally is supporting SD card. I thought it to be good upgrade to my Canon Powershot ELPH 8MP. This camera felt cheap in hand, and there is sound when lens moves. The images from this camera are awful to say the least. This camera was 100 times worse than camera of my phone (Motorola Atrix), the only place it could stay was in Amazon Warehouse.",

Plus catch fast action shots with up to 10 frames per seconds shooting. Full HD Movie Mode records amazingly detailed video and a 25mm equivalent wide angle 10x high-zoom G Lens allows you to take captivating images. \n\n\n\nFrame your shots on a 3-inch LCD Sony DSC-HX5V Highlights \n\n3.0-inch Clear Photo LCD display (230k pixels)\nCompose and show off your images on the large 3.0-inch (230K) Clear Photo LCD display, which features a special anti-reflective coating for sharp visibility, even in bright sunlight. \n\n10x (25mm) professional-quality optical zoom G-Lens\nG lenses are used in top of the line digital single lens reflex (DSLR) cameras and advanced pro-sumer HD Camcorders. Capture the action up close with the 10x optical zoom, and with the 25mm equivalent wide angle lens the HX5V even allows you to capture more of the scenes in landscape or group portraits. \n\n10.2-megapixel, back-illuminated \"Exmor R\" CMOS image sensor\nThe DSC-HX5V features a 10.2-megapixel \"Exmor R\" CMOS image sensor that brings out the full resolving power of the camera's wide angle G lens to deliver extremely fast speed, high resolution, and stunning low-light sensitivity with improved image clarity and drastically reduced grain. In addition, the combined \"Exmor R\" CMOS sensor and BIONZ image processor delivers extremely fast 10fps, Anti Motion Blur, Hand-held Twilight and 1080i movie modes. \n\n\n\nAnti-Motion Blur Mode\nCapture cleaner and sharper images in low light for non landscape shots. When set in Anti-motion Blur Mode, the DSC-HX5V captures six images in a fraction of a second with higher shutter speed and combines the data from all six to create a single image of extraordinary detail and eliminate subject blur, beyond the capability of traditional cameras. \n\nIntelligent Sweep Panorama Mode \nCapture expansive landscapes with Intelligent Sweep Panorama Mode. Press shutter and sweep and the camera does the rest, continuously, shooting images and in one second stitching them together. This model even detects faces and moving subjects to stitch intelligently different widths to avoid subject distortion. \n\n\n\nHandheld Twilight\nCapture cleaner and sharper night shots without using a tripod. When set to Handheld Twilight Mode, the DSC-HX5V captures six images in a fraction of a second with one press of the shutter, and combines the data from all six to create a single image of extraordinary detail and low noise. With these modes, you can capture images in low light, without flash, beyond the capability of traditional cameras. \n\nCapture 10 frames per second at full 10.2-megapixel resolution High Speed Shooting (10fps)\nThe HX5V can capture full 10.2-megapixel resolution images at up to 10 fps, helping to ensure you never miss the decisive moment. What's more, the HX5V employs a mechanical shutter that helps reduce distortion when continuously shooting moving subjects. \n\n1080i AVCHD Movie Mode \nRecord movies in 1080i AVCHD high definition at 60i. The AVCHD format captures a high degree of detail and smooth movement, and when footage is burned to disc, can be played back on Blu-ray Disc players, Sony PlayStation3 systems and compatible PCs and HDTVs. \n\nHDMI output\nThe High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) is a compact audio/video connector interface for transmitting uncompressed digital streams. HDMI connects digital audio/video sources such as a compatible camcorder, Blu-ray Disc player, a personal computer, a video game console, or an AV receiver to a compatible digital audio device and/or video monitor such as a digital television (DTV). \n\nDVDirect DVD recorder compatible\nWith AVCHD capabilities the DSC-HX5V is compatible with the DVDirect DVD recorder, allowing automatic playback of high definition footage. Simply insert your Memory Stick media into the DVDirect DVD recorder and enjoy your movies shot in high definition. (Recorder and media sold separately) \n\nHD MP4 Movie Mode\nMP4 is a popular format for high definition video that compresses the size of your audio and video, making your media files small enough to easily transfer to your compatible PC or Mac. MP4 is also highly compatible with the Web, so you can effortlessly upload your media to popular photo or video-sharing Web sites like Photobucket or YouTube. (Compatible PC with internet capability required). \n\nActive Mode\nOptical SteadyShot image stabilization with Active Mode represents the next step forward in Sony image stabilization technology, and allows the camera lens a greater range of motion for a superior level of image smoothness. Now you can capture smooth movies on your camera while on the move. \n\nOptical SteadyShot image stabilization\nOptical SteadyShot image stabilization uses a built-in gyro sensor to detect camera shake and automatically shifts the lens to help prevent blur without sacrificing image quality. \n\nGPS and Compass\nAn integrated GPS receiver and compass record the location and direction of every shot you take and let you view your images on a map with compatible computer and internet applications, so you can remember where you took your favorite shots. \n\nTransferJet technology\nTransferJet technology, developed by Sony and advanced and promoted by consortium of 18 other companies, allows you to transfer files between two TransferJet enabled devices just by touching them together, without the hassle of hunting for cables or the complication of pairing. \n\nBIONZ Image Processor\nThe BIONZ image processor delivers the high resolution and fast performance you expect from a Sony digital camera. Fast processing enables unique Sony features such as Sweep Panorama, Handheld Twilight, Antimotion Blur, HDR, etc to take and combine multiple images in less than a second to create wide panoramic images. Images have reduced grain and appear less washed out. \n\n\n\nBacklight Correction HDR\nShooting high-contrast scenes can often lead to washed out backgrounds and details lost in shadow. Backlight Correction HDR helps correct for this by taking two pictures at different settings and processing the best elements of both into a single image. \n\nSelf-Portrait Timer\nSelf-Portrait Timer helps take the guesswork out of self portraits by utilizing Face Detection technology to recognize when your face enters the frame. Once the camera detects your face, it triggers a 2-second timer, and then snaps a picture. \n\nIntelligent Auto (iAuto) mode\nUnlike traditional auto mode, Intelligent Auto (iAuto) mode thinks for you, recognizing scenes, lighting conditions, and faces, and adjusts settings resulting in clearer images, faces with more natural skin tone, and less blur. By incorporating advanced features such as Intelligent Scene Recognition, Face Detection technology, and Optical SteadyShot image stabilization, iAuto mode lets you take advantage of the latest Sony Cyber-shot technology without leaving auto mode. Whether you're shooting landscapes, capturing a beautiful flower, or taking pictures at an in-door birthday party or wedding shower, iAuto mode will optimize your camera's settings to help ensure you come away with a great shot. \n\nIntelligent Scene Recognition (iSCN) Mode\nIntelligent Scene Recognition (iSCN) Mode automatically detects eight different types of scenes and, within just 1/30th of a second, selects the appropriate camera settings: Backlight, Backlight Portrait, Twilight, Twilight Portrait, Twilight using a tripod, Portrait, Landscape, and Macro. iSCN has two modes: Auto and Advanced. In Auto Mode, the camera takes a single shot using the optimal settings. \n\nHigh Sensitivity Mode (ISO 3200)\nHigh ISO allows for faster shutter speed, so you can take photos indoors or in low light without the need for a flash. In addition to High Sensitivity Mode (ISO), you can select up to seven ISO settings (Auto, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200) when shooting in Program Auto Mode to adjust sensitivity to your shooting conditions. \n\nFace Detection helps ensure you focus on the right subject Face Detection technology\nSony's Face Detection technology can automatically distinguish between children and adults. Face Detection technology detects up to eight individual faces and adjusts flash, focus, exposure, and white balance to help deliver crisp, properly lit images of family and friends. \n\nMotion Detection\nMotion Detection, along with Face Motion Detection adjusts ISO sensitivity and increases the shutter speed when movement is detected, reducing blur in moving subjects and faces. \n\nAnti-blink Function\nIt's frustrating to think you've captured that perfect shot, only to review it later and discover one of your subjects blinked just as you pressed the shutter. When the camera is set to Soft Snap, the Anti-blink function captures two images, recording only the photo with less squinting or blinking. If a blink is detected in other shooting modes, a warning will be displayed after you take the shot. \n\nSmile Shutter technology Smile Shutter technology\nSmile Shutter technology captures a smile the moment it happens. Simply press the Smile Shutter button and the camera does the rest. You can also select adult and child priority and indicate the degree of Smile Detection Sensitivity. Intelligent Scene Recognition can be used together with Smile Shutter mode. This means that beautiful smiles can be captured with settings optimized for the particular scene, even in difficult conditions such as twilight and backlighting. \n\nScene Modes\nThe DSC-HX5V features 10 convenient scene modes: High Sensitivity, Twilight, Twilight Portrait, Soft Snap, Landscape, Beach, Snow, Fireworks, Advanced Sports Shooting, Gourmet, Pet. \n\nIntelligent AF\nThanks to Intelligent AF technology, capture fleeting moments like a child's adorable expression with the ultra-quick AF which locks focus in as little as 0.3 seconds. \n\nScene Modes\nThe DSC-HX5V offers 8 diverse scene modes for various settings. Modes include: Backlight, Backlight Portrait, Twilight, Twilight Portrait, Twilight using a tripod, Portrait, Landscape and Macro. \n\nEasy Shooting Mode\nWith Easy Shooting Mode, even beginners can take great photos. In Easy Shooting Mode, easy-to-understand basic instructions are displayed on the LCD screen and the camera switches to all automatic settings, removing several function choices and allowing you to focus on just your subject. Since this mode works together with Intelligent Scene Recognition, the camera selects the optimum setting for each scene. In addition the easy mode simplifies preview mode. \n\nFunction Guide\nThis beginner-friendly optional function helps navigate through the various functions and settings displaying the description of chosen functions or settings on the LCD screen. \n\nPHOTOMUSIC\nPHOTOMUSIC combines images with music (4 tracks, 5 minutes per track) to produce fun and entertaining slide shows with standard visual effects (Simple, Nostalgic, Active, and Stylish). Select from pre-loaded tracks on the camera or transfer your own from your compatible computer (sold separately). \n\nViewing modes\nFind your photos using the simple folder or calendar viewing modes. \n\nIn-Camera Retouching Tools\nRetouch and enhance your photos on the go with in-camera Trimming, Red-Eye Correction, and Unsharp Masking functions. \n\n\n\nPhotoTV HD\nBring your photos to life and enjoy highly detailed, high definition images with PhotoTV HD-capable Sony BRAVIA HDTVs. PhotoTV HD fine tunes settings on your PhotoTV HD enabled BRAVIA HDTV, such as sharpness, gradation, and color to display images that look more like printed \n\nLithium-ion battery\nIncluded lithium-ion battery provides added convenience with longer lasting power than alkaline batteries. \n\nMedia card slot \nFor convenient storage and sharing of your images, the DSC-HX5V accepts Memory Stick Duo/Memory Stick PRO Duo/Memory Stick PRO-HG Duo media (sold separately). \n\nSD Card Functionality\nSony SD memory cards are the perfect solution for storing and sharing your digital content such as high-quality photos, videos, music, and more. \n\nIncludes Sony PMB (Picture Motion Browser) Software ver. 5.02\nSony Picture Motion Browser software offers a simple, intuitive way to transfer, sort, and view your video and still images on your compatible PC. In addition, multiple output options let you burn your memories to DVD (sold separately), as well as take advantage of one click upload to a number of popular video and photo sharing sites \n\nIncludes Sony PMBP (Picture Motion Browser Portable) software\nWith the pre-installed Picture Motion Browser (PMB) Portable software the DSC-HX5V makes it easy to pre-select videos and images in the camera and conveniently upload them from the camera to a compatible PC and popular Internet sharing sites without the need for any additional software or install.",
