Now I can store them in here rather than taking up drawer space. It IS large, but again, that's not an issue for me. The finish does tend to spot up alot if you touch it with wet hands. Therefore I knocked off a star.But I may spray the stainless Exterior with Shellac or Laquer to help combat that issue. All in all I like it and I'd buy it again or recommend it to a friend.",

      "text": "It\u2019s super easy to clean and looks pretty sleek when your fingerprints aren\u2019t smudged all over it. However this toothbrush holder gets 3 stars because the rubber comb parts within the sections are really flimsy with no way to replace them. Toothbrush heads touching each other is kind of gross to think about yet unavoidable with this product because of those combs. Tip: Be sure to clean this thing regularly... because the gunk that accumulates at the bottom is absolutely disgusting.",

The insert is removable for easy cleaning -- and it definitely needs to be cleaned once in awhile to avoid grossness. The outside does get water spots, but this isn't a deal breaker for us -- and they can be wiped away. This isn't a petite toothbrush holder, so pay attention to the dimensions given in the product details! Would definitely buy again.",

Other tooth brush holders would have to be cleaned and sanitized weekly, but this one simply requires a quick rinse and also a quick wipe down on the outside to remove any fingerprints (like most stainless products I own).

It neatly protected our toothbrushes from dust particles and whatever else flies through the air in a bathroom. It works so well that even after moving into our new, larger, and permanent space, I kept this item and still like it for the original reasons I bought it.",
