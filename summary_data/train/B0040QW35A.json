I always thought furminator was for long hair dogs but I saw a review for a bulldog so I figure I'll give it a try and I'm thoroughly amazed. This thing not only catches alot of hair it even gets his dandruff. Plus side is that they like to be brushed. Win-win for me, only wish I bought this earlier lol I do recommend using this outside so that you can just brush off the loose hair's off and not have to vacuum after you're done brushing.",

I also recommend the Furminator brand mat removal tool. I use the Furminator every couple months and it really helps keep the fur-bunnies from appearing on the hardwood floors. The dogs seem so much more comfortable after getting furminated too. I included a picture of my Aussie after he was groomed with the Furminator and de-matting tool. Its also great for getting pesky dog hair off couches and throw blankets!",

One negative for me is the ejector button. You pay extra for it, but it doesn't really work. Personally I would've gotten a cheaper model if I had known this. Other then that, we love it!

It's not sharp enough to cut skin...or it wouldn't be a good tool to scrape along my dog's body. Blade is probably not the correct term.

First week I bagged enough of their hair that it looked like a triplet joined us. It gets the hair deep underneath, stuff other brushes leave in. To get the full benefit of both product, use them together. You'll see a huge difference in the 1st day. I used them daily for 1st week, now I use them once a week.",

Overall he loves being brushed and would fall asleep until I got to those more sensitive areas. Once I got the hang of it and was sure to use a softer touch he didn't even notice. It really does leave your animal's coat super soft and shiny and gets a good amount of fur and loose dander.",

I order this tool because of reviews and my neighboor has three dogs and uses the fermenator. I do not know why anyone could give less then five stars on this. I suspect if they dont they work for competitor or they do not use correctly. This is the best product on market that I have used and I recomend anyone to buy this. You wont be sending back!

Even as a short/medium hair cat, this worked on him. He liked it and it cleaned his coat right up. So dogs and cats, the undercoat is cleaned up and their coats are silky smooth and shiny without the shed mess all over the house anymore!",

      "text": "I found this to be a niche brush to get some small items out that are caught in your pet's fur. My dog found it fairly unpleasant as a regular use brush. I won't use it even when she sheds. Also, the push \"button\" feature to more easily remove the fur from the comb part is unnecessary and is a bit of a gimmick. This has a thin comb blade and doesn't really retain fur like a big brush so simply doing a quick swipe with your fingers to remove the fur is far easier than pushing a separate part and still needing to clean the comb part anyways.",

If we furminate every other day, we'll get a handful of undercoat. Also the puppy seems to be loving this comb/furminator. Sometimes tries to chew on the handle but after a bit of resistance rolls over and lets us deshed her belly too. You can see her with the ball of fur we just got out of ger undercoat in the picture.",

This brush removes the loose hair from the undercoat, and the results are outstanding. Less dog hair in the house, less hair in the vacuum. The hair release button is a great feature; helps keep the comb clean and makes for a easy cleanup. The Furminator is a sturdy, well-made product. My dog loves it; he actually sits still now while being groomed. For a few dollars more than regular brushes, I very strongly recommend this tool.",

      "text": "Great product. Haven't had it for very long but seems to work great. I can tell a difference in my Dogs shedding since I have been using this product. I end up getting a full hand of dog hair overtime I brush him. I would recommend this product to a friend. Better price than anywhere else. Serves it's purpose and hope that my wife will let my Cocker Spaniel sleep with us since it doesn't shed as much.",
