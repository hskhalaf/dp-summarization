It is not big enough for anything beyond a slieep/litter cage and is IMPOSSIBLE to easily clean the bottom grate wires. URINE GARDS ARE TERRIBLE! 1 corner of the cage only? COME ON!

A word of caution about the door that opens on the side. 7 week old bunnies were having trouble navigating it and I didn't want one to get a broken leg so I took metal clips (like for food bags) and clipped a towel tightly across the door.

It really makes the difference with the tray and my g.pig loves it, it doesnt hurt his feet at all.",

Pretty easy to clean. Only drawback is that the spaces between the metal grate in the door are much too wide for a rabbits legs and they fall right through. I had to lay a cloth on it for him before he learned how to jump around it. Change the door to match that to the same small grate size on the cage bottom, then the cage will be perfect.",

I only wish the urine guard prices covered the entire perimeter of the cage, but no manufacturer has that, and it's edges are sharp. I just took it out and use chucks /training pads under the cage -works great. I definitely recommend this bunny cage. Great price for a great cage!",

However, this is far too small for my two rabbits to do much other than eat and sleep, and we bought the large cage. It is quite skinny and short. Even if we only had 1 rabbit, I wish the cage was just a few inches larger in both length and width.",

We use it for a Rex rabbit and she has plenty of space for herself, food / water dish and a mat. The pull out tray has been a life saver, not flimsy at all to me. One of the other things I really appreciate is that this cage has a door on the side and a door on top, so I can take her dish in and out without her actually needing to be let out (most of the time she is out of her cage, we open it up in the morning and put her back in the evening). I would definitely recommend this cage to anyone with a rabbit or even a small dog that isn't permanently caged up.Read more 62 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Amy L.5.0 out of 5 stars Great for larger rabbitsReviewed in the United States on February 1, 2018Style: Rabbit Cage | 37L x 19W x 20H InchesVerified Purchase We breed meat rabbits for our family use, and use these cages for our 4 breeding does, 10-12 lb rabbits. We did not like the smaller ones availabe at our local farm store. We can fit a nice sized nesting box, a feed bowl, hang a hay feeder and water bottle, and the rabbit still has room to move around and doesn't quickly become overcrowded with babies, so they can stay with her longer. We hang them, so do not use the black tray underneath, and the wire flooring is perfectly sound. They do rust a bit where the wire comes together, but we have a couple of this model that we have used for several years and they are sturdy.Read more 37 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse JP5.0 out of 5 stars Best 37-inch Wide Cage -- Perfect for Adult RabbitReviewed in the United States on January 19, 2018Style: Rabbit Cage | 37L x 19W x 20H InchesVerified Purchase Excellent product. Francine, my 3-lb American White doe rabbit loves her new indoor Wabbitat condo. This thoughtfully-designed 37-inch-wide rabbit cage is better than any hutch I've made or purchased. Sturdy, easy access from the top, with a front door that opens and swings down; doubling as a ramp for her to hop in and out. The floor wire mesh, with small spacing for comfort, is an inch above the durable and easy-to-remove-and-clean plastic tray -- I place hay over the mesh for her to chew on while doing her business without getting her feet wet or dirty; sprinkle kitty litter in the tray below to absorb odors & urine. The included urine guard works OK, but I had to wrap roof flashing to continue the urine guard all the way around the Inside of the cage, since it is essential for diverting frequent urine overspray. I used an Amazon box Inside the cage with flaps open to the front as her hiding hole. This hutch is also tall enough for her to hop up on top of that box to enjoy an elevated view. :)Read more 26 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse CynTop Contributor: Cooking TOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE 5.0 out of 5 stars Really like this cage from setup to the trayReviewed in the United States on November 4, 2017Style: Rabbit Cage | 37L x 19W x 20H InchesVerified Purchase I had bought this cage from somewhere else. I was so impressed with it that I wanted more and started shopping around for a better price. By far this is the lowest price I could find and well worth the money.\n\nThe size is nice which gives my bunnies room to move around in. I do have bigger outside cages which are great but this one works well for me for when I want to bring the bunny inside. The tray is easy to remove, clean and put back. The cage is very easy to move around from one place to another. If you are transporting a rabbit this is a good cage for travel.\n\nThe setup was very easy as well as the break down if you have to break it down.\n\nI do use a plastic mat that has holes in it that hooks and fits nicely inside this cage so the rabbit can get off the wire. I will add a picture so you can see what I mean. The mat makes it so the rabbit waste can still get to the bottom and clean up is a breeze.\n\nThe only thing I didn\u2019t like about this cage is for those raising rabbits the holes are so big that a kit (baby bunny) can get through the wire. I raise rabbits and this cage is the perfect size for a nesting box with room left over for the mother to still be able to lie down and stretch out. I did add some rabbit wire that is smaller around the bottom side of the cage so the babies can\u2019t get out so this was an easy fix for me. I do not like my expected mothers to be outside and this cage can be taken outside or inside. My husband built a roof support that the cage fits under nicely and it is easy to pull the cage out to take inside. I would have liked this cage better if the end had a door but it really isn\u2019t a big deal I just have to make the place outside longer to place the cage long ways for the side door to face me. My rabbits are for breeding the tray is great but you will want to put some kind of potty pad under it unless your rabbits are litter trained to catch the waste if the rabbit decides to use the pen other than where you place the urine guard. It would have been nice to have that guard all the way around the cage but if you are using it outside that isn\u2019t an issue. If you are using inside I just use woven people pads under the cage which is big enough for the cage with pad left over to catch the urine where the cage is opened without a guard.\n\nThe bottom line this is a great price, great for travel, it can be used in or outside with a roof frame built on. It is roomy with enough room for most rabbits to be able to stretch out in. I do not believe it is big enough to use a litter box but you can give it a try. I do know it is big enough for a homemade nesting box with enough room for mother as well. It isn\u2019t big enough for mother and a litter once the kits get bigger. The tray is easy to remove and clean. I really like the way this is built. It is an easy setup and take down.Read more 24 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Anika1.0 out of 5 stars Update after buying larger cage.Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2017Style: Rabbit Cage | 25L x 19W x 20H InchesVerified Purchase First is the small with a 1.9lb netherland dwarf. Second is the larger with a 7lb Satin angora:\n\nThe tray is WAY too small. And the bar in front of it pulls all the bedding out when you clean it! It's also impossible to clean the bottom grate. It is not big enough for anything beyond a slieep/litter cage and is IMPOSSIBLE to easily clean the bottom grate wires. URINE GARDS ARE TERRIBLE! 1 corner of the cage only? COME ON! Please go to a rabbit supply vendor for a real cage.Read more 17 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Inkjoy5.0 out of 5 stars Great cage for rabbits, have bought again and will do so again!Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2018Style: Rabbit Cage | 25L x 19W x 20H InchesVerified Purchase Great cage. Good construction and the pan fits almost to the edges, farther than usual. If not cleaned daily, it can be hard to remove the little pan as their is a support wire that makes a more full try hard to pull out without pushing stuff off the pan. And the latch is not my favorite, but has not failed me in over 2 years, and multiple purchases of this cage, both the smaller and larger version. Is is easy to set up and take down. I raised the floor to a higher wire, and it is fully removable if you don't want it. I would recommend getting urine guards for rabbits...because they are rabbits. This would be true for all cages. I go to the roofing section of the Home Depot and buy a 8' stip of metal rain guard and trim it to fit so that I have protection on three sides that is all one piece.Read more 11 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse SpecialK3.0 out of 5 stars Rabbit kennel.Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2016Style: Rabbit Cage | 37L x 19W x 20H InchesVerified Purchase This cage is large height wise would've liked it a little longer in length for my bunny. However, it's pretty good quality and sturdy. The tray pan under kennel is a little hard to remove for cleaning and the metal flaps to stop urine is not that great as far as catching urine accidents but over all this is a nice kennel. My rabbit is 6 pounds. She still doesn't like the bottom grate of cage but she's gotten pretty use to it for the most part. Good cage for the price!!!Read more 20 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse See all reviews from the United States TOP INTERNATIONAL REVIEWS \nTranslate all reviews to English Tutu4.0 out of 5 stars They\u2019re okay but...Reviewed in Canada on October 28, 2018Style: Rabbit Cage | 25L x 19W x 20H InchesVerified Purchase I got these for a great price ($40 each) and I wouldn\u2019t want to pay any more than that. I secured the sides with zip ties to ensure that he cage is safe. The smaller size is not suitable for any full grown rabbit. It is no where near large enough. I breed rabbits so the cages are used for young rabbits for short periods of time (for separating young babies from mom/each other before they go to new homes). This is the only purpose I would recommend them for... just for a young rabbit that can gets lots of outside time until you can get a cage that is suitable for them to be in as an adult. They are fine for my use but really don\u2019t recommend for a pet rabbit.\n\n*Edit* I bought and received the larger size. Bought them for $70 plus tax each. If they go on sale for the same price again, I would buy more. The tray on these is deeper which is great and it is a much better size. Two of these cages were bent, making it difficult to properly assemble. The door latches are extremely tight, even after a week or two of use, still hard to open. Although I like the cages, the quality really isn\u2019t the best. I would recommend that the company keep an eye on the door latches and bent sides. I would also highly recommend to make the cages wider... they do not need to be as tall as they are for rabbits, take a few inches off of the height and add to the width, which is necessary for rabbits. I would also highly recommend changing the urine guards... I now have 6 of them and every single one is completely useless. The clips are garbage so I tried using zip ties. Still doesn\u2019t work properly.\n\nCages aren\u2019t without flaws, but I hope that the company will consider making a few small changes in the future. I like the free, quick shipping and the fact that they do have a wire bottom.Read more One person found this helpful Helpful Sending feedback...Thank you for your feedback.Sorry, we failed to record your vote.

Wouldn't recommend for a large breed or a doe with kits, but great for single medium breeds or a couple of dwarfs. I don't recommend trying to fit a litter box in there, the whole point of the wire floor over the tray is to eliminate the need for one. Well-constructed, door clips are a little weird but still secure. My rabbits love not having to use a litter box or sit in dirty shavings, I love the simplicity of just taking out the tray to clean.\n\nOnly criticisms are that the tray could be deeper, and that the urine guard is kind of useless. It doesn't attach well, it doesn't work properly if you're using the wire floor, and it has somewhat sharp edges. Within a day my male was tossing it around the cage so I just removed them.Read more One person found this helpful Helpful Sending feedback...Thank you for your feedback.Sorry, we failed to record your vote.

We take our rabbit camping with us in a trailer, so I need it to fold up when not in use. It is a thinner wire, so I wouldn't say it's for full time use, unless you are pretty careful with it. As in, if you were to lean on it to get up, you would definitely bend the wire. The bottom of the cage is great, the tray slides right out easy and the grate for the bottom is just the right gage for a rabbit. It does rattle quite a bit (because of the latches to make it foldable I know) if you travel with it set up in a vehicle, much to my husbands dismay, but overall it's excellent value for something portable, and can be folded down super slim and hidden under a bed until the next time we need it.Read more Helpful Sending feedback...Thank you for your feedback.Sorry, we failed to record your vote.

The door/ramp makes it very easy for her to come and go. The bottom tray keeps all the \"mess\" away from her eating/sleeping area.
