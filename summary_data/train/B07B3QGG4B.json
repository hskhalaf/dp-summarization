When sized and installed correctly they kept all the snow and moisture out of our boots. They also kept out legs warmer. The deepest snow we hiked through was 12\"+ and no issues. I read reviews from some people that the strap at the top of the leg kept coming loose, so all we did was double back the strap through the buckle after tightening it and we had zero issues. Couldn't of been happier for the price.",
