The 3D feature works although most 3D movies are not worth it not even at the theaters. I like the tv control integration with my time warner cable box and samsung soundbar which connects seamlessly. The tv can not control the TiVo premier box.",

The sound was average, so I went ahead and went with a sound bar with subwoofer with much better result. Only complaint so far is that when using external speakers (soundbar), when you adjust the sound, it pops up an alert message every single time, not a big issue, just a mild bother. Otherwise, it's great!!",

I have international programming which is not upto the mark, so they dont look very nice on this big TV. I dont think its TV fault. HD channels look great.

Gets annoying but this is the Internet connection not the tv so I will upgrade my Internet speed and see if that helps. I'm trying to research a good blu ray player to be able to upgrade and utilize the 3d capabilities but need to figure out which surround sound/blu ray combo to go with. It's a work in progress!",
