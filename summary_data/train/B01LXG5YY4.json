When using miracast, neither video nor audio plays smoothly. It doesn't work either. My requirements for color quality are very low. However, the colors are just awful. It's really not possible to watch movies. Probably it's possible to do PowerPoint with it. But if you are looking for a portable solution for movies, I promise, it's not for you.",

I think this is called speckle, which I had never heard of before. Too hard to return since I'm out of the country, but I do not recommend this projector. The positives: great size, very portable, but I wouldn't pay over $150 - $200 if I knew the image quality before purchasing.",

Tried both Android and IPhone on it, highly recommend it for Android because Iphones limit what you can view on it. I use my old Samsung and can view Amazon prime movies, HBO Go, and other streaming apps. Love that you can connect a speaker via Bluetooth for bigger sound. Recommend for those who like being outdoors. *Picture included is me using my truck door as a screen",
