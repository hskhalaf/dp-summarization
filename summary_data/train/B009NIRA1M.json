There was suddenly a large hole in the blender and pieces of plastic on the counter. I have never had this happen in all my years of using a blender to make shakes. Luckily Amazon is letting me return it (thank you, Amazon). I will never buy another Black+Decker again.",

I try very hard not to be overly negative ever in my reviews, however this is without a doubt the CHEAPEST MOST WORTHLESS piece of equipment I have ever worked with in a kitchen both professionally and personally at home. Being that it is a Black&Decker I expected a much better quality. It actually melted off chunks of the interior near the blade pushing it into the ice and started smoking. This is with 6 pieces of ice! This has NEVER HAPPENED with any other blender I have ever used. I am beyond disappointed in this product. And they should be ashamed for selling it to people!",

It's pretty powerful for such a lightweight blender too. Blended vegetables in broth until smooth. I am impressed but then again, it's a Black and Decker so I shouldn't have been that surprised.",
