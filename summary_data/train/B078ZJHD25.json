I am a PC gamer, and at 1440p, with gtx1080, my games look absolutely breathtaking on this thing. Highly recommend. multitasking, having windows side by side is also a nice luxury.",

      "text": "Great monitor for the price. Doesn't have quite as good of a contrast ratio compared to other VA gaming monitors and the lack of auto turn on when it detects signal is surprisingly frustrating since I turn my PC when I am done using it. That being said the adaptive refresh works great with my RTX 2080 despite this monitor not being G-Sync compatible and the picture issues won't be noticeable to most people. I did have white flashes using adaptive refresh with one game, Borderlands 2, but I'm pretty sure that's because it's an older game and isn't really supported anymore.",
