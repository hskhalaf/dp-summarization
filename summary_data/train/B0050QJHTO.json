The button may push down like I pushed it, but nothing changes.. You have to hold the power button to turn it on or off.

I upped the heat to 410 and there was no difference. I came back and purchased the 1/2-1 inch wand and that size is so amazing on my hair. I would only recommend this size to those with hair past your underarms or if you have hair that accepts curls without issue.",

Adjustable heat so I can turn it up if I want more curls, or less heat to just tame the frizz and add a little structure to the madness. The glove also works GREAT - it fits my hand like, well, a glove and protects from the heat in the event of accidental touching while styling. Also, I think it damages the hair less than a curling iron, and there's less friction and tugging and pulling. 5 stars from this mommy of two toddlers :)",
