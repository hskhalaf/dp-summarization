I put a full load from my 2.1 cubic foot RCA portable washer and was blown away by how well this thing dried. The load included jeans and towels and the thing still dried everything in about 45 minutes. The air did get decently hot, not just warm. Maybe there are some defective units out there or something. I'll update later, sooner if I run into any issues. So far this machine is awesome!",

The best part is that you don\u2019t have to vent it. It just plugs into the wall like any other regular 3 prong appliance. We use this with a small portable washing machine that attaches to our sink. Highly recommend this dryer!",

I wouldn't run this unvented for the sake of efficiency and unnecessary heat and humidity pumped into your living space. The dryer will dry faster vented outside.

Very disappointed with the quality of this product. *** Update *** Had to jump through a few hoops to register, and then request service with Magic Chef via their web site. But after that, they sent out a repairman who found a loose wire, fixed the problem no charge because it was still under warranty. So I am changing my rating from one star, to four stars, to reflect the warranty work done. I would have given it five stars, but the registration and getting through the manufacturers web site was not as easy as it should have been.",

This cycle of on and off continues for hours. There are no clogs which leads me to believe it is a thermal fuse / switch. In addition to it shutting off it now has a horrible loud squeal that I\u2019m assuming is the belt going orbthe drum. It leaves the clothing smelling like burnt hair. Definitely not worth buying if you have to replace parts every few months.",
