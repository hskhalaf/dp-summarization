This will be something that the whole family will enjoy as well as all the boys that come over to the house!!! There are a bunch of games to play and it\u2019s really easy to control with the control panel on the front of the game. It is seriously the best purchase I've made in a long time. If you have a basement and kids that love sports...don't hesitate...this is the best one on the market!!",

Not sure if I wanted it or my kids! My rafters in photo are 103\u201d, balls don\u2019t come close to hitting them. I didn\u2019t use any extensions. Can go up as kids get older. Games are fun. Instructions really aren\u2019t the best, but reference the website pictures and it will all make sense. Took me about 2-3 hours to build. Tools I recommend: 1) Cordless Impact w/ Phillips (Scoreboard Sensors) 2) 4mm Allen Key (Bolt Heads) 3) Philips Handheld Screwdriver (Scoreboard) 4) 8 and 10mm Sockets (Nuts)",

Fabric is good, board looks great minus the dents and the fabric that catches the ball feels like quality but there are a few things that could be done for the overall improvement.

All was good after about a week of playing the backboard arches down so bad, the audio is static and you can't even understand the announcer and the screen flickers, mine seems to have some extreme electronic issues.. unfortunately we had to buy a new one from a local store as we needed it for a birthday gift setup.. sucks this pretty much went to waste and now sits in the garage.. The build and the design is flawless just seems I got a defective one somehow. :(",

Sometimes it would count the ball going in and other times it would not work at all. My husband is a Master Electrician. He said that was either the moniters on the right side or a bad connection in the score pad. These 3 items need to be replaced. The game was delivered and set up yesterday.",

It's only been a few days but the construction seems pretty sturdy, and there are 3 different height settings, mine is set on the lowest position and is only inches from the ceiling and still have no problem playing. Kids and adults WILL have a lot of fun with this game!",

My kids and I have played a ton of games and we will continue to play a ton of games. I highly recommend this product!",

You definitely cannot leave this outdoors if it gets windy because it always sounds like it's guna rip. Other than the time consuming assembly, playing is the most fun!!!",

First, it gives points to the opposite side - thought maybe we put it together wrong. That's an easy fix right... no we didn't put it together wrong. But, no big deal - mentally you know to reverse it for the winner. The bigger issue, it does not keep track of all the baskets. Maybe we are just too good and it can't keep up with us. LOL. But, now we have this big thing in our home and in order to return it, we have to take it all apart.",

The picture in the instructions show attaching the control pad to the side, but the instructions on the web site tell you to attach it in the center. Attaching it to the side will cause you to break the tabs on the control pad. After braking one tab, we have since broke another, thus we just leave the control pad in the center. There does seem to be some scoring inconsistencies, but we haven't figured out the cause. On the positive, it is a very fun game, gives your kids something to do other than play video games.",
