My only piece of advice is to use a back-up to the belt clip. The device is so light it could easily slip off without noticing it is gone. You can buy a \"pedometer safety leash\" with a clothing clip and lanyard loop to make sure you don't lose the pedometer. I speak from recent experience. I will be buying another Ozeri and safety leash from Amazon soon.",

Steps are VERY accurate when walking or running. They DO go up on a bumpy road when driving, otherwise car rides don't change things!

I never could figure out the 12 hour clock set-up, so went with 24 hours (1PM = 13:00) I recommend getting the set-up done right with your customizations before you start a regimen that really counts for a total number of steps over a period of time.

    "description": "Color:RedIntroducing the latest edition of the 4x3sport Tri-Mode Activity Tracker and Pedometer by Ozeri. This latest edition features Ozeri's new Tri-Mode technology with separate walking, running and stair-climbing modes for the greatest possible accuracy based on all exercise types, not just walking. It also features MotionLock technology, to prevent unintended exercise tracking - such as can occur with accidental activation when motion is detected while traveling in a vehicle. Unlike conventional activity trackers that require a preferred orientation to work properly, the 4x3sport utilizes the latest generation in 3D acceleration sensor technology to provide superior accuracy in your pocket or purse, and in any position, whether up, down, flat, on its side, or at any angle. Compact, sleek and slim, the 4x3sport Activity Tracker fits is any pocket and is the ultimate personal trainer. Used by professional 100 mile ultra-runners, the 4x3sport is a comprehensive activity tracker that records your steps, stairs climbed, distance, calories burned and time spent exercising, with separate algorithms for walking, running and stair climbing. It counts up to 1 million steps and includes built-in memory that records your daily activity for up to 30 days. The 4x3sport also includes a Steps2Target feature tracks and calculates your steps toward your daily target, and graphical displays your progress on its bright LCD screen. The 4x3sport filters out vibrations and only begins counting after it detects a sequence of continuous steps for greater accuracy. The 4x3sport Activity Tracker ships with a lithium battery, lanyard, belt clip and instruction manual. Your satisfaction is 100% guaranteed.",
