Well, I don't like the sound one little bit! They sound like old ready-to-be-changed strings. They are dull, they do not 'ring-on' like I would expect high-end string to ring. Only reason I give two stars is because I do like the physical feel; they are much kinder to the fingers and moving from one note to another is smooth and easy.",

However, the strings are kind of hard to press compared to the usual strings that I use. Also, I don't like how it eliminates the squeeky noise when sliding chords and whatnot--makes me feel like I have a silent guitar. The tone is nice and balanced, but not quite bright in my ears. Still giving it a 5 though because they're very durable and clean looking compared to the ones I usually use, which after about 5 days of heavy duty usage it turns to a different color.",

They offer a bright almost whiny tone, very loud and vibrant, easy to hammer on/pull off. Subtle movements on the fret board can be heard that many other strings can't replicate. Up until now my favorite have been D'Addario coated philosopher bronze which are amazing also, but the sound with the elixer is unmatched. My only criticism is one of the strings coating appeared to be separating after only a few days of play. Only on one string, I feel it may have been a random defect. Easy 4 star, 5 if not the coating issue.",

While they are more expensive than regular strings, they are worth it. The quality and durability are unbeatable and for someone who has very sweaty hands, the coating does a great job of keeping your strings clean and sounding great without becoming dull from the acidic sweat. Use only elixir on both my electrics and acoustics, took me years of using cheap $5-$8 string sets before I tried elixirs and instantly found out why people swear by them.",

I've got a nice acoustic that I'm almost half afraid to play hard on...so it's not a case of abuse or anything.

Initially, the strings sounded so \"plasticky\", and I was really disappointed. However, after a week of playing, it started sounding pretty good (still has a little bit of unnatural \"plasticky\" sound). Not sure whether the strings stretched out for better sound or my ears became used to that sound. Still not my ideal sound, but good enough and lasts long time.",

These strings sound coated and the Martin SP's I was using sound so much better. Plus after just one week of play there's material flaking off the strings. If you want a really good sounding acoustic string that's treated to last month to 3 months that doesn't have a coated string then try Martin Lifespan's. I love Lifespan but won't be buying anymore Elixirs.",
