XL should have fit based on the sizing chart. It was to long for me and the neck was uncomfortably high. The neck wasn't tight so It wouldn't seal against water movement. And the waist wasn't tight either. I was going to try a large but the price had increased. It seemed to be well built. Maybe if the price changes I might try the large.",
