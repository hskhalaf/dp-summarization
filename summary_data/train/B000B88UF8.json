The quality is really good and I actually think it looks better in person. I have been using it for a couple of months, and there is no substantial wear visible. The reason I gave it four stars is that the red lining of the bag tends to rub off on items (white phone case, gray umbrella), so be careful with anything light in color. Would highly recommend to the fashion conscious.",

      "title": "Too big and looks cheap",
      "text": "This bag is ridiculously large, made of cheap material, and expensive for what you're getting. I was looking for a stylish and professional bag for school/work (to fit my 13\" Zenbook Prime, notepad, & misc items), but this bag turned out to be gigantic and cheaply made. The croc pattern looks ok, but the way the bag feels is how you can immediately tell the poor quality. Most importantly, it is too big for everyday use. At 5'2.5\" I looked incredibly disproportionate with it and even on my taller coworkers it did not look flattering. As for travelling purposes, why would you want to lug something so large and heavy when you can just use regular suitcases?",

As for the exterior, that's just amazing. The croc texture gives the bag such elegance. Fashionistas will definitely fall in love with this bag. I know I am!!",
