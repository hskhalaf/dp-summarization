I hated to take down my Apple AirPort Extreme router, but I was tired of trying to get WiFi throughout my whole house because I couldn\u2019t find a range extender that did the job, and I tried several. I swallowed my pride and replaced Apple with this TP-Link Deco, and am I ever glad! 20 minutes start to finish, three units on two floors. Easiest setup ever, and flawless. Max WiFi everywhere in house. Speed of WiFi exactly same as speed of modem. Great job, TP-Link!",

But it passes that (incorrect) knowledge along to android devices, resulting in your phone defaulting back to mobile data, your chromecast going berserk, etc. Would return if I could, the most disappointing tech purchases I've made in a long time.",

My wifi in my house was spotty and disconnected me from the various routers and extenders I had cobbled together. I bought this product based off other\u2019s reviews and it didn\u2019t disappoint. The setup of this router can\u2019t be easier. It\u2019s almost grandma proof. The app you use to set things up is super intuitive and very easy to follow along with. The only thing I could see someone complaining about might be the lack of advanced nerdy settings you can have but if you just want to keep it simple and have strong seamless wifi in the house this is an amazing product.",

I'm so glad I did. Install was easy, speed and coverage is flawless now. A week in, the system is stable and fast. We're very happy with the Deco.",

I had to ultimately figure out why the \"governor\" was set at my slower speed. In other words, I had to reset the device in the dashboard so that it would allow for the much larger download and upload speed from my upgraded service.",
