The newly designed can will hopefully eliminate the clogging of the nozzle that the old standard design had. The clogging nozzle was the only problem I had last time I purchased this product, because I used the paint in several small jobs over time If your going to use the whole can at one time this will not be an issue.Shake the can often or you will end up with a half full can of paint with no propellent.",
