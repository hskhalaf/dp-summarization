I've tried all but the largest non-tapered one (yet) and I can't believe how well it curls my hair. I have somewhat resistant hair (pin straight and drab by nature) but this created gorgeous curls that lasted for days! I was impressed. Now to win the Lottery so I can hire someone to curl my hair once or twice a week with this thing.",

The straightener turns unruly frizz and waves into sleek, straight strands, and the curling wand can create tight ringlets, loose curls, or bed-head waves with its interchangeable barrels.\n\nHow It Works:\n\nCeramic is a smooth material that glides effortlessly through hair without damaging snags or pulls. And when it gets hot, it releases a flood of negative ions. Those ions form a protective barrier around each hair\u2019s cuticle, sealing in moisture and shine (and color if your hair is dyed), and preventing humidity from entering if it doesn\u2019t know the secret handshake.\n\nFlat Iron Specifics:\n\n\u2764 100% ceramic plates\n\u2764 Floating plates minimize damage\n\u2764 Heats up within seconds\n\u2764 Even heat distribution means no damaging hot spots\n\u2764 Heat range: 175\u00baF\u2013450\u00baF\n\u2764 9ft., 360\u00ba swivel cord Curling Iron Specifics\n\u2764 Curling wand with interchangeable barrels for a variety of looks\n\u2764 Tourmaline-infused ceramic barrels create even more negative ions\n\u2764 Clip less design makes the most natural-looking curls and waves\n\u2764 On/off switch\n\u2764 LED light indicators",
