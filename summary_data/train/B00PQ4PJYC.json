Also attached some other pictures of this product just for your references. After leaving the comments above, the 3rd party seller contacted me and sent me a new adjusted one for free, which is really good costumer service, so I added 2 stars for them.",

Attached is a picture of the issue I was experiencing with my laser level. Attempting to adjust the laser seated in the plastic case doesn't fix the inaccuracy. Regardless, I wouldn't recommend this product. The customer service also seems to only care about review scores.",

The laser is bright and came perfectly level, and the tape lock works well.

As you extend it further it does become more difficult to keep the tape straight if you're tape measure hanging midair. But you're still getting a solid multitool for a great price so I can't be to critical on it! I definitely recommend if you need something for a lot of small indoor projects.",

I used it to determine/monitor a proper water drain slope/degree when I repaired my patio floor and replacing the gutter. If I had a weak laser projection on a rough/dark surface, I simply taped a piece of white copy paper on the inspection area to increase laser reflection/brightness. Great product!",

      "text": "I bought this to help me in leveling when I hang frames on the wall. I thought the laser beam will do the trick but unfortunately, it was hard to figure out. When I hang a frame on the wall, I hoped that the laser can be used to determine where I will put the nails on both sides of the frame so the frame will be level. I think the laser will be useful only when leveling several frames but not in hanging a single frame. Can I return this?",

The size is great, compact, can be stored in a drawer, glove compartment, tool box. The tape automatically locks when pulled out. Button retracts it. Nice to have the 6\" scale as well. Multi levels make it very useful, but the addition of a horizontal level would make the laser cross hair more useful. Great device.",

Setup is easy adjusting is easy and it pretty solid. I gave it a 4 because the laser just isn't quite enough to use in daylight and be seen easily.

However, I am so pleased with this Laser Level Pro3 that I have to write about how awesome it is! It came with batteries in it and extra batteries for when they die, (a screwdriver to unscrew the battery compartment to install the batteries),2 way level bubbles, a ruler that has both standard and metric measurements, 8 ft of measurement tape and the laser for hanging things is amazing!! And ... it was very inexpensive!! I can\u2019t sing enough praises about this product!!",

I always keep it in the \"off\" position unless I am working. The laser has a decent range and can wrap around room corners at a 90 degree angle.",

In a couple of wall hanging projects in which multiple frames have to line up precisely, I've found it to be inaccurate to the point of being able to see with the naked eye. But I went ahead and verified the amount of variance with no less than 3 different spirit levels. On a horizontal line, it had a variance of nearly 2 inches in just span of 7 feet. That's just inexcusable for anything marketed as a level, much less with the precision of laser. Just can't recommend this item if it can't do the job.",
