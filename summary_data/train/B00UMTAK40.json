It is heavy, challenging to pedal, even downhill, and difficult to steer. They much prefer an older smart trike we have that is lighter and much easier to pedal and steer. This seems like a great concept, but is just not well designed. Has been a complete waste of money and garage space.",

Now he can reach the pedals but cannot actually ride the bike because it's so difficult to push them around.",

We are so disappointed, wasted time trying to get the stupid thing together and it's NOT worth $80. Better off spending more money on higher quality Radio Flyer bike, not Little Tikes.",
