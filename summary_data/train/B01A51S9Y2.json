It's a greener and more cost-effective solution than constantly buying brillo pads. Downside: The rings are very rounded so it doesn't have much of a scraping edge to it. Removing food from a cast iron can take some real elbow grease. Also, it wants to slink down into your garbage disposal, so be aware of where it is before you turn yours on (We haven't done it yet, but we've had a couple close calls).",

They work great for knocking big chunks off of my cast iron and out of my stainless cookware but they don't work well for scrubbing so I always go back to my old stainless steel scrubber. I'm updating my review and giving them a 5 star rating because this company has absolutely AMAZING customer service. Thank you!",

Removes the built up gunk and food residue without much effort. Just put the chain in dishwasher after cleaning your pan. Totally worth it!",
