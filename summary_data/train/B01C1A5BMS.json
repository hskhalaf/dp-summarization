If you are looking for a QUALITY nightstand, that not only looks super stylish but is easy as pie to assemble... this is the nightstand for you. Legs come inside the drawer and all you have to do is screw them on and you are totally DONE. 2 minute job. These are price-wise comparable to something you'd get at Walmart and have to spend 2 hours assembling but these will last you for YEARS. One of the best purchases I've ever made on Amazon, not one negative thing to say. BUY THEM!!",

Just flip the table upside down and slowly screw legs into bottom of the table. We are careful not to have liquid spill on top of them and so far no peeling at surface.",

The drawer has no rail but slides pretty well. For installation, all that's needed is putting the four legs on, which takes no time. Of course, there can be some improvements: the drawer bottom is really thin which doesn't seem to be able to hold heavy items; the edge of the body can be better polished so it's more smooth. But comparing it with some other more expensive ones I bought online, this one is a winner for sure.",
