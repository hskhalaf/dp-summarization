I ran into large rocks (> 8\" in diameter) often while digging a trench. I even used the hoe to pry the rocks from the ground. The blade is solid and did not bend, crack or break.",

I looked everywhere for a hoe like this. My grandparents and parents had this very type of hoe and it is a lifetime tool unlike the junk sold at the big box stores that fall apart after any real work is done with them. This one has a nice manageable weight to it and comes sharpened right out of the box so chopping through weeds or roots is no problem.",
