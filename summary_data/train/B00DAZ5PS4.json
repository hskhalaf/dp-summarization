      "text": "Used this to pull my Kubota subcompact tractor out of a mud bog. Worked great! Only improvement might be a 20 ft wired remote control so i could sit on the tractor and operate the winch. As it was it took two people. A remote would also be safer as it would allow the operator to be away from the \"line of fire\" should something break. Vendor overnighted this to me without my asking, he must have read my mind because getting it a day earlier was a huge help! Overall a great product!",
