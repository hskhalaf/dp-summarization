Is there a way to return this bag or any idea on how to make kibble smaller. Please help! It said medium so I figured it would be perfect but its definitely too large.",

Before, with her old food, she never really got excited to eat in the morning and some days wouldn't eat more than half a cup out of the 1 1/2 she gets each day. But now... she is SO excited in the morning to eat her food, and she eats it all in one go. I am so very happy with this product, that it is not even funny. Oh, and the bag its in is resealable! +++",
