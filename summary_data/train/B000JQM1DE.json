Following trouble shooting directions, replacing needle, type of thread, adjusting tension, rethreading, etc., did not fix the problem. Trying the zig zag stitch resulted in skipped stiches...a mess. After giving away my old machine to my daughter, I am regretfully returning this much over-hyped, super space age contraption. Brother email support was of no help whatsoever. The phone support was kindly, supportive, but ultimately ineffective. Perhaps, this machine was simply defective. I don't know. I'm returning it..",

Mine is fussy about multiple layers of upholstery fabric (like the closing seam on a pillow), so I keep my old machine handy.

My only trouble has been with thread tension--occasionally it'll mess up (such that adjusting the dial doesn't really help) and the best solution is to take the bobbin out and rethread it.

As a result to be able to see the codes in the window you practically have to shine a light in the window.

This is sold as a quilting sewing machine but those specific accessories are what makes it so. Because this machine was replacing an older machine of the same brand, I still had those attachments which were missing. Otherwise I would have returned the machine. I love the Brother sewing machines, you just can\u2019t drop them like I did my old machine! So the 3 Stars are for the machine, a good value for the price.",

I had a Sears Kenmore for over 50 years, still worked great, never had a problem with it, I replaced it with this machine to update...BIG MISTAKE...I want Amazon to replace this matching with an upgrade with the same features and support the machine is in working condition or give me my money back.

So I ordered this one and the top loading bobbin is a lifesaver. The bobbin winder loads the bobbin so evenly. Because it is computerized, it \u201cfreezes\u201d if the material is too thick or if something isn\u2019t right. At first I found that frustrating, but once I realized that it was saving me from damaging ANOTHER machine, I was grateful. The speed adjuster is so helpful and once you get the hang of the automatic threader, it\u2019s great too. I have no complaints about this machine so far.",

If that's not easy enough, this is a very popular machine, I was able to find video tutorials easily on youtube. I've recommended this machine to everyone. You will love it!",
