It's stiff, and it feels like a running shoe. Not good if what you want is something like the F lite 235 v1. This really shouldn't be considered the same shoe. Build quality and appearance is great, so I don't want my disappointment to sway your buying, just understand that this IS NOT EVEN CLOSE to the F lite 235 v1. Otherwise probably a great show for other people.",

I'm a firefighter and do a mix of powerlifting and cross-training, and I would choose these over all the Nike zero-drop heels and Adidas trainers of my workouts past. If you have a longer run scheduled in for your workouts, I would suggest trying a shoe with more cushion/support throughout, but the INOV-8 235 v3 has held up to 6-days-a-week workouts consisting of 45mins of high-intensity jump ropes, rowing, and general kettlebell madness and traditional powerlifting. Super-breathable and supportive for the heavier lifts, despite the tops sitting below the ankle. Highly recommended if this is your first zero-drop heel!",

    "description": "Inov8 F-Lite 235 v3 Training Shoes The new look F-Lite 235 V3 is an all natural, lightweight and flexible training shoe designed around natural movement and upmost comfort. Inov8 Shoe Fit Scale For technical footwear, a good fit is essential to enhance your performance. Inov8's new Shoe Fit Scale makes it easier to find the perfect fitting shoe. All Inov8 shoes are designed with Met-Cradle technology to lock down the mid-foot for a stable hold, where they differ is in the toe box. The shoes are now graded from 1 to 5, Grade 1 representing their closest, most precise fit and Grade 5 representing the widest fitting toe box. The lower the number on the scale, the narrower the fit, which ensures minimal internal movement of the foot when running fast on technical terrain. Shoes with the higher numbers on the scale will suit athletes with a wider foot and those wanting that extra comfort in the toe box. This wider toe box allows the toes to splay for increased stability when lifting heavy weights. It's also perfect for longer runs and races when toes begin to swell. Inov8 have graded the F-Lite 235 v3 Training Shoes as Grade 5. Breathable Mesh Upper Constructed using a breathable mesh, the Inov8 F-Lite 235 v3 Training Shoes allow you to power through any workout. Perforations within the fabric allow cool air to circulate throughout the shoe creating a perfect microclimate for your feet to thrive in. As you build up heat in the gym, the breathable mesh forces out hot muggy air ensuring you remain cool, dry and comfortable at all times. Synthetic overlays also feature on the upper to ensure your feet are protected at all times. The durable overlays increase midfoot support and reduce the risks of wear and tear. An elastic mesh liner hugs the foot for added comfort and support. Completing is an external heel cage which ensures added stability around the heel so you remain support through the toughest workouts. POWERFLOW+ Midsole The midsole for the Inov8 F-Lite",
