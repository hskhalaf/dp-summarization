For a tomato, it was easier to stab it first, then slice. I believe a tomato needs a serrated knife due to its inner softness. I believe the size of the knife is 7.5 inches instead of the listed 7.25,but it really did not matter to me. I like the hard plastic sheath that comes with it to prevent cuts and/or blade wear and tear. For the price, it was a decent purchase for me and I would recommend it.",

Two cut themselves misjudging how sharp the knife was.",

Edited March 2, 2014: Found this item packaged with a similar knife at TJ Maxx for less than $5. Just sayin'. Look around, still a decent product but it can be bought for less.",

I received a free paring knife at our local Sam's Club during a product demo. That free knife cuts so much better than this one. I guess another pro would be that it didn't cost much. The price was low enough that I'll keep it for a spare, it isn't worth going through the hassle of returning it.",
