I like to mix mine with almond milk, a banana, I add in PB Fit powder which also helps up the protein content, and chia or ground flax seed. Overall I'm very satisfied, just wish it had slightly more protein content per scoop. I will definitely be buying more and trying out the other flavors!",

It\u2019s just gross and I\u2019ve tried making smoothies with different fruits to try and disguise the flavor, but to no avail. I can\u2019t even bring myself to try again. I wasn\u2019t expecting deliciousness in bone broth powder, but not something so offensive that I can\u2019t even stomach it. I am used to drinking bone broth and used to probiotic powders and things like that, but this powder just has a bad taste that I\u2019m unable to disguise. I\u2019m so disappointed that I spent almost $40 on something I can\u2019t use.",

Alternatively, a daily 1/4 of a scoop mixed in with flavored cold brew is probably a great use of it's health benefits. On this product, I just feel better and my cracking knees goes away.",
