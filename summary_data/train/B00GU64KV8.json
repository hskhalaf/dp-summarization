Nice storage zipper on the rear of the panel case to store a portable battery pack, flash light (like the switch 10 with flashlight attachment) and can charge while on the go. (open panel, attach the carabineer clips to a backpack and charge accessories while hiking, biking or camping)",

This small one is perfect for charging those small items that you use every day.",

Please see the attached photos I have taken of the Nomad 20W solar panel. One of the photos shows how you can connect the Goal Zero Torch 250 light (sold separately obviously) to it to recharge it. The Nomad 20 seems very well constructed and has a nice zipper pouch in the back to conceal and hold in the power recharging cables.",
