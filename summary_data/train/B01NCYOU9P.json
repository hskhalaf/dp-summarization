No thanks. These make life so easy! They\u2019re really soft- I\u2019ve heard some other brands feel like dryer sheets, but these aren\u2019t like that at all, they\u2019re more like a fluffy Kleenex texture. But don\u2019t worry- in case you accidentally get one in the washing machine they won\u2019t break into a million pieces like a Kleenex would. For me that\u2019s a bit disconcerting since I flush them, but so far no plumbing issues!",

I'm not sure if its the type of material itself or the chafing that caused the problems.
