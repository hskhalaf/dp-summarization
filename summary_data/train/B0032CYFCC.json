      "text": "This is definitely much faster and more convenient than scanning with my flatbed scanner. It feeds pictures through very quickly and saves on SD cards, not needing to even turn on a computer. Great to just scan hundreds of pictures, while you're doing something else, like watching TV. However, where it's lacking is the image quality. Pictures look pretty grainy and colors are lost on the computer monitor. I have not tried reprinting pictures yet. The way I see it, I'd rather have a low-quality copy of my photos than nothing at all. I would probably still use something else to scan your favorite photos.",

After awhile a line started randomly showing up in the scans. I tried cleaning it per the instructions but it made no difference. Also, sometimes, it was hard to align the photo's feeding into the scanner. The positive is it does make scanning large stacks of photo's easier and faster. Using the supplied photo sleeve made it easy to scan odd size photos or photos with frayed edges.",

If you don't clean the scanner per users manual you may get streaks on the scan. It scans easily and quickly.",

It is fast--vastly superior to scanning photos on your printer scanner. Directions suggest putting your photo in a little plastic sleeve before scanning, and if your image does not have clearly defined edges (like a drawing or cartoon without a frame), that is necessary. For most photos, the envelope is not needed. I scanned 50 photos in 20 minutes and only had to re-scan 2.",

I haven't quite figured out how to get rid of those yet. But overall, il Ike it. It does what I bought it for. I want to start scanning family photos. With this little scanner I can sit on the couch and do it while I'm watching a movie or easily take it over to my mom's house and scan some of her pics.",

Not exceptable. The main problem was that the unit was listed as NEW and it clearly was not!!!!",
