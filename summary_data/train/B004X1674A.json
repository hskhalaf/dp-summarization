I am sure that you will be able to fit more weight on there if using conventional weights. Other than that the bar does it's job and I have been very satisfied with my purchase.",

Note if you have bumper plates you will only be able to load three 45 lb plates per side and that is without space for a clamp, and the bar does not have rotating collars, if that matters to you.

Pros: great price, fast shipping, very sturdy, and is a great addition to my home gym.",

And it's allowed me to add farmer's walks to my regimen, and that's been a great addition.
