I bought it for my son who was leaving for Kuwait in the Air Force He went to Kuwait and is now starting classes on line while he\u2019s there but now has no computer. The customer service woman could have cared less. He is shipping the computer back to me but I\u2019m not sure what to do with it since acer is not standing behind their product and doesn\u2019t want it back",

Here's a tip for those worried about not enough usb 3.0 ports on the laptop for oculus users : To have the best oculus performance which requires 3 qty usb 3.0 ports, use the laptop's left side usb (3.0) for the oculus headset and then buy this: \"AmazonBasics USB 3.1 Type-C to 4 Port USB Hub\". This will allow you to convert the laptop's left side usb c (3.1) port to usb 3.0 ports power the rift's 2 usb sensors at usb 3.0 bandwidth speeds.",

I have yet to experience an issue with the hardware or operating system (Win10). The price is slightly higher than what I wanted to pay. However, I am still satisfied with the laptop.",

It took a bit of effort to get the GPU drivers to install properly, but after that, it has worked flawlessly. There have been a few firmware updates since I purchased it, so that might not even be problem anymore. I bought this for my college classes and for gaming and it has handled both with ease, sometimes even at the same time.",

I tried everything for the past 1 year and 5 months to fix this problem but nothing helped. I play the games in 30fps which is not fun at all. even with 30fps, the temperature for both CPU and GPU get high. I am sorry I will not give any star for gaming rating. because this laptop should run the game in 60fps with fine stable temperature after all its called gaming laptop but its not for me (disappointed).",
