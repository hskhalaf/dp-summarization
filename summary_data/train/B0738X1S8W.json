She had one pouch without any other dietary changes and her next diaper change, all of the skin had burn off her booty.

It didn't even taste remotely the same (we taste EVERYTHING she eats). The other flavor we tried was plain pears and it didn't taste right either. Tasted fermented like cider does.

It was extremely watery and thin making it a mess to feed my daughter. I transfer from packet to spoon and this product would spill quite a bit. I would have preferred it to be a bit thicker.",
