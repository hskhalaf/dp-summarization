I can put my iPad mini on the stand (putting the long side in the \"tray\"), and I can easily read, swipe the pages and keep my head propped up with my other hand. I love this!!!

However, it really needs that silicone material on the other leg as well because this product still slides on smooth tables far too easily if you ask me. It's not feasible because of the thinness of the edge and how it collapses together to add rubber feet, but maybe some silicone grip tape could work.",

There are rubber strips both inside and on the bottom of the curved piece that holds the tablet which keep the tablet from sliding in the stand, and the stand from sliding on the desk. The design is functional, universal, clean and unobtrusive, and you can't beat the price.",

I especially like the different notches for upright to more gradual angles for viewing as well as the rubber inside the bottom groove to prevent the iPad from slipping off. Finally, its light weight, compact size, and it\u2019s ability to flatten makes it ideal for travel.",

It's also lightweight and folds when you want to put it away. Very happy with this product.",
