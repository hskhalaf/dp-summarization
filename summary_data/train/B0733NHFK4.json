I came across this scanner and was impressed with its warranty, price point, and more importantly it just seems to work. Granted I have only ran a few hundred scans, but it seems to be solid and; well it works! I gave it 4 stars for now and will review again in 30 days.",

The software is much nicer than the Epson ES-400 or ES-500 as it's meant for business use. It's just simpler and lower profile, which is great when you're trying to pull PDFs into your main business suite. I highly recommend this scanner for heavy volume use.",

However, the software is so bad and cumbersome and the functionality is so low that the speed a advantage won't be considered a real advantage. I decided to return this product and look at something else. The next Fujitsu with a TWAIN driver is around $700. I may have to just get it. I'm very happy with ScanSnap.

After dealing with Dell computers for a week or two, we re-installed the scanner software and eliminated some extraneous downloads. Now the computer works fine and so does the scanner. But it was an enormous waste of time and I never got an explanation from Epson. Anyone else have this experience?",
