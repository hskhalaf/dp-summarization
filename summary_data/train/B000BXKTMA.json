We have an oblong seat and there just doesn't seem to be a good way of setting the potty seat on it just right. Two, and maybe it's a girl thing, the little splash guard in the front could stand to be a little higher. Any slight lean back from our little girl and you end up wearing it. Especially if it's more than just a trickle. Otherwise, it's easy to clean and I like the step stool aspect of it.",

The only con I have and why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is because I wish the blue plastic part of potty was one piece with the seat instead of being removable. With a boy, it's very easy to have to get pee in between those layers and need a cleaning. It just makes it inconvenient.",

I agree with some reviews that the splash guard is low, but it taught my son to lean forward so no sprinkling occurs. This lesson is invaluable since the pre-school toilets don't have splash guards. The fact that it's a step stool too makes it so much more worth it.",

The detachable seat gives her the flexibility to go on the \"little potty\" or \"Mamma's potty.\" The stickers were a nice bonus to help encourage use. I'd like the potty to be a little taller/higher so that it is easier to reach the sink when used as a stepstool. I have this complaint with both potties we own, so I suspect there's some safety issue with raising the height too much (or the issue could be with my sink's height/depth).",

The tabs to put the blue cushion back into the white base are soft plastic and curl or don't fit back into the white handle base very easily. In short, It's not an easy item to clean and the blue cushion is cumbersome.",

It is soft in texture. The descriptions felt a little misleading to me. The seat is more like a soft feeling thick liner.
