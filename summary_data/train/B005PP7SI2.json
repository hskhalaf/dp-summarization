It does everything but make my coffee. The wireless part is amazing. Even our Ipads & phone. And it can print photo quality pictures on glossy, or scan your photo so you can do away with the tons of pictures in the closet. And I think it only jammed once, maybe twice. I've had a lot of printers and this one had made me the happiest.",

I like how the paper stores within the machine and the over all size of it. It practically hooked itself up to my WIFI. Also should be mentioned that it will print in black if that's what you need and having separate cartridges is much better even in the size of the cartridges that come with the machine.......if you don't want the long cartridges. I'm running mine with an iMac and it works compatibly with iPhoto and prints from my iPad.",

The reason I bought it was the ink prices being cheaper but having to fight to get my paper out of the machine well lets say the end don't justify the means. so let summarize. Ink is cheaper, printing is good, performance is lousy at best plan on getting a lot of paper ate up.",
