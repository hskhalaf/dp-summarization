I run in GT-2000 road shoes exclusively and these were spot on for off-road. After running a Ragnar trail race, I\u2019ve gone to 4 stars. Shoes did fairly well is rough, muddy, wet conditions. Good amount of cushion, but they are far from water proof or resistant. Having a layer added to keep feet dry would be nice.",
