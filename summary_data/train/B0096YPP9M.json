In between these missions I've tried other eye makeup removers and they have always stung my eyes and/or not worked as well. This product does a great job removing eye and other makeup. It is also gentle; it doesn't sting my eyes and I've never had it irritate my skin, which is a bit sensitive, in any way. I highly recommend it.",
