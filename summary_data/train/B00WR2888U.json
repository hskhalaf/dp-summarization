      "text": "For some reason Microsoft told computer companies not to make anymore \"net books\" - small, lightweight computers that can be tucked away in a brief case. The only options I could find were a Mac or a Chromebook, neither one of which would meet my needs. Then I found this. It's perfect. At 2.5 lbs it's very light, and also very thin. It doesn't have a ton of speed, but I use it mainly for word processing, and a little light web browsing, and it's fine. The biggest drawback is the tiny SSD. I bought an inexpensive 60 GB SD card, and that helps out. The price is terrific, too.",

      "text": "Not a bad little unit for the price I got it at. Windows is an annoyance, and takes up almost all of the limited space that this unit ships with. Expect to be able to install just a few programs and browse the web. The keyboard takes some getting used to, and feels flimsy. The screen is decent, as is the touchpad. The casing is decent, but not super durable, and scratches easily. I hope to someday put Linux on this, and reclaim some disk space and processing power, but currently support is questionable. I'd put this in the category of a cheap chromebook/netbook, not really a laptop.",

For all intents and purposes, it works great. It can even stream YouTube videos without any problems, but it does tend to get laggy with too many programs running, but that's to be expected given the price and specs. The bezels are huge, which makes the laptop seem like it's from 2010. The speakers are really good and put out quite some volume. Overall, this was a great purchase and my shoulders thank me for it.",

Of course, 32GB is not a lot (especially when the the OS takes up a third of it), but I don't give it a lower score because it still fits my needs as to why I bought it. I'd say the only real \"cheap\" part of it is the power button. It feels like I turn on a toy every time with the way it clicks, but it works so it's not that bad. Runs super smooth even if I only have 2.5 GB left on it (and I do!). Not disappointed at all.",
