This 2 ton jack gives me complete confidence, regardless of vehicle weight, to lift with an extra margin of safety & confidence. My current heaviest lift is the front/rear end of a 1993 Dodge B250 van (6400 GVW). I believe the UJack extra wide front wheel(s) spread provides additional safety and stability. The supplied Operating & Maintenance Instruction Manual provides valuable information for operation. A well built jack that will give years of satisfactory service!
