Sperry should have included this in the product description. Also, there's no padding at all around the top of the shoe so they are very uncomfortable, and the support is poor. You get what you pay for with these, and the low price shows. After returning these, I bought, Sperry's Wahoo CVO Fashion Sneaker, which are great, and cost just $20 more.",
