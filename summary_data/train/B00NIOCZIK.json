Very poor design, I wrapped Gorilla tape all around and that seems to hold them in place. But, a pain to change batteries out in the field if needed.",

While I can see this as a benefit to runners wanting to easily remove it to wash sweat from the band, it's irritating to me when the straps fall off while putting the lamp on. I'm not a runner and use this only for working under cabinets or other jobs where lighting is insufficient. Removable straps don't help me all so I hot glued the slips closed. Easy fix but I don't like having to mess with something I just bought.",

      "text": "Make your friends and other people jealous with this light. It's incredibly bright on high mode, I typically use it in low mode most of the time. Battery lasts long enough for all of my attic or under car work/late night hikes/trail blazing activities that I may need it for. The metal lens housing can get a little hot when you leave it on high mode, so beware!! Protip: use the USB charger when at home for faster charging with a 2.1 or 2.4 amp usb charger, your batteries will charge almost twice as fast. The AC adaptor that comes with the unit is only rated for 1amp worth of current.",

The real key here is its adjustable for the angle its pointing, and the sizeand strength of the beam focus. Above all else...its the most comfortble one ive ever put on my head. I could wear it all day and probably forget i had it on. Also had a red light on the back of it when on, so if anyone were behind you theyd see you i suppose. Update: 01-02-2018 One of the lithium 18650s wont charge anymore. Never dropped or anything. Flashlight is fine but batteries are not up to the task apparently",

For comparison, typical cars put out about 700 lumens of light per bulb on low so this thing SHOULD be brighter than a car. It's not even close. I would guess it puts out closer to 400 lumens but for the price, it's a good deal. It is well made and the adjustable zoom on the light is great. I also like that it can charge with USB.",

I only ever use the slightly less super bright mode because it's quite bright enough for anything I do. Plus it's easy; two clicks on, two clicks off. Which, the button to turn it on and off is very conveniently located and easy to push. I HIGHLY recommend this headlamp, as I believe it may be the best on the market.",
