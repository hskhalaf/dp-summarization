But hey, even if you\u2019re heartless and don\u2019t care about animals, taking vitamin D from wool oils is disgusting...when you can take the REAL, BETTER form...from a friggin\u2019 plant.

The yellow bottle in my pictures is of Garden of Life Raw D3, also 5,000 IU, and they state 1250%. One of the pictures is a food tracking app I use and it calculated 625% as 2,500 IU. So half. Hmmmm.

And for this Vitamin D supplement specifically, I love that it's delivered in easy-to-swallow capsules and paired with coconut oil. The latter point there is important from a nutritional standpoint because since Vitamin D is fat soluble, with coconut oil\u2014a high-fat (and healthy) substance\u2014it's more likely to be more bioavailable to the body.",

I got these because I had low levels of vitamin D in my blood test and I experience SAD in the winter months. I read coconut oil is an amazing healthy oil with great health benefits for the body, so why not try that combined with vitamin D? So far so good! I have been taking 1 pill per day, honestly I don't think I feel a difference with my mood yet, but I will definitely continue to take them! I do feel a bit more energetic though.

I ended up getting a different bottle with a more medium dose (2000 IU).
