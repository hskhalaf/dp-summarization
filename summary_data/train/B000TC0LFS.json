I, frankly, had never even thought about it until I read reviews that said that it had an offensive odor. It certainly is not flowery or perfume-y but I don't find it offensive at all and it doesn't linger on my hair. A word of caution...be conscientious about rinsing, especially on the scalp, or you will have unattractive purple residue.",

Not completely, my highlights do change somewhat but nothing like how orange it would turn before I started using this. I don't like the fact that it contain sulfates and methylparaben, and probably a few other ingredients I'd rather not use but for now this is what my stylist recommends, so I'll stick with it.",

My blonde was a little yellow initially up top which i planned onnreturning to the salon to have it touched up (not their fault went from dark brown to blonde so it was expected) this product brought my hair from a yellow blonde to a nice icey blonde and I love it! I receive so many compliments on my hair too. Wish the scent was better but its not bad!",

My hair is ombre right now and it didn't affect my natural dark brown hair at all. There is a slightly odd smell to the shampoo, but it doesn't linger in your hair. I've tried other silver shampoos, but this one worked the best for me.",
