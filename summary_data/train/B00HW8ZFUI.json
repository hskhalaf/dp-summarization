I was especially concerned with whether they would develop an odor over time and the answer is NO! (I've been very careful to dry them well after using and spraying the inside with tea tree oil.) The gloves have great padding for protection and the wrist straps are very supportive. I was hesitant to spend this much money on a pair of gloves but I'm glad I did!",

As soon as they came, I noticed how flimsy they were. There was little to no wrist support and the padding on the top of the glove was lacking. I returned them and got my money back. For the same price, you can get a decent pair of gloves with better wrist support and padding. I have been boxing for 3 years and I wouldn't recommend these to even a beginner.",

Fantastic for hitting the heavy bag or just light sparring, Really happy with this purchase.",

Punches are so much faster and more crisp. For a 10oz glove there is a lot of padding around the knuckles and fingers to protect from boxer's fractures and if your hand is a normal size there is room for a wrist wrap underneath, which protects the wrists. Great overall product.",

They are a great value for the investment and I would recommend to anyone just getting into it. I don't see a need for beginners to have any of the upgraded/ more expensive models.",
