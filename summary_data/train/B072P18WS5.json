It was easy to assemble.. got it put together in about 15 minutes. I feel like the company could have gone the extra mile and included batteries for the laptop. My daughter was a little sad that the laptop wouldn\u2019t work without them. ***If you get this, please check the stethoscope because there\u2019s a screw in there that wasn\u2019t all the way in and the batteries popped out when my little girl was playing with this. Definitely could be a choking hazard.***",

The material is plastic but not cheap. It is sturdy and very colorful! The laptop is removable and most of the instruments are removable as well. The only one you can\u2019t remove is the stethoscope, which I wish it did because my gbaby loves to listen to everyone\u2019s heart, not just her babies. The crib rocks and fits most of her regular size babies. Very happy with this!",
