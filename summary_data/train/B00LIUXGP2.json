I found this table and it fit everything I needed. I was somewhat worried after reading some of the reviews but had no issues at all. It was delivered in perfect shape with no scratches or dings and was easy to put together by myself. It is real wood and very sturdy. This is a great table at a phenomenal price. I am very happy that I bought this and would highly recommend.",

Returning this item would be a massive pain because of how tightly it was pckaged and of course this peice was one of the last to pull out. Basically just get screwed in situations like this.
