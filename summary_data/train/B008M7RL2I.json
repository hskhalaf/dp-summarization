I easily fit 24 pegs with various items on it and still had room to spare!! Plus it looks nice, customers were drawn to it, and it's very lightweight. The only drawback that I can think of is that once assembled it cannot be broken back down. All in all, I love it!!",

The top has a concave to the center which makes the sign holder difficult to attach. Come on Azar step up the quality!",
