Never has the water been so cloudy as it has since switching to this food by Tetra. In fact, within 2 days after cleaning the tank and replacing the filter and going through about 4 feeding sessions the tank is again cloudy to the point of the fish nearly disappearing. Very disappointed in this product, especially when it boasts on the label it is the Clear Water Formula. We will be returning to the product by Aqueon.",

The Goldfish Flake is their favorite snack in the morning and evening. They\u2019ve become so trained by now that when I open the patio door they just show up with their mouths open bubbling tiny bubbles. They just clean it up when I sprinkle a couple of spoonfuls. After gobbling up any floating flakes, they are digging it up for any sunken bits with their fins wagging cutely. It\u2019s a peaceful scene those pretty fish enjoying their snack. I\u2019ve been feeding the flake last five years, and happy with it as much as those fish are.",

I have never had issues with cloudy water when Feeding these flakes, and my fish gobble them up. Then again they will eat pretty much anything.

That's less than half price for a little more effort; refilling the can from this tub is not a big deal. I use a scoop (or big spoon) and wide-mouth funnel, so I don't make a mess. It takes 2 minutes. I definitely recommend this purchase!",
