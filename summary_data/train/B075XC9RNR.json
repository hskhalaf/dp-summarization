It was obscured a bit, don't get me wrong, but I shouldn't be able to see something like that through wrapping paper which is supposed to hide and cover your gift so it's a surprise.",

I had a little trouble finding a good ribbon match for the peach design. Bottom line, very pleased with my purchased, and the person who received the wrapped gifts, raved about the paper.",

However, it will rip so easily when you\u2019re trying to wrap anything which I guess I expected a higher quality of paper since this was a bit on the expensive side for wrapping paper that will just be thrown away after opening. However, if you are careful and a wrapping pro. This paper might be for you! It\u2019s aesthetically beautiful!!",
