My biggest complaint is the junction box at the end. It's centered, solid, and inset in a good 8-inches from the edge of the bed. You definitely feel it, even with a pad over it. You can reverse it to put the junction under/between the pillows, but you still feel it there too. I would have much preferred to have it in a corner.",
