A little snug but I\u2019d rather have snug fitting outerwear then loose and damaged. Shoes are build to last and look great. Nice material but can be hot at time. Not as breathable as I hoped but no hotspot when walking so I guess they do the job. I would but again.",

They breathe very well and the sole was able to hand multiple terrain. They did start to tear on the front side after 300 miles but that\u2019s to be expected. Great product!",
