This treat bag fits on the strap of my pack perfectly! I\u2019m happy I don\u2019t have to carry the training treats in a pocket anymore. The closure is tight-fitting, but I keep it open just enough to fit my hand in to grab some treats. It doesn\u2019t tip or flip over, so no worries of spilling treats, and it\u2019s the perfect size...not too big, not too small! It\u2019s sturdy canvas (canvas-like?) material. I would buy again!",

Has a drawstring to \"close\" for more vigorous activities however I don't use this function. Very glad I found this and as always, amazon prices blow away the higher prices at pet stores.",

I used this for my reactive dog training class with hot dogs and warm (read wet) chicken meat, and a quick rinse makes it good as new. I only use the pull string day to day fairly loosely, to keep treats from tumbling out. I don't pull it too tight unless the bag is really full, as it keeps me from being able to stick my hands in the bag at all.",

It easily clips to any pocket on your coat or jeans, and it hasn't spilled treats or fallen off yet, but our exercise consists mostly of walks and playing fetch. If you need to clean it, it would probably be fine in the washing machine. If you want to keep stinky treats out of your pockets, try one of these.",

      "text": "These bags are great for training and walking. I feed my dog premium, refrigerated treats, so I find the bag gets dirty and needs to be cleaned about once a week. Cleaning the bag is pretty easy though: just turn the bag inside out, run it under warm water, and let it dry. You won't need to do this is your treats are dry (e.g., dog biscuits). The cord at the top is a little difficult to operate one-handed, so I kind of wish it was magnetic instead. Other than that minor complaint, this is a great treat bag.",

It does take two hands to open and close it, but I've rarely had issues with treats falling out, and I really only need to close it up when other dogs go sniffing at the pouch. Really the only drawback is that I need pants or a belt to clip it onto - hard to use with dresses.",
