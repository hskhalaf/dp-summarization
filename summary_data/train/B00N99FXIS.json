      "text": "It was a great laptop,... until it died on us 15 months later. If you browse the more than three hundred 1-start reviews, they're all largely about the same: an issue with the screen that renders it obsolete. That's what happened to us. We're just outside of the rather humble 1 year warranty, so we're screwed. Reading other reviews, it probably wouldn't have mattered anyways: it seems clear that Toshiba is unwilling to take ownership for this issue with the display and that their customer support is sorely lacking. Stay away from this product. It has lots of great features, but it's all moot if it's practically guaranteed not to last a mere 18 months.",

Arguably, better even than the 2015 model by Toshiba which trades this model's great battery life for performance. The only model I can is say definitively superior is the Google Pixel, which carries a price tag 4-5 times higher. Basically, this thing is a bargain. I use this machine for running a tech startup and for software development. The only applications it could really use would be the Adobe suite, which I use on another system. I do development with machines in the cloud using an SSH client, but Codenvy is a great option for those looking for an IDE (Eclipse).",

Battery life is excellent as can be expected from a chromebook, though slightly less than either of the lower-spec variants. It does everything I need and more, and has completely replaced my windows tablet for daily tasks. Though you forfeit the ability to use Windows desktop applications with a chromebook, you in turn get exceptional battery life, smooth and reliable operation, and timely updates all for the same price as a much less capable windows device.",

I was a little hesitant to make the jump from a Windows based laptop to Chrome, but so far I haven't had any problems. I was already heavily invested in Google since I have an Android phone, and I use Gmail and Google Drive, so the switch just made sense. The \"apps\" for Spotify and Netflix have made the switch even easier. Very happy with my purchase.",

But, as it runs clean and serves the purpose it was purchased for, I'm ambivalent about modifying the filesystem. The display is more than adequate, and sound is surprisingly punchy for such a lightweight system. Build is all plastic, very solid and no rattling or bendiness. Recommended as a step between a full fat laptop and a tablet. I personally find Chrome much nicer than Windows 8.x. It truly makes a computer that you can jump right in and use intuitively.",

Enlarging text on a web page is no big deal, just hit Ctrl+, but the only way to enlarge that microscopic text in the tabs and other controls in the web browser is to change the display resolution. I did that and the screen now looks crappy, which totally defeats the purpose of the gorgeous screen. Wish I could find a work around for that.",

It can take a few seconds to connect to the internet when you open up the lid. Other than that, I love this thing. The simplicity of a tablet but with the form factor of a laptop.

I even had a bottom plate screw just fall out. Sadly, the replacement screen was even more crooked. Amazon's customer service was great as usual. They were even willing to send me a third but even they wondered if it would be any better. Overall a great laptop, but you might get a lemon.",
