They work better than cotton boxer briefs that I have used, but after a full day of walking/hiking I was starting to get uncomfortable. I also tried out Fruit of the Loom \"Breathable Lightweight Micro-Mesh\" that were significantly cheaper, and in my opinion worked MUCH better to prevent chafing. Again, the New Balance worked better than most underpants I have tried, but if you are a chubby guy looking to relieve the burn I would recommend the above mentioned Fruit of the Loom tag free boxer briefs with Ultra Flex Technology. I hope this helps.",

Likes: the smooth seams (don't irritate), the wide waist band (doesn't cut or bind), the fabric structure (stays in place but gives flexibility and doesn't roll up), the breatheability of fabric, the moisture control (dries quick and keeps me drier), the length (doesn't show below shorts, but long enough to feel firmly in place), the design (it has to look nice, right?). As far as size, I am technically in between M and L, but the L fits me great, so don't be afraid to go a little large.",

These are similar to Equipo brand but even better. Waist band is nice and wide, causing no discomfort and doesn\u2019t fold over like many thinner waistbands. A+ product. Will order more colors soon if the pricing stays between $16-20 for two. Price fluctuates, but well worth it when they are priced right. My new favorite underwear for sure.",

Maybe after a few washes it will get better? enlarge the pic and look at the fly before you buy.",
