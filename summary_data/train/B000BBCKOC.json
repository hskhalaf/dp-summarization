      "text": "I have used NeatReceipts for several years and this little scanner really does a great job. Doesn't take up much room and after you are thru using it, just unplug it and put it in a drawer for next time. I save my receipts for a couple of weeks and then scan them all at one time. This really helps when tax time comes as many people find out that the receipts you get from the stores are thermal printed and the information on the receipts disappear/fade after awhile and if you can't read them, that's a problem. This scanner along with the NeatReceipts software can save a lot of headaches when compiling your receipts for the year.",

Large, page size receipts scan very poorly, and recognition of anything but clear, darkly imprinted receipts is weak or nonexistent. Additionally, creating nonstandard reports or modifying memorized lists is cumbersome. Sometimes \"you just can't get there from here\" A \"training\" or \"learning\" feature for logo's, graphics, or receipt formats would be very helpful. Overall however a useful, time saving, but not perfect, product which is probably worth the price paid.",

While it scans and reads the receipts correctly in about 90%+ of the time, once it collects the information, getting that information into the correct Quickbooks accounts is just plainly too difficult to be practical. Instead of giving one a menu of accounts to send the data, it wants to send all the receipts into a single account. That would be fine for a home user putting all charges into a credit card, but it is not sufficient for a business user to have all receipts clumped into a single category.",

At least 75% of receipts scanned are not \"read\" completely or improperly, and I end up manually typing everything into the program. Many businesses now use the carbonless receipts and the customer copy is a light yellow with faint imprinting. Neat Receipts will not recognize these types of receipts - I realize they are difficult but are also a large percentage of what I have to work with. Right now it is gathering dust on the shelf as receipts go into a shoe box, just like before. Can you say EBay?",

Very cumbersome to uninstall old version before installing the updated version. I had to actually delete files from my system registry AFTER uninstalling through windows. After this was successfully done the scanner still did not work. Contacted tech support again. Had to delete more files in the system registry. Scanner still does not comunicate with the software.",
