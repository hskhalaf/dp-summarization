However these are lighter and more breathable than the other ZX 750's, due to a mesh upper. I shall look forward to wearing these in the summer, as the other ZX 750's can get a little too hot for the warmer weather. Great quality trainers with tough soles. I am a size 9 but with all Adidas, I need to get a 9.5.",

With thick sport socks they are a little snug,not overly so making them downright uncomfortable ,but just enough so as you'd notice. With thinner socks they are ok. I suppose they'll wear in with use. Maybe should have ordered a half size larger ? But overall am quite satisfied with the deal. Good product and a good price and quick delivery. Rating 5 stars because the only problem was of my own making,nothing wrong with the shoes themselves.",
