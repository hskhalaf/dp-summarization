I hope this lasts longer than other Leviton products I have used.

I chose the most shallow TV mount I could find (why would anyone choose a mount that jutts out more than it absolutely has to?). The flush mount would give too little clearance for the tv's power cord... Well not with this baby. 5 minutes of work and problem solved.",
