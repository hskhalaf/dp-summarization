Luckily I read through the instructions completely and saw that ProDental will offer to shave the mouth guard down to about 1mm thickness all around for free if you mail it in to them. They even pay to ship it back to you! I just got mine back in the mail today, and now its PERFECT! Thank you ProDental.

Easy to form fit following the youtube instructions. As far as comfort, I have not tried any others so I can't compare, but with enough care with the fitting and then adjustments with scissors, I am able to get these pretty comfortable.

      "text": "There are not enough words to express what a wonderful experience I have had with this mouth guard. After watching Dr. Colin on the video I still (in my clutzy manner) managed to mess up all three guards. I called the provided 800 number and the phone was answered by Dr. Colin. Without hesitation he sent me 3 new guards. I have been able to successfully make an impression of my teeth and it is a perfect fit and controls my night time grinding. Do yourself a favor and purchase this product. The price is right! And the customer service is like you seldom experience in this day and age. Incredible!",

      "text": "Great deal on 3 mouth guards. Dentist quoted me $500 on a custom molded mouth guard to protect my teeth from grinding while I sleep, insurance denied the claim, so instead of dishing out WAY too much cash, I bought these at about $29. After about 2 weeks, these mouth guards have proven themselves effective. I have not been waking up with headaches from my teeth grinding, and the mouth guards were very easy to mold (just followed the included instructions). Not sure at this point how long each guard will last, but I'm sure these will end up being much more cost effective down the road versus dentist's guards. Money well spent.",
