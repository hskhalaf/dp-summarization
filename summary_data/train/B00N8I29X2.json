Either way the battery does last a long time so the second battery isn't actually super necessary unless you need the power drill for your day-to-day work of course. We've been using this drill almost every other day over several weeks while doing light renovations at our house and it has been great to use. We actually had someone come over to do some work for us and he brought his own drill but he ended up using ours instead because he liked it better! Highly recommend!",

I\u2019m surprised how little real torque the drill has for an 18V. Battery strength and especially life is surprisingly short as well. I rarely used the drill after the first because it\u2019s a waste of time. Very disappointed. Would return but I\u2019ve had it too long.",
