I also have a 660# one that\u2019s great for moving boxed furniture. My daughter and I have moved some pretty heavy items with these carts by ourselves. I gave 4 stars for maneuverability because it helps with really heavy or tall items to have two people, one pushing and one guiding the front of the cart. Only problem we encountered was elevator being broke during one move and having to use stairs. But we did use cart to roll to and from stairs. Great for flat services!",
