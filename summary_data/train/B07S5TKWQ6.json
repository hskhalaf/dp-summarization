If I buy another one it will be a 14 inch as 15 is a bit wide to be sittin in an armchair friendly. Also my readin eyesight is hopeless and the Acer keyboard is a bit feint. Although it's easy to plug in any deluxe keyboard as it will be quickly recognised So overall a good do. Phil M",

Battery life is adequate - I think probably about 5-6 hours of moderate use. Build quality is reasonable for the price. It's all most people need for day-to-day browsing and email etc. If I didn't use PhotoShop heavily, I think I could probably get by with one for myself as a primary machine.",

    "title": "Acer Chromebook 315 CB315-2H - (AMD A6-9220C, 4GB RAM, 64GB eMMC, 15.6 inch Full HD display, Google Chrome, Silver)",
    "description": "Style Name:AMD A6, Full HDFast boot times, ease of use, tough security, a long battery life and the ready availability of Google Play are some of the advantages of Chrome OS. A fast boot time gets you working quicker; the simplified interface is easy to learn; built-in malware protection stops viruses; and it has efficient power use so the power adapter can be left behind. The stunningly elegant Acer Chromebook 315, with its 15 inch screen and 10-hour battery life, is the ideal replacement for a desktop. The large screen and upward facing speakers also make it perfect for watching videos and video conferencing. The 15 inch screen provides users with the ability to easily watch videos and make conference calls. The wide viewing angle IPS is ideal for sharing with friends as they gather round to watch videos or join in the conversation. Keeping in touch with friends and family is easier with a wide Field-of-View HDR webcam. So that more than one person doesn\u2019t need to crowd around a tiny camera, the extra wide 88 degree lens will capture the entire room when you\u2019re keeping in touch. With a battery life of up to 10-hours, this Acer Chromebook is designed to stay at your side all day. With a battery that\u2019s been designed to work all day the charger can be left at home so you have less weight and bulk to carry around. For clearer sound quality, speakers on the top mean sound isn\u2019t muffled by laps or desks. Now you get the full sound from the speakers as the acoustics aren\u2019t hindered by objects being in the way, so you can hear sounds as they\u2019re meant to be heard. The AMD A4-9120C APU offers superior speed for web browsing, office applications and web gaming. An APU is an accelerated Processing Unit and combines both a CPU and a GPU. A single connector can be used for ultra-quick data transfer, video streaming, and battery charging/power. Acer Chromebook 315 has two of these reversible USB 3.1 Type-C connectors which are the same at both ends and on both sides, so it\u2019s easy to attach. USB 3.1 is 10 times faster than USB 2.0. With Chrome OS you can still use your favourite software. Traditional office productivity programs like Microsoft Office and Skype have Chrome versions, as too do Facebook and Instagram. And if your favourite isn\u2019t there you can download many more equivalent programs from Google Play.",
