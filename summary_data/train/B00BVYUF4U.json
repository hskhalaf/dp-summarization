Does the trick, stops your ankle from rolling and spraining. I sprained my ankle skateboarding, and I'll put this on sometimes to prevent further damage, and it doesn't feel too invasive. I do recommend maybe wearing two layers of tall socks on your foot though, to help with compression to keep swelling down, and also soften the feeling of the brace.",

I'm looking for a more rigid brace that the sides won't flex to the sides like this one did.",

This brace is easy to use and very light-weight. The only minus of that model is that after some time of usage (half in year in my case) the joint makes squeaky sound which, I believe, can not be removed by applying a grease. All in all this is the grate durable brace for the active people with some ankle troubles who want to be in game.",
