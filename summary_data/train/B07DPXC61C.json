Yeah not really worth the price but the bowls are ok just can\u2019t put them in the frame or take them out u less they are empty otherwise they throw the contents all over .... so yeah maybe not so much.",

Just think about what you got when you brought home that new addition. And, then had to run out to the big pet store for something you forgot. This is just the cutest and actually pretty practical gift.",

I do find the price rather high, but I don't know how much everything would be if it were purchased separately. Overall, a nice set.",
