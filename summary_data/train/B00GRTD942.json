I was getting tired of spending hours unclogging them, so I did what people do and did a quick internet search for best toilet plunger, and came up with this one at the top of multiple lists. So I risked it and ordered it. It has been great. The handle makes it easy to use. The design makes it create a tight seal on any of our toilets. I never thought I'd take the time to write a review for a plunger, but this one is so great, I just had to.",

First of all it has a fantastic handle, especially the grip on the top where you can really get your hand around it. But you don't need that much force, because this thing is so well designed that it creates tremendous force and after a couple of pushes, the toughest of clogs swirl away.",
