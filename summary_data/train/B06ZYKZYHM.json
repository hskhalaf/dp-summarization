I personally didn't enjoy the feeling of the material but it didn't soak up water and seems like it will be easy to wipe clean. I liked that it folds on itself into the little handle. I bought it to leave in the car so that made it compact which is convient. Unfortunately I had a bit of a difficult time trying to fold this the correct way. It took me multiple tries to get right and doesn't include folding instructions. Overall though I recommend this blanket. I hope this review was helpful",

Trust me, it makes a huge difference. You may as well sit on a plastic tarp or plastic bag.
