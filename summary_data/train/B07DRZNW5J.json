I put over 600 miles on my first pair and only now have to replace them because the soles are wearing thin. But the rest of the shoe is holding up great. And in the winter my feet never get cold in them . They are very cozy in cold weather but not uncomfortable in hot weather. Sorta like MAGIC ! And they are very light weight so it doesn't feel like you are dragging weights around on your feet. I highly recommend them for anyone who loves to walk long distances every day.",
