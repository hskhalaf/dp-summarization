      "text": "So disappointing. I bought this to carry around when not using my DSLR but the quality of the test shots were so poor that frankly I could produce better with my phone. The good points - fantastically compact, great zoom range and it has a viewfinder, albeit very small. The downsides are the picture quality and the generally insubstantial feel of the build. I returned it and have bought a Lumix LX100 - great lens, bigger sensor far better viewfinder but shorter zoom range. You pays your money and takes your choices - for me the Lumix is far far better.",

If I were to be picky, the only negatives I have encountered so far: (1) concerned that the manually popped-up viewfinder and flash may be a bit fragile; (2) very tricky to find right settings for optimum focus, especially for macro (same as every camera I have had!); rather non-intuitive manual and on-camera settings. But overall, this would be a good purchase for a bridge camera with powerful optical zoom (and good image stabilisation even at full optical zoom of 20x) and highly customisable.",

There is no way to dislodge this dust on the lenses unless you strip the whole lens barrel down which requires expertise.",
