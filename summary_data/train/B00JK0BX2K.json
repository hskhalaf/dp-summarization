I didn't give it 5 stars since my other cat who enjoys vertical scratching on my furniture has not yet been attracted to it, and this was the main reason I made the purchase. Maybe he will in time. I am noticing a fair amount of cardboard flakes coming off as it is being scratched which can easily be swept up but wondering how long the product will last with this occurring.",

They always try to scratch any cardboard that comes through the apartment, so I figured they would like this and I was right. The only downside is that it kind of has a weird, chemical-y smell when you first take it out of the plastic, but it goes away pretty fast. Both me and my couch are thankful for this scratcher!",

The grooves are also handy because they make little pockets for hiding cat treats. I randomly leave treats for her near the top. My cat never knows when a treat might appear on her scratcher, so she checks often...a good thing! She now scratches this instead of the nearby sofa.",

They are great, only the cats can destroy them quickly and there is always debris on the floor or carpet. Saw this vertical 3-sided, very sturdy, vertical scratcher and decided to give it a try. It arrived today. Sprayed cat nip on it. Waiting to see what the kitties do. Wish us luck!",
