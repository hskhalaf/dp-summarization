I put two strips side by side for the first time to give the maximum effect, but I found immediately that one piece was just good enough to keep nasal passage open. I like to give them 5 stars.",

I wouldn't recommend it if you have a very sensitive nose or sensitive skin in general, because it holds on tight and does hurt a bit to get off. Its definitely worth it to me though.
