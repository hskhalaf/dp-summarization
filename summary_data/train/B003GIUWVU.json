Honestly they are the most comfortable footwear I have ever worn including sneakers and boots. Also, what struck me as so incredibly odd is how awesome they regulate temperature. In 70 degree weather I'm not hot in them and in 10 degree weather I'm not cold. All with basic cotton socks. If these ever go on sale.i might have to buy a few eztra pairs for presents. They are that awesome. I have not tested them in water but gore text doesn't lie. Best boot ever hands down.",

The fit was great and there were not hot spots or discomfort. The first hike I did was about 8 miles with 2500' elevation gain. The boots did great, and the extra plastic support definitely saved me a twisted ankle and I was hiking down some rocky terrain. The sole is a softer rubber, and it is not the grippiest boot, but I think this adds to the comfort. Walking over sharp rocks did not over contort the sole.",

Quality seems good, I'm just worried about the tread depth being somewhat shallow and them wearing down.

I don't think it was a big deal otherwise he would have probably said something more about it. Overall, these seem like good waterproof boots. The fact that they might be a little warm will be helpful when we are hiking in cold weather.",
