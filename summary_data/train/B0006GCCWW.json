Cons: the cable is too thick and to heavy, explains also the good soundquality. The noise isolation is non existing, so when you are alone, these will give you the best soundquality ever heard before, when I am not alone I use my Bose headphones, which are better noise isolated and with good sound!!!!! Although I miss the SR125i sound immediatly.....",

      "text": "I bought a pair of these to stop my son borrowing my Grado 325's. It worked. Mainly because I hid my 325's. Comparing $150 to $300 headphones should be easy right? Actually it is - the 325's are much better. Maybe 25% better. Easily worth the money to me. If you only can spare $150 then the 125's are really good. Just don't kid yourself. If you could stretch to $300 I would personally pay the difference. It's a couple of nights out or an expensive restaurant meal. The 325's are worth the extra. Someone will tell me I should have bought XXX - and they are probably right - but I can only tell you my experience.",

Especially if you are a fan of jazz, classical, rock, reggae, opera, but even Hip Hop sounds amazing on these cans. But don't take my word for it listen for your self.

The headband and earpeices are connected by metal height adjusters, which adjust the height of your head with the center of your ear. These nifty adjusters also allow the earpiece to rotate a full 360 degrees, permitting them to lie flat on a surface--perfect when packing in a suitcase. The SR60s come with Grado's new earpads. The new pads are a soft, porous, open cell foam that covers the driver-- much more comfy. The SR60s offer good sound quality, plus are easily driven by the output of a portable player or inexpensive home equipment-- a nice combination. They come terminated to a mini with a 1/4 inch adapter and have a straight cord that attaches to both earpeices.",
