It comes with a chocking warning and for good reason. The powder turns to a gel and expands when you take it. The crystals make the drink a strange gritty taste and hard to swallow. The drink tastes fine but the texture makes it hard to enjoy. While we will probably try the brand again we will make sure we get the one with a pill at night instead of the drink.",

      "text": "Started this in combination with moderate dieting meaning no pork and I didn't stuff my face...incorporated green smoothies twice a day, started the ACV drink, and increased water intake (tried a gallon a day, whew!)...works wonderfully if you make minor changes. Didn't weigh myself but I definitely felt lighter and more energized. No emergency bathroom breaks just when I did go...it empties you. Will buy again!",

Made me feel sick whenever I took it to the point of nausea and the final straw my stomach bloating up like I looked 5 months pregnant! Not happy at all with this was a waste of time and money. I have better cleansing results doing detox drinks than this. DON BUY THIS PRODUCT.",

There are big pills that you have to take during this cleanse, you have to take them 5 at one time, the fiber drink is not nasty but it is grainy. another waste of money SMH,",
