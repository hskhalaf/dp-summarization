Screens are great and the picture is phenomenal, sounds is okay but they're monitors (so, you'll need separate speakers if you want better sound), the picture is great and they work well. But super disappointed someone created an adapter that can be bought separately to mount these but each adapter is over $30 each, so, you're better off buying monitors that can be mounted....if you plan on mounting them. I'm returning mine but here's a link to the adapters for mounting them",

The 24 inch had a slight yellow /pinktint to all the whites which I absolutely hate. The picture isn\u2019t horrible by any means but I could have bought a Samsung for the same price.",

It arrived as it should, had a great price, and is so much more detailed with GREAT color (or colour, if you're in the U.K. :) ). I am pleased with the ability to reduce the blue light setting.........and did I mention the wider screen from my previous is jaw dropping. With all this \"wow\" I just hope it lasts....... :)",

      "text": "Installation of the stand into the back of the monitor was a huge challenge. I had to call the manufacturer, and even the supplied videos did not make clear how to accomplish it. Essentially the pieces didn\u2019t fit together properly. Eventually with some adjustments using pliers and elbow grease I was able to get the pieces together but it took hours of my time and was really frustrating. Now that it is up and running, I am very happy with the quality of the monitor but gave it a 3-star overall review because of the difficulty and delays in assembly.",

The logo itself looks like written in Times New Roman in Word and placed right in the center of the stand and the bottom bar. The bottom bar itself would look 1000x better if it would be black. But the design isn't really the main feature of this otherwise fine monitor. It's main advantage is having displayport and being fairly cheap. Would buy again.",
