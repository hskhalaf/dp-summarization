It's light and pretty easy to put on. We took off the strap that goes over the top of his head as it doesn't seem necessary and slides to the side, and just kept the muzzle attached to his usual collar, so that it's easy to put both on at the same time when he leaves the house. It's unfortunate our dog needs a muzzle but for now, it's a good way to prevent him from getting too protective around strangers.",

      "text": "Tried this on my Chesapeake Bay Retriever in size 5 and its too small, not enough room for panting and narrow so it rubs on the side of his face. Of course it works for short durations but not good if he were to get hot or exhaust himself cuz he can\u2019t fully open his mouth to pant. The rubber basket is really thick and bulky looking though so sizing up would probably look hideous, so I\u2019ll probably go with a different style of muzzle next, maybe leather or biothane.",

I like that she can get her tongue out through the bottom for treats, etc. The only downside is that it definitely wears on their skin and if she had to wear it for any extended amount of time, she'd likely have bald spots around her nose. But we only use for trimmings, so it shouldn't be an issue.",

      "text": "This device was suggested by a trainer who also works with humane society dogs. We adopted a 1.5yo maremma (huge livestock guardian dog) that is very mouthy and likes to use his teeth (gently) to play. Obviously this is a huge issue, big dogs that use teeth can be really scary. She suggested we keep this on him whenever introducing him to new people or during times that he would normally use his teeth to help re-train him to stop doing this. It's working and we have some relief from the intensity which means we have more energy for positive reward training.",
