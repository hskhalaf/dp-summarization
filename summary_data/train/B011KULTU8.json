      "text": "Seem to be a very well made set of earphones. Great fit once you've played with the various plugs. I don't know what it is but sometimes they sound bass light and other times the bass seems a bit overpowering. Is there a certain frequency where they fall down? I'll run them overnight as one reviewer said there's a point where it all falls into place after a good run in. I've reverted to my Philips Fidelio SB2K's at the moment as these must be the best sub \u00a3100 earphones around. An add-on. As stated by the other reviewer they need a good bed in to come into their own. Certainly worth the wait though.",

I have bought a few earbuds before this including the RHA T10i and I returned them all, I will keep this one after I tried all the others. It is worth every penny and it is durable too. The sound is revolutionary and much much better than the previous version T10i, and it is easier to hold on the ear and lighter for they replaced the metal cable with a light rubber cable.",

This gives you everything if not more with sound quality, noise cancelling, options to customise your earphones and my favourite, no sound leakage! I have the base filters in and they sound superb. They are comfortable for all day wear. I would recommend buying and trying. You won't be disappointed! If you are, just return them. Best Buy.",
