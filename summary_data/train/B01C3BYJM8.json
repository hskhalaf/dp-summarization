I took note of its name - and ordered one from Amazon. You would think that something as simple as a shoehorn should be easy to make to function well. Most of what I tried before had shortcomings IMO. This one has none. For me its just the right length, weight, stiffness and shape.",

I have personally been responsible for the bending and breaking of numerous shoe horns throughout the years and have always searched for one that was up to the challenge (6'5\" , 275Lbs trying to squeeze into a tied shoe). This product deserves 5 starts not just for doing what it claims but really for delivering under extreme conditions. I can proclaim that my search is over and this is the one that is truly \"heavy duty\". Highly recommend to all that have bend a shoe horn before.",

I ordered the 2nd one because the 1st one went 'missing' while my 70 year old brother was visiting (wink, wink). I am 57 and hate trying to pull on my boots, leaning over and struggling with their snug fit. The shoe horn makes getting my boots on a breeze. I'd highly recommend them to anyone that wears boots (or shoes that are difficult to get on)!",
