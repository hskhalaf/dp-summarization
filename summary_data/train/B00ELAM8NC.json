At one point the right earbud stopped outputting sound correctly, luckily I had purchased the 3 year warranty. I contacted support and within a day a replacement pair of earbuds was on their way.",

The metal housing gives me confidence that these are going to hold up well to the wear and tear of daily use. So far I've been using these daily for two months and they have held up very well. Fit and comfort is great. I like the dual flange transparent tips because I like to take them in and out a lot while I'm at work. The foam tips work well too. Sound quality is very good, especially considering these are widely marketed and sold in airports etc. These are much better than my old Bose q20i's which were much less sturdy.",

The cable material is very soft and after repeated fatigue, it will start cracking. I'm not talking tight winding either. I treated these with the utmost respect. Also, don't expect RHA to do anything after your warranty is up because they won't. I guess they think that a year or so of use is worth $130. I'm not so sure.",

The problem is I can only use these when I'm not moving due to the wiring cover being pulled away from the connector and exposing and offering no protection to the wiring. I fear pulling the wires off the connectors and ruining them. I must admit I am very surprised due to the quality, but for the cost I am a little disappointed and sad as they made my daily walks much more enjoyable.

At about $100 these should be an automatic purchase for anyone who cares about quality audio. It is said MP3 tunes with earbuds are generally low quality audio, but these RHA's turn that 180 degrees. This rivals what I get in my car for about 1/15th the price. Highly recommended!!",
