      "text": "My wife loved this GPS sports watch, but like so many other purchasers we have discovered, within two months the micro USB port failed and the watch will now not take a charge or sync. We contacted Polar Customer Service for a replacement, but that will take a few weeks. Who wants to pay so much for product that is obviously defective in design? Polar should recall the M400 and give purchasers a product that works. Those of you looking at the new Polar A360, beware. The A360 has the same micro USB port and could be just as probe to failure as the M400.",

I use it to train for triathlons as well as get info on distance, duration, and altitude gain during hikes. I used to wear a sunto core most days and planned on this watch just for use during training but it has become my everyday wear watch as well. It also pairs with Bluetooth on iPhone so you get text and call notifications.",

Guess what. It breaks...even if you are trying to be careful and attentive to the problem. Once it's broken, the watch is useless.",

It went straight back in the box for a return and I bought a Garmin Vivoactive instead. Don't make the same mistake I did - it is less expensive than comps like the Vivoactive and FitBit Surge because it's not as reliable to sync with your phone.",

The fitness stuff is ok. No vibration alerts and no heart rate tracking while asleep, like many fitness trackers do. Polar Flow is a good app and the online data tracking is very good.

      "text": "Have had watch since mid-december 2014. Worked great, love the features etc. By April 1st GPS stopped working. Did factory reset, synced, shut down computer with it plugged in and rebooted as suggested by CS. GPS stays at 0%. Said stand still for signal, left on for 9 hours and still doesn't work. Hoping CS can get this resolved as spent good money for this watch",

      "text": "I've had the apple watch and the fitbit watches and this one blows them both away. The best thing about this watch is it's battery life. I've only had to charge this watch once so far within 3 weeks. It has modes for HRM, alarm, type of workout and diary. This watch will also sync with your smart phone to upload the data to flow.polar.com where you can keep a diary of your fitness progress. It's almost like playing a game but instead of leveling up a digital character, you're leveling up your body.",

There are no facilities in the USA. Very disappointed and will not be replacing with another Polar product. Go Garmin!",

I also find the display to be very readable. Only downside is that I believe it takes a little too long for the GPS to link up, although I say this without having anything to compare to. I'm very happy with the purchase. Very good value",
