      "text": "Really like this product. Our esthetician uses a expensive enzyme treatment. I looked up the ingredients online and saw the active ingredient was papaya. I found this for $11 and thought it was worth a try. It works great. Mild fragrance and a little tingle. Cleans pores and leaves a glow. Use it several times a week.",
