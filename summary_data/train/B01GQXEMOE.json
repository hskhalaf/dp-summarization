The glasses and attachments worked well and were a big hit. I saved all of the glasses for next time, they're well made and can definitely be reused. The only downside is that there's no indication of the colors and it's very hard to tell before activating them.",

There are 7 colors: yellow, green, blue, purple, pink, red (pinkish red), and orange. There were most of yellow and orange, followed by pink and green. There were least of the purple (looks light pink before snapped) and blue (looks clear before snapped). Adults can wear the glasses but they don't stay on as well as they stay on people with smaller heads (the legs barely reach adult ears). The 8\" glow sticks allow flexibility to make bracelets, necklaces, headbands, or whatever else you want to make. I highly recommend.",

Thought sticks would be longer for one piece necklaces but that's my bad since pictures showed otherwise. Not all glow sticks are as vibrant but colors are pretty.

We had a dozen very disappointed girl scouts as a result of these defective glow sticks.
