I've since found the stock and updated official Buffalo firmwares to be excellent and support all of the features I have been looking for. 802.11 AC is extremely fast, but its range is limited - this can be made up for by utilizing the 2Ghz 802.11G and N antenna. It supports guest networks if you want, or you can treat your 2Ghz/5Ghz ranges as private and guest. The hardwired gigabit speeds are as fast and reliable as you would expect them to be. With this router, my wireless devices on the 802.11N or AC bands can easily utilize the full 50Mbps of my cable internet connection.",

I was not able to configure the NAS' Cloud feature with the Linksys but it was very easy to do with the AirStation. The price at Amazon made it a no-brainer compared to any other model.",

I decided to replace them with this model, and all of them have been working great over the last 6 months. I'm really only using dual-band APs these days because they provide so much better avoidance of congestion on the 2.4GHz band, and this is a good box for the price.

I was able to verify as my cell and tablet will both log into the upper band. The only thing prevented me from loving this unit is the WiFi range. I was hoping this router will resolve the WiFi dead spot in my house but it did not. I had to purchase a separate range extender.",
