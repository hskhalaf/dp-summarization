I worry with less expensive suitcases that the handle will be flimsy or not long enough, but this case works perfectly as a carry-on, and I haven't had any issues. I was really impressed with the quality considering the low price tag! I have only used it twice so far, so I can't really speak to how durable it is yet, but I will update the review if anything changes.",
