I've assembled bicycles, trampolines, toy guns, Matchbox sets and more. I've also built a ton of plastic model kits of my own. This is not a toy. It's a kit. Every piece that could possibly be shipped disassembled, is. It wasn't just about shipping it, it was about the factory saving labor hours. It wasn't difficult to assemble, just time consuming. If getting this for a child as a present, assemble it the night before and put the assembled version in a box.",

I put it in her room with a scene like animals are boarding on the plane, she loved it, she just turned 6. The pink upper lid is a little bit difficult to open, but it`s not a big deal, overall it worth it as it is so much fun to play with it and all the accessories it comes with. If any part like tail often fall out I will hot glue it, but this set is awesome!",

If they falls apart with us handling them, what would happen with two little five-year-olds? I called Hasbro and they said they would replace them with an item of the same value that THEY get to choose. Come on, Hasbro. They've struck out in my book!!",
