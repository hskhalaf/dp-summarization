      "text": "Got this \"switch\" to be able to move my wireless router to a different area of the house while keeping my other devices next to the computer. Had issues with the network immediately and after replacing the router (due to thinking it was broken), and the modem(due to thinking it was not functioning), and spending the weekend troubleshooting issues found that the \"Switch\" was in fact a split that would only allow one device internet access at a time. After replacing the \"switch\" with my older wireless router the system worked perfectly... so thank you TrendNet for driving up my $60 router move to a $250 system upgrade..... wont be having this switch in my house.",

The time it takes for the two personal computers, both plugged into this switch, to communicate with one another is just 1ms. That being said, I genuinely recommend this switch.",

The difference between this version and the picture is that the power supply plugs in on the side rather than the back. This may be a problem for some configurations but it was fine for mine. I just bought another one for my office, great little switch, plug and play 1 minute setup",

I still use WiFi for phones, tablets and such but I think there's a benefit from not having everything share WiFi. Don't do wireless what you can do wired is pretty much my tech mantra, unless you can't hide the wires. :)",

The cost really can't be beat either, so I can't think of too many reasons why you wouldn't go for a unit like this.

The switch itself works perfectly and I have never had one go bad on me after continuous use.",

One important note is that while this is an unmannaged switch, it DOES pass VLAN tags (it can't manage those tags or apply tags like a managed switch). So if you have something on the other end that tags traffic with VLAN IDs, unlike other unmannaged switches, this switch will actually pass the tag information to the router. I use it with my Ubiquity UniFi AP, which tags traffic, and it passes the traffic to my router for management.",
