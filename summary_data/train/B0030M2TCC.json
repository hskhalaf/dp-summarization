I already have a metal chop saw but it's miters are atrocious. This saw is such a pile of junk it is ridiculous. It cuts violently through steel but it cannot keep the cut straight so every corner has a different length and so nothing never lines up . A total waste of good money!!!!! Don't waste your pennies.",

I've watched the \"how to\" video on how to make optimal cuts for blade longevity, but I'm not convinced that I've gotten any more 'mileage' out of the blades. I've had a few blades that went dull after the 5th cut on 20ga 2\" square tubing. That really sucks. One great thing about this saw (with the single bevel capability, not the double though) is that it will work with blades that have either a 5/8\" hole or a 1\" hole.",

This one feels tight (no slop) and slides smoothly so not sure how much more I would get if I got one of the higher end ones. A quicker operating hold down would be nice (one that you can set and release with a lever).",

The blade it came with Cutthrough 75 pieces until it started wearing down. I had to purchase another one through Amazon, but I didn't mind. The folks at evolution told me that it wasn't designed to cut through so much steel but it did a great job. Once I put the new blade on I cut through the rest like butter.

My only knock on the saw is that the clamping method is not as secure as a saw specifically designed as a chop saw to cut metal. Works great on wood, but you have to hold metal tubing tight to keep from moving. Good saw for a hobby welder that won't be using it every day for industrial use.",

I was going at a fast feed rate, and had some minor tear out... I could have gone slower, however the end result was more than satisfactory for welding purposes... far superior to any fiber cut. I am going to buy the recommended metal blade and see how this goes. I felt the low teeth count might be contributing towards the tear out. all in all, for 200.00 ish shipped, it's a great deal.",

Three is that when you attach the head to the body (comes in two parts with a clever snap joint), make it permanent with a couple of drops of epoxy to eliminate the slight play. I'd call this construction grade. I hope they will someday give us a professional version. Also, if you are cutting a lot of metal, get their dedicated steel cutting blade for a better cutting experience. Let the saw do the cutting. That's the key to blade life here.",

It's going to save me a ton of time since I don't have to grind each cut. It is also very efficient because it cuts so straight without deflection. I will end up adding a further review here:",

If I\u2019m lucky I\u2019ll get 10 good cuts from a 70.00 blade. Ive mostly cut 1-1/2\u201d angle iron 1/8\u201d thick. My horizontal band saw while slower does a way better job. After using this saw for awhile I come to the conclusion this thing is junk and can\u2019t wait for the day when it dies so I can justify cut it into pieces with my other saw and sending it back to the manufacturer.",
