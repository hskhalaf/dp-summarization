It is loud enough to wake up sleeping baby. But that's less of a problem compared to the safety risk. Clamp is not strong enough to keep the mobile upright and it falls on to the side immediately risking injury to the child. Please believe the other reviewers who complained about safety.",

Suspect it does this only because of the fabric covering the rails slips when tightening it. Once I got that little issue figured out I would give it 5 stars! It\u2019s cute and quietly plays lullabies and my baby loves it!! Have also attached to the bassinet. Looking forward to putting it on the car seat if we ever need to take a long drive. Would definitely recommend!!",

It would just slide forward until it fell into my baby\u2019s face. I tried several different ways and positions and it was a resounding no-go. I tried it on the Halo Bassinest. I\u2019m addition to all that, the little motor inside is loud and distracting/ the last thing you want for a mobile!! Returned.",

Only con for me is the song is loud with no volume control. Not a big deal. I put it on rotate with no sound. It has an automatic shutdown after a few minutes to save your batteries. Nice!",

Only reason I gave this review 3 stars was because I\u2019m pretty sure this mobile had already been opened.",

Now, he's a very easy-going 8-week-old so he doesn't really care...but I do. That said, I'll only put it on his bassinet when I can fully supervise him and remove the mobile from his face.",

My only complaint is that I wish the arm was longer / taller and a little more sturdy. I was able to find a spot on his pack and play that can hold up the mobile (it is kind of heavy). However I was not able to get it to connect to his rock n play without it sagging too close to his face. I really like that you can detach the mobile from the arm.

We have a separate sound machine for white noise and I was specifically looking for a mobile without music. Update: I didn\u2019t realize that this has an auto shut off function.
