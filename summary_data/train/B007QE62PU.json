Its primary limitation is its \"positionability.\" It has only click-stops in its rotation, so may not point exactly where you might want, for example if using it on a treadmill. And its up/down direction adjustment is even more limited and very dependent on the angle of the surface you clip it to. The other disappointment is the switch - a clumsy mechanical rotator dial located in back, not at all convenient since you are likely to be in front of it. It is corded rather than battery-powered and comes with a base if you don't need the clip. So may work well for you depending on your application.",

My only complaint is the length of the cord. Its fine for a desk since typically there's an outlet available just a foot or two away, but in a camper or a room in your house you'd likely need an extension cord. That's my only reason for 4 stars, otherwise it would be 5 without a doubt.",
