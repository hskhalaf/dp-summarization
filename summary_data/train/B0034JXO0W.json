      "text": "My purchases from Sauder in the past have been of good quality, but not this one. The TV Stand sent to me came with two major defects...both manufacturing defects. The first was a wrinkle in the finish on the top horizontal piece of the unit and the second was a broken vertical piece (K) on the bottom that was glued back together to hide the fact that it was broken. Since these pieces are on the top and front of the unit they are easily seen. I didn't find these defects until I was 80% complete with putting it together so I just finished the unit. I didn't have the energy to disassemble the unit and return it.",

This however, suits my needs perfectly. It has space to fit a TV on top (42' pictured), 4 components with perforated holes in the back, and 2 cabinets with doors. Its made of particle board but because of the design it is very sturdy. Putting it together was a leisurely breeze, but I'm also a weird person who enjoys putting furniture together. The directions were straight forward and legible. It did not require glue, which is a plus.",

Well packaged, delivered before promised, easy to assemble and now on display in my living room. This is UNLIKE several of the other vendors i and my friends bought from where the directions were conflicting and muddy at best with incomplete or erroneous pics to assist me in my quest. Sauder is the pioneer of this craft and continutes to excel. Wont waste my time with others in the future (i still need a white cabinet for bathroom), just go to Amazon, pick Sauder items to peruse and buy one of them. Keep up the great products you manufacture.",

Attaching the door hinges was a pain, and the pull knobs on door were not thought through very well by manufacturer; its difficult to get them straight.

Downside is that it took almost three hours to assemble by my son who is a mechanical engineer. Now granted engineers do like everything perfect, so power tools were used to line up holes that did not match properly. Slight damage in back of unit, but that cannot be seen.",

I would recommend their furniture to any one. All you need to assemble is a screw driver and your are good to go.",

The instructions don't want you to use one, because you might over-drive the screws. I very carefully used the tool to loosely fit the screws and then hand drove them home with a phillips head screwdriver. This saved time and wear and tear on tendons.and muscles.
