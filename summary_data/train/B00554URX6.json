So, I decided to get a new Liquid Shredder from Amazon.com. As a stay-at-home parent, I value price in everything I bought and with the $50 credit for opening a Amazon account, it made it more affordable. So far, it has been great for my kid and he enjoys surfing every time with his friends. The old one was water leak and making it too heavy to carry for my kid. Therefore, I advise parents to buy a surfboard at Amazon.com when asked. Thanks for the support.",

It is a soft foam board but pretty thick so hopefully if she takes care of it and does not jump on it too hard, it will last a few years. Red color is vibrant and my 8 year old has a blue board that is a cool color too. So happy it is light enough that they can each carry down the path to our beach with no problems.",
