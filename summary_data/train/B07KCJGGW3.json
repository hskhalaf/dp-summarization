      "text": "Had a Huawei Matebook X Pro for several months now - and it is just an awesome machine. Pros: Jaw dropping screen, never seen anything like it, edge to edge, super high res, perfect depth and colour, amazing. Great case finish, slightly matt finish grey gunmetal, feels luxury, strong and perfect design and visible engineering. Depth, this is the slimmest niftiest windows laptop you can buy, makes the top Dell look chunky. Cons: It's quite heavy, slight looseness to touchpad and slight rattle here, it's a known issue. Had a battery problem on first machine after a few weeks but Amazon sorted it and I got the same again, any other windows laptop feels poor compared to this.",

I turned off the autobrightness as it is confusing when watching movies. It even plays assassin creed unity with graphics better than my xbox. Photoshop is nippy and launchtime is about 8 seconds from closed. Build is strong and screen estate is good. The webcam is good for determining if nosehair needs clipping due to its strange location.
