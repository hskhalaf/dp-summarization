They were easy to install and have stayed tight since the day I installed them. No complaints--a good pair of shoes for the money.",

If you're really getting wet you might have water run from your pants/socks into these, in which case they might as well be bowls to hold water in. They're completely sealed. Worth it to consider booties that go over these so that water drips down their sides instead of into them for very wet rides. Would buy again and recommend to anyone looking for a waterproof riding solution.",

I wear 43's normally, Fizik and Specialized, ordered 43.5 to allow for thicker socks and they fit great. They feel a little stiff above the ankle at first, but you get used to it after a few rides.",

So far, they have been impervious to exterior moisture; my feet are dry and warm at the end of a 3-4.5 hour ride, even in a drizzle. I haven't ridden them in a steady rain yet....",
