I would recommend having your Dentist's office make a mold of your teeth. A fitted set of trays will only increase the effectiveness of the Senallis gel. You do not require much of this gel to attain positive results. Don't overdo it as gum irritation may occur. Use as you would with other whiteners. Attain the results you want.

Within about five days, the spots where my teeth had been kindof yellow were much more white. After using the teeth whitening gel for about two weeks, I have noticied a difference in the whiteness of my teeth. Thank you so much!",

    "description": "Color:Clear\n\nReady to feel the full effects from SenAllis Cosmetics RapidEffects teeth whitening gel?\n\nFast, Effective Teeth Whitening Gel that will save you money over the long run, ditch the teeth whitening strips, and forget the expensive name brand, and private label sellers on Amazon who mark up the price way above retail value. We provide you with the only part that is essential to whitening your teeth, the gel.\n\n\n\nDon't use whitening strips, ever, period.\n\nTeeth Whitening strips are a complete waste of your money, let's use this analogy, think about the epoxy on the back of a sticker, versus a small container full of epoxy. If you had the option of being charged $40.00 for a sticker, or you could make your own stickers for $10.00, and make 50x more, we think you already get what we're saying. Our teeth whitening gel provides a 30:1 ratio, that means for every pair of whitening strips you use, you could get the equivalent of 30 treatments from a single syringe of our gel.\n\n\n\nWell wait, don't I need teeth whitening trays?\n\nSure, you could get teeth whitening trays, it would improve your teeth whitening dramatically, however for the best results you want to get hard plastic trays. BUT WAIT! Our gel is sticky, and will stay on your teeth just like a whitening strip, so your STILL getting better results from our teeth whitening gel than you would EVER get from whitening strips.\n\n\n\nWill this teeth whitening gel work with my hiSmile kit?\n\nYour hiSmile teeth whitening kit's gel won't last you more than 5 sessions, sad, but true. hiSmile only gives you SMALL 3mL syringes, we give you LARGE 10mL syringes, forget the hype marketing that they've used to pull you in to buy their over priced products, get real results, get a real months supply worth of gel, and save yourself money!\n\n\n\nDo I need one of those weird teeth whitening lights?\n\nNo, that teeth whitening light does absolutely NOTHING for your teeth. The one's at your dentist's office are actually useful because they help to break down the teeth whitening gel which releases the oxidative power, or rather the component in the gel that whitens your teeth.\n\n\n\nHow to use our gel?\n\nOur gel can be easily applied to your pre-existing teeth whitening trays, or simply use our gel like a toothpaste and brush with it.",
