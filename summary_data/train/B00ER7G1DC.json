This trolling fishing reel is built upon the legacy of the illustrious Penn GT series of reels and offers the same proven performance in a more compact package. With a forged and machined aluminum spool and lightweight graphite frame and sideplates, this saltwater fishing reel delivers exceptional reliability without adding bulk to your rod. Its bronze main gear and stainless pinion gear provide exceptional strength and precision to ensure smooth, comfortable cranking. Additionally, the saltwater fishing reel's proprietary greased HT-100 Versa Drag system allows for multiple drag settings and remains cool in the heat of battle, giving you the finesse and power needed to conquer a variety of fish species. An anti-reverse bearing eliminates back play in the handle for instant hook sets, while the Versa-Handle system allows you to choose how long the handle should be. And thanks to its line capacity rings, the spool displays at a glance how much line is remaining.",
