Someone like me that suffers with build up with wax etc... I normally use the larger tips for earphones so they don't lodge everything back into my ear. Also unfortunately while the phone in my pocket I had cracking and break up in the right bud every few minutes. The good. Very good quality feeling with a cool case. Also the sound is the best I've come across. Incredible sound for Earphones. Wanted to love them but unfortunately the couple flaws for me didn't make them worth it",

However, I ordered a pair and the left bud broke within a week (I have since found out this is a common problem). I returned these and on the second pair I have received the back of the left ear popped off and there is no way to fix it back in place. Support is slow to get back too. Also, they cut out when there are many Bluetooth users around (e.g. train stations). Overall they are great when they work but it feels like corners were cut when it comes to build quality.",

Two negatives, but they don't outweigh the surprisingly amazing ear fast fit. 1. The buttons on the earpieces are really hard to press while in you ear, because they have a stiff a mechanism. This is good in that you don't accidentally click them, however they are so hard that I generally would avoid using them to control volume and only when you really want to advance the track. 2. It a little tricky getting the headphones out of the charger box. Pretty minor and getting better at it now ;-)",

There is very poor low charge warning on the case. Edit: Changed to two star as the button cap over the left bud has now come away (I hadn't been using these for a while, so it seems to just have deteriorated). Build quality isn't good.",

They take so much fiddling around to get to charge in the case! Edit: I upgraded my phone to OnePlus 7 Pro and the battery has improved massively. Also better connection too.

Plus battery life is exceptional. It doesn't seem to like being paired to more than one device at a time, so having to reset each time I want to change the paired device, but other than that no real complaints. These buds feel and perform premium but at a budget price. Great value. Would recommend.",

They are perfect for commuting and going to the gym as they cancel out background noise well, and sit comfortably in the ear without feeling like they will fall out. I usually dislike in-ear styles but these are a little shallower and comfortable for hours. The sound quality is great, and the battery lasts forever. The charging case is a convenient size, easy to slip into a pocket, and durable enough to take a few drops. Pairs seamlessly with my iPhone and laptop, and I have had no issues with connectivity, even in rush hour trains. My only gripe would be the extremely short charging cable provided. Highly recommended!",
