      "text": "I ordered this along with the Chaise Lounge and Couch Futons. All were very easy to assemble. I was on a short budget to fill my living room and all of these items did the trick. All are very firm, durable, well made, and quite fashionable. The way the legs, tools, and instructions were stored in a zippered compartment underneath each item was quite innovative as I had never seen that kind of inclusion before. I would highly recommend these to anyone looking for an economic way to fill a living room!!!",

It looks really good though and fits nicely where I needed it. It's pretty cheap, so I guess it gets the job done. It was very easy to put together and transforms easily as a futon.",

My kids have gotten all kind of stuff on it and it still looks new. The only down to it is the back chair legs don't stay screwed in very well and when they get really loose it starts making like a bell ringing sounds when any type of vibration happens(working by, kid jumping). I would definitely recommend though if you're looking for a bargain.",
