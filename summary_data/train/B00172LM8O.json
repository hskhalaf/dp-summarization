I've been using this serum in NYC in August when it is hot and humid, I expect that this will work really well while traveling and in colder, drier weather. The directions suggest using the serum over moisturizer or instead of moisturizer. The packaging is simple and straightforward - the bottle is squeezable and is similar to an eye drop bottle.

This hydrating serum is perfect to apply over the moisturizer as it makes the flakiness go away. I used to use Mario Badescu spray earlier but that made my face too shiny. This works better. It contains water and glycerin with some herbal ingredients to hydrate and protect the face. It's a bit expensive so I am rating it 4 stars.",
