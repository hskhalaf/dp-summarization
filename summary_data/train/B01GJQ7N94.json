The unit feels very light like it wouldn't stand up with headphones on it, but it is deceptively stable. The base feels like light plastic while the stand portion feels heavier (metal). The top is made of rubber to give the headphone a good grip. Overall I am extremely pleased with this item. UPDATE: Since this review I have purchased 2 more of these...",

Comes in 3 simple pieces. I threw out the free gifts they sent, but appreciate the sentiment :) Pretty flawless for the ridiculous price. Aesthetics look sleek/low profile and take up minimal desk space. Great steal.",

Secondly, the base is non-slip and is pretty stable on my table. Lastly, it's sturdy enough to support my bayerdynamic DT 770 Pro. So, overall, it's a good deal.

My only issue is that the stand is on the light side which makes it a two handed operation to place the headphones onto the stand. While the vertical support is made of aluminum (which is very good) the base is a piece of molded plastic that is too light. Once the headphones are on the stand, it is stable, but to put the headphones on, you need to hold it up. Not really an issue, but may effect heavier headphones. I took away one star for that, but overall, this is a good headphone stand.",

If you're worried about what weight it could hold, I've rested a scanner on it, so unless you've got headphones upwards of 5-7 lbs, you should be fine. If your headphones are that heavy, you should likely find a boombox to strap to your head instead, it may be lighter.",
