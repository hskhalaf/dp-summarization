Only complaint is it starts squeaking badly after heavy use. If you leave off the inner caps on the wheel hub you can get some graphite on the axles to help the squeaks.",

One downside that I wish radio flyer would fix is that there is no slot in the back of the seat to put a flag for safety. The lack of safety will limit the toy\u2019s usability (it works best on pavement, but I can\u2019t let her ride it anywhere there are cars)",

His cousins who were over also loved it. They were 4 and 7 years old and they were both able to ride it comfortably. I highly recommend it.",
