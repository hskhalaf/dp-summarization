This lightweight footwear is sought after for its rugged features, including the wide straps that hold the foot securely all the way.\u00a0Whether you\u2019re hiking, camping, or off to a weekend barbecue with friends, these sandals work great. Note, however, that they run a little narrow for some. It pays to get an actual fitting before making the final purchase.",

The footbed in the Strata has more cushion than my old sandals, which I like. The straps hug my feet in the same spots, but the Strata hook and loop closures feel more secure. The look of the straps and sandals overall is plainer, while more finished. I look forward to years of wear from these great sandals!",
