I lined the basket with a clear transparent 10 gallon trash bag (available from Costco) so when emptying these tiny pieces don't fly all over the place. The basket I did not buy the Fellows canola oil bottle for $9. Instead, to oil the cutters I use a small syringe and bought a small bottle of plain canola oil at the supermarket for $2, and now I can also fry some eggs for much lower costs :-).",

So no where near what it\u2019s capabilities are advertised. Slot for inserting papers is exactly 8.5 inches so you spend more time straighting out and carefully inserting items to be shredded.

It easily shreds paper and easily shreds cereal boxes, paper milk jugs, and thin single walled cardboard boxes cut into paper sized pieces. I definitely wouldn't try anything double walled. I'm keeping it well lubricated with shredder oil and it's doing an amazing job.",

The feed speed seems a bit slower then the old one, but that one was not a cheap model either, roughly the same price as this.",

I don\u2019t want to shop for and buy another plastic bag for a bin liner. Come on Fellowes... why couldn\u2019t you all have thought of that?",
