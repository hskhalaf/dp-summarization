I have been buying Harbinger gloves for the last 15 years, and they've always been top quality that I could expect to last for a solid year before needing replaced. I routinely lift weights 3-5 days a week for an hour at a time, but until this pair they've always held up. I don't know if they've changed manufacturing processes, but something has changed quality wise; I'm not happy that these things didn't last; I ordered a different brand of gloves yesterday.",

Really disappointed as I loved my old gloves that I used for a year and a half before they finally wore out. The stitching on these gloves started coming out of the fingers almost immediately once I started using them. Today the stitching gave way on one of the Velcro patches just from undoing the wrist wrap. Your Velcro shouldn't be stronger than your stitching!! These gloves are cheaply made and it's time to start looking at alternatives.",

They were made out of leather before, now it looks like it's made or if pleather... aka fake leather. The gloves run small. I got XL and the barley fit my hands. Other than that they are good. They added extra padding on the palm. Which is nice. And the fixed the velcro issue were it would get stuck in the glove as you tighten the wrist straps. So overall good, with a few draw backs. My last gloves lasted 3 years before they ripped and I had replaced them with these. Let's see how long these last.",
