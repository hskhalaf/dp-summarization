So far it does that well and we would expect it to last a long time based on the quality.",

The legs being long flat bars also gives it a great durability when performing an exercise with heavy weights. The distribution of weight was balanced. Best bench purchase for my home gym.",

Glad I didn't! It's got perfect padding, very comfortable, it's so sturdy and I use these benches for hardcore workouts, with a lot of weight and pressure, so this is absolutely perfect!!

I don't bench press anymore so I can't report on that. Some people commented on having difficulty in assembly, I did not have any problems. It took 30 minutes from the front porch to completely assembled. When you attach the two cross bars on the legs to form the base {feet}, 4 bolts on each, do not tighten any of the four until you have started all 4. This will give a little room to move and get the holes aligned.",
