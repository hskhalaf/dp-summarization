Update 8/24/19: I moved into a new place, it got a few little scratches in the moving truck, you should definitely cover it when transporting or take it apart and reassemble",

You will run out of the glue provided by manufacturer. Other than that, set aside an hour and a glass or two of wine, and you'll be decorating in no time.",

It's very heavy duty, sturdy and wonderful. I installed a wine glass rack at the top and I couldn't be happier!!!",

The quality is good, and once installed and shelved with books, they sit solidly on a carpeted surface. I did not overload the shelves, but they hold fairly large hardbound books with ease. Overall, very satisfied with this purchase.",

The directions were hard to follow and only the panels you were adding were labeled so you have to figure out what you were supposed to attach it to. The biggest issue is that some of the holes weren't deep enough and I didn't discover it until I was in the middle of putting it together and then u had to stop to get my drill to fix the holes.",

I set mine up on its side and it looks great, but the sticker on the bottom ended up on the side and when I pulled it off it took a lot of the laminate with it. I just covered it with furniture marker. I am very happy with this purchase.",

Purchased for our home office, looks nice (not amazing, not bad - just average) -Ikea meets Target... Fairly sturdy piece by looking at it, but if you touch it you can tell the cheap materials that it is really made out of. I am not disappointed in the purchase, but I'm not sure that going back I would re-purchase either. I cannot attest to the level of difficulty to put together, however it did take my experienced construction worker/hired helper nearly two hours to assemble!",
