It's consistency is almost like water so it rapidly spills out rather than smoothly dispensing with a slight squeeze.

It made my skin oily, it made my skin texture awful, the smell of the wash is bad as heck, I have bumps that I\u2019m still trying to clear up, and the new acne it caused was much worse than the hormonal acne I experience, and actually painful. I thought maybe my skin was purging - but after a friend (who has consistently been using this product and ordered it off amazon for the first time) said it was making her skin 10x worse I threw it in the trash. Don\u2019t even bother. Seriously.",
