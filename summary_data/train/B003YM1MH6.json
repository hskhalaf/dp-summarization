Also they shed like crazy and left black lint all over the house carpet every time I wore them. I also found the velcro scratched the top of my foot. I ended up replacing them with Hoka One Recovery Slides which are amazing for my plantar fasciitis (supporting and stretch the plantar fascia when I wear them) and don't leave lint.",

      "text": "This is my third pair of vionic house slippers, I usually love them and wear them to death so I ordered a new pair. The velcro attachment is way off on the left pair, so the scratchy velcro pokes at the top of my foot. It's been awful , but my son wore them out so now they are dirty so I cannot return them. But I am very disappointed at how the velcro patch is too close to the edge instead of being in the middle.",

I HAVE to wear these every day when I'm not wearing tennis shoes, so I need something that is durable and will last. For this price, its just not worth it.
