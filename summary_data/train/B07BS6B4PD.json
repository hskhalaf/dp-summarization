Chest straps work by detecting the electrical activity that causes your heart to beat. It's my understanding that as long as there's a good connection (wet the contacts) they are all equally accurate. I don't have an ECG to test with but based on a decade of using chest straps, this one has given me no reason to question its accuracy. No complaints about comfort.",
