      "text": "I'd probably feel more comfortable rating this at a 3.5, but I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt. On the \"Pros\" side, it's sleak, provides more than adequate volume for a bedroom, and is pretty straight-forward to set up. On the \"Cons\" side, either the subwoofer or the settings are too limited to allow the system to produce the type of base that I expected from such a massive enclosure. Furthermore, the proprietary connector/wiring (in typical Sony fashion) is far too short to place the bar at one end of the room and the subwoofer at another. All-in-all, I'm satisfied with the setup for the price I paid. I'd recommend it, but not enthusiastically.",

      "text": "Purchased this about 6 months ago. It has exceeded my expectations. Just the fact that the quality of the sound itself was so much better than the tv sound had me hooked. There is a certain surround sound feel to it too that I don't get from tv which is awesome. If you have a smaller room (apt.) or on a small budget I would highly recommend. You will be surprised how much better movie watching can be. The optical hook-up works great too on those movies that play DTS sound, which is an added bonus, along with the fact that you can easily switch sound to dvd player or media player by simply using the remote. Highly recommend.",

The sound is not quite as 'surround' as I'd like, but it'll do.

The 5.1 SACD's have a beautiful separation which makes listening to them a brand new experience. Easy to adjust and change the tone and levels to your desire. The subwoofer has a powerful bass that will surprise you. If you have any Sony products, the remotes are compatible. I highly recommend this product.",

We have a medium size great room, and this system is good enough to fill it up with quality sound. The sub-woofer generates good bass too. This makes up for the lack of good sound on flat screen TVs. Now we can actually hear the dialogues in the movies with the help of different modes (Movie, Drama, News, Game, Standrd, Music, etc). If you are expecting a home theater type experience, then you need to look elsewhere.",

If you have a setup like me and your living room doesn't really allow you to have a 5.1 system set up without looking hideous and getting in the way, I highly recommend getting a sound bar.

I use primarily settings for drama and music. The music setting was particularly pleasing while viewing the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. A very minor issue is the high directionality of the remote that is required to change settings - the subwoofer receives the output from the remote.

The only other deficiency I see is that it is not always synced with the actors lips. It is only slightly off but it is noticeable.",

If there is true value in these types, then a more obvious difference in them is useful. 2. The LED readout on the sub-woofer is small, faint, and hard to see from as close as 5 feet.
