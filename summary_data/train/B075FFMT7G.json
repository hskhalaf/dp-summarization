Without literally any good bacteria to function, his bowels shut down. Along with 2 vet visits for enemas and PROFIVEX, he is back to his active, talkative self! Thanks so much for a great product!",

It works well too and my Siamese car has not had probli with her anal glands since using it. Other reviews mention seepage from the anal glands, and she did for a few days after use but it stopped. I consider it a fair exchange as she's had to be treated twice for anal glands infection.. one was pretty severe and she had dead skin sloughing off. (Sorry for the gross details..)",

I use a syringe to give this mix to her 2X's daily. She is 6lbs, so she takes a half tsp ea time. She BM's daily w/o strain in spite of weak back legs. She is running down the hall now she's so happy she can poop!.",
