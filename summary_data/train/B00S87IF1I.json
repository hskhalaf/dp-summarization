      "text": "This is my second Dakine backpack. I have many backpacks over the years, including ome like Tumi that are very expensive. However the Dakine outlasted all my previous backpacks. I love the layout of the compartments and the roomy main compartment. However, I am soooooo disappointed that they changed the the zipper on the lowest compartment to a single zipper rather than the double zipper. It is difficult to get into without everything falling out and I have to keep re-zipping it because the zipper moves from the fully closed position on its own. I no longer put anything I truly care about in that compartment because I am afraid of losing anything out of it. PLEASE CHANGE IT BACK!",

I have two Dakine packs that lasted me through college ( I went to college later in life) and I still use for work and travel. My sister still has hers from college as well. Now that my own kids are starting college, there is only one brand I thought of...Dakine. Priced well, well built, and everlasting, my son loves this pack. Due to my experience, I believe it will last him for many years to come.",

Zippers and straps are all very sturdy, especially for the price. Plus it doesn\u2019t look rediculius on a 35 year old IT worker.

Update: Well, sometime after four months, the fabric on the bottom wore down and holes appeared. The material is just not strong enough to resist damage from abrasion -- however slight. Also, I wouldn't recommend any backpack with open elastic side pockets and as little structural support/rigidity as this has. It's really hard to find something decent -- I replaced this with a Samsonite Cityscape, which is much more expensive, but for something cheaper, look for a Tigernu design that seems functionally useful.",

Same pattern, but the flowers and leaves were places differently leaving the front panel a bit boring. But very sturdy and very large to fit all of your school/hiking needs.",

This roomy backpack features four distinct compartments including a large top compartment with a padded laptop sleeve and room for books and binders. It also includes an insulated cooler pocket to keep lunch and snacks cool. The Campus features a roomy main compartment with a secure laptop sleeve, an organizer pocket, a fleece-line sunglass pocket, plus a low-profile front zippered pocket and dual mesh side pockets for water bottles. Padded shoulder straps and an adjustable sternum strap ensure a perfect fit. Available in twelve unique prints and colors to match your unique style. Limited lifetime warranty included.\n\nCare Instructions:\nAdventures are messy. If your Dakine bag gets dirty, we recommend hand washing with mild soap (like Nikwax Tech Wash), cold water and a soft bristle brush. If hand washing is not going to do the trick, use a front loader washing machine. To ensure your backpack doesn't get tangled, place inside a pillowcase or mesh bag before washing. Always use cold water, mild soap and run on a gentle cycle. Never bleach your pack. Hang to dry in a warm but shady place, ensuring both inside and out are dry before storing.",
