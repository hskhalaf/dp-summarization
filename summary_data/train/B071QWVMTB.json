There has DEFINITELY been a change. These are inedible. They taste rubbery, processed and horrible. I think I read that EPIC was bought by General Mills (??) well, that would make sense in the change in product. It\u2019s just sad. EPIC sold out (which I understand) but they didn\u2019t even care about maintaining the integrity of the product. Sucks for the consumer.",

I gave the product another chance (we had these on auto ship but I\u2019ve cancelled that) hoping it was a bad batch. Nope. This batch had open packages, oil jerky sticks, and best of all one was covered in mold.",

If you like salmon but hate the over fishy aromas then you will love it. The maple flavor is not overpowering either. Just enough to enhance the salmon but you don\u2019t feel like your drinking maple syrup .",

It didn't seem to rehydrate, even when I took a sip of water while chewing. I doubt that this stuff will even digest properly. It really didn't taste like salmon, which is the reason someone would pay for the premium fish. On a positive note, I didn't find any bones in the one stick I tried so far.
