I clean the exterior of my toilet, the toilet seat, kitchen counters & mop my floors with it. I use the diluted spray to disinfect all surfaces in my home. I'm very fond of the Original Scent. However, the reduced price of the Melon Cucumber Scent influenced my decision to try this. For those who desire a softer, less pronounced scent I suggest you try this one.",

Walking into our home now, I\u2019m not embarrassed by how \u201cdoggy\u201d it smells. OdoBan truly got RID of the smell. Thank you OdoBan!!",

I use it to spray on my furniture occasionally instead of Febreeze. Smells much better and it kills germs and bacteria. Will definitely be keeping it in the house!",
