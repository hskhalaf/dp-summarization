The only thing I wasn't wild about was that they did not come with a paper tag over the battery which usually indicates the battery is brand new. Hopefully these will last a bit.

These small candles will fit in any tea light holder. The only thing you should consider is that these have no timer function. But they are very easy to click on and off. They are sturdy and seem well made. My quest for the perfect flameless tea lights goes on- I will keep them but wish they had the timer function.",

They are also designed well, and imitate a slightly melted candle, with the wick on the inside of the candle wall. I've only used them once, so I'm not sure about longevity of the product, but it definitely serves its purpose, and I look forward to many more uses.",

They are stationary and the light flickers in them. But that was my mistake. I'm returning them because I love to have candles you can actually see, and I really want some with moving flames.

With regards to the size (diameter and height), it's perfect if you want to use napkin rings as a \"sleeves\" around them rather than setting them out \"as is\" or placing them in decorative votive or tealight holders. We purchased the older version without the timer or remote. Good price combined with Amazon's 1-day prime delivery makes these a winner.",
