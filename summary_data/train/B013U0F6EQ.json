NOTE: It Is $100 per hour to diagnose and fix your drone by DJI. They do not give a parts price list or quote for diagnosing. They do not diagnose without an hourly charge . Please read the description carefully! It states the new warranty info that began last August. If you make the purchase, use a credit card that offers an extended warranty on your purchases. I am so frustrated that a $500 purchase brought such short lived joy.",

I tried doing the updates, I took it to Best Buy and they tried to set up it, another friend who has a DJI drone tried to set it, up but no one could help.

It's better to buy the cheaper Phantom model NOW, and get better at flying and maneuvering as soon as possible, rather than waiting until you can afford a more expensive model, and being that much less experienced. Additionally, you have to consider the hidden costs of these drones - you'll certainly want more batteries, ND filters, an adequate case/backpack, and so on, all which are easier to acquire when your drone model is less expensive.",

The self stabilizing feature is extraordinary. Son flew it near a tree, a branch randomly fell and hit the drone. The drone recovered and stayed in position. No crash. My son and I look forward to using this on vacation and maybe one evening at camp.",
