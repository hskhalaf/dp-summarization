Cleanup is also a pain because the cheese particles get stuck on the blade surface, which is not one piece but made up of metal blade affixed to a plastic lever, creating another point of resistance. It is much better for things like cucumbers, carrots, zucchini, etc .",

I only gave it 4 stars for two reasons: It's very light-weight, so you need to hold it in place while using it; and it does not work well for summer sausage, preferring to smash instead of slice. The blade depth is only about 1\u20448\" before getting to the arm taper, which is probably why it tries to smash the summer sausage. I have not tried it with vegetables or anything else.

The blade can move from side to side and requires the operator to take some care so that the slices are of the same thickness. Maybe that will improve with an improvement in my skill in using the slicer. Nor is it as sturdy as I expected. Important! Be very careful to avoid the sharp blade when cleaning. It could give you a nasty cut if you're not careful. Possibly a slicer with a wire cutter rather than a blade cutter would be safer.

We love this one (this is 2nd, which we purchased as a gift for a good friend). Some reviewers have stated that they did not think the thickness guide worked properly but we have had zero issues with it. The westmark slicer works flawlessly and we are very satisfied with it.

Quick, easy and inexpensive fix. Love the adjustable measuring gauge which allows consistent size slice. Washes up easily and it lightweight.",

This one has a sizing gauge and it stays in place exactly where you want it with little effort to slice. I had others try this because I was so excited and they also loved it. Very easy to clean as well. I'm buying some for presents this year. Would DEFINITELY recommend!",
