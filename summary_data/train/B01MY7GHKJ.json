As someone who is a bit older but still enjoys games, it is a treat to find a game that entertains my son while I play.",

Personally, I would love to 100% complete this game. Meaning, that I would love to collect all the skins. You would have to collect a lot of coin, and that's hard for me to do at this point since I'm busy with other things. Seriously though, this game is magical.",

The game play is clever utilizing Cappy the hat to assist and do most functions, yet somehow it maintains the Mario charm. Cappy is somewhat like a Yoshi that can't run away. Though unlike Yoshi, you have to have Cappy for a lot of things in the game. The combat style is fun and inventive with spinning and twirling remotes and being able to become frogs and dinosaurs. I do really enjoy this game. My one criticism is the repetitiveness of the game. It does after several hours feel a bit like you have done the same thing over and over again.",

However, I found myself running out of steam trying to collect all 999 power moons. Yes, that's right, there's almost 1000 power moons to collect. The entire game feels bloated with the sheer unnecessary amount of the moons. Here's hoping the sequel tones down on the collectible and makes them more substantial.",

Besides that I love the way the game looks so vibrant and colorful the controls are pretty easy to games not hard to get the hang of it and I like how there's a lot of objectives.
