Although a bit different from the usual, it was still able to deliver an improved fit. What left a number of wearers disappointed were the shoddy construction of the shoe and the thin sole that is predisposed to puncturing. Consumers were also upset about the lack of support needed for a hike.",

        "The KEEN Versago offered sufficient breathability, as experienced by a majority of wearers",
        "After walking for miles using the pair, a handful of wearers confirmed that it's a lightweight hiker"

      "cons": [
        "A couple of wearers disliked the shoe\u2019s sole which was thin and prone to punctures",

        "Some of its parts were peeling away",
        "The interior was tearing apart",
        "There were also visible glue excesses",
        "The shoe wasn\u2019t suitable for hikes, according to a few users",
        "They mentioned that the support required for a hike was not enough, as opposed to what KEEN claimed"

      "text": "I started to hike a lot more this summer and realized I don't have the right hiking shoes. My books were too heavy for the 2-4 mile hikes I wanted to go on. After some research I came across these little babies.... lightweight and extremely comfortable. My only complaint is that there isn't much arch support. I threw in some thin arch supports and boom... the perfect hiking shoe. I also just went on an early morning hike recently and the grass was covered in morning dew... my feet stayed dry the entire time. My mom just bought them too and loves them!",

I own other Keen sandals and love them so was excited to try these but they're not comfortable for walking. I've switched out the insoles to Dr. Scholl's gel insoles and that helps a little but I won't buy another pair of shoes like these.",

There's less arch support than other Keens, so I switched in more supportive arch supports but I'm not rating down for that because these are more like sneakers than hikers and I wouldn't necessarily expect a lot of arch support for a shoe like this.",
