The only complaint I have are the two PCIe x1 slots are useless if you're planning on installing a large PCIe x16 graphics card that is extra thick (like my ASUS GTX 1060 Dual). Installing that extra thick and somewhat long graphics card also blocked a couple SATA ports so effectively only 4 of the 6 SATA ports are usable.",

Has some simple orange lighting on the motherboard which can be set to breathe or remain steadily lit. 6 SATA III ports give it plenty of storage options and 2 M.2 slots are a nice to have too. 4 slots of DDR4 memory give it plenty of room to upgrade later down the road. However do note that if you do use a SATA M.2 SSD in place, the first SATA port will be disabled. So do not panic.",

      "text": "Loved the board until all usb ports quit working. Sent it back to Asus for warranty repair but when it arrived at service center they said cpu pins were bent and not covered by warranty. I guess I should have lived with the usb pcie card I installed to make it work, however I had invested money in ram and M.2 ssd for the motherboard, so I bit the bullet and bought another board just like it. Hope this one doesn't fail in 4 months like the first.",
