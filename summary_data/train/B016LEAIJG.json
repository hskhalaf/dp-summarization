Then, I saw good reveiws for this projector and thought of trying it as well. I called the professionals to install the new projector along with new Silver Ticket projector screen. Believe me, I am so impressed by the picture that I now prefer to watch every movie on this set-up. Picture is so crystal clear. Black is black and not grey. So crisp that I can see the dust particles flying when during movie someone was running in the field. So impressive. Love it!",

The 3050 is pre-calibrated for color, and even after running through all the calibrations there was nothing that I needed to adjust (but I'm in a dark space, YMMV). Only negative is the lack of motorized zoom, so I tend to leave it on its \"fill the screen in calibration mode\" position, and live with the occasional non-anamorphic DVD rather than mess with the alignment by constantly adjusting the zoom.",
