There is a place to write your info down in case the seat is lost. By far the feature I like is the back pack option, and protection for your seat. For those that fly with car seats, watch how your seat is thrown around while it is being placed on the plane.",

My only suggestion is that the instructions for getting it back in the bag would be printed on it somewhere. Decided to spend more for better quality and have not been disappointed. I expect to be able to use this bag (along with the umbrella stroller bag) on many more flights.",

The backpack style straps make it super easy to wear on your back while trying to get through the airport. It does a good job protecting the car seat from damage. When picking it up in baggage claim, you have to usually go to the oversize area instead of the conveyor belts. The design makes it easy to find among the sea of other people's items, particularly since it has a large area where you can write your name. It's pretty lightweight, so when you're done with it, it folds up and tucks away nicely.",
