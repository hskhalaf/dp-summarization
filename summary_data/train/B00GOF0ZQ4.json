We were at an event and we noticed the music was coming from one of these, and that's why we purchased this one. Update*one year later this is still my favorite little speaker we use it constantly outdoors by the firepit, inside while I\u2019m working, in the bathroom playing relaxing music for a bath. It\u2019s the best. You can use a an alternate micro usb charger like you would use to charge a Samsung phone plugged into a laptop to charge if your cord wears out or gets lost. Just FYI!",

Also, the battery life is pretty short when the lights are on, especially at the brightest setting. So unfortunately I use this speaker without all the cool lights to maximize my battery life, which sort of defeats the purpose of getting this speaker. The price-point is also way too high. They have same quality speakers for way less of the price.",

It is heavy but tough, military grade if I can say so. Under three hours to charge, if it is soft it's because the input signal is low. Using the m to m audio give it a bit more on the volume.

Worked excellent for about an hour then after that wouldn't get louder than a whisper when turned all the way up, It never was fully submerged in the river so i feel like it doesn't have an excuse to stop working. Contacted the seller and they basically told me \"sorry about your bad luck\" go kick rocks. Will never purchase from them again and do not recommend this product at all.",

It feels heavy, but a good heavy. It's a quality product my only concern is with how difficult it is to close the \"door\" that houses the charging and aux port, you really gotta press hard for that tight seal. Other than that, it's a great speaker",

    "title": "Alphasonik Phantom Wireless Bluetooth V4.2 Portable Party Speaker with Loud 30W HD Stereo Sound and Rich Bass, Built-in Mic, Micro USB, Auxiliary, 4000mAh Battery 24-Hour Playtime for iPhone, Samsung",
    "description": "Style:BlackThe all new Alphasonik PHANTOM has twice the bass than the CORE speaker. As the most massive speaker in this Bluetooth family, the PHANTOM weights in at 3.7 pounds. It delivers 30W of pure audio power with <1% harmonic distortion through the biggest bass driver Alphasonik has to offer in this line of speakers! The four professionally tuned drivers and the AlphaBass technology deliver very well balanced mids and highs with punching low end and powerful volume. The built in 4000mAh Li-battery provides up to 24 hours of uninterrupted entertainment on a full battery charge. When your PHANTOM is fully charged using the Micro USB provided, the red LED battery indicator will turn off so you may take your PHANTOM anywhere you choose! When unplugged, this amazing speaker also provides you with a battery level indicator that lets you know how much life it has left. Approximate charge time is 3-4 hours depending on battery life. Enjoy music and also hands free calling with the built in microphone. The engineers at Alphasonik carefully designed the capabilities of the PHANTOM so you can play music from Bluetooth (V4.2+EDR) and from an Auxiliary cable from any device with a 3.5mm audio cable. The PHANTOM also offers a 5V/2A USB output port for external device charging! Additionally, you can pair 2 PHANTOM speakers and connect them to a single source and expand the sound range! As if one PHANTOM wasn\u2019t loud enough, 2 of them will get any party started! This powerful speaker will bring you big sound and the ease of set up and use is an additive to the already enjoyable features.",
