      "title": "Great Book For Survivalists and Everyone Alike",
      "text": "While serving with the US Army and during survival training, I found this book to be better than any other. Peterson's Field Guides are okay, but this one by noted outdoorsman Bradford Angier was written with the layperson in mind. I have read numerous \"survival\" books of his; all are well-written and the drawings by Arthur Anderson make the plants pretty much unmistakable. There is a disclaimer at the beginning, but I highly recommend staying away from plants with white berries, plants with purple stripes and mushrooms. I wouldn't recommend this book for kids, due to the fact that kids would not be experienced enough to positively identify the plants. I also recommend this little article here: [...]",

After struggling with the newer books I'd bought (with photos) I remembered this one and bought it again. Money well spent.",

The drawings, color pictures and descriptions of each plant are detailed and precise, with helpful information about the nutritional values of the plants and how to use the parts (roots, stems, leaves & flowers). This was the second edition, I never read the first edition.",

It's easy to flip through because all of the illustrations are on the right page and information about that particular plant is on the left. The drawings show good detail of the leaves, which are in most cases the easiest way to initially identify the plant. Bradford Angier is highly respected in the field, so I trust the information in the book completely. I was able to use the book to positively identify several Serviceberry trees at our local zoo.

Variations among species make identity of individual plants a lot harder than it might seem, excepting for a few easy plants like cat tails, purslane, etc. I agree with a prior reviewer that absence of poisonous plants is unfortunate. Also, absence of scientific names is not good, since common names aren't reliable.",
