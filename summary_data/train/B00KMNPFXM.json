However actually stacking them and keeping them stacked is quite difficult as they only have a slight curved indentation on the bottom of each Kirby... I had thought there'd be some sort of magnet or interlock system. One bump to whatever surface you have them set on and they fall right over. Instead I focused my efforts on seeing how many I could stack on my cat.",

They're each about the size of a cotton ball, all with different expressions. A few of them look similar, but have different facial expressions. The material these Kirby's are made of is good quality. You do see the line where they connected the molds, but only with close inspection. The star that comes with it is about 2 1/2\" long. Maybe 3/4\" thick. Overall, I was very satisfied with my purchase.",

For what it is, it's really good! The Kirbys are very tiny!! About the size of a large grape. But the face paint is great! Its fun to place them in a bunch of different places around my room :)",
