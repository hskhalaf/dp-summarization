There were $100 wetsuits and $800 wetsuits, and it was really hard to determine the differences. But after really \"diving in\" (pun intended) and getting to what you get for either price point, this Synergy was a great value for what I got. I had the opportunity to do a long open-water swim on Easter and the suit performed beautifully - great bouyancy with lots of stretch to move freely. I do not think you could go wrong with this mid-price point wetsuit. It's well worth the money.",

I've struggled with previous wet suits that were too constricting and difficult to put on. The Endorphin is easy to put on and take off for triathlons, no restriction in movement, especially in the arms and shoulders, and keeps me very comfortable in 50F water. I haven't had a chance to test it in colder temps yet. Thanks for the fast shipment, TriMonkey!",

I also have naturally wide shoulders even when I don't work out, so that might also be a factor. If you have muscular arms and/or wide shoulders like me, this might not be for you.

I tried mine on and saw that the collar is much lower down the shoulder than the women's version. I am going to have to return this suit and look for one that has a more comfortable neck.

      "text": "Have used only once so far in an open water practice. Love how this wetsuit fits me better compared to my Xterra Vortex. With the Xterra wetsuit, it would feel like a ton of water coming out from the legs as I would exit the water, but I did not have that experience with the Syngery. The neck on the Syngery also feels less constricting. Looking forward to many more swims with this wetsuit.",
