It made me instantly nauseous!!! It seems as though it was expired or something went completely wrong with the scent. I was really looking forward to the amazing scent...after having read the most recent reviews it seems I wasn't the only one to experience the awful scent. You all should refund clients....if I could return this bottle for free I would...",

So far I am using it to remove warts I have on the body of my feet and it seems to be working. I don't expect this to be a quick process since I have had these warts for over two years now but I have to say I have seen progress in the eight days I have been using this product. I will most certainly buy again from this company. As far as some reviewers saying it smells like Pine Sol I disagree. It smells like Tea Tree Oil.",

I will continue applying this to the tags a few more days to see if there is improvement. I will update if there is any positive change.",

I personally LOVE the smell of tea tree, too, and so does my family. I also use it in foaming face wash- it's the best for oily, acne- prone skin. I find the quality of this particular tea tree oil superior to other products.",
