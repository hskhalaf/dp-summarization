The only drawback as shown in the two \u201cempty\u201d bottles pictured here is that it is impossible to get out the last 1/5 or so out of the container. I understand having a small amount of the moisturizer left in the bottle, but this really is wasteful. I have tried placing one bottle on top of the other, but the size of the opening is small and the top bottle slips off every time. The manufacturer should look into redesigning the container for maximum efficiency so that consumers can use the entire contents.",

I definitely run on the warm side of body temperature and when it comes to sweating and prefer and like that it doesn't feel as moisturizing as some more heavy weight lotions. I apply it all over my body immediately after I'm done showering and my body soaks it right up and it leaves my bath robe smelling awesome, too. Highly recommend!",

I'm a big fragrance enthusiast and I generally like green tea but it wasn't balanced in this lotion. It doesn't seem to moisturize in the same way the pineapple melon version does.

Also the ingredients aren\u2019t as natural as I hoped, although that\u2019s my fault for not checking before buying.",
