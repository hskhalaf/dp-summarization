      "text": "This strap was so inexpensive that I didn't expect much. After reading the reviews, I made a couple of easy alterations. First, I removed the \"cheesy\" looking camera on the woven cloth by simply sliding some wire cutters under the plastic camera and squeezing slightly. The rivet popped free and was removed. The next thing is to throw away the two supplied \"connect buckles.\" You don't need them and using them is just an accident waiting to happen. Connect the strap to the camera in the \"tried and true\" method as shown in my photo. The result is a great camera strap made even cleaner.",

The braiding also helps it stay on your shoulder with out the need for a leather backing. It is surprisingly long too. I'm 6'2'' or 189cm and at maximum length my camera will hang just below my waist. I actually had to shorten my camera strap for a change.",
