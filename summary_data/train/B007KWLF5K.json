The only reason i'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the white noise hissing sound you get when you turn on the noise cancelling is noticeable enough, it doesn't interefere with the music once you click play, but you don't really get a quiet bubble with the NC on. For $200 i kind of expected no white noise but i really don't mind that much about it.",

These were originally $380 retail so the price here is about a third that... a good deal. These are rather plane-jane looking and make them less attractive to unwanted attention a plus in my world. I've only used them for about 12 hours, find the dynamic range excellent as I listen to classical music that demands dynamic range. The bass listening to UB40 is never muddy. Carrying case is good.

The Audio Technicas are much better than the JVCs - The build quality is better, the sound is better, and the noise cancelling is *much* better. While these headphones will not cancel 100% of ambient noise, they do a great job. In fact, I would not want them to cancel all ambient noise for safety and courtesy reasons. They have great battery life. I'm still using the included battery after hours and hours of play. The build quality seems to be good as well. The only drawback is that they are large, and the carrying case is large.",

Allows me to watch movies and listen to music as a reasonable volume too. I do have to take them off to have conversations. The sound bleed would be an issue in a quieter environment though. It's pretty loud outside the headphones.",

    "title": "Audio-Technica ATH-ANC9 QuietPoint Active Noise-Cancelling Headphones",
    "description": "Product Packaging:Standard PackagingAudio-Technica's ATH-ANC9 QuietPoint headphones use proprietary active noise-cancelling technology to provide a comfortable listening environment in areas with high ambient noise. Delivering noise cancellation up to a remarkable 95%, the ATH-ANC9 QuietPoint headphones feature Audio-Technica's new Tri-Level Cancellation. Mode 1, ideal for use on airplanes, trains and buses, applies maximum noise cancellation to low frequencies. Mode 2, designed especially for use in noisy offices or crowded places, targets the mid-range frequencies, while Mode 3 creates a pristine, peaceful environment ideal for study. The headphones feature four miniature microphones, two in each earpiece, that pick up ambient noise and create a sound-cancelling signal to effectively block the noise. The ATH-ANC9 headphones also offer a cable with an inline microphone and controller for answering calls and controlling music. The mic and controller support select products, including iPhones, iPads, and many iPods. The microphone has an omnidirectional pickup pattern and it is designed for crisp intelligibility, so your voice will be clearly transmitted without having to speak directly into the mic. These headphones are designed to offer you crystal-clear sound that makes Audio-Technica the choice of leading artists worldwide. Wherever you happen to find yourself-in the comfort of your living room, in a noisy office, or settling in for a long flight-there is no better way to experience audio or immerse yourself in a peaceful environment.",
