A bit of nonstick spray, ~1/3c of batter, ~4-5m until it stops steaming, and out comes a beautiful square of goodness. All in all, especially given the inexpensive price, this is a fantastic value. Very highly recommended.",

She loves it better than the other style as it doesn't require you to babysit the iron and she can make four waffles at once. Her new thing is to pop in diced hash browns and crack an egg over them and close it up. Comes out cooked thoroughly and crispy hash browns so its got more uses than just the waffle",

Only skepticism is the cord is a mite short. It has a clip like lock when you close it but I suspect that's more useful to hold it together while storing and relocating, not so much while cooking; the waffle takes the clip in fight, pops up. Its more amusing than anything honestly, no harm done, no trouble or struggle. I'm happy. (For the Engineers: the waffles are not perfectly square, they are 4x5 sad to say)",

The amount of batter recommended by instruction may not be correct - I had to guess the correct amount. It was closer to 1/2 cup than to recommended 1/3 cup. Waffles not as thick as I'd like but I suppose for that you need a \"flip\" waffle maker.",

I'm convinced that the recipe is just as important as the tool to make it. I tried this recipe and everything turned out wonderful.  (Hint: Whisk those eggs till you feel like you need a new arm)",
