      "text": "We bought this appliance because it was the only recognizable brand in the sea of no-names. We were sceptical about usefulness of something that's basically small convection oven. It rocks! We do fries, tater puffs and onion rings. They come out great tasting and much healthier than deep fried, The drawer is made of two parts: drawer tray and drawer basket. Both are good but the metal gauges are thin and got to be careful while cleaning, especially mesh screen in basket. The body is plastic. Cleans easily with dishwashing detergent. Two controls: mechanical timer and manual temperature knob. Simple, easy, foolproof. Hopefully, working for many years to come. Highly recommended based on two month ownership",

I will keep trying, but am disappointed in the construction quality of the moving parts.",
