The concept is great but the material not only smells like a cow pooped in the respective room where you place the joovy due to its horrible materials, the material itself is all made of polyurethane foam and is not good for infants to breathe. I\u2019m disgusted that no where on amazon or on joovy\u2019s site there is zero mention of the products materials. It\u2019s disgusting. The smell is so bad I couldn\u2019t believe it. I\u2019ve had a joovy before (5 years ago) and it definitely did not have this horrid-fertilizer smell.",

Here are the reasons why: 1) Smell - upon initially unpacking the smell was so bad and strong that we couldn't even be in the same room as it 2) Opening/Closing - does not open and close with ease. I am not sure how they make it look so easy in the videos, but it simply does not open and close easily. Getting each arm to lock when opening and then unlock with closing up is an ordeal. Furthermore, getting it to completely fold with all four legs tucked in is also incredibly difficult.",

There is one snap and the pop in parts on the changing table I couldn't quiet get (I've got a thumb injury so it needs a bit more pressure and coordination than I have at the moment) but I don't see being a problem in the future.
