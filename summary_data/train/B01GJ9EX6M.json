This strip solved the problem by taking half the space and there is no pressure on the joint where the cord comes out of the plug. I was also able to free up several plugs in the strip, since three of the spaces I needed are for USB devices. Very happy with how well this worked.",

After the wife pointed out the problem was me, there were no issues. It even ran in one spot in Africa off solar panels and a generator.

I get if you want your plugs to be extra secure, but the Amazon power strip feels secure, but not to the point of having to forcefully yank out the plugs. Maybe it was just this one...either way, happy with my other purchase.",
