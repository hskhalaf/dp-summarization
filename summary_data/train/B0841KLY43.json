For example, other ride on car you have to take out battery and charge it. But this car is easier, you can plug into the car, no additional battery. You can drive this car on road and even on grass too. My kids love it and have fun time on it.",

No customer wants to go through hoops if they receive an item especially online that does not work properly when all the want to do is return the item and get their money back. The fast and slow setting was the same speed and the item buttons for other settings were labeled wrong. I wouldnt buy this item again. I also wouldn't recommend anyone else buy either.",

It has NO problem zooming around our yard. The turn radius on this toy is almost non existent. Which was why I took a star away. Overall very happy with this purchase.",
