      "text": "Within a week of a professional install, the faucet started to leak. A call to Delta said they would send replacement parts and tell me how to fix it, but nothing else. I am not a plumber and have no knowledge of how to disassemble the faucet so I asked for reimbursement for the amount of a plumber to fix it from Janiah, the Delta supervisor, who said no. A letter to the president asking for Delta to make good on the product was ignored. So now, after spending almost $500 for a faucet, I'm faced with having to hire someone else to fix the defective faucet they won't stand behind. Beware, Delta does not stand behind their product.",

Depending on the height where it's installed, turn on the wall faucet first, and then slowly open the main valve. If you are too high and just dump the main valve open, you *will* get splashes. When turning it off, turn it off at the *wall* first. Then shake out any drops in the end arm, and finally turn off the main valve. Fold it back up, and it looks nice against your wall!",

It works very well, and easily fills pots on each element including those at the front of the stove. The colour ensures the faucet is subtle and blends into the tiled backsplash. Highly recommend!",

The original location height would have been fine except our vent hood, I felt, was too close to the faucet handle. Just realize that the site that your faucet attaches to the wall is 7 inches lower than the top if your handle. A minor adjustment really, and all else was great!",
