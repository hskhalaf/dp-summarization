How if you use text, facebook, twitter, groupme, etc. constantly, it will die about 8 hours or less. (even if you don't watch Youtube or play game.) Charger is bad. It is a compatible charger. It was loose already when it arrived. The dock got bent because of the charger. I ended up paying $45 for fixing the dock and $20 for new authentic charger. I would say it's a good product if the charger was authentic.",

Great camera, very fast when multi tasking, easily change themes and fonts by using LG smart world and it finally got the 7.0 nougat update. I have read where some give it a poor rating because it has made the app draw obsolete by storing everything to the main layout like iphone does. However there is good news for the ones that still wine over this. LG has an option with the nougat update to allow the app drawer back.",
