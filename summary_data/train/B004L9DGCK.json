I view this Polk speaker as a great value for those of us on a budget. You can definitely buy cheaper speakers that do not perform as well. This speaker performs great and the tweeters can be manually directed towards the listening position, which comes in extremely handy when the speaker is mounted in the ceiling. I would recommend to anyone looking for a great sounding speaker especially home theater center speaker.",

Of course, you may run into a stud right where you want the speaker to be so there will be work on your end to make it fit. In my case, the stud was blocking the right locking lugs so I simply cut off the interfering part and made it work. Snugged it up and ran the wires through. Very easy. All done in about 45 min from box open to watching great P2P content.",

When the installer arrived he actually told me that he is glad that I bought the POLK brand because the speakers are really good and very reliable. He also recommended that I add a subwoofer so I also bought the Polk Audio PSW10 10-Inch Powered Subwoofer. After the installation, our theater room sounds really crisp and great!

If you cut it too close to the stud though, the anchor piece cannot catch the drywall. Also, DO NOT overtighten!!! I broke the drywall on 1 bolt on three speakers, it is still stable but the drywall is visible bulged out. Take my advice, and some others and get some insulation or some type of filling for the wall. It sounds good in my living room, but you can also hear it very, very clear from my bathroom (other side of the wall) just as well! haha",
