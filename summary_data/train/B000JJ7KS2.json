I thought the package was advertised to allow me to shake out the granules, but the packaging did not allow for it (poor design). Also, it did not give directions on the amount to use, so I guessed and learned later that I spread too much. I spread the granules directly on the soil (the package stated I could spread over mulch), and they did not dissipate into the soil after I sprayed it and after two heavy rains. Finally, weeds appeared after four days even though I laid landscape fabric over the soil. (sigh)",

I have not seen the weeds that are doing so well this year in any significant numbers in previous years.

      "text": "If you have a large garden, this 31 lb bag is a much cheaper way to go than buying the shaker jugs at a garden center. I use it to refill a jug spreader but a push type fertilizer spreader can be set to work just fine. Preen saves a lot of aggravation by keeping weeds from popping up in your flower garden or liriope bed. Works for 3 to 4 months after application.",
