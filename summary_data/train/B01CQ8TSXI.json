Being an all leather shoe they are pretty hot, not much breathability. But so far I like them. Shipping was delayed for some reason with no explanation.",

      "text": "Light, comfortable, great arch support, well made. Love these shoes! They led me to may victory's on the tennis courts too. Great slide control needed for tennis. I wear them until the soles, tops of toes, or side leather wear holes thru them, which takes year-s. I only wish they came in more colors. I am so pleased the shoes structure is the same after all these years. Honesty for real tennis shoes fans these are number #1in my book.",

I haven\u2019t had them long enough to comment on longevity but initial quality seems OK.",
