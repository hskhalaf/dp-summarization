However, that does not bother me at all.... I have worn the bra over 15 times already and it is still sticky and working great!... A few tips: You can unclip the cups in the middle. Unclipping them and putting each one on individuall, then reclipping then after they are on makes it easier to make them even. I would also recommend keeping the plastic covering they come with, that way you can reapply the covering after each use!",

Without much distance between cups since wasn't going for cleavage, the edges never stuck so there was an outline through my top.

      "text": "These adhere well. I wore them all day to a summer family wedding in my floor length bridesmaids dress. I danced, I sweat, I ran around, I ate and drank too much, I had a good time and I didn't worry about my girls at all. That says a lot because my dress was kind of lower cut and I was trying to keep it classy with family. They also held up well and are still in good shape to be reused. These have decent support and lift for my 32C chest. The amount of padding/thickness was just right to keep the headlights from showing without being chicken cutlets. The flower things were a nice bonus as well.",

I'm a size 36D/DD and was surprised to see how much bigger this one was than my last one. It took me a few adjustments to get the look I wanted but it's awesome! You can't even see the outer lining of the bra. The only thing that would probably show is the strap in the middle, but other than that minor thing it's seamless. Overall would recommend for those who need their girls pushed in together! Not for lifting though.",

The adhesion is excellent and the structure gives me just the right lift to prevent the moisture build-up underneath that usually leads to a rash. If you are expecting the same lift and support of a standard bra, this isn't for you, but then neither would any other adhesive bra be.

Walking home in the heat, with saggy boobs.. feeling totally self conscious left me traumatized. The material & craftsmanship of the bra simply can not hold up a heavy bust.. especially while sweating. The material is not breathable, so your sweat collects in the cups, voiding the adhesive, only the have it completely slide off. So unless you're an exhibitionist, I'd suggest looking into a more expensive version of this item (assuming the extra cost went into better quality) or duct tape these suckers to your boobs.

If you sweat, be advised this does loosen its adherence a bit. I go to the bathroom to address that and everything is fine afterwords!",

But with these I guess with them being pulled together and kept in place, it doesn't feel so bad. I'm going to give it like a month or so to see how they hold up, but I already have more in my cart to order.",

The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that it doesn't create lift for post-nursing mom boobs, and I believe showing a woman with a massive boob job for your advertising is misleading. Of course those ones are gonna be perky! Anyway, the adhesion is awesome, even when I've been sweating from 100F+ heat and/or exercise all day; they're easy to clean, and the aesthetic look is smooth. I am a DD and bought an E and it fits perfectly--no boob bulge.",
