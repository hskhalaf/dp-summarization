This machine is still covered by the manufacturer\u2019s warranty but it takes a minimum of three weeks to get somebody to stop by. The warranty service department promised to follow-up with a phone call to confirm repair date but never did, so the warranty process needs to be started from scratch. Also, the manufacturer doesn\u2019t allow feedback like this to be posted on their feedback page.",

The washer leaks during the clean washer cycle (there appears to be no fix for this). The 15 minute wash cycle has automatically changed itself to 20 minutes, literally (this is the time that appears on the screen). Now the control panel has died and apparently this part is on back order. All for a 2 year old $1,000 washing machine. Look elsewhere! Actually worthy of 0 stars! The dryer has an even spottier service history.",

We did not purchase the extended warranty and was told that we should have done so. Our LF lasted 15 years. Never did I expect a product to stop working after 2 years, 3 months.",
