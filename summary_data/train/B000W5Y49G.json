The game is simple but challenging. Playing the same levels repeatedly will reveal new surprises as you practice and get farther.",

It's a lot like a game you'd play in an arcade, with fast action and not much else. The gun is easy to set up and works great. It meets all my expectations and seems built to last. It's nice that you only shoot targets and cartoonish creatures -- no blood, stalking, killing real things, etc. This is definitely the best shooting game for small kids that I've seen due to its tame targets and quick, easy gameplay.",

The rifle type zapper helps a bit, but often times I find myself using everything but the zapper. The game alone is worth the price....zapper is an added bonus. If you only have a couple controllers, you will need another since the zapper does take a bit to set up. Odd that you use the front trigger to fire as well. Helps to steady your shot, and works well.

If you want the feel of a pistol then go with the Perfect Shot, if you want a fun game for 5 bones and want a rifle then purchase the Wii Zapper. Neither of these guns are perfect, you should be satisfied with either of them.",

I hope to see some titles using such techniques on the 1st person shooter. Ovverall very satisfied ...",

Because the Wii shooter games use a cursor sight instead of a light gun, a controller would be much more comfortable and effective to play them with.

The included game can be addictive but leaves me craving more than the minute or so that I'm allowed to compete for each stage. Too bad there aren't more games out yet that utilize the zapper. I'm waiting for Legend of Zelda....",

Nintendo should have provided a mini game where multiple users could play on at the same time. Aside from this, it has a fun build in and I got my wife hooked!!",

    "description": "The Wii Zapper is a gun peripheral that allows the user to insert a Wii Remote and Nunchuk, both sold separately, into either end and play a compatible game. The control stick on the Nunchuk controls player movement (on stages that allow player movement), while aiming the Wii Zapper moves the targeting reticule on the screen. The Zapper comes with Link's Crossbow Training, which helps to familiarize the player with the Zapper in a shooting gallery style game. Link's Crossbow Training contains three game styles: target shooting, defender and ranger. \n\n Features:\n\n\n \n\n * Target Shooting: In target-shooting rounds, players shoot bull's-eyes as they pop up on the screen. In early stages, targets are stationary. As the game difficulty increases in later levels, the targets move. Hitting the center of the bull's-eye nets more points, and hitting targets in succession without missing earns combo multipliers. Link can aim anywhere on the screen. \n * Defender: In defender rounds, players remain stationary but can look and aim in all directions by aiming off screen. Hordes of enemies assault Link, and he must fight them off. These battles have a great deal of variety, from fighting off skeletons in a desert to defending a wagon from boar-riding Bokoblins. \n * Ranger: In ranger rounds, players can move throughout the level using the control stick and aim anywhere they want by aiming the Wii Zapper wherever they want to look. In these missions, Link storms enemy encampments, fights his way through a forest and seeks out his foes while exploring the environments. \n * The Wii Remote and Nunchuk are sold separately",
