You CANNOT get symmetrical look for a double vanity bathroom with two of these hook racks. From the photos and design, you think that the base can be flipped upside down to install onto opposite wall (for symmetry look) so the hook can still be inserted. BUT inside the base opening, it is designed to allow the hook insertion with ONLY ONE DIRECTION (this means you cannot flip upside down/change direction). It's just stupid not to make this have symmetry capability.",

      "text": "I LOVE this towel ring! I kicked my old Ikea one to the curb! It looks expensive and very elegant. It also has a beautiful gleaming finish which I like and matches all of my other bathroom fixtures. Installation was easy, although I found Kohler's instructions very confusing. FYI - I did not use the anchors that were provided, only two screws, which I think will do the job just fine.",
