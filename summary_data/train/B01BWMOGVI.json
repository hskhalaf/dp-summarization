As expensive a toilet as this one surely deserves a handle that lasts more than three months. Nevertheless, these are very nice toilets and I would give them at least a 4 rating except for American Standard's Customer Assistance. When I called to complain I was left on hold for 20 minutes before I finally hung up. Evidently they have no intention of helping anyone.",

The second order arrived on time, it was 2 packages and both of them are bowls also! So now I got three bowls & no tanks.

The plumber had the old one out and this one in within 20 minutes. Uses less water than the older toilets. The new flush system is noisy but fast and you get use to it. Far less noisey that the old toilets though. I bought a second one for the other bathroom. 5 stars for American Standard. Thanks.",
