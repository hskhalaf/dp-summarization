This item smells like acid only few days after cleaning up the whole cage (1 Guinea pig only) Needless to say, I am NOT getting this anymore. I hope the company will consider changing back to what this product used to be - when it got all the stars for it's lost quality,",

To clean the cage I scoop it up with a dust pan and sweep or vacuum up the rest as all moisture is absorbed and unnoticed.",
