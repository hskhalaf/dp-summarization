The colors of the LED are bright and clear, the white setting is very bright, and the remote and presets work well. Best of all, the speaker on this is pretty good. Nothing too fancy, no deep bass or anything, but the sound is clear and it can get pretty loud. My favorite feature is the color-changing presets. It can cycle through colors quickly, slowly, or fade between colors. I've basically been running it for a week straight already, I don't know what fascinates so much but I love it.",

The Bluetooth connects quickly and the speaker sounds good for its size. The speaker is great at close proximity but can be a good background for even a large room. There is very little distortion (depending on source) at max volume.",

The other is that making the volume button the same as the \u201cskip/next song\u201d button seems to be counter productive. Skipping songs when wanting to adjust volume. Those are minor issues that do not take away from the overall functionality of the light and it does its job.",

      "text": "We have this in our kitchen as we love to listen to music while we cook, but hate having a speaker taking up space on the counter. Light is bright, and the kids get a kick out of the color change functions. I've seen some reviews in reference to sound and distortion, and one thing that will make a difference is to adjust the volume on the speaker itself rather than the device you're listening to. If you try to push the stronger signal through the speaker from the device, it will clip, and you'll blow it out. Hope that helps!",
