I think in hindsight it's a little big and we could have gone with a 2 light fixture, but construction is decent, and it was easy to install. The directions were much more detailed then I required, so I am guessing even someone with no experience could install this with ease if they simply followed the inscluded instructions. We picked up the bulbs @ Lowes on sale. The nice thing about the 3 lights is the bulbs that are shown in the picture are not overly bright, so 3 lights instead of 2 helps out there.",
