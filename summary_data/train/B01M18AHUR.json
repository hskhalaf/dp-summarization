I bought this for my 8 month old to use while sitting in her high chair; I don't like electronic toys for the most part and was looking for a durable, sensory stimulating toy that would encourage imaginative play and problem solving -- this fits the bill!!! Structurally it is superbly made. It has withstood abusive 8 month old hands without showing wear, and the suction cups on this toy are insanely strong (it take ME some effort and finesse to release them)! This will definitely be purchased for future baby showers! I wish I would've had this for my other children (I have 5 children ranging in age up to 12 years old)!!!",

We have a 10 month old, so their attention span isn't quite there, but I'm hopeful this toy will keep them entertained for many more years.",

It is great for exploring and building motor skills. The beads are different colors, textures, and shapes. We use it on the highchair and walker. I should mention that the suction isn't the best but baby isn't able to pull it off alone.",
