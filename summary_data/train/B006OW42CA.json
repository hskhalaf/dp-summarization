They are favorites and I couldn't wait to receive this pair in red... but... the fit is awkward. They are a very thin fabric, and they sort of flare out around the ankle a little in a strange way. I debated a bit, but returned and found something similar, but much nicer looking, for less than half the price at a local store. Bummed, as I love this under-belly style.",

Unlike other maternity clothing these pants are extremely flattering and versatile.",
