It is thicker than I would like--you can feel it on your face after applying. It also has an extremely strong scent, and not a pleasant one. As previous reviews have mentioned, it smells like candy. Overwhelmingly so. The scent stays on you as well, I could smell it on my face 24 hours after applying.",

It's even helped with scalp flaking, it moisturizes my face and neck and hairline so well that it must help keep the scalp moist too. I've had really bad luck with skincare so I'm desperately hoping they never discontinue this product line.",
