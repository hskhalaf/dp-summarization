This was one of the only Plush Artemis's that weren't at a ridiculous price or had red eyes. This Artemis was perfect!! He was easy to carry around, looked like the original and even better in person than in the picture. Seller was great, package arrived in a fast manner, and I would definitely buy from again! **See my Review on the Sailor Venus Tiara",
