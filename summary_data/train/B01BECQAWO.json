      "text": "The wagon is strong and multi-purpose. The wheels make it easy to travel across any type landscape. One of my favorite features is the \"dump\"/tilt of the wagon bed. You can dump your load. However, I have found you can also roll/push a heavy load into the bed before righting it. This saves your back from having to lift the load into the wagon. This is my second wagon ... the last one I had lasted 9 years. Do yourself a favor and replace the hardware before putting your wagon together. (I took off a star for the hardware) Also, here's an arthritis tip, spray the screws/bolts with WD-40. It will make the hardware screw together much easier.",

The square holes will need to cleaning out because some of the plastic didn't get cut out completely during manufacturing.

The big washer goes on the bolt side. The smaller washer goes on the nut side. Use a 1/2\" socket to tighten the nuts. Either use a ratchet or a drill with appropriate attachment.",

A \"GORILLA\" wagon deserves a far more robust bed. This thin wimpy bendy plastic bed is pathetic... Looks like it will crack eventually.

Some mulch or a few bags of groceries is about all I would put in it. I will update my review once I get another tire/tube. Great little cart for hauling small things.

Recommend 2 people for the assembly, as it was much easier than reaching around, trying to steady everything while using the torque wrench (not included, but use if you have one!) Didn't like? Not much. The cart plastic could be a bit firmer/thicker, but perhaps a bit of play helps the longevity.",
