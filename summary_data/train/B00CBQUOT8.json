The rifle does not ping like the gen one but it is also less air efficient. Regardless of all these factors, if you put a nice scope on it you too can shoot the flies off your target at 25 yards and kill ground squirrels out to 75 yards with essentially no practice. On a 2800 PSI fill you will get 16 or so shots before the POA starts dropping. This is about the best backyard friendly bang for your buck.",

I am very impressed, so impressed I am going to buy the Marauder in .177 cal to get more shots from a fill. The last 8 shots I took were low then I looked at the pressure in the rifle and it was down to 1000 PSI.",

Don't have a tank yet either as I can't find a place near buy to refill larger tanks to 4500psi. Pumping not easy, but if you don't intend to shoot target a lot, it will do the job. Negative parts: -it's heavy. - floating barrel will shift the point of impact if you lean it on the barrel or grab it by barrel. A lubed oring between the barrel shroud and that mount fixed that problem. - the stock is a little flimsy",

      "text": "Pretty good accuracy and powerful for small game hunting or pest control. Bolt came in kind of stiff, but lubricating should make it smooth. It sounds funny with the springs when firing, but can be fixed. Right out the box, I had a 2 inch group with barracudas at 30 yards. After sighting in the scopes, I had pretty good consistent shots.",

Using Benjamin domed hunting pellets at 15 yards from a benchrest, and a 3-9x Leupold EFR scope, it cut a ragged hole just a little larger than the pellets after 8 shots. Noise level was about the same as a pneumatic staple gun. Maybe less. Point of impact remained unchanged after more than 70 shots. It was also able to punch a hole through 1/2\" plywood at that distance. Definitely not a toy. A very precise, quiet and powerful air rifle.",

Now with a regulator installed it's a tack driver at 50 yards and holds a sub moa at 100 yards. Plus I'm getting 30 shots with less than 10 fps extreme spread at 840fps. I regulated my gun to 1850psi and put a spring stop guide in and it's perfect. There's nothing else I need to do to this gun. I am disappointed in the Crosman quality control on their barrels, but the Marauder platform has so much potential.",

A spring type air rifle like a Ruger is lots more fun to shoot and no troubles. Get this gun only if you like lots of frustration.",
