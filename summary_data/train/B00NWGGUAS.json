My stationery Samsung \"all-in-one\" printer scans documents only in Jpeg and other image files, which was very inconvenient. So, I have purchased this travel size Fujitsu, as it scans and saves in many other formats. And the fact that this one is wireless, makes life even more easier, as I can take it with me on every trip. Fujitsu once again proved that they provide great products!",

Works fine, though on needs to feed 1-sheet at a time, so if double-sided, need to feed it through twice. The bigger problem are the feed guides. They are very short, so when guiding the 8.5 wide paper into the scanner, unless you feed it perfectly perpendicular to the guides equally, the paper can easily go through crooked. This is especially true for any pages after the first page since the subsequent pages are automatically pulled into the scanner. That is usually when the aper goes crooked.",
