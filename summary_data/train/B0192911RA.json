My options were $140 for an additional year of technical support but he recommended almost double for 2 years.

The only minor \"CON\"s are It doesn't have all the features of the X6, most notably only one versus 2 higher speed 5mhz channels, and the devices attached interface, while prettier and graphic, doesn't give as much information, nor recognize the names of more advanced devices, like a Cisco Secure Router used for secure VPN.

While this is a great feature the lack of easy time restrictions is a deal breaker for me and I will be exchanging for an ASUS. Other than taking a few hours to figure out what was an wasn't possible with the parental controls settings, the router setup was very easy and routing performance is good.",

      "text": "It was a bit expensive; but it was easy to install and seems very reliable (so far). Signal strength seems good, even in the back yard. Nice feature is the ability to turn off the LED indicators, without affecting operation. The LEDs can light up a dark room. It has a ton of features that I have yet to try out. What I wanted was ease of installation, good/steady signal strength and reliability ... so far so good. I would buy this unit again.",
