I ordered the blue fabric. It is very nice-looking. I would not purchase this chair if you are looking for a chair to sit in for long periods of time. It is a very firm chair. The backrest does not have a lot of padding. I would highly recommend this chair if you intend to put it in a guest room or hallway. Assembly was relatively simple. I was able to do it by myself.

In addition, I like the comfortable fabric and sturdiness of the item with the bottom cushion being very think and low to the ground. My only issue is that the posterior cushion is a little stiff on the back. Would suggest a small pillow as a simple solution for support. Overall, I\u2019d buy the product again and recommend it to others.",

Wood is a little light (as expected for the price) but has a nice finish with no imperfections except those I pictured. Upholstery is a sturdy and comfortable fabric and had no imperfections.
