One time it even blasted a shrill screeching tone in my ear \u2014 that was pretty unpleasant. Compounding the issue is that Bose offers no real technical support or path of recourse, which is pretty astounding considering how much these headphones cost. I probably would not buy these again.",

The sound is way way louder than other sounds coming from headset and gives me tinnitus it is so loud. 3. Over the months ALL audio has become distorted and unlistenable.

Audio stuttering, skipping, drops, and loss of connection (while sitting in front of Mac!). Absolutely infuriating in a $350 product. I've wasted hours searching Bose / Apple forums for a solution. I've owned plenty of Bose products, aviation headsets and other noise canceling headsets, all great quality products. Which is why I am surprised, these are, politely put, utter garbage.",

Nothing compares. \u2014 Flawless BlueTooth connection (with audio confirmation of the pairing). \u2014 Absolutely stunning noise-cancelling. I know it is Bose's specialty, but this goes beyond all previous experiences: almost incredible. \u2014 Good sound quality. \u2014 Folds in small, practical carrying box. \u2014 Very comfortable to wear and use for hours \u2014 The charge lasts FOREVER! This is another impressive feature. Hours and hours without recharging. Exceeds specs. Overall, the best headphone set to come out in years.",

      "text": "Bose simply makes the best headphones. This being my third over the ear version they just keep getting better. Having previously used models from Parrot which is a technological dream, their quality is spotty. Bose however makes a product that works perfect every time, has the right technology that actually works, and builds a product that stands frequent use while showing little wear. Their carrying case on this model is very well made and as compact as can be. The voice over queues are helpful when the headphones connect to multiple devices and telling you of battery level. The battery level is really outstanding lasting me usually a week with daily use. Comfort and materials are top notch.",

While I love my children, they're not exactly quiet and I really was having a hard time concentrating when they were making noise. I was reluctant to pay so much for these when the next best model was about half the cost, but I also am used to a quiet office and figured it was a good investment. Couldn't be happier. Even without power, they work, but when I have music playing, it's like I'm in my own little world. When I play Opera or Classical; I feel like I'm at a concert hall. Great investment.",
