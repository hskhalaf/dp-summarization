Absolutely LOVE this oven. I cook and bake everyday and this baby is heaven sent plus it looks amazing in my kitchen. The convection oven browns everything perfectly even, the burners bring water to a boil quickly and have even distribution, and the broiler heats quickly and once again, cooks evenly. Love the heavy duty grates and professional look. Easy to clean. Installation was a breeze and it sits flush against the wall. I've had it for about 6 months now and couldn't be happier.",

Delivery was a little fraught: 7 days prior to delivery, I had to change the delivery time due to a conflict and, altghough amazon helpdesk individual (Sai Krishna) assured me the message would be passed to the delivery company, this apparently never happened, with the ensuing confusion, wasted time, etc... The cooker is solid, the burners work very well, the knobs are solidly built and turn smoothly to give smooth flame control, oven is about 25F off, but one can easily compensate for that. For the money, I really couldn't be happier.",
