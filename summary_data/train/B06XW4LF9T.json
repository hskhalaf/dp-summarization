With the comfort and sleekness of the Platform silhouette, the sneaker flashes an extremely stylish profile ready to tackle the streets in its dainty way. Though the glitter in the toe cap implies a high price, the low top sneaker\u00a0manages to be available in an affordable range.",

It's kind of annoying. I wish they were like half the price, considering how quickly the soles wear through.",
