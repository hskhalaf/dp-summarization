Paperwork says call manufacturer (Danby, a corporation in Canada fronting this Chinese product), so I did. Multiple times. Each time I got to wait more than 20 minutes to speak to a customer service rep. In each case, CSR was unable to address the problem, including directing me to service shops that do not service my area. So I have a new, non-working refrigerator with no one able to work on it.

      "text": "We bought this fridge almost a year ago and it doesn't do anything a fridge is supposed to do. It worked fine the first month we used it. After only a month, it stopped producing any cool air. At this point, it's basically a glorified cooler. On top of this, we've noticed recently that the door does not seal all the way thus letting cool air escape. We've moved every item inside thinking maybe the door was jammed, but it hasn't changed anything. We think it's because the magnet is weak or simply doesn't work. We are very disappointed with this purchase. Please don't waste over $600 on this garbage! It's been nothing but trouble since we've bought it!",

      "text": "We do like the product for its size and upper refrigerator compartment. The refrigerator has nice glass shelves with interior light. The door could use more shelving, if soda container holder was removed. The freezer basket does not slide well and is poor storage space, would rather have another shelve and door storage. We are having a problem removing glue marks left on doors after removing plastic packaging film. The refrigerator does make weird sounds while running, but the compressor is relative quiet. Power usage is unknown since we have not received a power bill since plugged in. Delivery of product was late, mostly by second carrier. Other wise we are happy with the product, hopefully it will last.",
