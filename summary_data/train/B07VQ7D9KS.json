The corrugated plastic used for gas station light pole and crash pole advertisements works very well, use 2 or 3 layers and alternate the corrugation to give strength in all directions.

And now its just over a year later and i just missed having it. First, its a great deal if youre looking for simplicity, durability and functionality and second it just looks cool. I appreciate how i can adjust it to make it nice and snug so i can attach all of my molle accessories to it. Just a great vest for those with tactically inclined mindsets.",
