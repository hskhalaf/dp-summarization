      "text": "Like another reviewer, I teamed this with a plastic/rubber \"V\" gun mount for photographic use. I was hoping for a home run with it being strong/solid enough for a walking staff/trekking \"pole\" too, but unfortunately the locks aren't strong enough when you lean much weight on it. They are certainly strong enough for any photographic equipment I can think of, so I can hardly hold this against the product. The \"V\" mount makes a decent \"handle\"/grip for modest descents, stream crossings, etc. Just wish there was a way to tighten the locks for more stability. For the price, however, a very solid product. Would certainly be decent for a gun mount/monopod as well.",

It is light weight and when fully extended is long enough for a photographer who is seven feet tall (I am 6'3\" and it is a fair amount longer than I need). It is much easier to work with than a tripod and it is very adequate for stabilizing the camera - even when using my largest telephoto lens (300 mm).",

I didn't want to drag a tripod around the woods, so I tried the monopod. For a light aluminum tool, it is well built and feels relatively sturdy. The adjustment tabs keep the telescoping sections in place very nicely. It won't stand up to any abuse, but for helping steady a camera or other item it works very well.",

While I don't use the spiked foot much, it is a nice feature if the ground/grass is damp. I use this with a \"Y\" yoke attached (I don't attach a lens or body directly to the monopod) and it works well with long/heavy lenses. It is sturdy enough to use w/o concern, light enough to carry, and priced low enough that I didn't hesitate to buy. The supplied case wasn't that important to me, so I don't use it and have no comment. Overall: Good monopod, GREAT value.",
