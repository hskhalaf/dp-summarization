Taste is PRETTY YUMMY - prob due to the fact that the number one ingredient in syrup (wish they didn't put so much sugar)... but rolled oats comes second so it's not toooo bad... It does have that taste of protein powder, but it's not overwhelming at all. These are one of my go to snacks to put in my purse and have on the go - especially as a busy mom who is always starving. These are a good deal to buy on Amazon!",
