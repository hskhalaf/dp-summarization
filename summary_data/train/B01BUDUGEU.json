My favorite thing to do in the morning is turn my head over and brush my hair upside down (so to speak). It leaves my hair with such a soft glossy feeling that it's like conditioner. Excellent quality brush that I would highly recommend.",

Actually feels better and is more comfortable to hold -- at a fraction of the price. This is NOT the type you use to detangle hair after washing -- there are no plastic bristles sticking out. But it comes with a nice wooden comb for that purpose, and the natural bristles just make your scalp feel great and your hair shine when it's dry. It's relaxing to do the \"brush your hair 100 times\" when I get home from a stressful day at work and plop down to watch TV or read.",

This was a very nice, personal touch, which makes me feel special. The comb is perfect to detangle my wet hair without harsh pulling, and the brush is definitely good for my thin, delicate hair. I used to have very thick, full hair; but due to illness, my hair has thinned considerably. This brush is very gentle on my hair, as well as my scalp, but it is very effective. I believe this comb and brush set will be a wonderful tool in the overall treatment to get my hair back in shape.",

The comb is probably of no use to us since he has fine hair. I might use it. Overall great product and I recommend.",

It's gentle on my hair and yet adds volume and shine. The comb works well to eliminate knots. Don't be disturbed if you initially get lots of static. I did at first but this went away with daily brushing as suggested in the instructions.",
