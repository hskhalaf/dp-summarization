Updated the software, which downloaded and installed without a hitch. Because I am an Amazon Prime member, I installed the app for Amazon Instant Video. Again, no problems. I was a little worried that my DSL (3Mb download) wouldn't be fast enough for streaming. I selected several movies from Amazon and the streaming worked flawlessly. I haven't tried any Blu-ray movies but watch my regular Avatar DVD and the picture quality was great. I don't have a 3-D TV so I can't comment about the 3D experience. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase.",

      "text": "On day one in July 2011 the LG BD670 was a mediocre player. The device generally had poor response times though the picture and sound was usually good. The software was a little flaky even after the numerous updates. Now 7 months later I wish the player was functioning even at that low level. Now it sounds like a lawnmower as it tries to spin up the disk. It won't read any of my BDs or DVDs and it even ruined one. Warranties are useless since its cheaper after 30 or 90 days to just buy new. I'm done with LG until they start respecting their customers. $150 players shouldn't be disposable.",

By heavy use I mean 4-6hours per day. Now it just sits there collecting dust with \"BOOT\" on the display. I have tried several hard restarts and even called LG.

Amazon, Netflix, and private DLNA network streaming work perfectly. Very low price for a player this capable. The bad: Menu structure takes a little getting used to, but OK once you figure everything out. Needs a very strong wi-fi signal to avoid stutters / pauses when streaming HD; we ended up hard-wiring it. Remote is weak and/or directional; must be pointed directly at the player to function. The overall quality and outstanding value, however, more than make up for these minor issues. Five stars.",

Did a bit of online research and they apparently decided they didn't need to let this model play Amazon videos anymore. Fine. No more LG for me.

I purchased a Panasonic and Sony unit before this, both of which I had to return due to setup issues.

I have a fast internet connection and still ran into buffering issues all the time, and with no internal buffer you can't even pause it to allow the video to preload.

I tried to play a second movie in it last week and it makes a grinding noise and ejects the disk. I tried other new bluray disks and some dvds with the same result. Called for warranty and the labor will be half the price of the unit. Not feasible and I'm not happy. The price to watch one movie is a little high for my taste. I guess I'll eat that cost and buy a different brand.",

However, since I've switched to using a Roku device for streaming, I've never had a problem, so I think it was the LG. If you have streaming problems, try a Roku.",

The player has Hulu, Netflix, Vudu, and Amazon VOD installed in the \"premium\" apps from the main menu. The player works great. I did change the audio setting from \"PCM stereo\" to \"primary pass-thru\" to take advantage of Blu-ray surround audio that can be decoded by my audio receiver.",
