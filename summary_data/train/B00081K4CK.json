The rubberized clamp on the attaching end is nice for a tablet, book, or other device without fear of it being scratched by hard plastic (like other alternatives on the market). The lightweight design also makes its use less cumbersome than other lighting solutions, since this doesn't hinder reading at all. I bought two, one for me and the other for my family, we love them. Battery replacement is easy as well, with the cover being held in place by two small Phillips screws, and the it containing a CR-2302 flat battery. Two thumbs up!",

The light outs out a soft white color light easy on the eyes but bright enough to light up both pages of the book with ease.

It does seem to bend on its own slightly over the course of my reading so I have to push it up. However it hasn't become annoying yet.",

Changing the batteries was total frustration and fail. I could not get them to stay in place or synch with the switch. I would have bought another one of these, but after trying over and over again to get these freekin batteries in, forget about it. I am going to look for another product. Lots of luck if you buy this and need to replace the batteries. Sucks, because I did like the light. It appears I'm not the only one.",
