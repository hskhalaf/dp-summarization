I use them for pickling and they are great After losing 4 of the center rubber pieces when washing them (don't ask), I sent the company an email asking how I could purchase more. They replied within one hour (in the middle of the night) asking me how many I needed and what address to send them to. That is great customer service! I look forward to learning more about fermenting and the information included with the lids gives great recommendations.",

I'm also a little unhappy with the durability of the date tracking rings as I've already had one ring pop off while soaking my lids in hot water trying to combat the aforementioned smell.

There's nothing wrong with this - it just means your stuff is fermenting and releasing CO2. Once your ferments aren't producing so much gas, it is easier to keep the jars pressurized.",

Just something you gotta do to keep it clean. Also not cleaning it will get it gummed up n potentially stick shut making the lid hard to remove. Again. Keep it clean and no problems. Much better than metal lids that rust. Lastly. The company\u2019s service is first class. You email them, they address it immediately. Buy their lid remover tool to make life easier.",

The little pump air extractor is a tad stupid to use as it doesn't suck out as much air as I'd think it should per pump so several pumps are required to do the job properly. Once pressure builds up it will come out on its own but the air extractor will pull bubbles up from the bottom without having to shake or tap the jar. The calendar on the lid is very handy when timing the fermentation time. The threads fits my jars and are NOT prone to cross threading which is GOOD and much better than regular metal jar lids.",
