They are motion sensored so they don\u2019t stay on all night bothering our neighbors. They install quick and easy. They don\u2019t turn on during the day wasting the solar life. The suggested charging time is 2-3 days but they started working as soon as it got dark same day that we got them. Highly recommend!",

If I have to fumble around in the dark to walk right up to them before they even come on, then they do not do the job they were intended for.",

Interesting, that just before buying these solar lights, I bought Solar Power Sensor Wall Lights. Those worked like a charm. Even in a 48 hour period of continuous rain, they charged and responded to movement flawlessly. I wish they would make some of these lights to last longer than 10 seconds.

I noticed the build was fairly simple and the back is held in place with four tiny screws, so I undid them and massaged the wires going to the solar panel and the battery right where they connect (figuring it was a bad connection), then clicked the on/off button again and they worked. So if yours arrived that way and it's too late to return them, I recommend giving this a try. One star off because I had to DIY it to get them going, but otherwise good, very bright, and easy to use.",

Both lights did work again, but only for a couple nights and they were dead again. I'm guessing it was due to a defective charging system or battery maybe ?? not sure.

Ambient light at best -- helpful but not extremely bright. If you still want to give these a try, I suggest doing a trial run with duct tape before installing.

We installed them on the edge of the roof line, which is the only way they can get sunshine. But then the angle of the light is directed out in the yard, instead of below the roof where our path is. So when we walk under the eaves, the motion detector doesn't see us and turn on the lights. We would have to walk outside the eaves (in the rain if it is raining!) to have the motion detector see us. The design would have worked better for us if the light pointed straight down, instead of out at an angle .",

Putting it at eye level is a non-starter. Other LED lamps have a cover for the LED bulbs inside. 2) the angle of the LEDs should face more downward. Again, unless you mount it very low near the ground or way high above eye level, your bound to be caught in the death-ray. Finally, the blue-ish color of the light is very unnatural.",

One now charges during the day just fine, but as soon as the sun starts to go down it cycles on and off (with nothing to trigger it on) until the batteries run out, until the next days charging. They are mounted high and nothing has come in contact with the plastic cover to damage it other than the sun.",

The amount of light is what is really surprising! It is fairly dark where we live. So the first time I seen one kicked on at night and I could see about 1/4 acre down in front of our house, that's what really sold me on these.

As a weatherproof and heatproof light, it can be installed without fear of environmental damage. As a Day Charger, Install it outside and let the sun power it up.
