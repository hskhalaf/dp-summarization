When a two year old (my Granddaughter) uses the pedal\u2019s unless the foot is EXACTLY placed the foot will get caught between the pedal (yellow) and the red part that holds the wheel. Try explaining it to a 2.5year old who wants to learn to ride a tri cycle but cry\u2019s when she gets pinched. I am 5\u20198 and have to hunch a bit to use the handle but I can live with that just not the Ouchy. Always love Fisher P. Just not this..",

Also, my 21 month old daughter is only interested in pushing it from behind, as her feet don't yet reach the pedals but the stationary pedals are awkwardly positioned and her feet don't stay put on them. BIG FAIL. If we hadn't already assembled it, I'd be promptly returning it.",

    "description": "Three grow-with-me stages let kids rock, roll, and ride from as young as 1\u00bd\u2026all the way to 5! The youngest of riders can enjoy indoor/outdoor fun on the stationary rocker base. When they\u2019re ready to roll, it\u2019s quick and easy to remove and convert the base into an extra-long push handle for parents. Before they can pedal, toddlers can learn to steer as you help them roll along! Then, when they\u2019re ready for big-kid pedaling fun, simply remove the handle, fold-up the footrest, and they\u2019re off\u2014with durable tires, easy-grip handlebars, chunky foot pedals and an adjustable \u201cgrow-with-me\u201d seat. Trike easily converts from one stage to another and back again, no tools required.\n\nBRAND STORY\nFisher-Price: For the Best Possible Start. To give your child the best possible start in life, you don\u2019t have to have all the answers or do things a certain way. All you have to do is the best you can, and let your kids play. At Fisher-Price, we\u2019re dedicated to helping you do just that by working tirelessly to bring you the very best gear and toys. Fisher-Price toys are made to help all kids\u2014from infants to toddlers to preschoolers\u2014develop through play, in their own ways, because that\u2019s how they learn best at each age and stage.
