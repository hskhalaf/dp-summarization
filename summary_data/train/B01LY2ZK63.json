The black and purple are of the same length and are both slightly thinner than the white. It has the same thickness as the eurosock version that has the flower pattern on it.",

      "text": "If you want ski socks knee socks these are pretty good. If you want padding you wont find much if any. The 'padding' is a very slightly thicker weave in the striped areas - hardly any different padding then a normal sock. Looks dramatic with the color but dont be fooled, that is not padding. All that said they fit well, did not fall down and were warm to about 20 degrees F with a liner sock. Any colder and I would go with a thicker sock. Finally, they were frayed at the rub points after four days of hard all day moguls. I doubt they would last more than a season to someone that skis often.",
