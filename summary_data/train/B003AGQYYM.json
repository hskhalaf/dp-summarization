Hope Nailtique can expand its color selection.",

I put on Nailtiques forumla 1 along this color polish and a quick dry top coat, and I'm good to go for several days! Yes, it's a bit thick, but I think that's part of the beauty if you have thin nails like me. It really wasn't hard to work with. Thanks for the color polish, Nailtiques! :-)",

Thankfully, Amazon was great--as usual--and refunded the money. I highly recommend the company changing the picture to reflect a bright, harsh red--if that's what people are looking for. I've worn polish for years and have *never* seen this shade of red on anyone. Ever.",

I did want to use this for french manicures but I think this color is a little too opaque for what I was looking for even with one coat, after using thinner in it. You could see the french tip but not nearly as well as I would have liked!!! I used bright white for the tips so that wasn't the problem. It would be beautiful on it's own if that is what you were going for but that isn't my thing.",

It takes several tries to get the cap to stay within the lid so the bottle can be opened. The polish itself does not chip on my nails.",

My only other complaint is that the polish doesn't really hold up very well. I find my polish usually peels or chips after only a day of wear & I only use it with the nailtiques base & top coats. Maybe I just got a bad bottle. Either way, I am a huge fan of nailtiques & will continue to use the product because of the miracles it has worked on my nails.",
