I the tension was correct and the chain was oiled. The chain came off and it took forever to get it back on. Now the chain won't tighten enough. I am ordering another chain but have my doubts. I have several BD tools that use the same battery so I thought this would be a great addition.......not so. So dissapointed.",

After cutting those hard to reach limbs, take out the center extension and you can easily cut the small limbs for residential trash cans. You will have to get a spray/pump applicator for the chain oil to ensure the chain is lubricated appropriately, but I would rather do it manually than rely on an internal chamber to lube the chain anyways. The battery is small and charges quickly. One charge and I am able to work around the house for a couple hours.",
