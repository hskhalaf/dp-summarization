Some reviewers had a more tangential viewpoint placing screen size as the most desirable item In their objectives thus ruling out this little but powerful beauty from their list. More fool them I say, because as a somewhat silver surfer this really is the bees knees. There is no aspect of this pint sized machine I am unhappy with ( and that includes the bezel spread around the edges). First Apple product I have bought and consider it to be great value for money.",
