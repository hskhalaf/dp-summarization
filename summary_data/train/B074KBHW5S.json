      "text": "What an awful product. I was aware of the poor battery life even before the purchase but what I really hate is that it hardly ever connects to my iPhone. I have 2 other Sony Bluetooth headphones and they\u2019re performing great. I expected this to fare just as well but I\u2019m extremely disappointed. I hardly ever get to use it because of the music skips, more times than I can count in just one song. Terrible product.",
