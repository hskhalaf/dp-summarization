For audio quality, the built-in speakers work fine for general use / conference calls but are a bit underpowered.

My biggest qualm with this monitor is its built-in speakers. They're absolutely terrible. The sound quality is awful and they're super quiet. You have to get external speakers or just use your computer's speakers because the ones that come with this monitor are TRASH",

Rear mounted speakers work for wall mounted monitors because the sound bounces off the wall forward. Other than that, it's a great monitor for the price.",

The sound quality is not very good as it is very quiet, and not good at all for music. The stand is also very big and takes up a lot of my desk although I like that I can mount it onto my wall. Sorry for mainly pointing out the negatives but I wish I knew these things before buying, so I figured I may as well tell others.",

These adjustments don't seem to \"take.\" Maybe they don't \"take\" in real time and only do so after saving the settings. Probably user error. \u263a",

Easy to set up, does not come with an HDMI cable, does come with two other VGA-looking things (my laptop only uses HDMI, so). Great for $130!!! impressed with how crisp it is for how cheap it is. definitely fuzzier than my laptop screen, but still looks great. Not a touch screen, in case you thought it was. speakers are kind of quiet, but I connect to a bluetooth speaker set anyway. The stand it kind of large, it takes a circular region of your desk that is around 10-inches in diameter.",

Great 1080 performance for my Cable TIVO HD system service on an HDMI connector, and my desktop PC/BD-DVD on the DVI-D. Only minor 'room adjustment' toning down of the factory set contrast and brightness was necessary, along with adjusting for best 'Clear Type' on PC Font settings. The integrated speakers are acceptable, though I use audio out to an enhanced audio system, or headphones most of the time. Although all manual (comparison to an HDTV remote), the OSD menu is easy to use, and source selection is pretty straight forward. Got a great PC monitor, and a 1080 HDTV in the bargain.",
