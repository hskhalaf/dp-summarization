I wanted to walk them together but was concerned the big one would hurt her if he saw a bunny he wanted to lunge towards. Well he tried a couple times, but the bungie leash is phenomenal. And the handle is so comfy with the underlying material that it doesn't hurt my hand. I was waiting for this email to come so I could give my review. Choose this one!",

      "text": "This works pretty well for my differently sized dogs (50 pounds and 20 pounds). The small one will sometimes circle the larger one, but the leashes don't tangle. The only problem is that the bungie cords give limited control over the dogs and it's hard to guide them away when they see something they want to pull toward, or when switching directions. My dogs are puppies still and don't walk well, so if your dogs are better on a lease you might have more luck. I do like the product though, just wish there was less elasticity, or another handle lower on the leashes to use as needed.",

I might replace the clips with carabiners since the leash cord and the rings are, in contrast, great quality. You can also turn this into a single, long leash by unclipping one of the short dog leashes and clipping it between the handle leash and the other short dog leash section.",

Not only does it provide a secure grip and sturdy connection to their harnesses, the leash provides a range of movement that gives them a little leeway while keeping them close enough to manage. They are able to switch places with no entanglement as the leash has the ability to pivot nicely. Our dogs are large, but this leash is perfect for them as it is easy to maneuver and our Malamutes have the ability to walk without the leash restricting their movement. Highly recommend!",

I am so glad I gave this a go! We had our inaugural walk today on the trail and it went perfect! They could zig zag to their heart's content and I was happily untangled.

I found that my dogs then started having space issues where they would not potty if the other dog was in their space. I went back to my old leash for when they potty and only use this on long walks",
