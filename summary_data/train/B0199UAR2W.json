Good cycle time too.. and pretty quiet. Suprisingly so.",

I rated this a 4 not because of how it performs, but rather these things. The instruction manual was inadequate. The instructions to put it together had very small and rather unclear pictures and rather vague and poor descriptions. I was not familiar with hydraulics and was unsure of how much oil to put in because it seemed it already had some when it arrived. I was able to assemble it but it took longer than I would expected if the instructions had been clearer and more precise.",

      "text": "For a 9 ton splitter, it seems a little underpowered. Does pretty well at splitting hardwood logs up to 15\" diameter, as long as there are no knots. The safety feature (having to hold down 2 levers at once) is extremely annoying for experienced loggers, as is the shut-off when it overloads due to a log that's too much for it to split. You have to turn off the splitter and turn it back on to reset. For once a year, it does a decent job. Portability is a big plus.",
