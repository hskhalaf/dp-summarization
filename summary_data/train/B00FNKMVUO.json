I don't know why I ever switched, this mouse has everything you could need and is very easy to customize in the Utech app. I'll never switch my mouse again.",

It's very thin, and when playing for any length of time, I wind up with a sore thumb from the edge pressing into my skin. I was able to fix this with some Sugru. Docking them a star because if they extended the lip into a proper thumb rest, it wouldn't be a problem. Other than that, it has a good feel, it's customizable, the buttons have good sensory input so you can touch-type with them.",

The weight, button design (the angle makes them much more tactile than the naga, easier to find), and texture all feel superior to me. My only complaint is the single button next to the left mouse button where the naga had two. If I can figure out how to program it as the browser back button I'll be in hog heaven.",

The program software (included on disc, don't bother with website) is fantastic, and has many different profiles. This is great for keying Photoshop and illustrator to the side number pad, while maintaining different settings for various video games. Very quick to change and can set color indicators with mouse LED to visually verify current profile setting (ie, blue for Photoshop, yellow for Illustrator, red for FPS games, etc). Make sure you get a good mouse pad too. The Venus combined with a Corsair Gaming mouse pad (($10) made this mouse surgically precise.",

It happens nearly 40% of the time now and Its driving me nuts! this started happening about 3 weeks ago after a windows update. I really dont wanna be spending more money on the mouse. I have tried a bunch of times to re-install the driver and still the problem continues! Update: I should note that my previous Utech mouse did the same thing, except it was with the middle click, also after about a year of use.",

I didn't have to go anywhere and download anything, as some of these reviews stated. The mouse is pretty quiet, though not dead silent. It is much more quiet than most similar gaming mouses, I have owned a few. I like the added functionality of this mouse. A comparable mouse sold in the store would cost far more.",

The only downfall is that the click buttons start really far back. For example you can click with your knuckles instead of the point of your finger. This is causing issues in the game i am currently playing however i am trying to get used to it.",

Figured I'd try this out since it was cost effective and I'm surprisingly astonished at its build and function. Definitely exceeded my expectations for the money and might even try out some other products now.",
