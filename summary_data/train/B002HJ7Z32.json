      "text": "I've been trying to kill some Siberian Elm trees (some people call them Chinese Elm but I'm talking about Ulmus pumila) for years. The original trees were cut down almost EIGHT years ago, but shoots just keep returning. RoundUp doesn't kill them, starving them for sunlight doesn't kill them, digging roots doesn't kill them. They're seemingly indestructible. But spray this stuff directly on the shoots and a week or two later they're dead. They may try to shoot once or twice more, but spray again and they're gone for good. I'd pay ten times the price of this for that level of success. Wonderful, DEADLY stuff.",

It doesn't seem to do a good job targeting the roots, so after it's dead, I'd suggest pulling what you can, but at least it will be easier to do at this point.
