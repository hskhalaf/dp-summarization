This is a nice size, very solid feel. Easy install. The packaging - from Amazon - was superb! The interior box, from Koehler, had ample styrofoam around it for a ride in the back of the car. Amazon's box was easily 6\"=8\" taller and longer, allowing for tons of recycled packing materials. Impressed with not only the product, but the packing. YES, I will buy it again (when it's time to redo the other bathroom)!",

      "text": "Followed the instructions and installed the medicine cabinet level and plumb. However, the top of the door was 1/4 inch out of adjustment (top of the door wouldn't close.) I went to the instructions to adjust the door and it shows 3 screws that would provide the necessary adjustment up/down, in/out but there is only 1 screw that is attached to a clip. I tried to move the hinge but with one screw the adjustment was at best 1/16 of an inch, certainly not enough to close the gap at the top of the door. It is disappointing that Kohler's instructions and product are different.",

This was not too bad as the walls were opened to the framing anyway. After framing was done four screws were required to mount the unit. It has a nice clean, minimal but modern look. The mirror on the back of the door and inside the cabinet are nice touches.",

I was trying to retrofit in a very specific location so I need accurate information. Extremely poor job, Amazon and Kohler. Now what do I do, risk going to a shipping store to return it?",

It's mirrored inside and on the other side of the door, with glass shelves and fits nice and flush against the wall. My only complaint is that the door is not soft close. You would need to upgrade to other Kohler models to get that and the price nearly doubles. That being said, it's a small door and it isn't a deal killer. Nice, inexpensive way to upgrade your bathroom cabinets. In my case, it was perfect for a seldom used basement bathroom.",

You can put the hinges on the right or left depending on your needs. By the way, I received advice from other people that cabinets like this one were \"out of style\". DON'T listen to similar advice and thank God I didn't. You will not regret installing this cabinet.",

My only comment is that it would be nice if there was a way make the door slow-closing (like modern kitchen cabinets), sometimes I forget since almost everything in our house is slow-closing and they slam a little hard.",

The cabinet box is bright anodized aluminum. Whether the door is open or closed this cabinet makes a nice appearance, the hinges are good quality, and I believe you would have a hard time finding a nicer medicine cabinet. There is another Kohler model of this cabinet the same width but 6\" taller. You might want to consider that one.",

It looks awesome, so much better than the rusty '50's cabinet it replaces. The interior looks awesome with the mirrors. I was impressed with the quality of the construction. It was hard to find one this size....glad I went with this one!",

They are meant to be recessed into the wall, which wouldn't work for us, so we had to be creative about installing. We did get the installed successfully, and we love them. Just remember to leave the film on the glass until installation is over. (Thanks to a previous reviewer for that little tip.)",

The only warning I would say is be careful how you drill the screw into the framing. They strip very easily. I had to replace a couple already.",
