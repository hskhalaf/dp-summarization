The price for this 144hz curved 1080p monitor is insane and while you may be afraid to try a lesser known brand, trust me it's fantastic. the blacks are darker and deeper than my benq and there is virtually no flashlighting issues. 144hz looks gorgeous and rts mode makes the picture really pop so i can see everything ( i play starcraft 2). Overall, great, no complaints, definitely recommend",

There is one dead pixel towards the top of the screen, but its so small that it doesn't bother me at all. I hardly notice it unless im actively looking for it. Im very happy with this purchase.",

Ghosting. Overdrive simply doesn't work and for me it made things worse. So there's some ghosting. Everything else is dang near perfect though. Again if the monitor was priced any higher than $180 I'd knock a star off. At this price point you can't do better.",

Basically to sum up my experience: It\u2019s capped at 143 FPS, which is weird, so I just default everything to 120 FPS. Also, the screen flickers and it bugged me, but I got used to it.",

Out of the box it\u2019s set to 60hz but changing that to 144hz and enabling freesync/ gsync and it\u2019s amazing quality for the price . I noticed there seems to be two different models being sold one has the stand in the picture like tripod and the other is a flat style. I got the flash style",

I would highly recommend this upgrade for anybody with a 60 Hz monitor atm, just make sure to use the given DP cable and change your display settings to the refresh rate to get the new refresh rate :)",

From a quality standpoint the monitors are not the same, the black trim on each is a slightly different color one is more of a dark gunmetal gray the other is black. If you purchase one of these only get one monitor, it works well for games but if you are even a little bit ocd it is a nightmare.",
