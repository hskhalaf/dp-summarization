I gave it to him at Christmas time and he has plenty to still use. We smoke 2-3 times a month and I would guess these chips will last for the entire year. Great value and great product!",

This variety pack doesn't have oak, hickory, or mesquite, which are more heavily flavored wood. These are fruit woods, which go well with any type of meat (fish, chicken, pork, beef), particularly sausages.

    "description": "Color:Original VersionWestern Premium BBQ Products BBQ Smoking Chips Variety Pack. This variety pack includes four wood flavors and a reusable smoker tray. As one would expect, Maple is a great wood for cooking pork. But the sweetness it provides with its light, smoky flavor is also great with poultry, game birds, and vegetables. Peach wood produces a mild, fruity smoke flavor. A BBQ secret in the Southeast region of the United States for many years, this sweet smoke is great with pork, beef, or even fish. Apple wood produces a mild yet delicate smoke with a hint of sweetness to add a very distinctive flavor to meats grilled or smoked with it. Apple is great for pork, fish, poultry, and game birds. Cherry wood adds a mild and fruity smoke flavor similar to Apple but with a bit more punch. It is great for adding a reddish tone to the items you are cooking and is typically used with vegetables, seafood, chicken, and steaks. You can also mix the woods together to create a unique flavor of your own.",
