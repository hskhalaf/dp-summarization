Does not pull media off micro SD slot. Neutral - not sure if it reads the usb port, interface is super minimal I mean really basic! To basic! I almost think that this thing was really ment for hard wire like HDMI, WiFi mirroring Bluetooth do not work all that great Pros: it is small and portable, image quality is just OK does have HDMI that works good, does have wifi I actually bought bought this to mirror off my phone doesn't work well.",

Should be best suited for home use to watch something off your iPad. Do not buy if you want use for business meetings. You will be dissatisfied.",

Image is so dark as to be impossible to see unless lights in conference room turned down to the point to dark for people to write, even after going in settings and increasing brightness to 100% (which was no different than default 50%). Have used lots of projectors in office settings, so have good comparisons to what should be acceptable. Had screen less than 8-10' from good quality screen, no windows so ambient light was not problem. Never have written a negative review before, but don't buy this unless you just want a cool looking toy, as that's all it is.",
