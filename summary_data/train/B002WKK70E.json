We have a lot of big trees and if we aren't going to be in the pool for a bit or we know that a big storm is coming we can put this on and save ourselves from digging out a bunch of leaves. We plan to also put it over the winter cover. It's not that difficult with 2 people. We have a 24' pool and the 24' cover fits over the ladder. Update: with the winter cover on I was able to put the net on by myself. Wasn\u2019t super easy but not too hard, I managed.",

So that part was useless to me - though in the end I was still able to use the product, just by a different method.",
