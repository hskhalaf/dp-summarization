Ended up buying this minly for price and reviews. things that make it worth bying. - small form factor -Pressure aguge is part of it . -reasonable lenght of power cord -easy attach nozzle for quick attachment and removal. - 25 psi to 40 psi in about 4-5 minutes. - Ideal for top up . - Cost is about 10 times worth of gas station payment for air service. -",

Very disappointed with this product. I also bought one for my daughter to use, but will have to warn her about its inferior performance and poor quality.",
