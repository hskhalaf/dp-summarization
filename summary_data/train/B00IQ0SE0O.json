This replaced a less powerful sound bar that just wasn't strong enough to get the volume I wanted. Not so with the Sharp. Plenty loud for the 60\" TV I have and the 15x15 room it's in. I also like that the bar comes on automatically when it detects signal from the TV, and goes to sleep when it doesn't. I would recommend this product.",
