The large steel components feel very solid and I'm sure it will be fine once I'm able to get some hardware. I'll update once I get that figured out and use it. Update: Bowflex customer service was actually fantastic. I called and they immediately shipped all the missing and broken parts. I'm very impressed overall.",

This item will not only force you to do the real exercises but will help you get there. The chin up bar is low enough for you to cheat and jump up into position until you can bend your knees and really do pull ups. The adjustable dip bar allows you to do the same. And starting pushups at a 45 degree angle as a warm up then lowering it to do real pushups also helps. The thickness of the bars is perfect. I just love it.",

I am a male and found it to not be suitable for p90X. HOWEVER its great because there are a lot of other exercises you can do, but I would probably buy a pull up bar to mount into my basement ceiling. So if your strictly looking for a just a pull up bar for p90x dont buy it. If you are ok with probably getting another pull up bar just for p90x buy it.",

I am not mechanically inclined, but I found the assembly directions and process to be straight forward. Please note that to do the assembly you will need a step ladder.

It is super sturdy, multi-purpose, looks and fits great in our basement, and easy to use. it's also comfortable for different heights/weights. I am 5'0 and can use it perfectly. My husband is 5'9 and he's also a fan. I also like the fact that it has the hanging armrests as I find them much more comfortable for some of the workouts I like doing.",
