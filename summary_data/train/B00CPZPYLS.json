      "text": "This was my first experience buying pure organic coconut oil and I must say that this did not disappoint. The aroma is heavenly! It smells just like you cracked open a fresh coconut. It arrives in solid form, (almost like a whipped consistency), but obviously melts in warmer temperatures. I have cooked with it and have also added it to hot Moringa tea. I primarily ordered this for pulling but it is also great when used as a carrier oil for any type of homemade or store bought moisturizing cream or butter. I would definitely purchase this again.",

I've ordered this many times and have come to rely on this brand. If they run out of it in the store, I order it online and would rather wait then buy another oil. It does melt in the summer, but I have never had a problem with rancidity, and consider the melting as a sign of its purity. I highly recommend Carrington Farms!",

      "text": "I was VERY disappointed that this product did NOT have 54 oz of coconut oil in it. The jar was only 2/3 full. When you first open the lid it appears to be filled to the top, but when you take off the top layer of oil (hard oil) there is a gaping hole right to the bottom of the jar. I am a soaper and use recipes that call for a certain amount of coconut oil, I only got 48.85 ounces out of the first jar, and the second jar I got 49.55 ounces. I will not purchase from this company again.",

It goes a long way, smells great, and absorbs fast, I like it because it is not some synthetic blend of chemicals like lotions. When lotion absorbs into your skin, you are getting chemicals. When you use coconut oil, you're getting just natural MCT and lauric acid which are great internally and externally on skin or hair.",
