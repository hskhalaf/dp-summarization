I had two other trimmers which were 2 cycle and sometimes finding good 2 cycle oil was a problem. Now check the oil on the motor and fill with unleaded and go. This trimmer just goes though weeds tall or short with ease. A nice big swath and with the better line I put on I hardly needed to tap to increase the line length. Very pleased and was glad I choose this trimmer.",
