      "title": "Wonderful Bamboo Steamer",
      "text": "I've steamed dumpling a few times so far, and they were delicious. The first time I used the included Liners, and it was pretty disastrous. The wrappers stuck to the dumplings and the only way to get them off was to mutilate my cute dumplings. The second time I used cabbage leaves instead of the Liners and the dumplings turned out perfect. I've used only cabbage leaves since then. Also, some reviewers mentioned that the Steamer imparts a weird taste to their food. Neither me nor the people I served the food to have noticed anything.",

The steamer worked perfect with my existing wok I just simmered water in the bottom of the wok then set the steamer on top. I am looking forward to using the steamer for pot stickers which is one of my favorite appetizers and prefer the chewiness you get from steaming vs frying.",
