      "text": "So, the tank itself is great! I've had one before, and loved it. Now, the stand they sent is really crap... The holes were drilled poorly and at odd angles, and off center of where they SHOULD be. With that, I cannot properly mount one of the doors, as the side panel overlaps where they placed the hole for the door... I would've sent it back, however I needed to set it up right when I received it as I had live rock, water and sand waiting... So, I'm not at all happy with this purchase as the stand really messed the whole thing up. Total bummer as the tank itself is great.",

      "text": "I absolutely love this tank! Would recommend for any one just starting out in the saltwater hobby. I already wish I would have gone bigger, but this is wonderful for my space. The tank stand is a little wobbly without the tank on it. However, once you get the tank on the stand filled with water, sand, and rock, it stays pretty stable.",
