I'm not sure what it does inside the dishwasher, but it doesn't clean dishes, doesn't remove coffee or tea stains from mugs or cups, doesn't get food particles off of silverware, and can't remove grease from ANYTHING. What a complete waste of time, money and water. This product owes ME stars!",

    "description": "Dishes should be odorless and clean after you wash them, right? We think so too. That's why Free & Clear Seventh Generation Dish Detergent Liquid Gel uses plant based enzyme blends for high cleaning power without the use of dyes and fragrances. This dishwasher soap is free of phosphates and chlorine bleach, and it's biodegradable so you can always feel good about what you dish out. It is truly a great choice amongst the dishwasher detergents. For more than 25 years, Seventh Generation has been thoughtfully formulating safe and effective plant based products that work. Really well, thanks to which this dishwasher detergent liquid is really effective. Our dishwasher liquid uses powerful plant based ingredients like surfactants and enzymes to break down tough residue and lift away food leaving your dishes sparkling clean. Yet you can call it a natural dish soap. So how does it all work? The enzymes in this natural dish soap cut through grease and food by breaking down starch and protein based residue while the surfactants remove dirt and grease by holding the molecules in suspension, so they can wash away. Yes, even those fussy egg stains. That's what our dishwasher soap can do. Based in Vermont, Seventh Generation is proud to be a Certified B Corporation. B Corps are certified to be better for workers, better for communities, and better for the environment. By choosing Seventh Generation products, you\u2019re joining us in nurturing the health of the next seven generations. *Safe when used as directed",
