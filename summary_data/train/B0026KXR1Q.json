But then I stopped using it for a few months, the ink on the printer heads dried up, and now the print quality is permanently messed up. The built-in nozzle cleaning function just sprays more ink everywhere and makes the problem worse. I even tried manually cleaning the nozzles, which was a huge pain considering that you can't remove them. No luck. It's a paperweight now. Lesson learned: you should never buy inkjet printers if you can avoid it. But if you must use inkjet, definitely avoid Epson.",

The quality is terrible: blurry, faint, lines missing, looks smeared. The unit is really loud! It has the option of printing in quiet mode (I can see why - but I've never even heard of that as an option on a printer before.) The printer has all sorts of features to help fix printing issues (nozzle check, clean heads, print head alignment) none of which resolve the printing issues.

Granted, the quiet printing setting reduces a lot of it and it still prints very fast with it on, but without the quiet print setting it's LOUD. It's really a minor annoyance though, as the quiet printing setting fixes that and it still prints very fast with it on.",

The NX515 boasts the fastest print speeds in its class (up to 2x faster than competitively priced models2), built-in Wi-Fi and Ethernet networking, high quality scanning, better image enhancement tools and a large, 2.5-inch color LCD screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat the press is saying:\n\n\"The NX515 not only earns its Editors' Choice award with room to spare, but resets the bar for what to expect from a home AIO.\" M. David Stone, PCMag.com, (9.2.09). Reprinted with permission. Copyright 2009 Ziff Davis Publishing Holdings Inc. All Rights Reserved. \n\n\n\n\nWireless access from anywhere in your home\n\nEliminate unnecessary wires and be more efficient, while sharing one printer at home. With built-in Wi-Fi and Ethernet networking, you can print, scan and access memory card slots wirelessly1. It\u2019s never been easier to use your all-in-one from anywhere in your home and share one product with multiple PCs.\n\n\nEveryday projects made easy The Epson Stylus NX515 is ideal for all your everyday projects. Scan and save important documents and photos. Make a high-quality copy, in color or black-and-white, with just one touch. Or, make multiple copies with ease. You can even reduce and enlarge documents and photos instantly \u2014 from 25 to 400%. Use the included software to create photo calendars and more. And, pair your all-in-one with Epson specialty paper to create colorful fliers and greeting cards.\n\n\n\nQuality and speed \u2014 the fastest print speed in its class2\n\nPrint documents with crisp, sharp text and photos with vivid, true-to-life color. The Epson Stylus NX515 delivers exceptional quality output, without sacrificing speed. Engineered with award-winning MicroPiezo\u00ae ink jet technology, this powerful performer prints up to 2x faster1 than competitively priced all-in-ones with maximum print speeds of 36 ppm black and color and laser quality print speeds of 15 ppm black and 9.3 ppm color\u2020.\n\n\nAmazing borderless photos, PC-free!\n\nBorderless photos are easy to achieve, with or without a computer! Print borderless photos in multiple sizes right from your memory card or camera. With a 2.5-inch LCD, PictBridge\u2122 support and built-in memory card slots, it's easy. Amaze your friends and family with PC-free photo restoration. Automatically bring the color back to old, faded photos at the touch of a button, without a computer.\n\n\nOriginalEpsonCompetitor \nBetter image enhancement tools\n\nEpson sets the highest standards for image quality compared to competitive products. Get amazing results automatically. Auto Photo Correction will correct the lighting in poorly exposed images to ensure you never print a bad photo. And, it includes advanced face detection, which distinguishes people from scenery, correcting the color accordingly to ensure beautiful, natural skin tones for results better than the competition. Also, with just the click of a button and no special software, you can even remove red eye.\n\n\nReplace only the color you need!\n\nThe Epson Stylus NX515 is smart to own. Individual ink cartridges give you control over ink usage. There are even multiple sizes available to accommodate your budget and specific print volume needs.

There\u2019s no need to spend additional money on specialized cartridges to print photos.\n\n\nEpsonCompetitor \n\nWorry-free handling\n\nWhile many competitive inks often take several minutes to dry, prints made with DURABrite\u00ae Ultra pigment ink allow you to handle documents and photos immediately after printing. Prints are smudge and water resistant \u2014 and even highlighter friendly. Plain paper documents resist fading up to six times longer than leading competitive prints3, making it easier than ever to archive important documents.\n\n\n\n\nSave paper with two-sided printing\n\nWith the Epson Stylus NX515, it\u2019s easy to print on both sides of the paper, saving money and paper. In fact, with manual, two-sided printing, you\u2019ll save up to 50% of your paper supply1.\n\nProduct protection you can count on\n\nThe Epson Stylus NX515 comes standard with a one-year limited warranty. It also includes a quick and convenient product exchange program. So, you can rest easy, knowing you have dependable service and support.\n\n\nBE MORE INFORMED\nThe new international ISO print speed standard Print speed is critically important when buying a printer or all-in-one. But how do you compare print speeds when different manufacturers measure in different ways? Now you can. Much like the \"MPG\" ratings on new cars, there's now a new industry standard for measuring print speed, which allows for an \"apples-to-apples\" comparison between different printer models and brands. The International Organization for Standardization (widely known as ISO) developed this industry approved and internationally accepted standard, specifically for ink jet printers and all-in-ones. It measures \"out of the box\" (default) print speeds using \"real world\" printing scenarios, so you can be sure you're getting a product that performs at the speed you need.\n\n\nFeatures/Benefits\n\n * Wi-Fi and Ethernet built in \u2014 share one printer with multiple PCs, wired or wirelessly; print, scan and share memory card files between your PC and printer, wirelessly1\n * Fastest print speeds in its class \u2014 up to 2x faster than competitively priced models2; maximum print speeds of 36 ppm black/color, laser quality print speeds of 15 ppm black and 9.3 ppm color\u2020\n * PC-free, borderless photos in a snap \u2014 2.5-inch, tilt LCD screen and built-in memory card slots\n * Scan directly to e-mail4 \u2014 restore the color to old, faded photos; better than the competition\n * Superior image enhancement tools \u2014 red-eye removal, automatic photo restoration, Automatic Photo Correction and more\n * Save time \u2014 make multiple copies (1 \u2014 99) with one touch; instantly reduce and enlarge copies 25 \u2013 400%\n * Manual Two-sided printing1 \u2014 a great way to save paper\n * Replace only the color you need \u2014 individual ink cartridges, available in different sizes\n * Truly touchable photos and documents \u2014 instant-dry ink for smudge, fade and water resistant prints\n * Unsurpassed print quality \u2014 get sharp documents and photos with precision detail and more accurate color\n * Standard ink set included \u2014 includes one 69 Black ink cartridge and three 69 color ink cartridges\n * Packaging Specifications \u2014 Dimensions 20.3 x 9.1 x 15.7 in (W x D x H) and Weight 16.5 lb.\n\nEco features\n\n * Save up to 50% of your paper supply with manual, two-sided printing1\n * ENERGY STAR\u00ae qualified\n * Designed to be Recycled5\n\n\n\nRecommended Supplies \nEpson Ink Supplies \n69 DURABrite Ultra Black ink cartridge (T069120) \n69 DURABrite Ultra Cyan ink cartridge (T069220) \n69 DURABrite Ultra Magenta ink cartridge (T069320) \n69 DURABrite Ultra Yellow ink cartridge (T069420) \n69 DURABrite Ultra color multi-pack (3 colors) (T069520) \n*69 for standard-capacity \n\nEpson Paper Supplies \nPremium Presentation Paper Matte Double-sided 8.5 x 11 in, 50 sheets (S041568) \nBright White Paper 8.5 x 11 in, 500 sheets (S041586) \nPresentation Paper Matte 8.5 x 11 in, 100 sheets (S041062) \nPremium Photo Paper Semi-gloss 8.5 x 11 in, 20 sheets (S041331) \nPremium Photo Paper Glossy 4 x 6 in, 100 sheets (S041727) \n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s in the Box\n\n * Stylus NX515 All-in-One\n * Instruction booklet\n * CD-ROM containing printer drivers and software (Windows and Macintosh\u00ae)\n * One 69 Black ink cartridge\n * One 69 Cyan ink cartridge\n * One 69 Magenta ink cartridge\n * One 69 Yellow ink cartridge\n\n\nEpson Stylus NX series\nSmart.
