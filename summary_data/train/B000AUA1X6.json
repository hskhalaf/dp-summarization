During the first canning process I noticed that my rack was rusting. This was very disappointing to me as the item is designed to be in water during use! How the heck ca it rust, well clearly I should have opted to purchase a more expensive canning rack (Ball or Williams Sanoma) because now I have to purchase one anyway to replace the new one that I just used once..... I will never recommend this product and am extremely disappointed.",

    "description": "Capture summer fruits and vegetables at their prime for enjoyment throughout the year by canning at home. This seven-piece canning kit provides all the essential tools needed for getting started. A jar lifter, a magnetic lid lifter, two canning funnels, sterilizing rack, canning rack, and natural cheese cloth. To safely remove hot jars and lids after they've been sterilized in boiling water, use the jar lifter to pick up the jars and the magnetic lid lifter to easily remove the lids, with no risk of burned fingers. Choose from two canning funnels. The wide mouth canning funnel directs ingredients into the jar quickly and cleanly and offers a wide design that accommodates both regular and wide-mouth jars. The narrow 6 inch funnel is excellent for straining into narrow jars and comes with a detachable strainer. Also available is our sterilizing rack that holds 12 canning lids, and our canning rack which is designed to hold jars as you lower and raise them from your cooking pot. (Holds up to 7 quart or 7 pint jars; 12-inch diameter fits most pots- keeps jars from touching each other or the canner). Made of steel and features elongated handles on either side for ease of use.",
