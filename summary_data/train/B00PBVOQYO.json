Super disappointed considering I've bee getting these treats for the last 4 years with no issues. Not worth the hassle of returning, but I will be getting from somewhere else from now on.",

They are soft and easy to break up; however, as others have mentioned they do tend to flake and create a lot of crumbs so keep that in mind. They are too big for my 10 lb beagle pup to take down whole during training sessions. But they are a different type of treat and she seems to like them. Not a super strong odor like other treats have. Another good quality product from Blue Buffalo.",
