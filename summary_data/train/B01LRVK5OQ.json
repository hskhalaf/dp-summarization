He has a tongue tie that the doctor wants to wait another 2 weeks to see if he latch gets better before he snips it. We have the normal Avent bottles with the newborn nipples and they also help reduce air consumption. But the nipples on these anticolic bottles are shaped a lot different! And if your still thinking about purchasing these just go on baby\u2019s r us website and look to see how much 1 single bottle costs with an anticolic nipples on it for newborns. Highly recommend!!!",

The brush in here isn't easy to use as a bottle brush and the formula container was hard to shake formula out of(notice I said SHAKE, because it wouldn't easily pour). This seems to be a popular brand so that's why I gave it a try, and I will say that I was impressed with how long the nipples lasted and didn't retain any smells like some of the cheaper brands do. I was introduced to a brand called Como Tomo and I'll never use anything else but that.",

I hold the bottle upside down and the milk comes out in very quick drops. My baby is one week old and she choked quickly using this bottle. They will likely be fine when she is older, but by then she will be eating more so the small bottles wont really be of much use to us, unless I can get even slower flow nipples.",
