      "text": "I have owned Pal Radios for years, the new version requires a 9 volt charger rather than a 12 volt charger. Buyer beware this newer 9 volt version will not play while charging. According to Tivoli this change was made to extend the battery life. Brilliant! So in the middle of listening to the radio when the battery dies you have to wait until the battery has recharged before you resume listening. The portability and the ability to listen while charging and on the battery was the major reason I continued to purchase PAL radio instead of going to the Sonos system, not any more.",

My wife bangs the headphone jack when the radio falls over, and the socket comes loose, so we need to get another; not the fault of Tivoli, just a heads up. Love the radio, sound is balanced and awesome. Looks cool in my office. Works best with the antenna down and the charging cord unplugged; we are also on a boat with very bad reception, but this picks up when others will not. I would buy another.",

Overall, it functions as intended. The shape is convenient for placing anywhere. The single speaker sounds ok, but there are many better sounding options available. The battery power is respectable, lasting about 8-10 hours on a charge. The tuner is somewhat disappointing. I expected it to lock on to a station much better. All things considered, its nothing more than a portable radio. To earn more stars, the tuner and speaker need to be improved.",
