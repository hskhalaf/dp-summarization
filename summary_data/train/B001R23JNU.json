      "text": "I bought this for my wife who is a very experienced photographer. The original plan was to buy a more expensive model. But we ended up getting this one instead. We are not disappointed at all. I'm on a three year stay in Hawaii for the Army and on our off days we like to go snorkeling. So far it has performed admirably. Underwater shots taken in low light conditions are of mediocre quality but ones taken in full sunlight are superb. Macro shots are my wife's favorite and on a recent trip to Shark's Cove she was amazed by the quality this camera returned. The video is of that trip.",

However, all that aside, the picture quality is horrible. I was so disappointed. I actually returned it because of this fact. For 10mp it should have had great picture quality. My Nikon Coolpix 5mp has way better picture quality so I'll stick with it now. For the Fuji Z33WP though, I could not believe how grainy the pictures were. I even used multiple settings and megapixels to see if I could be satisfied but it didn't work. Keep this in mind if you plan on purchasing this camera.",

I took this camera to Six flags and went into the water and down the slides with the camera all day long. Worked Great! Went to the beach and also performed 100%. Camera is small enough to fit into a pocket and comes with a wrist strap that I used in the water. Very easy to set up and install battery and card. easy transfer to computer to download photos. The camera does come with a quick set up guide which is really all that is needed. Purchased from Adorama. Quick shipping! Have Fun in the Sun!!!",

And take PHENOMENAL underwater shots and video it did!!! For the price it was a steal. Too bad I dropped mine in the ocean in Mexico last December because from what I understand, they made some changes to the most recent model that have made it not that great. Prior to Mexico this camera has been snorkeling in Hawaii several times, floating on the river, out on the boat...and survived it all. I am generally not gentle with these things either. WISH THEY WOULD BRING IT BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

The camera lived up to every expectation! It was great for all of the snorkeling we did and not only took great underwater pictures, but the recording feature works awesome too! This is hands down, one of the best and most affordable investments we made this summer! Our only wish is that the camera's zoom feature was better, but its not something we can't live with. If you're looking for something affordable and compact for underwater use, this is a great choice. :)",

The picture quality is pretty good, I just use it when we are at the beach or pool. I use it with a long strap that can be worn around the neck, it doesn't bother me to swim or float. It has a pretty good image zoom, enough for playing around with kids. Easy to use under water and it takes the pictures very fast, much better than my non-waterproof cannon or sony. This is an excellent choice to be used as a secondary camera just for water fun.",

I use my DSLR for those pics, instead. When I was shopping around for a waterproof camera, I was deciding between this one and a similarly priced Olympus one. I chose this one because it was cheaper and seemed to have better customer reviews. I have not been disappointed.

Still, I was able to film whale sharks up close while swimming alongside them, and if you stay very shallow in clear water (less than 10 feet), you'll get satisfactory results.

      "text": "Purchased this camera back in December for Christmas for my teen daughter. Went to Cancun right after Christmas and she loved taking photos in the pool and at the beach. Also nice for boating trips and swim parties! She loves the \"easy video\" button and the fact that she can charge her battery and not worry about AA's. We also had fun taking photos in the rain in Paris. Overall a great camera. And it was less expensive on Amazon than in Target - BTW, Target does not sell this camera in Pink.",

I took the batteries out and replaced them with fresh batteries, still no luck. The pictures I took with the camera were still fine in the sim card, and nothing appeared wet or damaged, just no power. Very disappointed!",

    "title": "Fujifilm FinePix Z33WP 10MP Waterproof Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Pink)",
    "description": "Color:PinkFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe FinePix Z33WP is Fujifilm\u2019s first waterproof digital camera. No longer do you need to worry about damaging your camera in less than optimum shooting conditions. The FinePix Z33WP ensures you\u2019ll never miss capturing any of life\u2019s precious moments, any where, any time, under any conditions, and be able to share them easily with your extended network of friends and family members. The 10-megapixel FinePix Z33WP is ready for any adventure including underwater activity up to 10 feet. The Z33WP uses a Fujinon 3x optical zoom lens, has Fujifilm\u2019s \u2018Automatic Scene Recognition\u2019 SR AUTO mode, and features a 2.7-inch, 230,000 pixel resolution LCD screen. \n\n\n\nIntelligent Scene Recognition\nAdding ease to outdoor navigation, the FinePix Z33WP is equipped with a new SR Auto (Automatic Scene Recognition) mode that enables the camera to intelligently recognize six types of scenes automatically. For each picture taken in this mode, the Z33WP will optimize the ideal exposure, focus, white balance and ISO for the scene to ensure the best quality picture is captured with ease. In addition, Fujifilm\u2019s Picture Stabilization is powered by high sensitivity for faster shutter and operational speeds to help reduce camera shake, keeping real life moments as true to form as possible. \n\nEasy Sharing\nThe family-friendly Z33WP also features Fujifilm\u2019s handy Blog Mode which allows for easier sharing with friends and family members. The Blog mode automatically resizes a photo to a standard 640x480 pixels (VGA) or 320x240 pixels (QVGA) image size and enables 12 in-camera editing features such as Zooming, Miniature effect, Illustration and Painting, cutting the need for extra time with home editing. \n\nIn addition to these innovations, the FinePix Z33WP is loaded with the following handy features:  *  Face Detection in action\n * Face Detection Technology: Operating in tandem with automatic red-eye removal, the FinePix Z33WP identifies up to 10 human faces in a scene, and sets the correct focus and exposure, regardless of where subjects are located within the frame. \n * Automatic Red Eye Removal accents the aforementioned features by lending an extra touch to that group shot. The Z33WP automatically checks for red eye and self-corrects it in each and every person in the photo, saving time on post-editing. \n * Couple and Group Timer Modes: Working in conjunction with Face Detection technology, detects two faces in 'Couple Timer Mode' and up to four faces in 'Group Timer Mode' in a frame. \n * One Touch MOVIE Button: Capture VGA quality movie clips at 30 frames per second with sound to capture all of those once-in-a-lifetime moments. \n * Battery Life: The long-life rechargeable Li-ion battery (up to 200 shots) allows for extended use without worrying if the camera is going to last for the duration of the trip.",
