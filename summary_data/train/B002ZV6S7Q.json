It has to be the most neglected item on my computing desk and the most used. I have tons of stuff hanging off every place you can plug something into and each one can make me pull my remaining hair out! But the mouse? It just takes care of itself with aplomb! Wish it were that way with all my other devices that they would behaved as well!",

      "text": "This mouse works very well. It feels a little too heavy if you need to lift it a lot like I do with a small space to operate it, probably because of the batteries required. It is very accurate at pointing. But it seems a little tail heavy when manuvering it since the sensor is in the rear part of the mouse. It worked right away on my window xp pc and ok after downloading the software on my Mac. The dongle is nice and small. All in all, I'm satisfied with it. It also helped that it was on sale.",

The only slight issue is the USB receiver that plugs in is a little long in length but not too ong to be a nuisance. The on-off switch is very convenient as well! I will be buyin a second USB mouse for my travel use!!!",

It's obviously ultra-portable and even has a slot-type thing on the bottom to put the usb connector when you're on the go. I couldn't have asked for a better mouse for the price. Battery-powered (2 AA), and yet still very good life per set of batteries. The on/off switch also makes it very easy to control when you want to conserve battery power. Less than $20 and utterly functional. A great purchase, no regrets/letdowns.",
