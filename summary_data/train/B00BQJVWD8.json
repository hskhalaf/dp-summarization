Everyone has commented on what a sharp, good picture this tv has. Yes, the Toshiba system might be a little slower than others, but waiting an extra second or two isn't a deal-breaker for us. We only watch television and DVD's, so can't comment on gaming features and the like.",

My family arrived and stayed over the weekend I received the TV, and oh my goodness, we all loved it so much we wanted to sleep in front of it. I have always been a fan of Toshiba, and as usual they did not let me down. My family said the picture was so vivid it almost looked 3D. Haven't used the keyboard yet, but everything else is awesome.",

After a little bit of tweaking using recommended settings i got from Tom's Hardware; colors are perfect as well.",
