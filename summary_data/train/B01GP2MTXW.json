Going back to pampered chef as I have a board that is over 10 yrs old that needed to be replaced. I cook almost everyday and being vegetarian I chop a LOT of veges!! The good ratings have to be bogus! Nope, no attempts to improve, just look at the 1 star ratings and pictures- they are aware and do not care. Looks like many are having this problem and they are choosing not to fix it!! Look back as this has been a complaint since December of 2016!!",

I should have sent them back, but somehow the hassle of doing that seemed like more work that it was worth. I would not recommend purchasing them.",

And, they're easy to clean after you use them. The surface is so smooth everything washes right off. We've only had ours for a short time but they get used 2-3 times daily and so far our knives are not leaving any cutting marks on the boards. I would definitely recommend this set.",

Rather than having one large or small cutting board for all your kitchen projects this \"set\" provides the flexibility to choose the right board for your needs. They are very study and made of hard material. Easy to clean, dishwasher safe and they look good too. I highly recommend this product!!",

We recently held a White Elephant Christmas party at his house and that was when I finally got to use it and everything about it was great especially the hooves, that was AMAZING!! I did NOT have to worry about the food spilling onto the counters. The cutting boards we used before did not have any hooves. Overall, they\u2019re beautiful, nicely made, and I can\u2019t wait to buy my own set!",

Let me be more specific: The boards are reversible and have a juice channel on just one side (which in my mind is an advantage). However, with the juice channel side up, the rubber borders don't extend below the white cutting surface far enough to fully grip the counter., so they slide aroud a bit. But with the juice channel down, they grip great. I just wish the rubber borders were a little thicker.",
