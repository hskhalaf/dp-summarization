Wired both through an 80A SPDT relay using the original horn wires as the trigger, but supplying current through a 40A resettable breaker on 10 gauge wire. The Tornado is a dual tone horn and the Hurricane a single tone, but on a different sound wavelength so I have ridiculously loud triple tone horn solution that's still relatively compact and installed in the OEM horn positions. Just don't be the person that starts to pull out in front of me or wander into my lane on the interstate or you'll need new pants.",

The sound lacks balls and IMO, the 1970 Cadillac Coupe de Ville horn is a better sounding deep thrusting get out of the way horn.

I squeezed it into spot where factory horn was mounted (2011 Wrangler JKU, so between radiator, driver-side headlight, and windshield washer fluid reservoir). Seems pretty loud so far but I\u2019ll update this as I go along, good or bad. Also, gonna need to upgrade factory 10A mini-blade fuse to at least 20A. It clicks and vibrates a split second when I arm the alarm via key fob, I guess because it needs longer electrical discharge time to activate. Tried panic button; loud, so good.

Do not use the horn wiring that comes on a motorcycle. Use the factory horn power wired to trigger your relay not the horn and make sure you have a fully charged battery. When done properly according to the instructions it is the loudest horn on the road for a 2 or 4 wheel vehicle. I highly recommend it if you really want to get another drivers attention.",

Only downside is that now you sound angry anytime you hit the horn - even if you mean to politely honk (say, someone left their coffee mug on top of their car) to get their attention, you're now blasting them with 110 db.",

It has to be one of the best purchases I've ever made. I connected it to the wiring of the original horn (which I removed), secured it to the car and tested it. It was the loudest horn I've ever heard and easily gets people's attention if needed. I will absolutely purchase another one of these when I get a new car.",
