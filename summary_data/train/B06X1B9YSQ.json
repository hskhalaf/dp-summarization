Not one to buy multiples of the same shoe in different sizes, and send the ill fitting pairs back: I just returned them and received a refund. But if you want to take the chance on sizing, the shoes were super cute and appeared to be well made!",

At that point, I felt it didn\u2019t matter what size, either 5.5 or 6 it was not going to fit right on me. If however, you have wide feet, it may work for you. One more important thing, I returned the shoes, but they took almost $5 for shipping which was not fair. Look for free returns when you purchase these shoes. Thanks,",
