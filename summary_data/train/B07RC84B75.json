And it would never have come out in one piece. So. I don't know how the New York Times Wirecutter came up with its recommendation, but this is a completely useless product.",

It's design means it doesn't hold as much volume as I'd expect it to. Once washed, you'll need to place it inverted over something so that it can air dry. I tried filling it with water, sealing it, then placing pressure on the bag. The seal quickly gave way, and water gushed out all over the sink and back splash. So, while this bag works ok for solids, I would not recommend using it for liquids. Ever. I'm not at all thrilled with this bag, but my wife likes it so far.",

Even when I burped it, it opened on its own if something knocked against it in my bag. Luckily, the first time this happened it did not contain a liquid or it would have caused a mess.

Now, my freezer is full of these holding fish, prawns, hamburger, chicken - all right from the store, in their original store packing, and stuffed into the Stashers. Freezes everything without the extra frost that usually accumulates. Food thaws without the excess water and meats/seafood retain their texture and flavors. I also successfully freeze extra pancakes, bagels and breads. Very happy with my investment in this product.",
