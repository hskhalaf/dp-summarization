I had tried a few different tires from a few different brands (even some kevlar varieties), but nothing has held up like these Gatorskin Hardshells. I plan on only riding on these tires from now on. No more random, undependable cheapies for me.",

DuraSkin anti-cut fabric protects the Gator Hardshell from bead to bead, wrapping further into the sidewall to protect from side attacks. An extra-wide Poly-X Breaker covers the entire tread strip, adding another degree of puncture resistance and increasing tire life -- all without the added weight of other all-season tires.\n\n * Lightweight Continental DuraSkin protects from cuts, punctures and abrasions \n * Poly-X Breaker lays tightly overlapped fibers of polyester to add resistance to thorns or shards without increasing rolling resistance \n * \"Reflex\" reflective sidewall increases visibility at night \n * Tread pattern deflects debris, reducing the risk of collecting it on the tire",

      "DURASKIN- Sidewall protection coming from the high quality polyamide fabric encasing the core casing of the tire from scuffs and cuts under the worst conditions.",
      "HARDSHELL- Hardshell protection is comprised of three main components, a deep casing overlap providing added sidewall protection, and extra wide PolyX breaker protecting the entire tread strip and finally, the casing is sheltered by a bead to bead layer of DuraSkin fabric.",
