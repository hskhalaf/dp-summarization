Weak bass, weak treble, simply a weak junk As portable sound system, I would give the Killburn a 9/10, Bose 6/10, Stockwell 4/10 Go for the Killburn. Avoid Stockwell",

The other drawback, is while the design is slick and iconic to look at, carrying this around is not practical, except if you put it in a backpack or bag of somekind. Moving it around the house, can get dicey, because there is really no good place to hold it. But that is minor problem as far as I am concerned.",
