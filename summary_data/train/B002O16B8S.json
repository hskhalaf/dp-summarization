Happy with my purchase and hope that you will be too.",

The hot pink was a hit and the wool stayed fairly fluffy after daily winter rough wears. It repelled sand, dirt and water fairly well and doesn't stained too much. Knocked down a star because after awhile, the interior sole, the wool started to bunched and she complained it annoyed her.",
