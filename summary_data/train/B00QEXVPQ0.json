Sadly, I've only found this out because I want to return it. This has stupid recharging. You can't just plug it in & go: it says you can't recharge for more than 5 hours, which means you have to babysit it while it's charging. Buy en Emjoi -- they have fantastic products.",

      "text": "This is a Fantastic product! I was a little hesitant to order at first but I am so glad that I did. For less than a price of just one pedicure I now have super soft uncallused feet. As an extra bonus, my BF also had some deep cracks which are now healing because the callus around the cracks has been removed. Not saying that this will heal the crack, but with the callus removed the cracks can now heal. I am very happy with this purchase and will be buying these for Christmas gifts ;-)",

You just have to be patient, do a little at a time, and then after a couple of days your feet are smooth as can be. Be sure, though, to lotion them up every night before you go to bed with whatever lotion works best for you (I prefer Gold Bond for Diabetics, even though I'm not diabetic!) and put those white socks on. I'm so happy I bought this product, and you will be too!",

After that I let it recharge for about 6 hours. The next day the power was lackluster that I could stop the spinning with my finger. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and changed the outlet that I was charging from. However the same thing happened. I'm not impressed, the battery probably is defective. That being said the instructions had the numbers crossed out and handwritten for the number of hours needed for charging. A good product that only worked once for me.",

I also like how there is a coarse and super coarse option because there are some areas that require a little more aggressive removal and others a little less. Overall very pleased with the fast delivery and product quality.",

If you are patient, you will probably eventually get the most hardened skin sanded off, but it's not as quick as you might think. It most definitely does not eliminate the need to have a routine pedicure, but you might be able to squeeze in an additional week between pedicures if you use this.",

This allows that impulse use versus planning a foot soak which can be a great timesaver and convenient. Easy to hold as it is lightweight and conforms to the hand comfortably. No vibration felt - great power with its rechargeable battery which I prefer over the battery operated devices. Easy to clean rollers and head.",
