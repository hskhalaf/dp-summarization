I figured I'd take a gamble, and everything was perfect. I bought this based on a CNET recommendation. You can view a short video on their site and they show you all of the bells and whistles. I basically wanted something for listening, but the fact that it has so many other options on it was a plus. The sound is really great. Even the small speaker on the player is pretty good for being what it is. I've plugged it into a receiver and sounds better that way.",

Reasonable built in speaker (ok so it's not surround sound stereo!) allows for playback at record shows, while you're on vacation etc... Battery option allows sound-hounds to check quality at garage sales before buying... Alltogether a nice turntable for the price. I upgraded from the ITTUSB, and am very happy with my decision. Built in carry case makes this perfect in my book! Ok so not the kind of thing you'd buy to create your 'home theatre' system, but ideal for the hobbyist/small time vinyl explorer",

The turntable works very well and I am overall pleased. The replacement styluses are available on Amazon at a reasonable price. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to digitize vinyl records.",

Audacity works well for basic ripping and trimming of the records, haven't used it for more complex work. If you are purchasing this record player to listen to your records directly, you may be disappointed. Sounds decent with a pair of headphones, but the built in speaker is very weak and poor sounding. Has controls to slightly speed up or slow down a record, which works well.",

My only complaint is that it doesn't have a lid like the old fashioned record players which leaves it unprotected.",

I put on one album and knew I was done with this, returned it right away. The sound from my cellphone speaker sounds way better and is way louder than the speaker on this thing. So if all you want to do is rip mp3s maybe this might work, but if you want it to enjoy listening to records, don't even bother. Its cheap plastic, thats all.",
