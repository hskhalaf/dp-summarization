I was ready to return the set because I was so frustrated, but with this fix, it works much better, and I'm happy with the product.",

I highly recommend buying the railway clips (sure track clips) that keep the pieces that are elevated (bridges) together where they meet. My son is 2 and was able to destroy all of my hard work in seconds but the clips really helped keep everything together once I got them on. We put this on the M&D green and white table and it fits perfectly. The table is a good buy too. Pretty large but perfect for the littles to play on!",

The colors are bright and catchy. My son can sit and play with trains for hours. It\u2019s a great toy.

      "text": "My kid loves it but I am slightly disappointed in the quality. The narrow radius turn tracks cause the train engines to bind in the track, the bridges are too low if you want to make a custom track that goes under the bridge, and the instruction for building the pre planned tracks don't line up right. Some of the pieces when connected aren't centered so the tracks don't line up perfectly which causes the trains to derail. We picked the Melissa and Doug brand and not a knock off because we expected the pieces to fit better and unfortunately that was not the case here.",

My daughter will push a train through a turn and the whole thing just falls off. The magnets between the train cars are not very strong and they separate rather easily.

Whenver other kids visit our house, this is still one of the most-played-with toys. And, our 2-y.o. son is just getting started playing with them. We picked up a train table on the cheap just before we bought this, and the table has helped make the train set a prominent (and largely permanent) toy.",

The same train also has a wheel that has never functioned properly. However, for the price we paid for the set we got more than we expected. Kudos to Melissa & Doug!",
