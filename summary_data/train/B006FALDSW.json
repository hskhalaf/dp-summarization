      "text": "Very disappointed. After reading so many glowing reviews, decided to upgrade from our ancient reel mower. The biggest problem for me was the two sets of wheels, requiring the operator to bear down on the handle to lift the front wheels in order to turn in the opposite direction. On my small, tight lawn, that didn't work very well. Additionally, it is quite heavy so, while easy to push in a straight line for me, the turning was difficult. I wanted to love it, but ended up returning it after one use. My antique mower is easier and more efficient.",

Neighbors tell me that they are going to by one now. Only downside......if you have long weeds, you may have to cut over area several times.

And it is quiet, so in the summertime when it stays light later I will be able to mow when I get home from work.",

You will need weed eater. There is a learning curve.... I have different type of grass in my front yard and if its damp (dew) you CANNOT push it.... it slides. I have a weed eater and I wait for few to dry now...or work in back yard first...that type of grass is okay when slightly damp. Overall I really enjoy this.

On a well-groomed lawn (cut often and weed free) this mower is like cutting each blade of grass with scissors. Perfect even cut like a golf course.

My husband is tall so he has the handle positioned in such a way that when pushing the mower up our small incline the handle folds in. There should be a way to lock the folding handle. Otherwise it cuts OK except for the fine seed heads, which is annoying. I think we'll stick with our regular Honda mower from now on.",
