I could not sleep with this on, as it began to hurt over time from pressure points on my face. The smell of neoprene from the \u201cwetsuit\u201d like material is overwhelming and just as much of a reason why I could not continue wearing it through the night.

The ear-slots are not aligned correctly. The strap won't stay in place over my head. Do yourself a favor and find one that has dual head straps to hold it in place.
