You couldn't pet him without coming back with a handful of hair. he felt greasy and dirty and you could feel small mats in his undercoat and after 30 minutes with this brush he felt like a whole new cat. Now it's not too much different than a regular slicker brush but the ability to easily clean it makes the difference for me simply because he is impatient and if you take too long to clear the brush he'll get bored and walk away. Works very well definitely recommend it.",

After doing all of my online research, I found this brush which was consistently rated one of the best. It works beautifully! It is gentle yet very effective in helping to remove mats and for de-shedding. Grooming sessions have become a much more pleasant experience. Thank you!",
