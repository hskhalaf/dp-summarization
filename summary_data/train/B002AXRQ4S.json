It stays on for a very long time and doesn't leave my lips feeling like they've been coated in gunk. It does dry your lips out a bit, but thats normal with long-wear lip products and is easily fixed with some chapstick after removing it in the evening. I'd also suggest to put this product on layer by layer. I hate when I can feel product on my lips, and making sure you give each thin layer a chance to dry before building up the color really helps with that. Pictured is Premier Plum, my favorite.",

It is a little drying, so carry some lip balm to apply over it, but it's not irritating at all. Also not sticky once it dries. The Nude #1 color is very natural looking, a balanced pink/beige color. I am very fair but this would work for many different skin tones. I also bought the Iconic Iris color which is a little more pink but also very natural looking.",

This particular item though seemed different - it was less creamy, didn't last as long, and when it would start wearing off it became kind of a pasty gray color. It seems like something is wrong with this color or the product has been modified somehow.",
