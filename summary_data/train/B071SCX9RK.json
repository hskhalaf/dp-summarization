This allows me to store my bungee cords, keys, wallet, and i love how there are two zipper tabs with loops so you can use a small lock in needed. My other swag zipper bike bags do not, which annoy me, but this has it, so its very functional. The touch screen works great. The only thing that is annoying is if you get a call, you can't access the phone quickly, but i will pull over and put the call on speaker. but that's not much different than other phone holders. Anyways, long story short, this is a great functional add on to my bike, i would recommend.",

      "text": "Was searching for a handlebar phone bag that would fit an iPhone 8 Plus. Overall, I didn't like the build quality of this bag. The clear plastic was thinner and flimsier than that of an older bag that I had from another manufacturer. The visor was thinner than it appeared in the photos and was almost like a sheet of plastic paper. The zippers would stick and I would struggle a little to open the bag. I can't recommend this. They could have used better materials and I would have gladly paid $6 more. Will keep looking.",

I don\u2019t ride In the rain (on purpose) and I haven\u2019t been caught in a downpour (yet \ud83e\udd1e) so I can\u2019t attest to the water resistance but I really love this bag!",

It's not a particularly snug fit for an iphone 7 but touch functions do work and there's enough slack on the bottom to plug in a charger cable all inside the case. The phone won't sit centered since this is oversized but works sufficiently to see. I think a iphone plus would take up the full space but likely leave no room to plug in a charger cable. Was able to fit a battery pack in the pouch section to keep my phone charged for a 6 hour ride. There is no direct opening for headphones and the zippers stop at the bottom corners.",
