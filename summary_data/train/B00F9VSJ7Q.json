I LOVE making logos for people with this. Bands, landscapes, everything! I love the big ideas of this camera and think this 360 instant click form will take over all of photography/video in 5-10 years. This camera would be perfect if it was 50+ MP rather than about 5 MP like it is now. Video mode would be great as well since Oculus Rift is launching ~2015 and I can't wait for that either! Exciting times people :D",

      "text": "I need to take photos of existing homes and businesses in order to create building plans for my design and drafting business. This camera is a god-send. With this camera I only have to go to the job site once to record existing conditions. Each photo shows a 360-degree view plus up and down. It's easy to use and fast. Typically I stand out of camera view and take the photo using my cell phone. I recommend using it with the Grifiti Nootle Stand tripod, because the latter has a very small profile that won't take up much room in your pictures.",

I was able to load the android app onto my BlackBerry and it works flawlessly but it does drain the battery for some reason. As I've read in other reviews, the image quality suffers only a little in low light. And the resolution won't be enough for Occulus Rift users, but if you like to play with different panoramic projections (i.e., stereographic little planets, this won't disappoint.",

You can hold the camera yourself and be in the photo, or use your phone to remotely trigger the device. The resolution of the images isn't quite as high as the multi image process, but for fun shots it's fine.",
