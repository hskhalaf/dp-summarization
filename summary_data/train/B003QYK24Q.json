I now have zero issues getting her bow on an airplane.. so much room in it as well .. only flaw I saw was I wish there was a way to latch or buckle the handle side that rolls because that handle gets a little beat up when rolling it . But that\u2019s about it .. we absolutely love this case !",

The only two improvements I could suggest would be 1) make it lighter and 2) make it possible to protect the handles. The handles are very solid and they click-lock in the \"down\" position, but I worry that if they get pulled up during transport, they may then get knocked off by the cargo gorillas. I have not flown with the case yet, although I'm sure many people have.",

The case is solid and water proof and will withstand many years of hauling away. It is a large case, though, but should last a lifetime. The workmanship on the case is very good and is not cheap but heavy duty.",

Cons: It is big and heavy. It offsets this to some degree by having wheels.",
