Using it while barefooted (no-shoe Korean household) and wearing shoes (if coming in from the outside). Pros: Smooth. Super smooth operation. Ease. Requires only a little force to push down. Quiet. I was curious if it would make a loud sound snapping up. It doesn\u2019t. Great installation. A template was provided so you know just how high/low to place it on your door! Bonus. Love that the rubber foot can be lowered as it wears away from use. Extending the life of the foot and reducing waste. Cons: None yet. Will update if I encounter any.",

      "text": "Very nice! No more bending over! These are especially nice for people who are handicapped or mobility impaired, as the door stop can easily be released with a walking cane. You don't want to chock the door to full open position though, as you need just a tiny bit of additional push to make releasing the stop effortless. I work in a public facility and we've installed these on all our public access doors.",

Easy install, template provided, marked spots for holes, drilled small pilot hole and secured to door. Love the fact you can engage the door stop and disengage it with your foot and no need to bend over.",

The automatic pop-up feature to raise the stop works well, but it can also get in the way when you want to lower the stop. Annoying a bit, but overall, the design is quite good. I purchased two more units based on my experience.",

Consider using bolts that go through the door (with the appropriate sealant if necessary) rather than just using wood screws: it'll last a lot longer and won't loosen as much with time/use.",
