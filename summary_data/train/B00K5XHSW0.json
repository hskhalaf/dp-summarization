      "text": "This kegerator works just like described. Perfect for a keg of brew. Cools great and holds the temp +- 2 degrees. Been using it now for 2 weeks and love it. Added a tower fan to keep the beer cool to the tap but other than that, only addition i made was a high accuracy thermometer to test the cooling. Hoping it keeps working for yrs into the future.",

So far the kegerator appears to be a big hit especially since it is on wheels and can be moved the backyard near the pool.",

I haven't added fans yet, but intend to. However, it comes out ice cold, so I haven't gotten in any hurry to do it. Everything works as it should. I think it's an excellent value for the money.",
