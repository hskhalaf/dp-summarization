Takes up a bit more space than a traditional laptop due to the tilt/slant feature. However, for typing maybe it helps? One downside is accessing the F-keys - need to hold fn then press the key. Another downside is initially had a few problems with crashes but now those seem to be removed.",

Cortana guided me through the usual initial settings, but as soon as that part was over, Windows did not start and I instead got the WHEA uncorrectable error (see pictures), which is usually caused by some type of hardware failure. In addition the laptop started overheating right away. Sent back for a refund today (the same day I received it). Really disappointed (waiting for my refund now).",

QUICK UPDATE 13/10/2020 Over the last few months the laptop has now been blue screening constantly, it's not even use-able. I can't seem to get through to amazon to get product support for it. ASUS won't repair it either because its 'over warranty'. Disastrous",
