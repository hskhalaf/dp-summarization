This lens has been attached to my camera since I purchased and has been fully protected with cap and my camera kept in bag when not in use. It has been greatly cared for with minimal use... maybe 300 photos taken on it. Suddenly stopped focusing properly and causing a malfunction error on camera. Images show in focus through viewfinder but all images come out blurry once captured. Cleaned the contacts and still doesn\u2019t work. Very disappointed.",

After 10-15 shots my camera showed \"Err 01 Communications between the camera and lens is faulty. Clean the lens contacts.\" The connections were clean and all my other lenses work perfectly. Sent it back for a refund. I'll try the Canon F1.8 and hope I get a better result.",

      "text": "Absolutely my favorite lens in my kit. At $45, it's nearly 1/3 the cost of the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM lens, and while it lacks the STM feature, it's still a must-buy for the majority of beginner/intermediate photographers. The depth-of-field \"bokeh\" effect the Yongnuo YN50mm lens simply elevated my game. It's become my go-to lens for portrait shots and still photography. Regarding experience: I'm not a professional photographer, but I've been shooting with Canon EF SLR and DSLR cameras for a little over 12 years now with about 15 years of Photoshop experience to support it.",

It's slightly louder and takes a bit longer to find focus, but I don't mind. This lens is *not* rugged, but rather similar to the canon version so it should be treated with the same care.

I'd lobby for my money back, but warranty term has expired. I will not buy again, and do not recommend this product.",
