Also, the lid seal doesn't do a great job. I've had to clean the oil off the counter that leaked out. Besides these annoyances it's not a bad product for keeping your pan seasoned.",

I have hundreds of cast iron pots, pans, bowls, skillets, lids and Dutch ovens. Yes, reversible large and small grill/griddles too. Be sure to buy a tube or two of this cast iron conditioner it is your cast iron cookware's best friend. Thanks.",
