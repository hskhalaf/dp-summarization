By the way: It definitely held 2 Adults who carry a good weight on them and no problems whatsoever.",

      "text": "We ordered three different floats for our above-ground pool, and this one is my favorite. I like that you can relax in it like a hammock, and it's got the back float to serve like a pillow, and I like that you can straddle it and lean on the front float too. Pretty easy contraption that works well and keeps me afloat and doesn't take as much space as some of the other floats. . The color is a nice bright turquoise. We're happy with it. My husband likes it too and it holds him up well.",

Very easy to maneuver yourself around the pool unlike a raft, where just go where the raft takes you. However, it can also be used as a raft, if you prefer to lay back. The whole family likes this one.",
