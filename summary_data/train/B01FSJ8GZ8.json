The on/off switch is terribly located on the side of the engine and poorly designed. The nozzles are made from lightweight plastic and lowquality metal, I found WEN nozzles to be a better grade overall-the engineering team gets and F.",

I really like the soap reservoir which is easy to activate via a tube from reservoir to the pump and holds quite a bit of soap. Switching tips is a downer as a previous unit I used for years had a spray wand that included swival types on the end of the wand itself...a small complaint. The equipment is easy to start and very mobile with a very sizable fuel tank and soap reservoir. Hose storage on the back works well and is snap to put up for storage.",
