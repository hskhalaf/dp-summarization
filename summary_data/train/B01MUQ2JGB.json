I had a similar issue with the original Bragi Dash and support sent me a poorly packaged replacement without the charging cable or custom eartips that they required i send back to them when i sent the device in for repair. When they finally sent those back to me weeks later, they were in a plain envelope and had been through hell. I have since moved onto different buds.",

      "text": "They work really well! Walked across my house and they stay connected to my iPhone 6. Sound good when playing Tidal master quality, and ok with Apple Music also. Battery life could always be better, but they will last several hours on a charge. Fit is good and I can wear them while I run. I'm really happy with them and love the transparency feature. I use it all the time because it allows me to hear around me but doesn't affect the music quality or volume.",

They will come with different sizes of the soft ear insert so most likely you'll find one with a perfect fit. Sound was great also.

      "text": "I've had this for 3 days. Out of the box, I couldn't hear anything out of the left ear piece. After charging it, I was able to hear out of both ear pieces. But then the metal stick that attaches to the case and the strap pushed though and is now stuck inside the case and the strap has nowhere to attach. That seems like a a bad and cheap design. I'm hoping Amazon will help me get a replacement.",

The Headphone does this with smooth sound, bangin\u2019 bass and the longest battery life of any such product on the market.\n\nWhat makes your product special?\n\nThe Headphone is the first truly wireless earbud to provide amazing battery life, high acoustic quality and Bluetooth capabilities that first-generation Hearables have struggled with. We also rethought the interaction, putting buttons on The Headphone, for customers who prefer tactile interfaces. \n\nWhat has been the best part of your startup experience?\n\nFrom the first day of our Kickstarter to 2014, to present day, we\u2019ve been driven by the support of thousands who believe in our vision of a wireless world. Bringing The Dash and The Headphone to life and having the opportunity to share them with this fanbase has been an incredibly intense, rewarding and beautiful experience.",
