      "text": "I was looking for a pair of comfortable, durable boots but am a weekend hiker. I was pleasantly surprised by how comfortable these were when I first put them on; the cushioning is outstanding. I wore them one evening to break them in but this wasn't necessary. A few days later I wore them on a 5 mile moderate hike; no problems with traction, feeling rocks thru the sole or becoming uncomfortable. Can't speak to longer term yet but for the first week these are well worth the money.",

These are my go-to shoes for daily use. great for day hikes, work use, etc. The toe cap rubber does not handle abraision well, such as roofing shingles or asphalt, if you spend a lot of time on your hands and knees. Otherwise, I can't think of a complaint. Super comfy. I get 9 months of perfection, wearing them daily, then I buy a new pair, and retire the old pair to dirty jobs. After a short break in, they are as comfortable as sneakers.",
