The shoes are really comfortable and look good. I am a little hesitate to recommend them until I've had them a while. I wish the toes had a little reinforcement as I am afraid my toe is going to wear through the mesh. So I don't know about longevity. But as of now, I really like them.",

I finally found a shoe that fits my somewhat narrow foot without buying a narrow that ends up being too tight. The colors are vibrant and I\u2019ve gotten a lot of compliments! I would say this is not so much made for working out but for daily wear.",

I will take those out and add the thick insoles I have from my previous shoes. Definitely feel more comfortable walking. I wouldn't say these shoes are for working out though.
