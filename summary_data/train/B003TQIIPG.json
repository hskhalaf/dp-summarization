Then I prepped my truck bed by sanding it down with an hand held electric mouse sander. I used my air compressor and mixed the first bottle. Right before I finished the first bottle, I mixed the second bottle. Anyway, long story short, I was super impressed!! It covered my bed, sides, and tailgate with only two bottles!! I still have two bottles and half of the hardener left over. Great product. Just make sure you have a 5 gallon or higher compressor or it with take forever.",

I\u2019ve had this product for several months now, and I\u2019ve just accepted the fact that if I ever have to have something heavy and hard in the bed, the bed liner is coming off with it. Pretty awful stuff. The aproperate prepperations were taken before being painted. The bed was completely sanded and mineral spirits were used to clean it. Just a bad product.",

Can't comment on the durability but looks really nice. I would like to see an alternative offered in an alternative 'flat' option.
