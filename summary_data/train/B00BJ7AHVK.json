      "title": "Nice Lamps, but not well made",
      "text": "The lamps are beautiful. Pros- Came with LED bulbs (nice touch) Great size for table lamps or night stand lamps Cons-Chrome finish was coming off the neck where the bulb socket screws in. This is a pretty big issue as it would appear the finishing is not up to par. Mostly hidden by light socket base so we kept it. One of the lamps had an irregular hole where the cord exits the lamp. This is not a problem overall but my be a week spot in the shell finish. Bottom line lamps worth keeping even with flaws. Price was not unreasonable, but these are not bargain store lamps so workmanship should not be shoddy.",
