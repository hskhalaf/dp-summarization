      "text": "The unit itself is well made and loud enough to hear over my practice amp however I did not realize that the tempo adjusts 2 - 8 beats at a time depending on where you are on the dial. That means it's not possible to increase the tempo in 1 beat/min increments or even 10 beat/min increments sometimes it's either +2, +4, +6, or +8. That's not a huge deal but it's annoying that I can't start at 50 and raise the tempo an even 10 beats at a time when practicing speed and accuracy, it goes 50, 60, 72, 80, 92, 100. Easy to use and the dial makes for fast adjustments though, I'm keeping it.",

For example, some metronomes let you tap a beat to set the tempo but who cares when turning the dial to the desired tempo is just as easy.",

I have no issue with the LED, and the two different tones are very useful. Very handy and attractive metronome.",

At first I thought maybe it was having a problem due to an old battery, or something, but I've tried multiple new batteries and the problem continues to occur. It goes along fine for a while, but every once in a while it throws in an off-tempo click. Very annoying. I'm quite disappointed, as I like the dial, I like the simplicity, and I think the click sounds fine. But if it can't keep consistent time, then it's of no use at all. That's it's entire purpose, and it simply doesn't do it.",

However, there is a small problem: The power switch and volume control are recessed and tricky to find with one hand. When you turn the unit on with the thumb of your right hand, you might accidentally turn down the volume with your index finger, causing you to think that the device is malfunctioning or that the battery is dead.",

It is a raised portion of the clear plastic rotating front with no line on it. It's impossible to see the indicator in anything but bright light, so I drew a line on it with a black Sharpie. Problem solved. Makes me wonder what the designers were thinking. \"Oh, let's improve the model by making the arrow nearly invisible.\" Sheesh! Edit 9/11/15: Someone pointed out in another review that the lettering on the wheel lines up with the arrow. True, but why bother having an invisible arrow?",

      "text": "This is a sturdy and easy to use metronome. My only complaints are that (1) the speed increments by 3 beats and (2) the same tone clicks each time. I would like to set my bpm to any value, incrementing by 1. I also get confused by the same tone each beat and wish you could alternate mild and heavy tones for the up and down beats. While I use this, almost any smartphone metronome app has many more features. I just don't like running down my phone's battery.",

Kids can see them easily but if you don't have 20/20 vision you have to squint to read them. The dial turns to the right to get faster gradually and to the left to get gradually slower.I use it at my piano studio and recommend it to my students to use at home. A nine volt battery lasts a good while. It has a built in medal stand to keep it upright.",
