      "text": "Having read the reviews of the other top brands in the same price range I opted for the Momentum 3's as my main priorities were sound quality and comfort (as I wear specs) over noise cancelling. I must admit they haven't disappointed as the soundstage is stunning and they are by far the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn. Battery life is better than advertised and the noise cancellation is absolutely fine for my needs. Build quality is also head and shoulders better than the others I tried on before buying these bad boys.",

My problem is that from day one the left hand ear cup was sliding down the rail at the slightest movement meaning the headphones continually slide on my head with no security. The right side is fine and secure but the left side makes wearing these phones a bit annoying. Great sound - more to be done with the fit. A real shame for some fantastic sounding headphones. Noise cancellation is adequate and battery life is pretty low but not problematic",

I tried the Bose 700s before and these blow them out of the water when it comes to everything about sound quality. The sound is really energetic with a punchy bass response, warm and mellow mids and highs that are clear without being too bright or sibilant. Battery life could've been better but that's probs the only thing that you can say is below average. The sound more than makes up for it though imo",
