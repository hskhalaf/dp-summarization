I took it to a NHL hockey game and the zoom is incredible, I could see the stitching on the jersey. I am very pleased. I also loved how the night setting photos turn out. We took a photo of our house at night with the Christmas lights on it and it was perfect. I would highly recommend this!",

You can definetly see the water drops coming down from the reefs and in the air. Great Item for the price. Although I did find it at one of these mega stores for $20.00 cheaper.

    "description": "Color:BlackFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nZOOMING ABOVE AND BEYOND.\nPUT YOURSELF IN THE CENTER OF THE ACTION.\nYou've never been closer to the action than you are with this 36x wide-angle optical Zoom-NIKKOR\u00ae ED glass lens. Its optical zoom (22.5\u2013810mm) pulls you in from wide panoramas to crisp close ups. Plus, a side zoom control marks the end of shaky zooms\u2014freeing you to capture great action photos with minimal blur. So whether you're shooting a mountain vista or zooming in on a snowboarder, say goodbye to missed shots. This lens catches it all. It even allows for macro shooting as close as 0.4 inches!\n\n\n\nWide panoramas to crisp close-ups. STUNNING PHOTOS IN NOT SO STUNNING SHOOTING CONDITIONS.\nWhether you're aiming at a midnight skyline or zooming in on a hang-glider in a sun drenched sky, Nikon enables you to take incredible photographs and movies. With its 12.1-megapixel backside-illuminated CMOS sensor, dual image processors and Nikon's EXPEED C2 image processing engine, it frees you to shoot highly detailed images with minimal noise and distortion.\n\nThe COOLPIX P500 is ideal for shooting high speed action, so you're sure to capture the fastest skateboarders, skiers and windsurfers. It's armed with ISO speeds up to 3200 and equipped with a five-way Vibration Reduction (VR) Image Stabilization System that reduces the streaky images associated with shaky cameras. The COOLPIX P500 even has a motion detector that identifies moving subjects and then adjusts the camera's settings to ensure that you won't miss a frame of the action.\n\nWHATEVER YOU WANT TO SHOOT, THE COOLPIX P500 IS READY.\nYou'll never miss a shot with this versatile camera because it starts right up, has a quick autofocus, and shoots five shots in approximately one second\u2014at full resolution. Plus, multiple Continuous Modes allow for a variety of high speed shooting options up to a blazing 120 frames per second*.\n\nUp to five consecutive images per second. When a single picture just isn't enough, the versatile COOLPIX P500 features a One-Touch record button that lets you shoot Full HD (1080p) movies at 30fps while recording audio with a built-in stereo microphone. It's great for sporting events because it will record high speed activity in slow motion, catching action missed by the human eye. The COOLPIX P500 also has an HDMI-CEC output for simple playback on your HDTV or computer\u2014so now it's as easy to watch your own movies as it is to shoot them.\n\n*reduced resolution\n\nANY ANGLE. ANY LIGHTING. ANY SHOT.\nThe COOLPIX P500 is all you need to shoot eye-catching photographs, thanks to the three-inch, tilting, vari-angle monitor. This 921,000-dot display not only makes it easy to capture, review, and share images, but it also enables you to shoot from unusual angles and tricky vantage points. The Clear Color Display has a brightness adjustment and an anti-glare coating, so it remains vivid in the most challenging lighting conditions. And for those who want even more compositional freedom, the versatile COOLPIX P500 comes with an eye-level electronic viewfinder.\n\n\n\nPANORAMAS: SEAMLESS, EFFORTLESS, GENIUS.\nMountains. Canyons. Sunsets. The glory of these vistas is the breadth and grandeur of their natural beauty. That's why the COOLPIX P500 includes Easy Panorama Mode that combines multiple shots into a seamless 180- or 360-degree panoramic picture. Simply move the camera as you shoot and let the COOLPIX P500 combine the shots for you. Choose from 19 different Scene Modes or let the camera automatically select the most appropriate settings. Either way, you'll have a panoramic shot that captures the size, scope and splendor of the most majestic scenes imaginable.\n\nTHE COOLPIX P500 PUTS YOU IN CONTROL.\nWhether you're shooting a scenic overlook or a competitive speedboat race, the COOLPIX P500 captures images the way you want them. It lets you select aperture and shutter priorities, and includes a Manual Exposure Mode that puts you in complete control. And shooting at night is a breeze with the Advanced Night Landscape and Advanced Night Portrait Modes. Simply press the shutter release and the COOLPIX P500 will shoot multiple shots and automatically combine them into a single, superior image.\n\nWHATEVER YOU'RE SHOOTING, IT COULDN'T BE EASIER THAN WITH THE COOLPIX P500.\nThe COOLPIX P500 is master of convenience\u2014and the ideal choice for capturing fast action, low-light images, panoramas and stunning portraits. And its Smart Portrait System includes a Blink Warning that warns you when your subject may have blinked. It also includes in-camera Red-Eye\u2122 technology that automatically fixes red-eye, a Face-Priority feature that can focus up to 12 faces and a Skin Softening feature that smoothes out skin tones at three different levels.
