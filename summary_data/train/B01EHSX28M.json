The battery lasts longer than my bluetooth headphones plus it can charge while operating so battery life isn't an issue.",

Once you connect the first time it\u2019s almost automatic though. I\u2019ve also used it to get Bluetooth audio in my car, and to transmit from a record player to a Bluetooth speaker. The uses are endless and this little box has become invaluable for us!",

Example: My TV (Samsung 32\") will only allow sound to go to external speakers. This TV is not a top of the line it is for bedroom use only. So if you need Bluetooth and your system allows the sound out to non speaker devices, this will work for you.",

This Bluetooth TX/RX helped solve that problem. Paired it up with my AirPods Pro and now can leave the Bose behind. I was a little worried that maybe there would be latency/sync issues. In the videos I have played and the games I have tried on my switch it is imperceptible. The device is super light weight and compact as well. I attached some photos to show the scale.",

If paired with another receiver, it seems to work only in SBC (there's no obvious way to verify which codec is in use since no forms of indicators are available) as the receiver does not support AAC in TX. Therefore if you plan to use a pair of these, you WILL suffer significant audio latency.

The only downside is that the instructions are terrible and it took many tries (on different days) to get it to work. I swear I tried the combination of cables and modes I'm using now and they didn't work initially , so I have no clue how to reconnect if I ever unplugged it from my tv!",

I gifted one to my stepdad so he could use his new Bose 700 Bluetooth Headphones with his old Bose Receiver connected to his TV. We tried and tried and tried to get the headphones to pair with the device and never could make it happen. We reset both, cleared out pairing history, and tried everything we could find online. So disappointed. UPDATE 3/9/20: Seller responded to me personally, stating I probably received a defective unit and replaced my unit with a newer model. Received it next-day delivery. Great customer service and I recommend this seller.",

I first tried fireTV and the Bluetooth transmission function of fireTV is really awful, it was hard to connect and audio was lagging behind the video. Then I bought this product to give it a try. Surprisingly, this transmitter worked perfectly! After the initial setup, it automatically connects my earbuds and no audio lagging issues any longer. I highly recommend this product",

My setup isn't for high-end recording of course, however, I just needed some recording equipment to lay down some guitar tracks to send to my drummer. I don't like having to juggle with so many cables around me so I'm trying to lessen the mess while recording as much as I can :). Having so many cables around kind of interferes and makes a hassle during recording for me. So these definitely help!",

Paring was fairly easy squeeze the transmitter/receiver until it flashes red and blue; then hold down the Bluetooth head phones power button constantly usually you will hear \"power on\" from the headphones continue to hold down the power button in a few seconds you will hear \"paring\" from the head phones.
