The stripey texture gives it a nice adult bump but retains a rock star flair. They are a tiny bit tight, and that makes my otherwise fairly cute feet look a little pudgy. However, I wore them to work today and i can already feel them loosening a bit. I have faith these will be my new favorite thing. I wear a 6.5, these felt like... 6.25. But they're getting better.

I'm usually crippled by the end of the work day in new heels. They are a little tight around the top, but I'm sure they need to break a little. They feel cushioned without anything weird in the foot. They are a perfect, classic black pump with a lovely little metal detail on the heel. I would buy them again and again.",
