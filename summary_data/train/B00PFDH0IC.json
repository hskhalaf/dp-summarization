I knew this Matcha was not ceremonial grade, but I didn't think this poor quality,,,, to be honest. I'm Japanese and even lower quality Matcha in Japan tastes much much better than this. This matcha has No aroma and no tastes of Matcha. This is just bitter cheap green tea tastes and just the colour of green. I hope people don't think that this as a standard of Japanese quality even for a culinary grade. I totally agree with other reviews that even not for Matcha Latte (Mixing purpose) for me. I wanted to like this product but it didn't work out for me.",

      "text": "I have drunk matcha many times, maybe 30-40 times. I buy Uji Ceremonial Grade or Premium grade usualy, but because I put matcha in my cold matcha shake/water each day it started getting expensive. I ordered from my usual supplier Hibiki an in Uji, Japan but because of Covid and planes leaving Japan at a minimum, I looked for a local souce. This food-grade is very good matcha. It's a bit less smooth than Ceremonial or Premium but the matcha taste IS there. Nice green color, easy to blend AND it comes from Uji, Japan my favorite tea producing area. I bought the 3.5 ounce in case it wasn't good....I wll order the 8oz next time and keep ordering.",

It's a lower grade that I've been using as my morning tea (it's all I can afford at the moment, so definitely not complaining about this option at all). I've substituted with honey and almond milk (I have a sweet tooth), and in fruit smoothies for a more tart flavor, which has worked well. If you're looking for sweeter, lighter, truer green-tea flavor, an imperial grade is better. -Of course it's more expensive, but if you want matcha on the cheap this is your option.",

I mix 1/2 a teaspoon with 2 cups of boiling organic unsweetened almond milk and 1/4 a cup of organic maple syrup and drink this every morning. It\u2019s pretty good and the matcha powder grows on you. It\u2019s not disgusting at all, and it blends very well. I\u2019ll definitely be ordering more monthly. The packet is very small BUT you get 30 servings per packet so it\u2019s worth it. Highly recommend!!!",

I've tried many other brands at the same price range and they steep splendidly. I tried returning this item and the seller does not have a return policy. Also disappointed with the customer support. The only nice thing about this matcha was the color. It did have a nice rich green color. Doesn't match the quality of the matcha though.",
