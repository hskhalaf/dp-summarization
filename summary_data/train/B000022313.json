My original unit was beginning to have too much play in the upper arm so I decided to purchase a new one. The New unit was obviously manufactured incorrectly with a spacing between the upper blade clamp and the lower blade clamp of 5.0 inches. This was too wide to enable the mounting of a 5.0 inch blade. My old unit had a spacing of approx. 4.32 inches. I would re-order if you can guarantee that the new unit spacing would be close to 4.32 inches.",

The clamp on method on the Dewalt leaves much to be desired. The hold down arm of the Hegner was a better design. I have only used the new saw for a few projects at this time and am pleased with it's other aspects .",

      "text": "I would not recommend this saw. Mine is 3 months old and I just had to order parts to repair it already. The upper blade chuck is cheap aluminum and the thumb screw is hard steel so the screw pulled the threads out of the blade chuck. I registered the saw with DeWalt Feb 11 2015 ab=nd also made an account on Dewalts site three times. When I attempt to sign on to contact Dewalt about my warranty it keeps saying the account does not exist, BUT they let me order parts and pay for them as a guest. The blade chucks are a 2 month back order, they must be selling a lot of them.",

I make items cutting very detailed scroll art portraits of 3/32 Birch ply to cars and construction equipment made from scrap 2 X 6 pine and redwood, sometimes from seasoned oak. I have yet to have a problem with this great saw. Regardless of where the saw was made -- You cannot find a better saw for the money spent. The ease of changing blades is priceless when you have to change - like 987 times in a 12 X 16 portrait. GREAT job Amazon.",

The saw relies on a dependable 1.3 Amp motor for the power you need and delivers a variable stroke length between 3/4 inch and up to 2 inches deep. This application-specific performance translates to improved control and cleaner results.\n\nSave Time with Tool-Free Blade Changes and Adjustable Table\nWhether you're working with a variety of specialty materials or you're simply ready for a more aggressive cut, the DEWALT exclusive, tool-free blade clamps allow you to complete blade changes in just seconds. And the arm is easy to lift, making it easy to thread the blade through materials when making inside cuts.\n\nWeighing 56 pounds, this scroll saw has a heavy-duty feel yet is small enough to move around the shop easily.
