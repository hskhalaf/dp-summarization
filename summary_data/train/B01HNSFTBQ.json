It's a huge advance over the traditional old bells or chimes -- offering a full range of sounds, volume, alert lights, custom programming, etc., etc. Attractive, solid construction.

Within the last couple months, it drains the batteries within three weeks. The instruction booklet says batteries will last five years. Now, I have to look for another one but it won't be Honeywell!",

Love being able to bring the chime anywhere, including our cellar or backyard. My hearing isn't so great either, so the strobe lights and volume setting are incredibly useful. I've read the negative reviews and I can't imagine how anyone could find any significant fault with this product. Highly recommended.",

It's advertised at quite a decent range, but I have found that it is absolutely terrible operating through barriers. The bell failed to receive at a distance of about 30m when operating through 2 steel gates and a wooden door. To me that is rather dismal. In all honestly, I'm so fed-up with wireless doorbells. There just doesn't seem to be anything with a decent range.",
