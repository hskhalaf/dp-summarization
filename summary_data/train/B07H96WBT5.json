I also can\u2019t wait to have friends over to watch the super bowl and fighting events! I\u2019ll include a few pictures that show lights on, Dim lights And dark. Hope this convinces You enough to get one!",

People were impressed and a number of them came up to me afterwards and asked about the projector I was using. It is half the cost of a comparable big name projector. Its small size will make it easy to transport in my carry on bag. I read enough positive reviews of Wowoto that I felt confident enough to trust them.",
