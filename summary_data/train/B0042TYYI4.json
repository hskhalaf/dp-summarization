I like this so much I am going to request my work laptop be replaced with a similar size computer. This thing is perfect for traveling; I have already used it as a GPS using Microsoft Streets (with GPS antenna) and tethered my phone to it for internet on the go. I have had this a week now and my wife is dropping subtle hints that she may also want one.",

I would NOT want this as my sole computer or sole laptop due to the small size and limited capabilities, but for checking e-mail, surfing, and light typing on the road... it's great. The touch pad is my sole complaint, but I'm getting used to it and I carry a Logitech mini-mouse for extended sessions. I've had mine for 2 months as of this writing.",

I have one of the orignal 7 inch Eee PC's from ASUS and it's not on Microsoft software and works brilliantly except for a too small screen and keyboard. It's possible the Microsoft 7 software installed on this netbook may be slowing the computer down. It's also possible I may have gotten a lemon. My 15 inch ASUS laptop works like a charm.",

It's fast, has great resolution, terrific batter life, functional keyboard and good construction all around - and for $368 is a great alternative to a laptop - if your primary usage is Internet, email and media. I'll leave all my data on my old Dell, but will probably use the ASUS more around the house (watching a movie while keeping up on March Madness) and while traveling. I would definitely recommend it for anyone interested in a netbook but not quite sold on the \"I\" family of ever-obsolecing Apple products or other tablets.",

I highly suggest that if you don't have experience with Starter, do some research to help you decide whether you are going to need to factor in the cost of upgrading to Home Premium or something.",

      "text": "After much research, I decided to purchase this netbook. While this netbook IS fast, there are two things that made me return this computer. 1) The touch pad is WAY too sensitive. I changed all the settings to low sensitivity and anytime I would BARELY touch the touch pad, the pointer would jump to another point on the computer. It became ridiculous and extremely irritating. 2) The keyboard is extremely cramped. I've used netbooks before and this one is particularly small. I had to return this computer because I just couldn't handle the mouse jumping around anymore.",
