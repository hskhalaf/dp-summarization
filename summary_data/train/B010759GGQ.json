Assembly is relatively simple and took about 30 minutes with the proper tools on hand. The meat box itself is made of thin material but seems to hold up well, the fire box is somewhat stronger. Lastly, if your serious about smoking then you are going to need to apply gasket material around the door to create a better seal.",

      "text": "Just a few points about this smoker: 1) the metal is thin, so this smoker is best suited for use during warmer weather cooking, 2) since it is an offset smoker, you will be adding wood/charcoal every 1-2 hrs for long smokes. If you're new to smoking, I would not recommend this one. If you have been smoking a while, this is a good choice if you're looking to smoke a lot at one time (brisket and a few racks of ribs) and don't want to spend a lot . The offset chamber makes it easy to add wood/charcoal without having to open the cabinet where the meat is cooking.",

Keeping a constant temp was a bit of a challenge for me but I will attribute that to being a novice with this particular smoker. All in all I am extremely happy with the purchase.",

One thing that did make me a little unhappy was the dents in the door to the meat box. They are 1/2 inch in size. One at the top left of the door and one at the bottom right of the door. They did effect the way the door seals but with some smoker gasket it will be remedied. Also the temp gauge that came with mine was very accurate. I used my oven temp gauge and put it in the smoke to see any discrepancy and there were none.",

I also own a green egg and a weber summit. Both cost 10 times what this unit does. I love the weber and the komado but indirect gives more smoke flavor.",

I siliconed and felted all the joints and doors like recommend. Cured the smoker as recommended then started my first batch of marlin, came out great smoker seems to keep a steady temperature. Really like the vertical box can cook alot more at once.",

Plenty of room for even a full turkey plus other meats or vegetables. Does take quite a bit of attention if slow-smoking as you're adding soaked wood chips every 40 minutes or so, and taking around 8 hours for most meats. Easy assembly. Biggest downsides are when removing the chip basket, if the tray is not removed at the same time, there's a lot of mess. Other downside is the drip tray doesn't line up well with the drain, and is very small so overflows several times during an 8hour smoke.",
