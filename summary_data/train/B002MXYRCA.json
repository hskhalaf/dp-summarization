Then use 2 pairs of thick socks. This will keep your feet firmly in the boot but give you that needed extra padding. You can walk for days and days and never have a blister or even red areas. Change your socks daily if you can and your feet will love these boots. Also, I treat them with snow seal before and after every hunt. Keeps the leather flexible, water resistant and protected.
