What everyone says about the cheap plastic stake is true, so push the stake into the ground first, then put the light on top. To reposition, remove the light, remove the stake and then re-insert it where you want it. They look great and have a consistent brightness and sharpness. The \"star burst\" light pattern looks really nice too. One of the things I hated about solar lights is how wimpy they look, their lack of actual useful light output and the fact the batteries die quickly. These solve all those problems.",

Unfortunately it was not just me as 3 lights no longer work. I even purchased replacement batteries and still did not work. To make this an even worse experience is the lights stopped working after the return window closed so be very careful!!!",

Not a big deal, but they should all perform the same. By summer, one of the two failed completely.

      "text": "Loved the brightness and the appearance, but after purchasing two sets of the lights I found that both sets had wiring issues. Lights would not come on all the time, so after checking I found that the wires were loose or disconnected and not easy to fix as they are very thin to work with. I have 4 lights now. One does not work at all and the other three work when they feel like it or I tap them with my hand. Have given up on taking them apart to rewire. Great lights if they just worked consistently.",

Most important thing is that they light well in the evening when you are more likely to be out in the yard.",

There is a brown plastic pin that you sink into the ground like a stake and on which you install the lamp. This pin tends is made of cheap plastic and it snaps easily. Without it, the lamp is useless.",

I purchased 8 lights and 3 ground stakes broke off while inserting into ground, even though I was extremely careful. Customer Service does NOT respond to any requests for replacement parts. And I have yet to find any type of substitute ground stake that fits the design of these lights, so the lights are virtually useless if the ground stake is broken.",
