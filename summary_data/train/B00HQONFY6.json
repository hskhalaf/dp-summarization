      "text": "I've contacted Wen a couple of times trying to resolve the excessive runout (wobble) on my Wen drillpress (4214). They sent me an arbor replacement that didn't help. Then I took a closer look at the chuck. Very poor quality and loose construction. I emailed Wen for a replacement chuck and the reply was a link to a $260 heavy duty industrial chuck which was about what I paid for this machine. Now my problem is finding a replacement not knowing the taper specs for the arbor. This Wen product should only be used for rough work where there is no expectation of accuracy or quality. Anyone have a suggestion or information on finding a reasonably priced chuck?",

Assembly was painless and all parts fit. You can even read the instructions! For roughly $185 it's a wonderful tool and vastly better than the smallest one they make.",

I took one star off because it lacks power. If you spin a 3/4 drill bit in like 3/16 plate and pull down on it too hard with a good sharp bit. The motor goes into like an over load protection and stops until the load on the machine is reduced. I can deal with that. But I sure wish that sucker would just eat!

      "text": "This drill press is the perfect example of cheap Chinese tools not worth the money spent on it. It fell apart first day locking lever on table stripped out and had to use a c clamp to hold it in place to use it I first tried to drill 1/4 mild steel with a stepped bit and it drilled in fine then just stopped bit in place stalling out from lack of power pretty weak drill press It also vibrates alot which the spindle handles loosened up guess I needed lock tight on handle Over all I boxes it up and returned it bought a fox shop drill press still cheap cost and far better quality",

Put a dab of silicone in each corner and let it sit to act as damper. No rattle. Run out on stock chuck is about .0025. This is not bad but I am OCD about run out. Put higher cost keyless chuck on and run out is .001. I would recommend this press for the cost as it is great for home shop for Wood Aluminm and steel drilling.",

The speed adjust is so simple and easy to do. Seems like the press runs smoother at lower or high rpms. Rumbles some in the middle. Two gripes: 1. The on off switch is flimsy and somewhat loose right out of the box. We shall see if it holds up. 2. The laser only works from a distance so the item to be drilled must be lowered 5 or so inches for the laser to line up. Not a big deal I didn't buy it for the laser.",

Had to use a mallet, oil and brute strength to remove it. Had no grease in it, but it works great. The press part was not greased either! So, it was easy to assemble, but be ready to spend some time on this guy, it has been worth it.",

Did some semi-concealed cabinet door hinges in oak, and even tried on steel at low speed and worked fine (0.188\" mild steel plate) and aluminum. I'll update after using it for a few months.

    "description": "Remember when power tools were actually powerful? WEN\u2019s 12-inch swing, variable speed drill press with laser centering device, is a powerhouse for your shop. Packed with features that you\u2019ll find in larger more industrial type drill presses. This bench-top, cast iron drill press has the power to drill through metal, wood and other materials. Max drill capacity is 5/8\u201d in 1\u201d thick cast iron. The variable speed feature allows you to target in the exact speed (infinitely from 580-3200 RPM) that works for your project. While you are working you simply move a lever and adjust the speed as needed. No pulleys and belts to change! Our design uses a mechanical variable speed which allows for the same power and torque through the entire speed range. A digital readout powered by LED\u2019s displays the running speed. Constructed with a rigid frame consisting of cast iron: head, table, and base, ensures accurate holes. Its powerful induction motor features ball bearings for an extended life and it all comes together with smooth and balanced performance even at high speeds. The 5/8\u201d chuck with MT2 spindle taper gives you versatility with a variety of bits and features on-board chuck key storage, so you never have to hunt around for it. Worktable bevels 45\u00b0 left and right for those tricky operations for the perfect right angles consistently. Base has predrilled holes for mounting onto a bench or work stand. Slotted table allows for mounting clamps and vises for effective mounting. The X-pattern laser locks-on to your drill points saving on guesswork and sparing expensive materials. A versatile and valuable tool for any shop especially when you expand its range of use with optional accessories such as mortising attachments, drum sanders, circle cutters, etc. Since 1951, WEN has proudly produced innovative powered tools focused on value delivering meaningful features that will help you complete and enjoy the work as much as the project. Remember when you could drill with laser precision? Remember WEN. DO NOT use power tools in the presence of flammable liquids or gases. Drill press Base -10 x 16 inches",
