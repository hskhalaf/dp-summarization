Adjustable straps are comfy and do not bother me when running with just tank top. Meaning there are no sharp seams or any coarse straps to rub when jogging. The straps are adjustable although I had to tape mine so they would stay and not slide because the plastic piece does not prevent slippage.",

The one thing I'm a little worried about is the strips, they feel like they might stretch and I have it fit for the smallest it can go- Until then, it's worth it.",

The smaller card pocket is a surprising convenient addition to hold my ID, insurance, and key. I would highly recommend this pack to any runner wanting a comfortable & safe way to keep their phone on them.",
