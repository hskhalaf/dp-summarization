Windows 10 immediately started updating itself with Microsoft and completely filled the storage memory -- and was not completed! Useless from the get go.

      "text": "The provided software is largely immaterial to the Linux user, only implementing the drivers (in conjunction with ndiswrapper & wpa_supplicant) found in the /Driver/NT/ subdirectory of the supplied CD. This is a good, full-speed performer for pretty-much any Linux-based laptop/notebook, you'd care to throw at it. WPA & WEP are fully-supported, and connections are easy to establish and maintain over relatively long distances between the card and AP. Overall, I am very satified with the operation of this card, and would recommend it for those who have concerns about providing wireless b/g connectivity for Linux-based laptops & notebooks. I would buy another one, were the need to arise.",
