A week later I got the gun back in perfect working order. Great warranty service.",

Then last night, the retainer clip at the base of the screw that holds the CO2 cartridge in place broke. The gun is now useless since you can not tighten the screw without the nut backing out of the gun, therefore putting no pressure on the cartridge itself (pic 2). I was told my \u201creturn window\u201d closed on 10/4. So in other words I was screwed out of $41 by 7 days. Do NOT buy! I\u2019ve owned numerous air pistols and have never had one break on me (especially in just 37 days)!",

The instructions don't have anything to cover this situation other than telling you to not try to disassemble the gun yourself. Maybe yours will last longer.

      "text": "This is a pretty decent BB gun. It looks exactly like my M&P 22. It even has the S&W markings on it. Nice fake \"fiber optic\" sights,... I'm sure there just a light capturing plastic tube, but there really easy to see and appear to be pretty bright. It has a long, hard trigger pull which throws you off target somewhat though. You do have a few stray bb's that don't go where your shooting, so be carful if you use it in an indoor range or BB trap. It's a decent little gun for the price, just a little dissapointed with with the stray bb's it puts out. But again, look at the price... great for the money !",

      "text": "Out of the box, loved the gun. Nice look and feel, blowback, accuracy. BBs a little tedious to load but, nothing new there. About 300 shots in, the gun simply began to misfire or no fire. Wasted 6 or 7 cartridges before calling Umarex. Customer phone care was good. Invited to send it back in. They turned it around and sent me back the same gun in about a week. It was worse! First cartridge barely worked and it was down hill from there. BB's simply wouldn't shoot and testing with a spare clip I had purchased, wasted another 4 cartridges. Very disappointing. Sent it back to Amazon for refund and moving on to a different brand of blowback.",

I pull the handle a bit too hard and the backing came off, it took a while to fit the enclosure back into the groove...to cover the CO2 cartridge. The cartridge allowed about 5 clips before the CO2 ran out. At 20 yards, I can see the BB to each target. The extra clips I got (also from Amazon) did not fit, even it says it can hold the plastic bb and the 0.177; but the 0.177 is too small, and they fell out; and the plastic appears too big to fit....so i just use the clip that came with. I will keeping looking for another clip",
