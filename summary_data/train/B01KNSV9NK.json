      "text": "Great upgrade for a decent price. I mounted these on a Specialized Hotrock 20 mountain bike for my kid. The bike came with V Brakes but had the mounts on the frame and fork to support Disc. I had to order a wheelset with Disc hubs to complete it. I have a feeling I will be buying a new back tire for the bike as it stops so good the wheel can be locked up to skid! I won't worry about wet rims being a problem anymore either! Mechanical brakes can be difficult to tune and they need to be broken in as well, then re-adjusted. Plenty of videos online to refine your skills!",

      "text": "Construction of the brake caliper is decent. The levers feel nice as well. What scared me was the brake pads themselves are dangerously ineffective. If you attempt to brake any harder than moderate or maintain brakes for any amount of time (downhill), they break down and fail. After using the pads for about 2 weeks, I ate all the way through the pad material. where this is scary is the brakes are not hydraulic so when you lose pad material that fast, the levers become more and more loose til pulling the lever all the way does nothing until you re-adjust the system.",

After installation they worked at first, then I took the bike in for a complete tuneup at a bike shop. The brakes worked for one time then would not brake, the shop readjusted and they worked for a couple of times but when I got home they did not work. The cable arm is a very loose fit and wobbles to the side when the brakes are applied. I can not return the package because I did use the cable and the hand brake lever but I am very disappointed in the quality of the caliper.",

BUT putting in new pads was ridiculous. Otherwise, this would have been a 4 or 5 star product for the price.",
