      "text": "So I had to give this luggage at least two stars because you get so much for the price. However....the quality is really not there. Materials are pretty cheap and flimsy and the liner inside each suitcase feels like a thin piece of plastic. One of the little luggage tag holders sewn to the back of one of the smaller suitcases is already half falling off and we haven\u2019t even used it yet. :( Zipper on one of them is tough to zip and unzip.",

      "text": "We bought this set of luggage to use on a cruise. It is definitely not American Tourister but is sturdy and held up well. Pros: Lightweight Has a zipper to expand the 3 wheeled pieces Nice variety in sizes All the pieces nest making storage a breeze No issues with the handles or wheels Cons: Interior lining is a bit thin. I worry about rips after continued use. We don't travel a lot so I don't see that being a problem for us. The included locks are low quality and 2 broke. Definitely worth the price we paid for the set! If you vacation occasionally, go for it!",

I purchased metal privacy address tags to attach to the handles, only to find there were hidden address tags built into the back of each large case. Very well constructed and no issues with zippers or lining coming out. All the telescopic handles worked great. They stack nicely and look cool. No complaints any where so far! Id buy again if I needed another set.",

      "text": "It arrived and it was as advertised. Stand out color from all the black luggage at the airport. Very sturdy and 'looks' like it will stand the test of time and baggage handlers. They have a different kind of handle (not on the telescoping wheelie) and I'm interested to see if that is a better idea than sewn in ones, but then again how often is that ever used. They nest nicely in storage and the two shoulder and hand carry bags will come in handy in additional carry on and cruise situations (before the big luggage arrives). All said, I'm happy with my purchase and the price of $95 bucks can't be beat for 5 pieces.",
