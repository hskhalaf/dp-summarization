When I wear the bracelet I have much less pain. My arthritis has never been extreme, but uncomfortable to the point that do not play golf any more. I continue work out pushing through the discomfort, but with this bracelet the discomfort is minimal. It's a good weight and in fact I sleep with it on. I also like the design, the price is reasonable and expect I'll add another one. Lastly I did remove a couple of the links and the tool was easy to use but requires patience.",
