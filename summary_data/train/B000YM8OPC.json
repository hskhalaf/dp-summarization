I've gone years with no way to soothe or rinse my eyes, then started using the large bottle of this product with a glass eye cup...which helped. But these little bottles of purified water with a hint of boric acid, sodium borate and sodium chloride are a miracle for me. When allergies or tired eyes hit, a couple of drops do the trick. Highly recommended!! And thank you, Acme United, for putting out a simple, pure product. They're not easy to find.",

Unfortunately it is very expensive to get more for just the first aid kit - this is a great price for this much of the eyewash, and it's good to have on hand. We only have two eyes, and if anything gets in them - this is great stuff to have around - is an understatement. Great price too for this much product. Having eye wash cups is also a good idea.",
