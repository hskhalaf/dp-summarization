The recessed hex nut that serves as a \"binder bolt\" is frozen and will not turn in either direction. I used the proper 6mm allen wrench and even added a breaker bar and penetrating fluid but the hex nut will not budge. A possible cause is that powder coating was sprayed onto the hex nut after it was installed, which coated the threads. I can't ride the bike because the handlebar grips are out of reach. I've tried emails and numerous phone calls to customer service at Pacific Cycle but no luck. Now I'm stuck with a bike that I can't ride.",

I am exceptionally satisfied with this purchase! Beautiful bike, great value!!! During a pandemic like this it has been so very difficult to get a bike and they have been out of stock so long so I ordered this bike about a week ago and it came within about a week!",

It\u2019s a lovely bike and a great price, just beware assembly is not a one person job and it might be worth the money to take it into a bike shop for professionals to put together.",
