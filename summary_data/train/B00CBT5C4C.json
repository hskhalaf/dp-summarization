I believe it to be misleading people. It should be listed for people to take into consideration. Possible reproductive harm and cancer? Wonderful. If I could give zero stars, I would. If you are not concerned about that warning, then it looks like an ok product. Definitely get what you pay for. It looks ok on the outside but cheap lining and smells like chemicals on the inside. Would probably air out in a few days. I'm sending this back.",

The vibrant colors are beautiful, The zippers were strong and held up great. It seems like an overall sturdy wonderful luggage set. The small bag easily slips over the long handle of the taller bag, making it easy to pull both of them together. There are several zippered areas to store smaller items, including a flat one for books. We were very pleased with this product.",

I can not see where to get it replaced and even through it has a 5 year warranty (they require you to send them $25 handling charge BEFORE they do a thing, if they do) the bag is not worth $25. So the 4 bag set after the FIRST use is a 3 bag set. Please see the photos showing the issue. If they step up and fix the issue I will update this review, but for now its sadly a one star review for both the warranty policy and construction.",

Still has an unpleasant smell 2 weeks later. The size of the luggage is great, the handle works well, and the extra bag was nice to have to pack toys for our trip.",

      "text": "Loved this luggage! Bought a few sets and they held up perfectly for a family of 5 on an international trip with a few plane changes. The patterns are classy and distinct - we could pick out our luggage the minute it popped onto the conveyor belt. They are good sizes, the smallest rolly bag CAN be used on most airlines as a carry on. The dimensions on it list it is about 1 or 2 inches too big so I was a little worried I'd have to check it, but it fit perfectly in the overhead bin and not a single flight questioned my use of it as a carry on.",

I have used it and borrowed it out frequently for two years. This set has gone on many domestic and international travels and it still maneuvers smoothly with no broken zippers, rips, or tears! I cannot give enough praise and will happily reorder when the time comes.",

As other reviewers mentioned it does tend to tip over sometimes, depending on how you pack it, but I didn't find that to be a problem if I was mindful about positioning it properly so it could lean against something. The size was just right for me and fit everything I needed for a week in Hawaii. The separate tote bag fits nicely over the roller bag handle and held my tablet, snacks, chargers, cords, book, water bottle, etc. The purple print is cute and easy to spot on the luggage carousel. Great value for the price. Time will tell how durable it is but so far, so good.",

They are light, a little over 5 1/2 pounds each for the suitcases and about a pound and a half for the bag, but seem plenty roomy for what we are needing. Would definitely recommend!",

Looks good, as shown in the photos. The stitching looks moderately durable and the telescopic handle works fine but does look a bit on the weak side but as long as your not trying to lift the bag up or jerk it around widely it should be fine. No issues like the one reviewers video that showed them not opening at the same height. Haven\u2019t traveled with it yet but will update the review soon!",

Only down side - and I would expect this with any 2 wheeled suitcase - is that it tends to get \"front\" heavy and will tip over. But, lean it against something and problem solved.",
