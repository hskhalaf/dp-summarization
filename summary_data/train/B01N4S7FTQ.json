      "text": "This Columbia wallet is a good decent cheap wallet. It's definitely not as sturdy as say the carhartt wallets, however its still more than good enough. Its real soft and pliable so you'll barely feel it in your pocket. The flip id is always awesome. You can't remove it though and there is no divider in the bill section. It's also not made out of real leather i dont think..on the tag it says coated leather, how much of that is true, I'm not sure. The quality is there though, stitching is really good and it has rfid in it( haven't tested that though). Overall, I'd highly recommend this wallet if you're looking for a no frills comfortable billfold.",

A few months of normal everyday use and it is holding up great!",

It was a little thicker than I thought and the folding flap inside doesn\u2019t come out. So it stays that thick. My old wallet was a little thinner than this one. 4 stars out of 5.
