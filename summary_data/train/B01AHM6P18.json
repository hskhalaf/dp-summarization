Oddly enough, the cat loves the little bag of \"Catnip\" as well, though I doubt it actually has any inside (more likely stuffed with polyester). Played around with most of them, though a few were withheld over safety concerns. Imagine they are all perfumed to smell like catnip. \ud83d\udc31\ud83d\udc31\ud83d\udc31\ud83d\udc31",

      "text": "This is more than just a starter kit everyone.. Take one or two toys out of the package every week OR spread them ALL across your home. ****One warning though: the white \"cat nip sack\" doesn't seem to actually have catnip in it. On top of that, it has a long string attached to it. I suggest cutting the string off or only have the toy available when you can actively supervise your cat playing with it. Too many stories of cats strangling themselves with toys like these****",

This is way better than the mixture I got at target for about the same price. One of our cats loves the wand toy so much that I stick the handle in the a drawer and she keeps coming back to play with it for hours.",

However, as another reviewer mentioned, there are some toys made of material that can be easily scratched or bitten off and ingested. My cats did shred and no doubt ingested some of the material from the toys in question and they have since been taken out of rotation. The rest are holding up great and are really cute!",
