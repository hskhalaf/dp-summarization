We are very satisfied with our choice and play every day. The table was delivered earlier than scheduled which made us happy. The table is very easy to set up and came with great instructions; easy to read and follow. The craftsmanship is awesome. The table is easy to level and maneuver with a good solid playing surface and nice painted lines. The ball holders on all four corners are extremely convenient. I love the volume of the ping as the ball strikes the table.",

It could be the balls, b ut I suspect it was because we were playing on a hardwood table, which had excellent bounce, and this one, which has little bounce. Perhaps this is unfair to compare. I'll updated after I've gotten used to it. UPDATE: Now that I have had it for a few days and played on it more, I've gotten used to the bounce. It is otherwise well made, very easy to assemble and a lot of fun.",

      "text": "The origins of Joola are a bit complicated, a German brand bought by a Maryland office representing a Chinese manufacturer, but the table itself is made in China. The quality is solid, and the weight is heavy! This is at the very least a two-person lift per half. The table does not connect in the middle, but is two separate halves clamped together by the net clamp. It is very solid and rigid, without much assembly required beyond attaching the wheels. Table includes magnetically attached score keeping sliders, and the corners function as ball storage. Table comes with a small cute welcome package. Our purchase was made through Amazon Warehouse, and the quality is essentially factory new.",

It seems to be pretty durable, but only time will tell. The little ball holders are a bit cheaply made. The plastic busted as we were trying to \u201csnap\u201d them in place. You also reinforce them with screws. A couple of those were stripped almost immediately, so if the ball holders are the determining factor between this model and the one below, buy a basket as a ping-pong ball holder and save yourself some money. As far as putting it together, it was pretty simple. Took about 30 minutes. We would highly recommend.",

There are two corners of the table seriously damaged. Unacceptable! I read many reviews that also mentioned damage, I wish I had listened and purchased the table elsewhere.

The only improvement I could ask for is some type of built in storage (possibly on the branded cross bar between the legs) to store paddles and balls when not in use.

You can certainly spend more for a table, but why would you? This one is excellent - crazy heavy, but the kind of solid that you know will last a long time. The fact that you can split the table to use as two independent serving or eating tables makes it all the more useful to have around the house. The corner ball holders are a great feature - wouldn't have normally bought for that but we love them. Would highly recommend for anyone who wants a casual fun table but who is also looking for quality.",

Also allow for a little extra space for storage because the two pieces nest with one another therefore is actually 65\u201d wide when stored vs 60\u201d.

I read reviews on other tables where the balls didn\u2019t bounce as smoothly due to the material of the table; no issues with this one. This was a great addition to our house as it gets the kids off the electronics and out moving. My husband and I play this whenever we need a good break from adulting.",

I guess you can't blame Joola unless you fault the shipping box. When I installed the ball holders I also had trouble getting the screws to grab. It was like they were too small. I haven't contacted Joola yet so maybe I'm doing something wrong. Even with the cracked corner and loose screws the ball holders still work. I wish I could give them a 5 but that wouldn't be accurate. You'll need to buy paddles and balls.",

Box came looking like it had fallen off a few trucks, but nothing inside was damaged as it was packaged really securely. Table plays great and we enjoy how easy it is to move around and store.

They really only wanted to bring it into the garage and leave it there, but we did get them to bring in the front door. Not a complaint, just an important note to keep in mind when having it delivered.",
