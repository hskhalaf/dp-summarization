It's a wonderful thing that Dr Mercola had combine the Omega 3 with Astaxanthin, which helps it to cross the brain barrier. Astaxanthin also helps with reducing inflamation. Impressive! The only thing I am not satisfied with is the capsule is be made of gelatin from tilapia. I really hope that it will be made from wild-caught tilapia in the future, for farmed fish are not healthy at all. Especially, lots of tilapia nowadays are imported from China. I expect the pruduct to be of high quality, meaning 100 percent from all high quality sources.",
