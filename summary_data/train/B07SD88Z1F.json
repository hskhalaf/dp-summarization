Very bad first impressions with this company.",

The package came in perfect conditions, The 4K screen is just amazing, I read about how annoying the keyboard would be but it\u2019s super comfortable and smooth to type, i haven\u2019t got any problems so far while testing it\u2019s magnificence, I love it!",

Throttlestop or some form of under volting is an absolute necessity to even use this computer for work. My PC had chronic USB issues with the ports constantly failing to read or write and detect simple accessories such as a mouse.

I got around it by mashing f12 and choosing windows to start. A little annoying, but not a big deal since it hasn't happened since then. Battery is a little lackluster, but that's kinda to be expected. I played destiny 2 and ace combat 7 - both of which ran very well. Still, it may vary for you depending on which game you play, considering that the laptop is apparently aimed towards designers...",
