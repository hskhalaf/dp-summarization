And the best part is once you find your spot at the beach the folding table has cut outs for your drinks and the table has plenty of room for your books, sandwiches and gear. I highly recommend this product.",

Love the fact that it becomes a table with cup holders. My only concern is that the mess will not hold up to carrying the large umbrellas. I have put a hard surface at the bottom to reinforce.",

For myself, after seeing all the carts at the beach i would probably have gone with one having four wheels which seemed much more stable (mine did tip over once but it was packed full). I do not regret this purchase, but next time I would consider more than just the table aspect.",

Also there's a net bag for carrying loose items. Cart is thought out well and a plus for all situations.",
