      "text": "Works well but you do need to plan ahead. The main container needs to be placed in the freezer overnight and the ice cream mixture itself should be made in advance and put in the fridge also. Very easy to use and ice cream is ready in about 35 minutes. The container is somewhat small however,probably enough ice cream for about 5 people from one batch. The kids think it's fun and the ice cream tastes great and fresh.",

Both times, the mixing paddle stopped after less than five minutes because the mixture froze on the side and bottom , up to half an inch. ( Directions say it may take 20 to 40 minutes). The mixture in the center was not frozen. Recipes from website tasted good, more like a thin milkshake. Cleanup is easy. BUT not as expected. I hope seller will accept the appliance back!",

      "text": "Very mediocre results my first few tries, and twice the blades just stopped moving and I had to intervene multiple times to get them working. Part of the problem is that the pieces don't fit together well, and nothing clicks into place, so the various components sort of detach. And if the ice cream has firmed up when that happens, it's a real pain to get everything back in place. Also, the capacity listed is maybe if you filled it to overflowing, but it's a very small canister. Maybe technically they're not lying, but practically it's BS.",

Having to leave the heavy pot in middle of it in freezer for 2 days makes it not a spontaneous treat. It's basically just a stirrer machine. It doesn't make anything cold, just the piece in freezer does that. So honestly you could just put ice cream mixture in a bowl in freezer and stir it occasionally and end up with same thing. But this machine does stir and keep ice cream cold enough while doing it to make ice cream. I would not buy again, but it was easy to clean and works.",

Even if the freezer is at 5 degrees and you store the container for 24 hours, it will churn for 30+ minutes and you will still get soft-serve goop that will not set properly. If you store it at the absolute lowest temperature, it will make decent ice cream in 25 minutes. As I said, at $23, you get what you pay for! I think when summer rolls around I will get an old-fashioned rock salt churning machine and get some exercise as I churn it the old way... and get better ice cream!",
