Didn't want to spend $600-700 again so settled for a cheaper model since this has lots less options . But I never used all the options on the D5000 anyway and the D3100 has plenty options to take very nice pictures . Lens, battery and accessories were interchangeable so this helped a lot . Pictures still turn out beautiful since the same lens is being used . If your not a professional photographer then this works great without the extra expense .",

It has all of the basic features I wanted but is missing the additional resolution of the D5100, 14.2 Meg vs 16.2 meg, and the adjustable screen which is OK. The most important thing to me is that it uses all of my lenses and attachments I had for the D60 and uses them as well or better than the D60. It's a very nice camera. It takes very nice HD video. It is limited to 10 minutes but when you think about it thats a pretty long video. I'm glad I bought it!",

He loves the camera and it works with his lenses. He particularly likes the movie capabilities and we just returned from a winter photo trip to Yellowstone where it performed quite well. We just wish that it had exposure bracketing capabilities for high dynamic range scenes. Other than that, it works quite well and it was a great price as a used camera purchase from an Amazon Merchant.",

The D3100 is a great body; unfortunately one lens I have the Nikkor 50mm F/1.8 AF lens does not autofocus since this body needs the AF-S lenses but otherwise our existing investment in glass is preserved. The unit is smaller and lighter than the D70s was and the improved picture quality is very noticeable. The Ken Rockwell site still recommends this model unless you're a professional, I'm glad I followed his recommendation.",

I really have only two complaints: 1.) No manual mode for video (although, you can use a flashlight to adjust the exposure and then lock it.) 2.) The LCD screen lights up when I'm adjusting exposure in the viewfinder's HUD. Also, I feel it worthy to mention that this camera has survived outdoor shoots in torrential rain.",
