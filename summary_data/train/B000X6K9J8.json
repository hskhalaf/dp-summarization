That way a person can place both hands on the jar to get better twisting action, helps to keep the jar lid flat against the top of the opener, which makes the opener work better, pull the jar toward you and twist, helps to keep balance when the lid starts to open. Install at the front edge of the cabinet, not toward the wall. Woody S, Virginia Beach",

It takes a time or two to get used to exactly how to hold your bottle or jar, but after that, no problem! It will gouge a smooth plastic lid a bit, but I haven't found it to be a problem.

      "text": "This is an EXCELLENT product for hard / tough to open jars, bottles of any size. When I installed I placed the ezoff with the point of the V facing me and the opening of the V away. I have found this to be much easier for opening things and you can utilize two hands this way. It comes down to preference which way you want to install. So simple and easy to use for people of all ages and strengths. The only complaint I have is the included hardware screws could be longer. It would ensure that the ezoff is very secure. If you have longer screws, I recommend you utilize those.",
