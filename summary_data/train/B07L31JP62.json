The value proposition compared to Apple products is incredibly strong, while also offering a matte display, substantially better performance, user upgradability, and similar build quality. I can't say anything bad about this machine. Everything from the wifi performance and thermal solution to the sleek and minimalist design, Razer hit it out of the park!",
