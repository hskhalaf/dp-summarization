Our last bench was the same width as this bench, but on our old bench, the legs were placed too close together, so the bench sometimes felt like it would tip over if you didn't center yourself exactly when sitting down.. This bench has the legs placed all the way in the corners, the screws are reinforced with metal rather than going straight into the wood, and feels very sturdy. We love the appearance as well as the durability of this bench.",

I received them today took them out of the boxes and assembled them very easily. I was pleasantly surprised as to how sturdy they are and my concerns over reinforcing the legs proved to be unfounded. As I said I only received them today but I don't forsee any problems with them and would recommend them, if someone asked.",
