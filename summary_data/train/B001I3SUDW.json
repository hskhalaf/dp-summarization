She said she'd have never bought this herself, finding she could do the job with a knife just fine. However, after using it once, she marveled at how much better it is than using a knife and uses this every time she wants to prepare a dish that uses avocados. This year I bought one for my college-age daughter because she lamented about not having one for times she wants to prepare avocados. And my younger daughter who will go to college in a few years has already informed me that this will be on a future Christmas list for her.",

The spoon-like scooping part is pretty nice, more convenient than a regular spoon, but to hold it in a way you can use the spoon side, if you are right handed, you end up with your fingers on the straight sided serrated part. Not painful per se but inconvenient. All and all, I like avocado and wanted this tool to work, unfortunately it doesn't quite cut the cookie.",
