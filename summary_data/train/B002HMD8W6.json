Cons: I think they allow way too much air in and my eyes dry out after just a short ride. My eyeballs almost feel like they are freezing when I wear these in winter. I guess the air is supposed to help prevent the lens from fogging. The only other con is that I can't stop seeing the little plastic pieces on the sides that I believe are supposed to support the tear-aways.",

      "text": "These goggles feature clear lenses and are good for night skiing. I had some other off brand ski goggles that were OK, but they were too dark and had to much tint for night skiing. For the money, definitely worth it. Be sure to place the goggles on your face BEFORE you start skiing/snowboarding and keep them on, do not take them off or goggles will fog up. It also helps if goggles are anywhere from normal room temp up to body heat (72\u00b0 F - 98\u00b0F) before wearing them. If the goggles are cold when put on face... they will fog up.",

Although once I had the lens pop out when stretching them on to the chin of my helmet; a small inconvenience that only took a moment to correct. Would definitely purchase again!",
