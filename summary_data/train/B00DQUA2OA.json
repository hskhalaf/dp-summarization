After the rain, I removed the cover and found the car streaked with ribbons of dirt. See uploaded picture. The second problem is we trusted the vendor's sizing recommendation and not our own measurements. The result is a car cover that is too large. I'm hoping the vendor will contact me to make this right and I am able to give a positive review.",

I thought by paying a little more I would be getting better quality but fell apart faster than $20 dollar ones here on amazon. Complete waste of money. I tried contacting seller and they instructed me to take pictures and after I sent pictures I never heard back from them ever since. Please save your money don\u2019t buy this garbage.",

I bought extra large first and wasn\u2019t happy about the extra length hanging down(sorry no pics of that..touched floor on both sides and hung with a lot of extra on each end). So I decided to try the \u201clarge\u201d size. Those are the pics I added. I just wanted a cover for inside my garage. It is just a tad to small, but works for me and what I wanted. Absolutely love the quality and soft interior of the cover. Definitely is the kind of cover you want to protect your baby.",
