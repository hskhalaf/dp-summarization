Also it has an area to put iPhone but is not compatible with newer iPhones I think the only iPhone that fit were 6 and below. The car seat is great and sturdy but does not give good head support.",

The tires go flat constantly which is super annoying and when not using the car seat and you just put your baby in it, the back doesn't sit up straight its always on an angle so the babe is lounging rather than sitting up straight. On the bright side, super easy to steer, smooth ride, and easy to fold up and pop in your car (even though it is heavy).",

The stroller turns well without baby, but once he's in there turning it is a beast! And we have a much smaller than average kid.
