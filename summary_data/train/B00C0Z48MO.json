It's small enough to catch the \"pieces\" that other scoops miss but open enough to sift quickly and quicker than any plastic scoop design. It's worth it for that feature alone. Next, it is metal and will last forever and is easy to sanitize. The length of the handle is great. I understand the requests for a square scoop to get corner or larger. If you have lots to clean then that makes sense. Otherwise a quick scoop (except for corner) is done faster with this design. Maybe they can sell a prototype for a square and see how that works. 5 stars as it's the best scoop!",
