They fit like a glove and and so comfortable. My heel spur has been painful lately and I played a tennis match the other day in these shoes. My spur pain is gone. I couldn't believe that the pain went away so quickly and all I did was wear these shoes.",

      "text": "I have been wearing a size 8 tennis shoe forever. I just had to return two other brand names because they were incredibly small (how could this be) I know my feet have not grown, is the shoe industry changing, does it matter where they are made? The sizes weren't even close to an 8 as I have known them all my life. I took a chance on these because I have worn ASICS before and sure enough they fit perfect! Size 8 is a Size 8. To top it off they are a great looking shoe! Comfortable with little to no break in. I would highly recommend these shoes!",

Buyer beware...Asics has a guarantee on this outsole but only for their resolution line! Money down the drain that quickly!",

    "description": "Like its older cousin in the GEL-Solution\u2122 series, the new GEL-Solution Slam\u2122 3 tennis shoe is light in weight but not in performance. The new GEL-Solution Slam\u2122 3 GEL-Solution Slam 3-W features a low-profile midsole which offers our SpEVA\u00ae midsole material for enhanced cushioning. A lightweight midfoot Trusstic\u00ae technology ensures torsional stability while the solid rubber outsole provides sure-footed traction on a variety of hard court surfaces. The lightweight upper features a combination of synthetic leather and air mesh enhancing breathability and flexibility making this the perfect choice for the tennis player looking for a great lightweight, lower-profile shoe at a value price.\n\nIn 1949, Mr. Kihachiro Onitsuka began his athletic footwear company (Onitsuka Co., Ltd.) by manufacturing basketball shoes out of his living room in Kobe, Japan. He chose the name ASICS for his company in 1977, based on a famous Latin phrase \"Anima Sana In Corpore Sano,\" which, when translated, expresses the ancient ideal of \"A Sound Mind in a Sound Body.\" Taking the acronym of this phrase, ASICS was founded on the belief that the best way to create a healthy and happy lifestyle is to promote total health and fitness. Today, ASICS offers a full line of performance-driven athletic shoes and technical active sports apparel and accessories dedicated to bringing harmony to the body and soul.",
