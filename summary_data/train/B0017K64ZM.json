      "text": "The quality seems good but very disappointed how Landmann wants you to think that their products are made in the USA. I bought this as a gift for my father who is a fanatic when it comes to buying everything he can made in the USA. I was going to be extra proud buying him this and pointing out that its made in the USA. O'well, so much for that. Has made in China all over the box. I suspect if the company name was \"Landmann China\" there wouldn't be quite as many people buying their product.",

Any assembly issues others have mentioned are operator error. They apparently didn't know how to put it together. I purchased a cover for it to keep the weather off of it. The best money I have spent on a well made fire pit! Don't settle for less! Don't buy a cheap one. Enough said, our family loves it.",

We have block parties throughout the year and this fire pit will work out just great!!! Word of advice, do not purchase the Veranda 44\" fire pit cover that is pictured with this fire pit. It DOES NOT fit. It barely fits over the ring at the upper part of the pit. The cover would definitely fit the Big Sky (smaller version of the Super Sky) Fire Pit.",
