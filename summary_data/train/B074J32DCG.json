This travels case feels to be made of high quality materials, it is durable and does just what it's supposed to. In traveling I packed the following Xbox One X Elite Controller (in the hard nylon travel case) Astro A50 Wireless (headset & base) 3 USB cords HDMI cord Power Cord A few Games in cases Seagate 4TB External Hard Drive and I still had room to pack a few more things if needed. I would break down a pros and cons list, but honestly there are no cons that I've found yet.",

The top compartments are perfect to keep everything plugged in so all I need to do is plug in one power strip and its up and running!",

It's got six places for controllers, and the only issue I have is when you place your controllers in slots on the left and right (rather than middle), they have a habit of sliding out when the case is opened. I carry two controllers and have to store them in the middle two slots because of this. Case fits well in overhead bins and underneath seats, and is proportional in size to whatever luggage you may carry with it. Could use a strap on the bag to slide onto a rollerboard carry handle.",
