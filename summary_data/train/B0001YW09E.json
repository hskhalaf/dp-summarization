I bought a pair of these & added a couple of whistles. The labeling on the preservers is clear & easy to understand, also informative if you haven't researched 'personal flotation devices'. I would've given 5 stars but I can't. Even understanding their intended use, and allowing for the low price, they won't get that last star. These life 'vests' are cheaply made and won't last long unless they never get used.",
