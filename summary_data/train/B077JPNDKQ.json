The charging outlet doesn't hold the cord so the slightest movement and it comes unplugged. It won't switch off anything but military time and not a single device in my house can hook up to it. All it keeps saying is searching for \"blue tooth\". It would be cool if it worked I think but I can't comment on the sound quality because I could never get it to hook up to anything. For now it is a just a waste of money...",

There are 3 levels of white but it also has a 7 color option which has 6 steady colors or a morphing. The Bluetooth is a nice quality for both music and phone. It has a clock and alarm feature. It also has an option to allow you to play a micro SD card. You can use headphones thru an Aux hole, but it also comes with aux cable for access. It can be portable and the charge lasted 10 hours for the light, shorter for music. Well worth the price, nice gift item.",

Thanks Tranesca for another awesome, affordable product for your arsenal of goodies! Anyone reading this review- Don\u2019t hesitate to buy this or anything from this company.... they have great customer service and products. In the event you get a fluke and something doesn\u2019t work, they\u2019ll handle it no questions asked! I really like them!",

The military time can be annoying at times but its not a game changer since most speakers don't even have a clock. All in all, I would buy another one like this if I needed it.",
