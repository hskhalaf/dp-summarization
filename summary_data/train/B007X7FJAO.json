It's funny watching him stick his face inside or actually roll it over to make food fall out. He will not play with the chipmunk unless it's a game of fetch, he won't pull them out of log just to pull them out,but it's definitely a lot of fun watching him play with the log and I'd recommend.",

The first day the stitching came loose on one of the critters and the stuffing found its way down my pup's throat. I could easily return it, but I dont know another one of better quality so will sew it, probably repeatedly.. If a squeaker finds its way down a pup's throat this seller will have more problems than a bad review IMO.",

So beat me it met my expectations but they might not have met my dogs. Please no hurt feelings. I wonder if it is the squeaky noise that she doesn\u2019t like. I thought the were cute and were small enough for her to hold. Beats me I am still trying to figure her out,",

He doesn't do much with the log anymore but he puts those chipmunks in his mouth and makes them squeak, it's so fun. We had to sew the seams on a couple of them a few weeks ago, but he's back playing with them again. He loves this toy and will buy it again when this one doesn't squeak anymore.",
