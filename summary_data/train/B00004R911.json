      "text": "I purchased 2 of these pans in Nov 2015. I used them about 7 times and each time a bit more of the non stick coating peeled away onto the bottom and sides of my popovers. I have been very careful washing only with a sponge and regular liquid dish soap by hand, in the sink. According to Amazon I can no longer return them, even though it has been less than a year and they supposedly had a 25 year warranty. These were expensive pans and really should have held up much better. It is a shame because I was so very excited the first few uses because they made incredible tall, puffy popovers.",

Other cups have followed. So now there's a bunch of holes. Plus, when the coating flakes off, it sticks into the dough so you have to be careful every time to look at the bottom. And then, of course, after the coating is gone enough, it is no longer non-stick...",

      "text": "I purchased this popover pan to make popovers at my mother in law's Thanksgiving. I was nervous about it because I'd never made popovers before, but this pan worked beautifully. I'm giving it five stars because - the recipe I had called for a non stick pan, but also said to spray the pan with non stick cooking spray before adding the batter. In the Thanksgiving rush, I forgot to do that and remembered halfway through the cooking time. I was picturing scraping ruined popovers out of the pan because of my mistake, but they fell right out, no prodding needed. They were just beautiful and perfectly baked.",

Even the cheese mix does not stick to the pan and just fall out. Nothing stuck in the small cup that has to be dug out. Much better than my old method in a muffin type tins.

Don't forget rule one: if your recipe is no good the pan won't save it. So if you have a popover recipe that works for you it will work as well as you hope in this pan.",

It was $3 cheaper than the local kitchen store, and with free shipping, I ordered three!",

Also your popovers can be used for a sweet desert, or you can make them savory by adding a meat of your choice and some gravy.",

The puddings puffed up wonderfully and as the heating was more disbursed than in the muffin tins, they didn't deflate when they came out of the oven. I read that this is generally caused by undercooking. Anyway, if you plan to make popovers or Yorkshire pudding, these pans are highly recommended.",

    "title": "Chicago Metallic Professional 12-Cup Non-Stick Mini-Popover Pan, 16-Inch-by-10.75-Inch -",
    "description": "Size:12-CupTo create true popovers, this is the pan for you. The cups are designed so that as popovers bake, rise, and \"pop over\" just like in the bakery\u2014they won't spread into the others in the pan. Deep tapered cups promote even baking and better air circulation. The pan is also great for making muffins and cornbread. Oven safe to 450\u00b0F / 232\u00b0C; not intended to be used under the broiler. Sharp-edged utensils and knives should not be used. \nAt Chicago Metallic, we believe that serious baking requires serious bakeware. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve been crafting innovative equipment, for professionals and serious home bakers, for over 100 years. We\u2019ve built a global reputation one kitchen at a time. People know our products are built for durability and can be depended on year after year. We\u2019re proud to offer three distinct lines of premium bakeware plus stylish, innovative specialty bakeware and baking essentials. The Chicago Metallic Professional line of bakeware makes cooking and baking a delight. The non-stick surface easily releases each recipe and makes clean-up effortless. It\u2019s the preferred choice of bakers who understand quality and design, but also want professional-grade durability.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nRegular muffin tins can't make a perfect popover--the classic American pastry that requires just the right heat circulation to inflate and pop over without overcrowding. Chicago Metallic has engineered this pan to ensure that every popover gets a big rise. Each 2-1/4-by-2-inch cup is suspended from crossbars and has an extra-wide lip so popovers can spread out and up. Properly puffed, popovers are a quick breakfast indulgence with butter and jam, or a savory surprise for dinner when stuffed with a mushroom filling. This pan is made from the same professional-quality steel and nonstick coating as Chicago Metallic's full line of bakeware, which is designed for the home cook who has high standards. --Lynne Sampson",
