      "text": "These were the perfect size for my SUV and appear to be well made. Easy to install although I am not fond of the bottom strap that goes around the front seat for aesthetic reasons. I tucked the bottom strap into the seatback netting and ordered magnets to hold the bottom snug against the seatback instead. One magnet inside the seat netting and the other inside the bottom pocket on both lower corners. Works out great and looks neat and tidy. If you decide to do this you will need 8 magnets; 4 for each protector to achieve a snug fit and sleek look.",

We drive long distances regularly and my 5-year-old sonetimes watches movies on her tablet. I bought this thinking the tablet would mount at eye level for her. Because of the added height of her booster, the tablet ends up even with the chest. Because of the angle of the back of the seat that the organizer hangs on, the tablet angles downward. These two factors make it incredible difficult to watch anything on the tablet. However, it is a great holding pouch when the tablet is not in use.",

It is much sturdier and remains in place much better than the old car organizer I used to have. Totally recommend!!",
