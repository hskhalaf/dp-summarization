      "text": "I\u2019ve been using Bak products for years and each time I purchase one the quality control gets worse and worse. This time for my 2019 F150 the rails that hold the slam latch were attached so out of spec it damaged the rails attached to the truck before I realized what the issue was. This thing costs almost $1000 so don\u2019t expect that kind of poor quality. At this point I had already installed everything on my truck and this thing is too bulky to try and repack to return. Now I have damaged rails that look like crap, a cover that I had to rework to get it to work, and have lost all faith in BAK all together.",

But the instructions were clear, and all the parts were included and fit as described. I like the way this looks and operates so far. We'll be taking our truck on a road trip next week and that will be the true test. I'll update this review if something unexpected happens or it fails in some way. But for now, 5 stars all around.",

It was packaged very well when received and all the components were in the package. Watching the short install video really helps with the actual install. My only request with this product is that they should supply (4) brackets for each rail, vs. the (3) which the company supplies. Installating the rail brackets 6\" - 9\" from the tailgate end, leaves a little bit of flex when opening/closing the roll top. Great product!!",

Not really the durability you would expect from the \"leading\" industry brand...That being said there is a lot to love about this cover such as bed security when closed and general ease of installation and operational features. Just wish they spent a bit more time at the factory to tighten it all up and match the price point. Pretty sure I will be switching brands. Good luck",
