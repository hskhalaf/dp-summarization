This tiny little box is absolutely packed with power. Everything is so responsive and 'instant' it just feels so much more intuitive and inviting to use. The things it can handle is just amazing. I can honestly say this is one of the best gadgets I've ever bought, it's transformed the way we use our TV. Yes it's quite pricey but believe me, it's worth every penny.",

      "text": "Netflix and Amazon apps use Dolby Digital Plus, which although CAN be downgraded to earlier versions of 5.1 sound - the developers have chosen not to support it. So if you have an older AV receiver which uses an optical connection, it is impossible to have anything more than stereo sound from Netflix and Amazon on this device. This limitation is missing completely from the NVIDIA sales material and web site - so this review loses 4 stars for lack of transparency. It's a shame, the device is great and really fast and nice to use. But lack of 5.1 is an absolute deal-breaker. Will return it.",

It's a little on the expensive side though and although i don't regret my purchase i would have felt that a lower price would be more agreeable. The bottom line is that you probably already have devices that can do anything that the shield TV can do but probably don't have a device that can do it all in one and as well and seemlessly as this can. It's also smaller than i expected which is great",

Technically this is a console killer for certain people, any power this little device might lack Vs a higher end system is offset by the ability to utilise Nvidia serves to do the heavy lifting and sending the computed data as a stream. For some, this is the next step in gaming. For me, it's mostly just an expensive future proof android box I wanted because my TV wasn't native android.",
