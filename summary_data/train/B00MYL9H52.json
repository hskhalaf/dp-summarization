There is a setting where it counts and another where it counts but in both English and Spanish. There is no setting where it just does music and sounds the way the older one did. I think that was better for very young babies. I have no complaints about how the toy works, though.",

However, if you pause too long between coins, the counting starts over. Not a big deal if you are fast enough, but toddlers who are still learning fine motor skills might not put the coins in fast enough.",
