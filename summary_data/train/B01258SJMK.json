Perfect snow boots and they look a little more fashionable than typical snow boots in this price range, especially in the blue.",

I felt the inside bottom liner a day later and they were still wet (not sweat, wet). To be fair, MICHIGAN winters are very very wet and its almost impossible to keep their feet dry unless they wear wading fishing gear. But over all im happy with our purchase. She mostly needs these boots for when she goes to school not hours of playing in slush.",

She picked out her favorite color/design and I ordered them in July. Delivery was on time. When they arrived, I was delighted. Very cute, with sturdy rubber and deep treads, no apparent openings, furry interior, soft insole and not too large. Its still only August, so they haven't been snow/water tested yet, but I will be very surprised if there is leakage. Given that they are no longer available, I assume they are very popular. They are a terrific boot. If they become available later, buy them.",

The lining is extremely nice and fluffy and the exterior seems to be water proof. We just got them so when we use them in the snow I\u2019ll update if they\u2019re not. My son is 10 wears a size 2 I bought a 3 they fit great with a little extra room. Would definitely recommend as of right now.",

Good bottom grip to allow for use when snowy and icy. Little one was able to climb up hill with no issues after large snow fall.

I love the color, the draw string so you can tighten the boot and the zipper which makes the boot easier to put on. The rubber shoe part is great and sole with grippers is great. It is a little heavy because my granddaughter is a lightweight but it is a great boot.",
