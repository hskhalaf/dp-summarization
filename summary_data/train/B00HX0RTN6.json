However the quality of the padding materials leave a lot to be desired. After about 14 months the soft material started to peel. Maybe we received one from a bad batch as I didn't see any other reviews with similar issues. Because it is out of warranty, customer service was no help. Note: volume limit only works when used with a cable. Bluetooth has no limit and can go pretty loud.",

We also bought a second set (in purple) and those seem to be doing well so far. My children are 4 and 8, and they fit their heads well and were easy to use. Update 2/20/17: customer service contacted me (without prompt) and offered to send me a replacement headphone set! We have a new set that is in full working order and couldn't be happier. Thank you to Lil' Gadgets for still valuing the customer!!",

It's very hard to find good quality products nowadays and when you find a company that cares, as a consumer, you stick with that company.",

I like the audio cable option, it doesn't have to be charged, and the cable can be replaced. It has been my biggest problem with previous purchases. Kids tried the sharing port, where you plug an audio cable between 2 headsets, they liked it. I'm very satisfied with my purchase. I purchased separate USB chargers, with the same specs as the headsets, making charging an easy task when kids want to use bluetooth.",

      "text": "Originally, I was quite convinced at the sheer number of positive responses. After receiving 2 sets, I'm sorely disappointed. Like a few other reviewers have said, the volume is far too low to hear anything over ambient noise unless you're in a very quiet room. Cars and airplanes will down out any amount of volume. Additionally, the Bluetooth is spotty at best. One of the headsets doesn't pair with anything (I can't pair it to anything) and the other requires a fair bit of finagling. TLDR: Don't bother with these. There are many other headphones/earbuds that will work much better than the $50/pair that I paid for these. These are being returned.",

      "text": "These are awesome! Bought for traveling with my 5-year old twin nieces and was the perfect choice! The girls could watch the sample thing on one Ipad and each wear there own head phones or watch something separately on two Ipads. These were durable, comfortable and the volume control was a must. Easy for the kids to use and understand. Fit them perfectly! If you're looking for headphones for your kids, look no further. It was convenient you could listen via bluetooth or wired in case they ran out of charge.",

On long trips, my little ones complain that it feels tight around their heads but them but nothing intolerable. My 5-star rating has to do with the seller. I had an issue with one set and informed Jacquie. She told me that I had a one year warranty and if the problem persisted, it would be replaced. Well, a few months later one side of the headphone completely stopped working. Once I informed Jacquie, she quickly sent out a new pair, which was very much appreciated. Because of the this, will definitely purchase another Lilgadgets again.",

I didn't consider the car seat headrest side clearance so it took some coaxing to get my son used to not having much room to move his head side to side. Although after further consideration there may be a small safety risk associated with a child wearing these in the car seat. After realizing this, we switched to an in-ear bud style for road trips.",
