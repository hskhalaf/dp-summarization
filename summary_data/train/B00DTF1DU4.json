      "title": "Nice shoe but they do come up small and to Narrow!",
      "text": "These are a good quality well made shoe, the grip is very good on the wet and muddy trails I run and being water proof is great. The problem I have found though, is although I ordered one size up on my normal shoe size I am finding the width to narrow. They felt OK when I tried them on and had a walk around but after running my usual 10k runs I am finding my toes are painfull and made one bleed, never had this before with my Asics. I didn't think I had a particularly wide foot! So if you do, then I would look elsewhere as this has turned out a rather expensive mistake!",

My first impression was that although long enough, the shoes were too narrow. However, they have already started to stretch to a comfortable fit. I use the shoes on public footpaths on the fields around my village. They give excellent grip in the dry, and release mud rather than letting it accumulate in the damp. The quality and designate very good. i think I will be very pleased with this purchase once the shoes are fully \"run in\", but for the time being I will give four rather than five stars.",
