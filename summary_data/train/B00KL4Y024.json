      "text": "This is the third one I've purchased. The only reason I've had to purchase so many is my own fault. When it was too cold I dropped it and cracked it and another time I overheated it. As long as you pay attention this thing is amazing. After I've been outside overheating I pull this out of the freezer and lay down with it. Or more importantly when I have a headache...take some ibuprofen and lay down with this on. I absoulutely love it and will keep purchasing if I'm clumsy again.",
