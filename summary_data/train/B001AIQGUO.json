These coatings are notorious for degrading over time and becoming a gross sticky mess. This mic is no exception. I've owned it since 2013 and not too long ago dipped the plastic shell in alchohol to break down said coating. The threads on the usb connection point can also be stripped if not careful.",

I can't fault the mic for this though, so I give it a 5/5.",

The tripod is a bit wibbly-wobbly when you have a pop screen attached to it. I do recommend GETTING a pop screen. It's well worth the investment.

Also this was the best price by about $25 under any place that I found. It's easy to use and does a great job of giving you a professional sounding recording. I would recommend this for anyone who needs a quality microphone that isn't over priced. I use it to record podcast for the internet, great buy, glad I found this one.",

Voice is very clear. I also bought a voice pop screen for it. Always a nice add on.",

    "description": "Record studio-quality audio directly to your computer via USB with the CAD U37 side-address condenser microphone-a great choice for both vocal and instruments as well as for creating podcasts and voiceovers for videos. Compatible with both Windows and Mac OS operating systems, you can simply plug the U37 into your PC and start recording. The U37 has two switches on the front. The first switch allows you to decrease the sensitivity of the microphone so the sound quality is clear for extremely loud sounds. For example, the switch should be in the \"-10\" position for loud voices, percussion and other high sound pressure level devices. The \"0\" position should be used for normal voices and string instruments. The second switch on the U37 is designed to reduce pickup of deep-bass sounds. The switch should be in the \"Normal Bass\" mode in most cases. However, if you want to remove wind noise, ventilation noise, or decrease the low frequencies in a recording, the switch should be in the \"Bass Reduction\" position.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nUSB Studio Recording Microphone\n * Record studio-quality audio directly to your computer \n * Excellent for vocals and instruments \n * Podcast over the internet \n * Create your own audio for video \n * Record your own songs \n * Simply plug in and start recording \n * Windows and Macintosh compatible \n\nApplications\nStudio Vocals, Speech, Instruments, Podcasts, Desktop Recording \n\nU37 Features and Benefits\n * Large condenser microphone element for warm, rich recordings \n * Cardioid pick-up pattern minimizes background noise and isolates the main sound source \n * Smooth, extended frequency response is excellent for singing, speech and instruments \n * -10dB overload-protection switch minimizes distortion from loud sound sources \n * Bass-reduction switch reduces room noise \n * Side-address design used by broadcast, TV and recording studios \n * Ten-foot USB cable for flexible mic placement \n * Desktop mic stand included",
