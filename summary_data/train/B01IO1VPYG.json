It's going to be fun to watch him see what pictures he gets on the camera. It was easy to put together. I like that you have a battery to charge and not have to buy any. Lol. It was priced great for a first one for my grandson to learn from. I will be getting a couple more for my other two grandsons. There younger but they will have one too. It's a great first drone.",

      "text": "Bought this for my nephew on Black Friday for around $20. The camera is actually pretty good compared to nearly every other toy-grade camera drone. Comes with (4GB) SD card and USB reader which is a major plus. We took it out on a breezy day (about 5mph consistent winds) and it handled great. I took a star off because there is no camera dampening, meaning the videos come out very \"wobbly\" for lack of a better word. What I did to fix this was insert a foam wedge between the spherical camera and the drone body. This fixed it pretty good. Overall, a great toy drone for the younger crowd.",

On the second day while flying it came down in grass, short grass, and wouldn't fly again. This was not a crash. It seemed fine. Had landed on it's landing gear. Just wouldn't fly again. Every time you tried to fly it, it would just fall over onto it's side. Like the two propellers on that side weren't working but they were all spinning just fine. Giving up and returning.

It broke the first time landing because the control could not connect it right. It run into stuff and fly\u2019s around like a giant buzzing fly with flashing lights.

I do find the Pictures and Vids are grainy. In video mode, the camera shakes so bad during flight, it's really not usable. There's no way of fixing this problem though. It's a cheap Drone, but it's a good place to start I guess in the world of Droning.",
