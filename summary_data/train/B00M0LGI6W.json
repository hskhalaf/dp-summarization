      "text": "Purchased this trimmer about one year ago. Used a few times through the warm seasons with no issues. Got it back out this week for spring trimming...worked great for about 3 bushes then started having issues. At first the motor would just stop - I thought thermal overload or my hand slipped off the trigger. Neither proved to be true - pretty soon it would stop and start randomly with the trigger firmly held. I narrowed it down to an electrical connection problem between the rotating trigger/handle assembly and the motor. Slightly rotating the handle would cause the on/off action that appeared random previously. Nice feature, but ultimately appears to be this tool's downfall. Will be contacting customer service.",

The reason I got it was because it looked identical to a Craftsman trimmer I had that held up very well but this is a different trimmer entirely. The handle and trigger seem identical but the blades are very thin cheap steel, as a result it is almost impossible to get a nice clean cut. So I now have a quarter of a bush with all kinds of jagged edges and stems sticking out. I wasn't impressed before it died, I'm even less so now. Returning to replace with another brand.",

The longer blade is a bonus as I can not climb up on ladders easily anymore so I can stay on the ground to get the whole crown and continue doing what I love most, gardening.

Doesn't go through them easily but if you have light limbs and shrubbery, it works rather well. I was able to trim bushes without issue as well. VERY pleased for what I needed.

The Greenworks 22 trimmer is exactly what I needed. Strong enough to prune the tree and light enough not to stress out my arms for a half hour pruning.",

Two-prong to three-prong is a flimsy connection at best because of the weight of the cord and the 3-pronged receptacle plug.
