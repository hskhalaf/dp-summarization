It took me about 10-15 wipes to clean a poop because of how ridiculously thin they were. I now have a case and only use these wipes for pee or for wiping hands. The honest ones are only a little better and i think I'll just stick to the costco ones, which can clean a poop with only 2 or 3 wipes. It cuts down on waste and frustration. I really wanted to use these because of cleaner ingredients but it's just really not worth the anger i feel when trying to use these \ud83d\ude2c",

Now that she\u2019s a bit older, her skin is better able to tolerate cheaper wipes. But as a newborn, when I tried to switch to something cheaper (pampers sensitive) it gave her a diaper rash. So I say this is definitely worth the splurge on delicate newborn/infant skin.",

      "text": "Like others, I am not certain if these are knock-off Waterwipes or not. We received Waterwipes as a gift for our NB and we loved them so much (compared to a few others that were gifted) that we bought another case. We still have plenty of other gifted wipes but still wanted these. Lo and behold, the Waterwipes purchased on Amazon are smaller, dryer, and have a very different texture to them. So far we have not come across any issues with them effecting our baby but we are still on the first pack out of the box. Will update a few packs in.",
