      "text": "I thought the Mypurist Free Cordless Ultrapure Steam Inhaler was nice, especially for helping me breathe at night. I have allergies and this really helped to open my nasal passages. It's also great for a facial except it only lets out cool steam. I did have a few issues with it leaking so not sure if I would buy this product. It is good as an inhaler, humidifier and steamer.",

I like the fact that it is cordless but I would like the option of being able to use the cord if I forget to charge it.",
