      "text": "This is actually really amazing technology. Unfortunately it was blown out of the water by DJI when they decided to offer the Mavic Pro Drone. I ended up selling mine for the Mavic. The 3DR had all the same features and was a couple years older. I also liked the open-source nature of the 3DR which allowed it to do some things that the Mavic probably can't. I loved using this drone with my GoPro that I already owned. At the end of the day though, the backpack in which I would carry it was HUGE and that meant I almost never took it with me anywhere. And if that was the case, what is really the point?",

I would recommend this drone to anyone, even beginners with some linux knowledge (the controller and drone both run a linux based OS. terminal knowledge is needed to re-calibrate the controller after a software update.). Make sure to get extra flight batteries, they last around 20 min. each, and take an hour to charge.",

But...I set it all up in the house and everything worked fine....took it out for its first flight and drone would not pair with controler...after reading the forums I discovered this seems to be a problem with the 3DR....contacted company they gave me a list of things to do..tried several times with no luck...gave up and returned product for full refund.....very disappointed!! Decided to spend a bit more and ordered the Phantom 4....I set it up and it works perfectly.... I should of orderd the Phantom in the beginning and saved myself the frustration and disappointment.....I would NOT and Can NOT recommend the 3dr after my experience..",

    "title": "3DR Solo Quadcopter (No Gimbal)",
    "description": "Color:Black| Style:Quadcopter OnlyDesigned from the ground up as a companion to the GoPro HERO, the Solo Quadcopter with Gimbal from 3D Robotics features aerial imaging-specific flight modes including Cablecam mode and Follow Me. A quad-rotor configuration, flight stability and autonomous flying are enabled thanks to a twin computer flight control system. The flight controller relies on GPS for navigational coordinates, plus uses data from gyros, accelerators, and other sensors to keep the aircraft safely flying. The Solo includes the Solo Gimbal, a 3-axis stabilizer compatible with the a GoPro HERO3+ or HERO4 action camera. This is a ready-to-fly bundle, featuring a pre-bound transmitter (radio controller) that has been styled after a video game controller for more intuitive operation. In addition to dual joysticks for flying, it features dedicated dials for operating the Solo Gimbal. In addition to the transmitter, there is a mobile app for iOS and Android devices. The app provides full control over the aircraft, gimbal, and even the GoPro itself. A mount is provided so that you can mount your smartphone directly to the transmitter.",
