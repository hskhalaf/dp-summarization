I have been a seiko watch enthusiast since 1970 , which I still have, needs a battery but still works. Don't delay getting this model, if you like heavy large face watches this ones for you. The plus is not needing a battery replacement ever, the online pictures don't do it justice it's gorgeous. I love the day indicator and the easy way to check the charge level. Thanks again Amazon this was a home run for me.",

All the documentation and warranty from Seiko USA was included with the watch. My only issue is the watch is more difficult to read due to the smaller hour and minute dials, but this is more the fault of my 82 year old eyes than the watch. Highly recommend the watch.",
