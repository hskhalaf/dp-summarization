This wires to the ear-buds are longer than in older models and fit into a magnetic socket in the neck piece. Compared to previous models the wires to not stick out like some alien antenna. Much more discrete than older models. A nice feature I recommend you use, as the dangling earbuds often tangle with my necklace or wired headset when I use one.",

Battery life is not as good as the other tones which I had purchased at least 3 other LG tone products in the past 6 years.

I even received an email to alert me that my delivery had been made and where it was placed. Way to go guys! Thanks! I am big on hands free driving. I don't always have my phone on me. I don't miss calls even with my phone on silent. The bluetooth vibrates when I get a call or when I venture too far away from my phone. Which also helps me keep up with my phone.",
