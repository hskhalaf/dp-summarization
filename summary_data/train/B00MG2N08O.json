It makes a bit of a sugar web on the ceiling if you turn away from it. Make sure you wait and collect all it makes, otherwise you miss some good treats and have candy webs everywhere. Wife and I are considering a plastic cover they suggested in directions but they cost about the same as the machine.",

It makes about one cone, then it needs another scoop. I add the sugar to the paper cone and add it that way since it spins it out instantaneously and the cone is there to catch the floss.",
