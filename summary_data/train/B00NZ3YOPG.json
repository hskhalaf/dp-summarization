I am not a fan of the huge overblown low end most people seem to want in their headphones, but these are a tad thin for my tastes. My only other complaint is that the earpads get a little uncomfortable after long use. However, for what I paid for them, they are better than a comparably priced set of Microsoft or Turtle Beach phones.",

You can hear yourself in chat. Cons: Very tight fit around ears..pain after one hour of use. Short boom mike. Short chat wire. Sound cuts out sometimes. This headset is extremely cool for the price. I will never purchase another set for more than 200 bucks again.",

Don't forget the old \"you get what you pay for\". I've had three sets of Turtle Beach and they've all conked out on me so I'm not falling for their gimmick anymore. This Polk heaset is in my opinion the best bang for the buck.",

When installed for initial use the headset did power up and was able to hear game and self through headset. Overall the sound is decent and it does the job in transmitting the sound from counsel to headset. I have nothing to compare to and I am not a professional headset reviewer. Added bonus-you are able to control volume with the included adapter and hide the mic when not in use. Unfortunately one of them had a run in with the family K9 and lost it's line.",

The sound is good but it is not quite what I was expecting, they are not much better than my Sony on-ear headphones that I paid $11.00 on clearance at Target for. The fit of the angled ear cans took a little getting used to but not a deal breaker. Overall I like the headset but with a Xbox Headset adapter they're not really necessary. Do yourself a favor and buy a headset adapter for $20 then us your favorite headphones/earbuds instead. If you don't have headphones with a mic or an xbox headset adapter then these would be a decent buy.",

At first the sound quality and comfort of the headphones were fantastic, however, after 15 or so days the sound started to go out in one of the ears. It required you to jiggle the cord around to get them to work properly. Contacted Amazon and they quickly sent us a new pair. Unfortunately 21 days later the same thing happen to the new pair. I would NOT recommend going with these headphones if you intent to use them allot. They don't seem to be built to handle regular day to day usage.",

Right now, I am listening to Spotify on my MacBook Pro with these plugged in and it works great.",
