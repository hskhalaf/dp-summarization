One important item, first trace your foot and measure the length and width in mm to see exactly what your feet really are. I found out my feet grew and measured something different than what the shoe stores were measuring my feet as. So when I purchased the shoes in the correct size they fit perfect. Happy Trails.",

My advice to anyone considering these is keep scrolling. The soft bottom is nice for about a month, then it starts to degrade at an alarming rate. Really disappointed that these were labeled as runners. Misleading is what it is. Surprised to find amazon has 1 month warranty on these. TERRIBLE!!",

    "description": "Fila began in 1911, in the small alpine town of Biella, Italy, a place renowned for manufacturing the world's finest textiles, and weaving fabrics with impeccable quality, true innovation and extraordinary beauty. Born of the city and its traditions, Fila is inexorably derived from Biella's dedication to artistry, luxury and elegance. This is our birthright, it's in our soul, and it defines our future. We continue to enrich the athletic experience by improving comfort and performance with Italian design, quality craftsmanship and refined materials. There is no feeling quite as luxurious as that of playing in Fila, and that is the reason for our existence. We create what is desired, not what is necessary. Not just enough, but more than you need. This is Fila.",
