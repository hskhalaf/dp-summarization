I tested a few small spills which were gently wiped up with no damage. I also noticed that the very fine print was much sharper than when using regular 24# paper. It is definitely tear resistant. With the price per sheet of slightly more than $.30 I won't be using it for all my printing (though I wish I could). Good value.",

Permanent markers may or may not smudge. Pencil smears easily, but that's somewhat expected. The only problem is that this material does not fold well. Making pamphlets and binding books that lie flat requires the use of high power presses because the fibers are too strong for that application.",
