If you really want this thing to be securely mounted, put it into a board long enough to straddle two studs, and mount the whole thing to the wall. I've attached a photo for reference.",

Even if you need the instructions (which you shouldn't - pretty self-explanatory) the directions are straight forward and easy to follow. The hardware (screws/wall anchors) are all great quality. I was able to get two of the screws in a standard 2x4 wood stud and the third using one of the wall anchors in the drywall. Has been up for a few weeks and holds my Cannondale mountain bike (Medium 29er) great. Super easy to adjust position from wall and angle of bike as well. Happy customer\ud83d\udc4d",

Ended up ripping up my drywall. It would probably work ok if attached directly to studs, but I'm done with this rack. Beware.",

It was tedious installing the 1x6 for them to be mounted on and getting the right height and spacing takes planning. I like that all the bikes sit horizontally with the adjustable arms. Also the top hybrid bikes have wider handlebars, so being able to adjust for those was key. You can see that the overall space occupied by the bikes is minimal. Very happy with product.",

      "text": "Ummm - awesome is all I can say. Installed with ease, make sure to drill a pilot hole if you are installing into a stud. Having this rack include an adjustable wall distance was a good idea, I situated my bike the perfect distance from the wall to be able to allow the wheel to turn 90 degrees and rest against a little wood plate I added to the wall to prevent the rubber from scuffing the tire (the rack included a velcro strap to keep the wheel straight, but that seems like a lot of work to add/remove each time I take the bike out the front door).",

      "text": "This product is exactly what I needed for our small apartment. The design is simplistic yet robust. I like that I can keep the bikes far away enough from the wall so that the pedals dont mark it. Also, aesthetically it adds to the urban-life wall art theme I was going for. The instructions were very clear and I had no problem using them. I used a stud finder and drilled very small pilot holes to make it easy to tighen the phillips-head mounting screws down. The result is a very sturdy hanger that easily holds our 17lb and 20lb road bikes. I highly recommend this hanger for your bicycle.",

I would suggest the instructions manual to omit direct drywall mounting instructions.",
