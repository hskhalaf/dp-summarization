I would not recommend for that reason. Update: The company contacted me and showed concern regarding my satisfaction. They shipped me a new backpack which arrived today. It's perfect. And it smells fine! I'm impressed by this company and recommend the backpack.",

Everything easily fits, and it is not overly heavy or a strain to carry. I've also taken it along as hand luggage on plane trips, and it worked out great. The gray color doesn't clash with anything you might be wearing. Compared to other famous-name backpacks, the price (under $30) is excellent. I haven't noted any ripping or wear in the fabric, but please note that it is not waterproof.",

      "text": "Really like this backpack's color and sophisticated look...it is elegant and very professional looking. However, it could be roomier inside, with more pockets and inserts for greater utility and versatility. The wide padded shoulder straps are a plus, and the side pockets are well-placed for a water bottle or umbrella, etc. The zippers glide well, and the USB cable attachment extension is a good idea, but could be better secured when being stored inside the backpack. Would be helpful to also have little 'cubby-hole' pockets or Velcro loops to hold the strap lengtheners in place for the shoulder straps. Overall, a nice little backpack, but expected so much more for the price.",

The integrated USB port is fantastic for traveling or short hikes when you want to plug your phone in without carrying a battery pack in your hand. The pack is sturdy and comfortable. The interior pockets are adequate and well placed. I've even received a number of compliments on it. Simple and useful!",

Some other reviewers complained there isn't padding at the bottom of the bag, mine has a considerable amount of padding on the bottom and zippers are high quality. There is a good number of compartments, it is visually attractive, straps are comfortable and stay at their configured length. Bottom line if you are looking for a backpack for a 15.4\" or smaller laptop buy this, if you have an abnormally large 15.4 like a Predator you are going to need to get a backpack for a 17\" backpack but that is your laptop's fault, not the bag.",
