One issue I had was when I installed the battery it worked great and once it timed out and turned off it wouldn't turn back on unless I took battery cap off and on again then it worked till it timed out and so on. I figured out the brass connection on the cap was tarnished enough to not make good contact to positive end of the battery. I carefully scraped the brass contact on the cap and now it works flawlessly.",

If the finder measures straight distance as the base model does...you will miss high badly if you're in a tree 15 feet above the target.

      "text": "If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive range finder compared to the more expensive options out there this may be the one for you. Simple to use. I don't necessary need the speed option, but being able to use the range mode and continuously range different distances by holding the range button down is a nice feature. Case is ok, but would have liked something a little more rigid with other attachment options other than the belt loop. Having said that if this sounds like something you are interested in I would check it out. 2 yr warranty gives you a piece of mind as well. Enjoy.",

The range seems to jump around a little in the finder. Having said that, it really seems to do a good job especially for the price. I obviously could have paid more to have an automatic focus, but I'm glad I made the decision it did.",

If I could change anything i would drop the speed calculator and spend the money on a 3-5 second delay to the digital readout after the completion of ranging a target. Thus the 4 stars",
