But after that, my hair kept getting lighter (and less supple), even though I never used it again! So my advice is to use this gently and gradually, to monitor your results over weeks, and don't overdo it in one day--esp. on thin hair!",

You have to wash it out thoroughly so you don\u2019t have any purple residue left in your roots. Also, be careful to wash it all down the drain, it can stain the shower. I did not give 5 stars across the board because it does dry out your hair if you don\u2019t follow up with a good deep conditioner. But for the price, it is a great shampoo for keeping your blonde hair looking toned.",
