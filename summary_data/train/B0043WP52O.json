It makes no squeaky noises once setup. The rubber feet are soft enough that they hold their position on smooth flooring without marking. The treads are wide and comfortable for my feet. The platform is wide and deep enough for comfort and the ladder doesn't wobble around, so pretty stable for video. For the light weight, I am impressed by the strength and stability of this ladder and I am very glad I bought it! I highly recommend this ladder as comfortable and SAFE. No reservations at all.",

This Little Giant is wide enough for comfort and stability, has a nice, high safety rail and is solidly built. The top rail has a convenient small parts tray. the extra wide top step is very comfortable. As an added bonus, it closes very easily and is small and easy to store. I LOVE IT !!!",

The real icing on the cake being that it's not only super strong/sturdy, along with zero wobble, but especially light in weight. In summary, it rates even better than 5-stars.",

For safety it was important to have a lot of ladder extend beyond the top step platform. This allows you to safely ascend by having something to hold onto. The ladder is light weight and also it folds down very compact. We have a nine foot ceiling and this allows us to complete any projects, including those that reach the ceiling. I think the price was very reasonable too.",

So much so that I avoided projects involving the ladder.

The ladder is very narrow and I had planned to put it in the space between my refrigerator and the wall because there is a 4.5 inch gap but I has not considered its height. The ladder is too tall to fit under the cabinet that is over my refrigerator.",

This ladder is perfect. It is very lightweight and also has a good height for most internal house jobs. I have vaulted ceilings and needed to change the battery on a smoke detector and this ladder was tall enough to reach without climbing all the way to the top. Highly recommended!",
