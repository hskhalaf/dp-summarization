She liked them so much she\u2019d beg for them and even stopped eating her regular food. On the other hand, I rate them \u201c1\u201d only because I believe the treats are causing my cat to itch and lick herself bald. She didn\u2019t display these symptoms until she started eating the treats. Currently, she\u2019s been off the treats for 2 weeks while I wait to see if her hair grows back and the itching stops. I\u2019ll follow up with another update in a few weeks.",

And, the vendor did not check for this and discard, but sold it to another customer, me. I have returned this for a replacement, as the product is fine, it's the behavior of this vendor I think is unethical. So, I suggest you look for missing seals, and complain to Amazon customer support if you find them.",
