No drivers, completely plug and play, and everything works out of the box. I would've liked an additional USB-C port that's not dedicated to charging pass-through, but it's a very minor concern. It's a stylish form factor, and very slim. To accomodate the slim nature, if you want to use the Ethernet port, the port hinges out slightly for you to fit an RJ45 cable in. Not a big deal considering it means the design can be streamlined, however I'm curious how many times one can unhinge the RJ45 port before something breaks... Time will tell!",

In any other situation, you'd be better off with a simpler USB-C hub for $15 and a separate HDMI adapter for another $15; you'd be spending half as much or less, and getting a better result. The other problem with this adapter is that it draws 160 mA idle (measured on a USB power meter), whereas my simple Aukey USB hub has no measurable idle draw.

I have been using the hub to interface between my old Macbook Pro, new Macbook Air, and WD external hard drive. In addition, I will be using this product during future syncs between my new Macbook Air, iPhone, and iPad. No drivers or installation of any software was required and I have had no problems thus far. The product is easy to use, and I appreciate the blue light that goes on to signify when the product is operational. So far, a very good purchase for the price. No complaints at all.",

Most of the time I have two things plugged into the ports--a USB mouse and an ethernet cable, both of which have worked flawlessly. I have also added an HDMI cable at times, which is when I have noticed the hub getting warm (which makes sense with having 3 different things plugged into it). It never gets hot to the touch nor does anything ever glitch while I'm working. Glad I bought it.",

So far I have not had the same issues with the VAVA version and the plug also sits more securely in my MacBook Pro's USB-C port. The Satechi version kinda of dangled out of the port and could slip out if touched slightly. I suggest this upgrade!",

Of course, there is power dissipations within the wires if you choose to use those produced by Apple so I can't really make a correct interpretation on the efficiency of this product.
