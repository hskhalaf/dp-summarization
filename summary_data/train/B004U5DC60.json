      "text": "This bow does not have a let-off! The whole point of the cam/pulley system in a compound bow is so that all the pull weight lets off at full draw. Meaning a 10 pound pull weight (normal for this bow) drops to only 2-3 pounds at the end of the pull. This lets the archer hold steady, aim, and release accurately and consistently. Learning how to shoot on this bow will force a shooter to learn recurve bow mechanics - which isn\u2019t a bad thing, but is for the wrong kind of bow.",

The bow was accurate and set where she could start shooting right away. I love that Genesis makes an affordable bow for left handed people. I also love that this bow will grow with her. She and I were both able to take turns shooting her bow while teaching her how to properly stand, aim, and fire. Great bow! Thank you Genesis for making such a great bow at such a great price!",

I suspect that any bow would likely have the same issue for a child. Anyhow, she loves the bow & is doing well with it (except for the part where she set her target up on my adirondack chair for practice...grrr! lol!)",
