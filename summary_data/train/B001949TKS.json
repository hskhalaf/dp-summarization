I could see how many I had left and keep them dry, organized, and free of being crushed at the same time. They take up very little space when repackaged.

To our surprise the bottle was missing almost all of the tablets, allowing us to purify only one quart of water.

The colour did not affect the taste of the water however which is good. Package is small and light, excellent for hiking as an emergency water purifier.

Throw in a few sticks of powered drink mix to your bag - just a tiny bit will cover any chemical smell if it bothers you. Drinking untreated water in the wild is just not smart anymore - these tablets do what the best filters ever made do...and take only a short time to work and make the water safe.",
