I love this fan as it moves a lot of air. I use it to cool my flat and specially whilst I'm cooking in the kitchen which makes my small flat a lot hotter. I set the timer to 2 hours on power level 1 and point it towards the kitchen and it cools down the kitchen significantly. Now I can cook more since I can handle the heat in the kitchen. This fan blows, I'm a big fan.",

I choose this fan for several reasons. 1-can connect to other fans, 2-has a timer that can shut off, 3-powerful yet quiet, 4-price compared to other fans. It delivered all of the above items under 100 bucks!!!! I use them to dry floors for my property management company and they are awesome!!! A few connected will dry out a room in no time flat!! I use them when our company paints, has wet carpets from hurricanes, and just when there is heavy moisture in the air for our oceanfront condos. I am a fan and will buy more!!!!",

Several screws are too rusted to come off and have stripped in place or else I would take it apart and oil the shaft to fix the squeeling. This fan should not have rusted like it did. It was used very little since bought. Ultimately had to throw it away, as a new motor was supposedly out of stock and cost around $50. Way to excessive. Would never by Xpower products again.",
