One of the pleasant surprises is windows 7 sees this as a media server or another computer so using this allows easy access thru windows media player. We have too many media files to justify hosting everything from a desktop so this allows me to take all that data from our desktops to further isolate them from catastrophic failure. This has five USB 2.0 ports so it's flexible enough to grow into as well.",

I have had it running for several months now, primarily as my backup server, with 3.75TB of storage. It is always accessible and delivers quite acceptable performance for backups and storing photos, etc. The unit requires an Ethernet hardwire connection (i.e. one of the ports on your wireless router) and supports up to 4 external USB hard-drives. I have 3 drives currently installed (2TB, 1TB and a 750GB drive), each one was just a simple plug-and-play installation, with no formatting or configuration required. Love this box - great value.",

Works well and have had no problems. I wasn't interested in the other model with a built in 1tb drive because I already had a couple of 1tb+ drives. I was more interested in the ability to have 4 usb ports to connect to. Overall, I'd recommend it! Great product!",
