The screen is just as responsive as my 5S, which was always a big stick point with me on the last Android devices I had. Battery life is spectacular. With my Pebble on all day, and in an area of poor service, still checking texts and emails, my battery lasted the entire work day (my 5S/5/4/4S would have needed a charge at around 3:00pm). If you're looking to enter the world of Android, or re-enter it, or just have a great device, the Moto X is for you.",

      "text": "Upgraded from a Motorola Droid Razr phone I got 2 years ago, so that's my point of comparison. I am a fan of Motorola's version of android, which tacks on minimal extras compared to most of the others. The Moto X interface is reminiscent of the Razr, but better. Notifications are handled much better (low power on-screen notice vs. blinking green light) - by far the best improvement for me. Performance and battery life are noticeably better also. Unless I am using it heavily I can go a day or so without charging, which is a distinct improvement over the Razr.",

It is the perfect size and fits perfectly in your hand (if you want a case that still feels great I recommend the SupCase). The voiceless controls are great, admittedly a bit buggy but they are getting better with every update and the active notifications are the best feature of a phone I've seen. The camera isn't the best, but I'm not really a picture taker so I don't mind. This comes highly recommended! I've had no problems with it at all.",

Also a Plus, the Moto X is a bit smaller, so it's much more comfortable in the hand and pocketable.",

The phone new out of the box is super fast but once you start DLing apps and taking photos and basically doing what a smartphone should do... it becomes laggy. I had to constantly delete things from my phone. It didnt help that the OS took up about 5gb of space.. 5gb!!!! If you're looking for a cheap, simple smartphone that takes ok photos and has a tiny memory capacity, get this phone. Or save some money and get a better phone.",
