A few of the legs did not thread smoothly into the fame but might have just had paint in the threads. Motors operate smoothly and legs have a good range of height adjustment. Love the lights and USB ports on both sides (allows placement against a wall). Heavy and awkward to handle but once assembled all is good. Will update this review after more use.",

Amazon was no help as the seller only had a 30 day guarantee!! The seller wanted me to get under the bed and look at the motor to tell them what is wrong so they could send me a replacement part. I am a single female that has no idea about any motors nothing is detached so how else would I know what\u2019s wrong? Just ridiculous I would never do this again this guarantee is worth nothing!!!!!",

The under lighting and massage features create a spa-like feeling, and the vibrating leg and body feel great to wind down from the day and caught some great initial reactions from our pets. They are heavy duty and my wife adds... they are not a 5 minute setup... 15. :)",

Great massage (three modes with 10-30 minute timer), 5 position buttons programmed in, night flash light built in on the controller, lights built in under the bed, use the USB chargers every night for my iPad and iPhone, half the price of adjustable frames at mattress locations.
