      "text": "An OK set. After careful inspection, 3 of the burrs have issues. Larger cylindrical burr can cut with about 1/4 of the circumference; the other 3/4 of the circumference have inadequate cutting edges (which I tried to photograph and highlight a bit at random) from the off-center forming process, so 3/4 of the edges will end up rubbing against the material instead of removing it. Smaller cylindrical burr will cut with about 2/3 of the circumference for the same reason. Larger ball burr has an air pocket at the brazing. It's probably on there well enough and won't fly off, but who knows until that happens... Got to wear protection! Other burrs in the set have good cutting edges.",
