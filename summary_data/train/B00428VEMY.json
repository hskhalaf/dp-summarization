The foam is comfortable, and the lens didn't fog (but the weather was only in the 30s-40s) I'll update my review after I've used these more, but so far I'm extremely satisfied; I've never skied with goggles before and I am a convert.",

I'm surprised the description hasn't been updated to better explain the exposure ratings, but I've worn these on days that featured plenty of sun and didn't have much issue. Bolle is a quality company that makes quality products. You'll probably see a similar pair on Alex Pullin this weekend at the X Games Aspen.",
