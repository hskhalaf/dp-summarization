I used this with the Cerepil Blue wax (14.11 oz tin) since I saw a lot of people say how well it fits right into this wax warmer. It has been easy to use, but I would recommend to completely unplug this item when you are done. The knob on the front slides quite easily, so it would be easy to accidentally turn it back on (especially if you have kids or pets.) It seems to heat up pretty fast. This has been a good experience so far.",

So Low, for example is much further to the left and not actually ON the L. Same with M and H. Which can lead to easily burning yourself of you dont know what your wax is supposed to look like when heated properly.",

It takes about 20 minutes for the wax Hard Wax) to melt to the point where the melted wax is coming up on the sides. Remember to put your lid on while the wax is melting, it helps it melt faster, by keeping the heat in ;) Overall the Wax Warmer is awesome, does what it's supposed to do and it's a few bucks cheaper than what some stores charge for this exact one.",
