This is a great addition to our Whaler! Pick one up and happy fishing. I just picked up a second rod holder because the first one that\u2019s a year old has held up well and still looks great. See pics for more details- one rod holder is a year old, the other brand new/ I can\u2019t tell the difference. If my review was helpful please consider selecting the helpful button. Thanks and happy and safe boating!",
