It's probably good enough for most people but it sounds way worse than broadcast FM and not even close to playing Apple Music tracks over bluetooth to the same car stereo.",

The features on this little unit aren't extensive, or if they are, they aren't that intuitive. I pre-program 10 presets and don't touch anything else on it while driving. The one thing this needs is a rotary dial or else, 5 stars.",
