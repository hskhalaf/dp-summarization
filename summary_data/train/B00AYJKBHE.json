It relies on a little heater in the base unit, the allows that heated air to waft upwards into the boot. I put some kinda-sweaty/moist leather Justin boots on to dry. A couple hours later, they were \"dry-er\". But not as dry as expected. Maybe this is an overnight kinda thing...?",

Spritz the inside of the boots, let it soak in a little, and drop it on this dryer. This helps kill off the fungus. I also spray my feet with it, but if its really itchy, you better grab the altar by the horns before you spray them.",

The \"Toe\" of the dryer stems usually come off of the dryer and end up inside the boot - a minor inconvenience. The main thing is that I got one good dry out of these boots before the electronics went dead. I still use the dryer to help air-dry my boots propped up against a wall until I can find a more industrial dryer.",
