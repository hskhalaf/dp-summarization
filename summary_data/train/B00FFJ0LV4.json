If you have trouble sleeping like sometimes I do, it may not be a great idea to have these before sleep. I felt that for me, they would wake me up which I guess makes sense due to the electrolytes!

I can't consume aspartame because it gives me a headache. I read someone else got a headache but I consume a case every 2 weeks and no issues. It solved my midnight leg cramps and makes me feel better getting enough fluids. My dad is 92 and drinks it because dehydration is a problem for older folks. I buy other flavors occasionally but I'm happy with my purchases.",

Also, the expiration date was 2-3 weeks from when I received the shipment. Normally, the expiration date is several months away from the time I purchase the Propel. I am having difficulty getting in touch with a live person who can help rectify this situation. I have filled out forms, but have had no response so far from Amazon. I would like a refund for the bad water, but I would like to know why they are sending out items with expiration dates occurring so soon. These are old products.",
