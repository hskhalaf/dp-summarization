      "verdict": "The reviews for the Altra Duo 1.5 have been divisive. There are people who like this shoe a lot, saying that it is a comfortable and well-made product. But there are also those who feel that it is not as described. The upper unit, in particular, is a highlighted area because while some say that the fabrics and design are accommodating, others complained that they\u2019re only sources of skin irritation.The Altra Duo 1.5 is intended for neutral pronators who like to take to the roads.",
      "pros": [
        "The breathability of the Altra Duo 1.5\u2019s upper unit is praised by those who like a well-ventilated ride",
        "Some testers feel that the shoelaces are long and stretchy enough to accommodate small and significant adjustments to the fit",
        "The toe box is praised by purchasers",
        "they report that it is spacious and able to boost the quality of the toe-off",
        "According to a handful of consumers, the midsole foam is able to responsibly attenuate the impact forces generated by the foot-strike",
        "The flexibility of this product is lauded by Altra fans",
        "The traction capacity of the outsole is considered reliable and precise"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "Several testers have detested the design of this product, stating that the look isn\u2019t too appealing to the eyes",
        "A couple of users report that the thin tongue unit has a tendency to bunch up and cause irritation",
        "The edges of the collar are deemed sources of scratches against the ankles and heel",
        "A break-in period of several uses is apparently needed before achieving full-comfort, based on some reviews",
        "According to a few runners, the upper unit near the forefoot is quick to separate from the sole piece"

      "text": "For whatever reason I came home with two bloodied heels the first time out. I think the material the uppers are made out of is so flimsy it clings to my socks (more than my socks cling to my feet) forcing my socks to rub against my heels. I used clear glossy packaging tape on the inside of the heel and things are fine now. My Paradigm and Olympus shoes never gave me any trouble. I would have gotten Paradigms again but their arch supports are too high to suit me. Perhaps Altra should include a roll of tape with every pair",

They have the same cushioning and wide toe box they are famous for. The upper material is what I would compare to a water shoe, very thin. I bought these for indoor workouts on the treadmill and have put about 30 miles on them so far. They will last a long time doing that. I don't suspect they will last as long for an outdoor road shoe but that will even come down to each individual runner and conditions. They have met my expectations.",

I have worn many different Altra shoes for thousands of miles and never ran into this issue... but none of my other Altras had suck a poor heel cup design. It is not padded at all- it is a thin, hard material with a seam sewn right at the Achilles. Returned them after one six mile run. Other than the heel, the rest of the shoe was great.",

Like many have said, I had some blistered achilles on the first run. I used some thicker socks and put Band-Aids on my achilles the skin was healing and once the shoes were broken in things were fine.
