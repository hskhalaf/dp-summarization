It makes my skin soft and afterwards, when I use toner on a cotton pad, there is no dirt left behind, so I know it's doing its job. The scent isn't overpowering, but it is there, so if you have a high sensitivity to fragrance that is something to consider - perhaps check out The Ordinary's Squalene cleanser as it's quite similar but with simpler ingredients. This cleanser comes in a decent-sized bottle so it is a good value for the money IMO.",

I cannot recommend this product even though it did make my skin less dry.",

I\u2019ve purchased the corresponding moisturizer and I\u2019ll be trying that as well to see if it helps. Cannot tell you how grateful I am to have found this product.",

I have dry skin that always felt rough and I was often tempted to use scrubs, even though I don't think they're very good for my skin in the long run. Now my skin feels smooth after cleansing and I'm able to avoid scrubs completely.",
