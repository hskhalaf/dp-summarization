I'm a 40-something year old woman and I do flat water lake paddling. Nothing too strenuous, but we're out there for several hours at a time and I wanted something comfortable. This fits the bill. I pretty much forgot I had it on, which means that I'll leave it on, which is great.",

I am happy with the price paid and the quality of the product when comparing it to higher-priced models. I was hesitant to purchase this as I wasn't sure it would fit the bill for our needs. Thankfully I took the chance and went with it. I will repurchase this should the need arise. The items were shipped super quick, and I cannot complain about my experience at all. Edit: 12/26/2017 Works really well, allowing for superb movement. Worth every penny of my purchase.",

The main differences are that the Torsion has two pockets, better material (400 denier vs 200), bubble foam on the back, and a waist belt for better fit.",

The pockets could be a little bigger but this isn't a fishing vest. I have no plans to replace this vest until it wears out. More expensive ones may have more adjustments but there hasn't been any problem with fit for my wife and I. I wear it kind of tight and after about 10 minutes of paddling you forget you have it on.",
