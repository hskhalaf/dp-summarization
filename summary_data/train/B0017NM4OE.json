The second time I went out for a bike ride with my 65 pound labrador it broke, when she saw another dog she really wanted to meet. Like I said, luckily I had my emergency leash on, otherwise, she would have been gone. I only gave it 2 stars because it looks otherwise durable, but way too overpriced for the quality.",

She is passed out now! Instructions suck! I read reviews to get the thing on and needed a wrench to tighten all the way. It could stand to be a little tighter but didn't move while riding!

      "text": "My giant puppy loves to hunt for lizards while we take our walks every day. Sometimes, we just have to get the walk done without regard to stopping to smell the lizards. On those days, and when she has lots of extra energy, this springer thing is the bomb. This contraption works great. I let her set the pace - sometimes we trot around our usual half hour walk, and it takes just 10 minutes with me pedaling and her trotting. Sometimes, she's feeling it, and she gallops for a mile or two. It's a great change-up to our normal routine, and an excellent accelerated doggie exercise device for when I'm running late. A fantastic product.",
