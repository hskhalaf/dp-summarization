Also I just thought it would be a little bigger, but that's my fault. I didn't read the product dimensions before hand. I don't have huge hands either. All my work gloves are in a size Large.",

      "text": "This review is for a 50-ton jack. Seems like a decent jack, for the price. Bolts must be used to connect/disconnect the three-piece pump handle. This is inappropriate because, in normal operation, one lifts the jack to the load with just one section of the handle then adds the other sections as leverage is needed. Most jack handles assemble with convenient spring clips, saving a lot of time. Given the short throw of the piston, a standard screw adjuster in the top of the piston is needed so the operator does not need to stack blocks under the jack.",

The most troublesome was the haudrylic fluid leakage around the bleed-down screw each time the jack was lowered. The fluid stained my shop floor and I don't like that. It will forever remind me what a crappy jack that I bought. Secondly, when the bleed-down screw is opened, the jack binds and will not lower under light loads. The jack is now in my junk heap waiting to be taken to the metal recycler.",

I think the problems most people are having that cause them to leave bad reviews on this product come from improper storage, careless shipping, and/or improper first time use. Always store bottle jacks upright so they don\u2019t loose fluid. Also when you use this jack for the first time make sure you follow the first time use instructions. The paperwork provides instructions to remove excess air that has formed inside the hydraulic of the jack from travel and climate/elevation changes during shipping. This air could inhibit jack function in left in place. Anyways, great jack. Would recommend and buy again. (6 ton model)",

The only other hydraulic jacks if used before were floor jacks not bottle jacks and in comparison you have to pump the lever on this many times to lift the car. It takes no muscle to lift the car just way more pumps than I would have expected. Be careful the small base does make it a bit tippy. A big bonus for this jack was it was the perfect size to fit where the scissor jack was without rattling around.",

    "description": "Size:20 TonThe Torin BIG RED T92003B hydraulic bottle jack is designed for residential and commercial use. It is industrial welded and engineered using a drop forged alloyed steel construction that is ideal for quality and durability. The inner/outer welded structure and steel construction will keep your bottle jack leak-free and give it an overall stronger build. The fully welded structure is designed for hard-hitting commercial use, making large loads easy to lift. A wide, rugged base adds stability and strength. The lifting range is 9-1/2\" to 17-3/4\" with a 20 ton (40,000 lb) capacity. It features a high-quality glide-action pressure pump designed to lift with minimal muscle and effort and has an integrated built-in oil-bypass and overload valve that protects the hydraulic system from extending beyond its travel limits. Hydraulics are powered with a high-quality oil, which offers better corrosion resistance and high/low temperature flexibility, allowing the unit to operate at temperatures between 40 degrees Fahrenheit and 105 degrees Fahrenheit. Piston ram utilizes a Y-style polyurethane sealing ring with backup ring, preventing the load from falling slowly. This powerful bottle jack is ideal for lifting cars, trucks, SUVs, farm vehicles, heavy-duty machinery and industrial equipment. It can also be used for military applications, agricultural and industrial environments where the equipment receives heavier abuse. This unit is 100% factory tested for reliability and safety to meet and comply with ASME PASE safety standards. Includes a limited 1 year manufacturer warranty.",
