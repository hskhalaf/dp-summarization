I used the app to record video of the journey. I didn\u2019t even know that was a feature until I had it in my hands. I was so impressed I took it to work for show and tell.

Mine went swimming in sewer water, and still gave me a great image. For snaking through drain pipes, I recommend taping the tip to a plumbers snake - the cable is semi-rigid, but you won't be able to push it past maybe 6' of large pipe before it starts to fold on itself. The phone app was great too - simple to connect via WIFI. I love this borescope so much I bought two :-)",
