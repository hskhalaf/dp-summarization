      "text": "Great product but be careful about the images. The 2422V002.*** models just don't have the tile flange so they are primarily meant to be drop in tubs and not for alcove installation. It's still possible to install them in an alcove but requires extra care for water-proofing. Note that American Standard's own website has the incorrect pictures so I can't fault Amazon for it (you will notice that in at least one of the pictures the tub is shown with a small tile flange on 3 of the 4 sides - that's not going to be there so don't count on it).",

I opted for the thinner even thought I could fit the wider one due to being in the country and having limited hot water and on a well. It's faster to fill up. I love the look too.",
