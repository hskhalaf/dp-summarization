I found this really helped me develop a high follow through with lots of power and control. I do practice a lot with it, and I admit a lot of improvement came with practicing with the Hanger, which allows you to hit balls.",

      "text": "I bought this device because I enjoyed Kelvin Miyahira's blog and youtube videos. After a few minutes with this device i was finally able to feel the proper hand positions at impact. I was somebody who flipped/scooped the clubface through impact and as a result i hit really high and weak shots. Not good for someone who lives in the windy desert climate of Las Vegas. I still struggle with the occasional scoop/flip but this device has reduced that issue significantly. Now if only i could learn the proper hand path I probably wouldn't shank so much...is there a device for that?!",
