I decided to see how long I can use the Surface Go with windows 10 S OS, which means that you can only install apps from the MS Windows Store...so far, so good. If I have a need to upgrade to Windows 10 Home, the switch is very easy via the Windows Store...just remember, you may have to update the Windows Store app then the upgrade to Windows 10 Home, for free, is available. I use this as a secondary computer to surf web, watch Netflix, work on MS Office documents...works exactly as advertised.",

I personally use it for all of these things on a daily basis, and I've never been disappointed, even with the 4GB model.

She keeps him quite and happy so I guess you can call it a win/win. Told call it a tablet in his presence though. She's a computer! *eye roll*",

At the same time, I view this as more of a tablet than a laptop. Thus, my expectations in several categories are within the range of such a device.",
