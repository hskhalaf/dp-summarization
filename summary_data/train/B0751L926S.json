It just takes forever to remove any thickness. On the plus side it is easy to hold and maneuver,and much quieter than a sander. Also for being a battery operated tool, I am impressed with the battery life, but it does bog down if you apply too much pressure.....but it seems to remove material faster with a light touch. This tool is more for light duty maintenance to prevent a callus ,if used regularly , than it is for grinding down a already present thick callus.",

I would expect something moderately sturdy at the price paid. Secondly, the instructions say to charge it for several hours to maximize longevity. For me the green charged light came on after just a few minutes on the charger. I believe you can also over charge this item so this leaves me in a difficult position and strongly questioning the QA involved in manufacturing this item.",

This routine only worked for as long as the moisturizer was still wet. Once the moisturize dried up my feet were back to their original state. This callus remover quickly took off hard skin from my feet, but I did have to do my heels 2 or 3 times before they were baby smooth. The grinding of the stone against your skin does not hurt and the process itself does not take much time. I highly recommend this product!",

Cant understand what they'd be doing to cause it to bog down, but mine goes to hard. Then, the most concerning, was the complaints of it not working to take off calluses.

My feet are not in the worst condition and I felt I had to be there so long to get the result I wanted and then you really have to be at it every other day or so to keep up the smooth feel. Typically by then the roller starts to lose its effectiveness. I just don't find it practical. I feel like I'd have to have 20 of these little rollers around to keep up. Great idea but needs to be stronger and longer lasting.",

Honestly, I'll need to use it probably 4 more times. Then my feet will be in good shape where I can probably just use it once a month. It does work good, on a full charge. But after about 20min of work, it's ready to be recharged. And if you give too much pressure it slows to nothing. I'd GLADLY pay double this for one that lasted longer and had better torque.",
