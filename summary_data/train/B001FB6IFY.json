A few degrees difference may not matter much if you're using it as a deep fryer thermometer, (I don't know, I don't use it for that) but for candy making, the temperature has to be exact.

      "text": "This is a great quality no frills item that I don't anticipate I will have to replace for a very long time. I have the best digital thermometer but never trusted it, found it was a pain to set it in a way which would utilize its many abilities, and its a hassle to get batteries. No fuss and great quality! Very large with a sturdy clip and you don't have to worry about the thermometer hitting the bottom of the pan and effecting your temperature since there is a metal piece on the bottom.",

I tried all of the recommended online fixes for this issue before I decided to return it and get another. The second one... had the same problem. I could deal with it if it would not have affected the temperature reading, but at cooler temperatures the bubble is smaller, as it warms up, the bubble gets larger.
