      "text": "Finally a dog shower that isn't a plastic piece of junk. This is totally worth the extra money in my book because you don't have to monkey around with leaks and cracked parts because the diverter is metal and that's generally the first to crack in my long experience with plastic diverter valves for my dog's shower. The only criticism I have (and it's not a big deal) is that if you're attaching to a single lever faucet, it's difficult to regulate the flow. It works like a kitchen faucet sprayer and it's hard to get a lower volume spray for the dog's face area (for example).",

I wish it were possible to somehow get the converter closer to the handle but it's fine that it is up by the shower head. Overall very pleased with the product and would highly recommend it for someone looking for a dog washing shower head or for rinsing cloth diapers- because of the long hose it reaches to my toilet just fine!",

This did the trick after trying a few other products. Based on other reviews I used a rubber band on the handle to give it a grip since it was commented to be very slippery. Will look into something more permanent but rubber band works fine for now. Nice solid build and not lightweight plastic. Includes everything needed, even the thread tape, for install. Just need a screwdriver and a drill bit if you use included drywall anchors.",

I could go to the local dog wash but both my dogs are highly reactive and it's never a good experience. So I ordered this attachment. Came with everything needed to install..A huge plus!!. We have a 100 year old house so my Husband was nervous about the install. It took 5 minutes. Initially there was a little leaking but more plumbers tap and it stopped. Has VERY high pressure which is nice. Works great both dogs got nice warm baths. I would definately recommend this!!!!",

It was easy to install...just remove the shower head and hook the unit into the line. I would recommend this device very highly.",

It made getting their armpits and bellies a piece of cake! The ability to control the pressure is easy and a great feature. It doesn't leak at all when not switched on. I think they actually enjoyed their showers because the pressure is like a massage. My only regret is not buying this sooner! Very much worth every penny!",

Not a deal breaker we just hang the nozzle from the shower head.",
