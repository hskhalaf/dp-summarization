Sound quality/ bass isn\u2019t exactly production studio quality but it\u2019s still amazing. Didn\u2019t expect the noise cancellation either.

I had to return these, material build was subpar ....the paper thin wires to the ear buds will likely flex and crack when placed in a travel bag/ pocket in transit, which is what happened to the last set I had of a similar design. If you have the Holland tunnel as your ear canals, perhaps these will suffice.",

Since I was still inside of the return window, I returned that set for a replacement back in January 2019. Now, 4 months later, these headphones also stopped charging and are now useless. I've tried air-cleaning the micro-usb socket as well as trying a multitude of different charging cables. Nothing. Given that both sets of headphones experienced an identical failure to charge after just a few months, I suspect that this may be a chronic design flaw. I strongly recommend that you steer clear of these headphones.",

Although, the buds never are in danger of completely falling out while running",

They collect a lot of moisture from the ears and they get gross really quickly if you don\u2019t wipe them down often. They size and form act as earplugs so the \u201cnoise cancellation\u201d from that is pretty good. The battery lasts a long time so overall is pretty good for the price.",

      "text": "I bought these after a friend recommended them and I am glad I did. Nearly 9 mos. of use and no issues. I have a two year old at home who loves pulling at anything he can get his hands on\u2014these earbuds have been yanked out and grabbed from my ears and not skipped a beat. My only gripe is a small one\u2014due to the sound/song/call controls being on one side, the weight of the earbuds to one side is heavier which makes listening with one earbud in less realistic. To date, these are the longest lasting, still functioning earbuds I have bought online, would definitely buy again!",

The volume panel is on the right side but outweighs the left side so it\u2019s alwats lopsided. Would be a much better review if the left earpiece worked",

I have experienced infrequent sound quality loss through the microphone while on the phone (i.e., the individual I'm speaking with reports \"garbled\" words) when frequently walking through the house.
