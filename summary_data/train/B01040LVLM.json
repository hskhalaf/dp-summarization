I have charged it as per the instructions but when I put it in the hexacopter, it flashes quickly and won't power on. I'd like to get a replacement battery to see if that fixes the problem. Update: Returned it for a new one. The replacement I got is not as well made. It is much less sturdy and very flimsy. One of the motor housings broke and I've had to reinforce them all with electrical tape. I regret this purchase and would recommend sticking with Syma models in this price range.",

I thought a hex would be easier to fly for him than a quad. I want one so bad now not even kidding I set the thing up so my little cousin could take it out of the box and it not need to be trimmed or anything, and it flies so much smoother, and I spent probably 2 hours flying it before I put it up without a single crash landing. Definitely recommend for beginners.",

Motor burnout, hasn't happened yet with 2 hours of intermediate run time but the motors are inexpensive and relatively easy to swap out. Price point at $52 is very good for what you get. Only real fuss is linking the transmitter/receiver, which takes a minute or two and can be frustrating for a 6 year old.",
