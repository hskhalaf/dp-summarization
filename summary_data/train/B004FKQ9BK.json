      "text": "Awesome helmet, has to be one of the best for the price. It is DOT and Snell approved so that's nice. It's not ECE certified as far as I know. The vents on it make a huge difference in having them open vs closed. The visor system is nice and switching shields is easy. It provides good airflow and has pretty good aero up to at least 115 as far as I can vouch. Its a bit of a bulky helmet all together but it fits well and has a nice strap. The cheek pads are easily interchangeable to get you a perfect fit.",

      "text": "It's honestly a great helmet and fitment matches most other helmets. The low review is because every picture shows a tinted visor and no where in the description does it mention the color of the visor. I figured that the helmet I received would simply be the one pictured. I received a clear visor not a tinted. I'm not happy about this because another visor is close to $40. Be aware that you will most likely get a clear visor not what is pictured.",
