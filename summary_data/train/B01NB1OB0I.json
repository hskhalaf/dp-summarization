I could adjust the temperature remotely...great! But after two weeks, Alexa disconnected. The unit continued with its regular program, but the remote functionality was gone. I figured out that the batteries were too weak to maintain the connection to my home WiFi network. Ok. New batteries. Two weeks of remote access, then again... new batteries were required for remote functionality. No bueno. Now I use the unit as a regular programmable thermostat. You know, like the ones you can buy for a third of this price! Booooo!",

They eliminated two jumper wires by having that done internally. Setting up the smartphone/thermostat to the WiFi was easy too. This replaced a complicated digital setup and this new setup works right. Right out of the box. They even put a built in bubble level so mounting the box straight was easy. Size of this unit hid all the older holes in the wall. No touching up the paint.",

      "text": "After you connect the wires to the unit, all you have to do to get the wireless to work is Install the app first. Then follow directions. Takes minutes to complete and you are ready to go. The thermostat works as described and keeps accurate temps. I love that I can control it when I am away from home, you can monitor, change temp and even turn off or on. I did not get the one that has touch screen but this does everything from the app or just from saying Alexa set thermostat to 74, and the other associated settings are all voice controlled.",

      "text": "The tech support is first class and very patient. Dont lock the units if you have an questionable router or you're stuck untill you reset everything and start over. I love these thermostats, it will save me a lot of money being I dont have to depend on renters to turn of the HVAC off when they leave the property anymore and I can control them from anywhere. To complement these new gizmos I have a little 1080p wifi cam that I can also observe from anywhere so I can determine that renters have left the facility or arriving so I can manage the AC/Heat etc myself. I am so happy about this purchase.",

    "description": "From across the room or across the country, your Sensi Wi-Fi thermostat makes it easy to remotely control and schedule your home comfort - Anytime. Anywhere. Designed to work with the wires you already have, Sensi thermostat does not require a common wire (c-wire) for most installations, so it is compatible with the HVAC equipment in many homes in U.S. Canada. A c-wire is required for heat-only, cool-only and heat pump (without aux) systems, and for use with Apple HomeKit. Check to make sure it will work for you at sensi.emerson.com/compatibility . The intuitive app walks you through each step of installation with custom configured instructions, removing all the frustration and guesswork from the installation process, so you can be up and running in no time, no experience required. Put your comfort on your terms using location-based temperature control with geofencing or creating custom heating and cooling schedules with the flexible 7-day scheduling option with the ENERGY STAR certified Sensi thermostat. Both energy saving features you save about 23% on your HVAC energy usage so you can save money without compromising your comfort. Plus, Sensi integrates directly with Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit, Google Assistant and Wink home automation platforms. Connect to Amazon Alexa to control your home temperature with simple voice commands, or just ask Siri to set, raise or lower your home temperature when using Sensi with Apple HomeKit. Whats more, Sensi Wi-Fi Thermostat has been named the Best Value smart thermostat of 2018 by USA Todays Reviewed.com Energy savings calculated by comparing operation time for a nationwide sample of Sensi users with temperature adjustments averaging 4 degreeF vs. users with no adjustments. Savings vary based on equipment type/condition, insulation, climate temperature adjustment size/frequency. Based on survey results of 2120 respondents that purchased and installed a Sensi thermostat in 2018, approximately 70% reported installing in 30 minutes or less. Adding a common wire may impact installation time. Does not work with electric baseboard heat and some other systems. System requirements for mobile app: iOS - 10.0 or above Android - 4.2 or above (5.0 or greater to use the Geofencing feature).",
