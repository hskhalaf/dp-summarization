The projects are interesting, but again, as much as it pains me to admit, its not gonna grab the attention of every kid.",

Both his father and I were electronics technicians in the Navy and I thought it would be a fun way to share some of our experience with him. We hadn't had a chance to play with it yet, and I was busy today in my office. My son was in his room playing and came in to my office to show me how he had created a fan circuit by reading the manual. Sure enough, once we put in the batteries and closed the switch, it worked like a charm. This is a great little kit for use one on one or in group play.",

He and his 6 year old sister have a blast following the diagram and seeing what they can create. I'm sure there's some educational benefit but I don't see how much you can really learn about electricity by playing with the circuits without supplemental content. It might spark an interest in learning about how electricity works though.",

That blew all our minds but really lit a spark in his creative juices. Thank you for another activity that uses the mind and a bit of creativity!

Teaches attention to detail too. If a single connection is wrong or not snapped in place correctly - the project probably will not work as designed. They then have to retrace and check everything to see where the problem might be. Great thinking game for kids. Good for small groups of kids too. They can work together on projects.",

    "description": "Product Packaging:Standard PackagingLet your child have endless fun learning to build circuits with these colorful electronic Snap Circuits. Each one features more than 60 parts that easily snap together. The Snap Circuits Classic can be used to make interesting circuits, encouraging educational play that teaches your future engineer about electricity. All of the parts have colored graphics that represent their real electronic names and symbols. This educational toy comes with a complete instruction manual and project guide that helps you to guide your child through exploring over 300 experiments. Some of the projects include making circuits for doorbells, radios, alarms, flash lights, laser light, street lamps, a lie detector and a fan Modulator. This kids' Snap Circuits toy runs on four AA batteries that are sold separately. It is ideal for children age 8 years and older. Snap Circuits Classic comes with over 60 parts to create 305 different electronic projects. The parts, which include snap wires, a slide switch, a resistor, a microphone, and capacitors, snap together easily onto the included plastic grid--no soldering required. Each part is numbered and color-coded to make identifying them easy. These parts combine to create working circuit boards just like the ones found inside televisions, radios, and other electronic devices. With its easy-to-follow instructions, Snap Circuits gives your child a hands-on education in how electrical circuits run the everyday devices that they're familiar with. They'll also gain valuable lessons in building and in following instructions. The project manuals include large color illustrations and simple directions for each project. the projects are arranged in order of complexity, kids can build on their skills as they progress through the manual. The lessons start out with a simple electric light and switch project that demonstrates how electricity is turned on and off with a switch. Further along, kids can put together a fire fan symphony, a water-detection alarm, a delayed-action fan, and more. Once children have mastered several of the techniques introduced in this kit, They can use the parts to experiment and create their own customized circuits and electronic devices. The Snap Circuits SC-300 can also be upgraded to the Snap Circuits Pro, Snap Circuits Extreme, or SCM-400 with the purchase of a UC-50, UC-70, or UC-100 upgrade kit, respectively. Kids will enjoy additional parts, manuals, and projects that will take their kit- and their fun- to the next level. Snap Circuits SC-300 requires four AA batteries, which are not included.
