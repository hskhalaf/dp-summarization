I made mini donuts and they were done in minutes, I am able to make a big batch in very little time. You cannot find this mini dessert maker anywhere in Was-mart, Costco or other stores. It's definitely a keeper! Too bad the plates were not dish washer safe, it's not that difficult to wash them by hand anyways. This is a keeper!",

Second batch it wouldn't come back on, wait till cool still nothing, changed outlet still nothing...try other appliances on the outlet, it works. So I was sad and stuck with a batch of batter. I end up having to cook them in the oven, using my donut and cake pop pan. Did not come out that pretty but at least I didn't have to waste my organic and gluten free batter. I will buy it one more time and hope that one was just a defect, fingers cross. Will update when I get the new pan \ud83d\ude00",
