      "title": "Great Heat, Good Quality",
      "text": "Much better quality than the last big box store heater I bought. Upgraded to this unit and I am not disappointed. Bought two and assembled both in less than 2 hours. Only the heat reflector assembly is slightly difficult. I recommend buying the larger one piece reflector as it spreads the heat out much further. It\u2019s certainly a little extra, but well worth it. The unit itself heats up quickly and is easy to start with the electronic ignition. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was that the cover for the tank should have hand holds higher for easier lifting. But a minor inconvenience given that you don\u2019t have to lift it very often.",

      "text": "This patio heater is better constructed than your average Lowes/home depot models. I was looking for a stainless steel version not soft Aluminum. However this unit is mostly stainless steel, except for the top heat reflector which is cheap and flimsy aluminum. So after a few days outside flexing in the wind, the top flimsy week soft aluminum fails and actually breaks off. Now after the first week its not even useable. Very bad design. I will be contacting the manufacturer for a fix, but probably will be pushing this to the curb on bulk garbage day. Dont waist your money. Find a patio heater with a sainless steel top heat deflector that can withstand some mild wind.",
