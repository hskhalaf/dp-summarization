I previously used sand bags or weight in a backpack, or a padded strap harness with chain looped through plates, but that setup really compresses your trapezius, shoulders, neck and gets uncomfortable. with this belt and chain, it makes your whole body a little heavier, but doesn't constrict your upper body motion or nerves/muscles. plus the weight hangs down more evenly instead of making your whole body tilt back like a weighted backpack does. Now I need to actually work out more with it, ha ha instead of just typing about it. :)",

The chain is not very long, which limits the number of large plates you can pile on though, so I would not recommend trying to stack a bunch of 45lbs on this thing. Instead try 10's and 25's and it should work out great for you.",

The reason it broke was due to belt squats at 405lb it managed one movement then bent. Other then maxing it out belt works great for everything else. I feel if the segment that bent was welded it could have handled 500lb with ease.",

So I decided to buy this and I'm very glad I did. The injury has completely healed and has shown not even the slightest signs of returning. I have to thank this belt for that and for others that are doing weighted pull-ups/dips, really urge you to get a belt to prevent injuries. I've used this belt alot since May 2012 and it's still in Like-New condition. It works great, it's very well made. Strongly recommend this product.",

Good quality belt and the chain is the right length. Highly recommend.",

It's very hard to close if you have a decent amount of weight on it unless you kneel down to the floor (requiring more effort than necessary).
