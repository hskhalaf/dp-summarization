      "text": "Because my son, who is in his 30's, only wanted cash for Christmas, I decided I had to make it a little challenging. This was perfect! He got kind of frustrated and would set it down then try again in a bit and did so until he finally got to the treasure inside! Then the fun went on with everyone else having a try at it. And yes, I had to cheat and read the instructions so I could get the money in there! This is a well made product and is perfect for keeping out on a table for a conversation piece to challenge all guests!",

I took the instructions page away from the box to make it more difficult. After 40 minutes he asked for help so I gave him the first step. He had it open within 2 minutes after that. He liked the money better than the box...but then realized his little sister or parents couldn\u2019t open the box and it dissappeared into his room. Who knows what\u2019s in it now!",

The box was built extremely light though, so I wouldn't give it a really long life expectancy.

By putting their cash in these really cool boxes (and offering another $20 to whomever got it opened first WITHOUT using a hammer), it entertained us for the better part of an hour. They really enjoyed the challenge, and gave them something to \"open\" on Christmas morning, which we enjoyed.",
