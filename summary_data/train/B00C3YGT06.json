The velcro on this suit's collar gets caught in the fabric of lining unless you fasten the collar together when not wearing the suit. This may seem like a small thing, but my suit after wearing it only 4 times is already showing wear on the lining. I swim often, several times a week, so over time this could become an issue.",

The xl fits me good but it is a bit tight in chest(I' have a 47\"chest, 34\"waist)) but I suppose this is expected... better a little tight than too loose. I'm trying to lose another 5 lbs or so by race day. Haven't swam in it yet. Good service and super fast...on my doorstep within 24 hrs!",

I tried the suit on and it fit well (I am 6 ft tall and 200lbs - size 9 wetsuit), but the material felt extremely cheap. I was afraid to pull the suit into place around my shoulders and waist for fear of ripping the suit at the seams. I was positive that in a race situation, I'd rip the wetsuit pulling it off during transition. I immediately returned it to Amazon. I ended up with a second hand, high end Orca suit and it was much better. Remember, there's a reason why this wetsuit is so inexpensive.",
