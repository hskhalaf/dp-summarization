It is very easy to use, quick, and even looks cool. The only complaint I would have is that not all new releases are available right now, but from what I have read, their catalog is increasing rapidly. I can't believe that more people don't know about the Vudu, but their marketing is lousy.",

      "text": "I got my Vudu for $399, a few weeks later it was $295. Smart move for Vudu, since Apple TV is trying to crowd them out of the market. Vudu is far better than Apple TV, it has more movies and a better platform for delivering them. I'll stick with the new kid on the block. The new price makes Vudu the better buy (more movies, more storage space, brighter horizon). I noticed that Vudu also dropped some vudu dollars in my account, maybe to compensate current owners for the price reduction in the box. Smart marketing. The other big plus is that netflix and blockbuster are in my past!!!",

With over 5000 titles to choose from, and an easy to search feature, it is easy to find something that all want to watch. Can't remember the title but know who was in it. Easy to find! Many different search functions; title, genre, actor, director, etc. Very simple, logical and intuitive. This small box makes movie nights even more enjoyable. And with HD around the corner, I no longer need to join the format war, either.",

The cost of the movies is outrageous & only confirms that the people who think its a great deal must also think that the economy is in great shape. Maybe they need to use a debit card so they see the direct effect on their budget instead of the visa that they're always last paying, & has a $10,000 balance. Lastly, without WiFi the functionally is cut in half for most people.",

With the Vudu I can stop buying physical media and just purchase digital media and store it on the Vudu. with Over 5000 titles available and all in a nice little box my problem is solved. And with HD content @ full 1080p I don't have to worry about the format war that is ridiculous and just go with the Vudu. I had this unit for a month now and I love it.
