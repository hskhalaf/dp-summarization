The spring water itself is fine but the spray mist is not as fine as Avene or Evian. The mist is rather coarse and I didn't like that. I use it after washing my face, but also use it to set my makeup (powder foundation). For that purpose, I want the mist to be very fine. It didn't meet my expectation in that regard. I will go back to my regulars after this one.",

When you have rosacea you learn what your triggers are. Heat is one of my triggers. This spray is fabulous! It is a fine mist. A quick couple of spritzes and my skin feels cooler and a lot less irritated. It is now my favorite La Roche-Posay product! I highly recommend anyone with rosacea to give this product a try. Amazon does sell this product at a higher price. It is approximately $2 more on Amazon than it is on the company's website for the same size bottle.",
