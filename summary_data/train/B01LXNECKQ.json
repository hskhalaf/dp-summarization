I gave a review of 1 star for this but chose not to send it back because it is a beautiful board and still a good value. Today I received another board directly from the company apologizing for the size difference. I was shocked to get a note from the owner explaining that the board was sent directly from Amazon's warehouse. Clearly this was just an error in sending the correct size. If you want a beautiful board, order this! And Thank You Thirteen Chefs for standing by your customers! Very appreciated!",
