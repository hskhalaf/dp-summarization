I photo-merge exposures to capture the night sky with the full moon (with all its craters) and also the beautiful cloud patterns in the sky around the moon.

Comparing pictures with other people who had much more expensive (normally Canon) SLR cameras, there was no discernible difference in the quality of the photos. Although the build quality is good, it's a shame the actual camera body is rather plasticky and cheap feeling. One complaint about Panasonic cameras is - why so many different battery sizes? Over the years I've had a TZ1, TZ10 and now TZ70 and all the batteries are different. I highly recommend this product.",

The Leica lens is first class and remarkable for a camera at this price point. As someone relatively new to serious digital photography the interface is also much easier to get the hang of than others I have owned; the scrolling explanatory footnote for each function helps a lot here. Finally, the good quality electonic viewfinder is a boon when shooting outdoors in bright conditions as it is much easier to compose and review shots using this than the main screen. So, all in all, a billiant little camera - highly recommended.",

The problem is that the zoom mechanism just isn't robust enough. Eventually it will start having problems if the tiniest bit of grit or water gets in the mechanism. After less than a year of use the zoom on mine has totally jammed up rendering it useless. And a year of use for a camera just isn't enough.
