Wireless connection seems solid and I've had no problems. Only had them a few days so can't speak for longevity of the product. Overall seem very good value for money for \u00a350.

      "text": "I bought 2 pairs of these Jabra wireless headsets as Christmas presents and both have now broken as the weld has failed in the same place on both of them. It is where the ear piece is attached to the headband. It, therefore, seems to be a general product issue rather than a one off. The sound still comes out but they are now not usable. I'm really disappointed as I bought Jabra on the back of using Jabra products at work and I was impressed with those ones.",
