It's a fairly inexpensive watch but I wish Casio would stop it with the propriety bands on their watches. They have ruined most of their watches with their uncomfortable bands. It has a few nice features like atomic time and solar charging but I promptly returned this one.",

So far, the Casio has been great. I like that I don't have to buy batteries for it and that it resets itself by the Atomic Clock. Less time I had to deal with my watch, the better. I know it's going to correct itself for DST and date changes. It also looks good to wear out for casual dates with my wife.",

He is bound for the miltary, for which this watch is ideally suited: 5 alarms, world time zones, atomic clock sensing, solar-powered, and G-shock tough. It is beautiful, but the smaller digital readouts are truly meant for younger, sharper eyes. It was also an unbeatable value at the price on Amazon.",

It's not hard to read the negative dials because I read some reviews of people crying about it. I live in an area with no signal reception for the atomic time sync, but there's a 3 dollar app that sends the same signal and takes like 3 minutes to sync the time. Great watch and I am in love with it.",

The small watch face also means the LCD displays are small. The layout is the same as the G Steel collection, but the larger dials on those watches provide more room for legible LCD displays. The watch functions fine, but if you have large wrists, you might want to look into a G Steel rather than this version.",

Some folks complain about the digital subdials, but they are perfectly readable in office lighting and outdoors. A little tough (OK, very tough) in low light situations but that's a small trade off. The white analog hands are very easy to read in any environment. It's a classier look than the regular AWG100 and the blue bezel really pops. A great value.

      "text": "I got this as a gift after picking it out on Amazon and I must say it is much smaller than expected for a man. It is the size that a woman would wear. The diameter in the description indicates that it should be the size of my other Tough Solar watch however it is much smaller. I think that this is an error.",

      "text": "I have another G Shock watch that I have owned for 10+ years. G Shocks are known to be built like tanks. That's why I decided to go with another G Shock. What caught my eye was the chrome/blue accents. But when I found out all the extras it offered like it solar powered, atomic synchronization, light weight, and other features it offers I was sold! This will be the last watch I own. It is stylish but rugged too. This is a must have time piece.",

      "text": "I love this watch. This is the perfect weight and simple design to make it a classic favorite. The fact that is solar powered and you don't have to deal with the hassle replacing batteries is awesome. I put it under a lamp for a couple hours when I first received to charge it and than set the time. It was bit tricky at first (or maybe it was just me) but after the first couple tries I finally got it set to my time zone. There is no manual button for setting the time, as you navigate the menu and press the correct sequence the time automatically advances to your time zone. I highly recommend this watch!",

I recently went on a trip that had me go through several time zones and it did not change times as I went through airports. I travel a lot and that was selling point, for the watch to adjust to the time zone. I have to study the instructions further to see what the problem is.",
