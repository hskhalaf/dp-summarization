So far we are impressed with the ease of use, programming and construction. As with everything else it should be used responsibly and cared for. I read someones review that said it was a toy, which they are not. They are children s computers. Although we have had limited experience they have been greatly enjoyed with no problems coming up as of yet. I want one for myself. Some of the games are challenging even for adults.",

She is a beautiful four (4) years old angel. She loves it so much that her mother told me she sleeps with the tablet and her favorite blanket. Very pleased with the ability to use filters - even her mother is happy helping her use it, however my angel won't let anyone else hold the tablet for very long. She politely says that her Grannie gave that to her and to give it back. I'm so happy I could give her a first 'computer'. She calls it her computer so that's fine by me.",

We have 3 Kindle Fires in our house and will be adding another very soon. I have returned it through the awesome help of Amazon Customer Service and will buy him a Kindle Fire HDX.",

And when it is working, it runs slow. For $150.00 a pop, I think these tablets could have been better quality. For their birthdays this year I will be replacing them with the Kindle Fire.
