      "text": "Purchased almost 3 years ago and writing a review today as I need another to replace an aged Chamberlain Liftmaster. The LM has had the circuit board replaced twice and despite being a belt drive is incredibly noisy. It now has a gear that has failed but at 15yrs old, I'm not going to repair it. The Decko, which replaced another LM 3 years back, is going strong and is super quiet. I did have to call customer service when I initially installed it for a stripped gear but they overnighted a replacement at no cost for something that was likely my error. For that, I won't deduct a star. Overall, easy to install.",

I'm guessing when I have to change the bulbs i'll have another break. except for this I'm satisfied.",
