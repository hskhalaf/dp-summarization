I needn't have worried as this little frame is great! It is not top-of-the-line, but anybody looking at it would not even realize. An excellent value for the money.",

Now I want to try this with just it's small internal memory before I spend more money after bad. After what I'm sure will be a very interesting tech support call, I think I'll be returning this item. Bye the way, ANTOnline.com has terrific prices on their own site, but exhorbitant shipping rates to make up for that.",

Not so... and the product packaging and instructions do not reference any sort of internal memory. A memory card or USB flash drive is required to display photos. Still, not a bad price for the product - but it would have been nice to know I would have to purchase a separate memory card (this is a gift) for the product to work BEFORE I ordered it.",

I had this frame loaded with pictures in a matter of minutes without evening getting out the instructions, long story short, user friendly!",
