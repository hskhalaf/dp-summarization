The weight is mostly in the back, but there is some weight in the front. I give it 4 starts because it is not exceptionally adjustable. I am quite small framed (5ft tall, thin build). I wear it \"upside down\" so that the strap in front is under my boobs, that keeps it more secure. Overall i am highly pleased with this product and would highly recommend this product to others!",

It cannot be tightened enough so it bounces when you use it for jumpy exercises.. and it can become quite uncomfortable. I wear it upside down which, is much more comfortable but I have noticed that the elastic is beginning to run.. meaning that it wont be long till I can probably only use it for a slow walk as opposed to HIIT.",
