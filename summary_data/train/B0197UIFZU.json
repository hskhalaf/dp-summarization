      "text": "My cat's go berserk for this cat treat. I used to buy a bottle that was 15 oz and cost about $9.00 a bottle at walmart. It was a better price when Sam's club sold 2 bottles for $15 but then Sams went out of business in Alaska. These treats are not only half the price, the bottle is 20 ounces and my cats come running from wherever they are (the dogs too) when I shake the bottle. I purchase 2 bottles a month (for my four cats and a couple of small dogs) for treats everyday and to get them to do what I want. LOL.",

Talked to her vet as well and she tells me they are just mostly protein so they are fine in moderation. So buyer beware. You might have a super happy cat on your hands if you buy these!

Treats should be bigger, perhaps dog kibble size, to clean teeth. I do use Greenies, too, and all three cats still eat them whole.",
