      "text": "I'd heard about this shampoo as it was recommended by a hair salon. Bought it there, it was pricey but I liked it alot because it lathers so well and is good to color-treated hair. It seems to be a really good product as it leaves my hair soft and I'd say bright.This is the best shampoo I've ever run across - it's not full of needless scents and isn't a gimmick formula. Was very happy to see Amazon offers it at such a reasonable price.",
