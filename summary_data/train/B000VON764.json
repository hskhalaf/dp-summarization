They do have the set for sell for more money. But the add is confusing. Besides that, I love the CK one line. Please note, I layer the product and it lasts all day. Ex. Shower with ck body wash or scent less soap. Use ck lotion and ck deodorant as normal. Spray self with body spray or cologne over lotion!!! (Not to much) if you do this it stays and turns heads.
