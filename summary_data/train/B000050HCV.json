The vacuum is very noisy, does not pick up dirt (or in my case cat litter) very well at all, the suction is worthless. I highly suggest that no one purchase one of these vacuums. In my case I threw the box away before testing the vacuum, as the Royal model worked very well and I expected the same from this model. I'll ask Amazon if they will accept a return with no box. I will fully understand if they say no.",

The brush roller recently failed, and when I tried to find a replacement, I discovered that the vacuum is so old, they don't even make spare parts for it anymore. So, we replaced it with this model. We've had it less than one month and the brush roller has stopped turning. I confirmed that the belt is installed correctly. Luckily Amazon will still let me return it for a refund.",

Never mind how insanely loud it is for the poor suction, but even storing the cord with the attached clip is a struggle. The plastic piece that holds the bag to the vacuum is cheap as well, and doesn't secure easily. Don't waste the time/money/struggle on this updated version of a previously great product.",

I bought it on Amazon when the manufacturer no longer sells it on their mail order services. A very long cord too, and it is necessary.",

Today when I was finished vacuuming with the hose attachment I noticed dirt falling from the brush. All the dirt I vacuumed with the hose was coming back out of the brush area. The cover was completely closed and the bag was nearly new. Do not waste your money!",

    "title": "Dirt Devil Hand Vacuum Cleaner Ultra Corded Bagged Handheld Vacuum M08230RED",
    "description": "Size:1 VacWhether it's pet hair, car interiors, or stairs, when the job is too tough for a broom but too small to haul out the huge vacuum cleaner, grab the Dirt Devil Ultra Power hand vac. With the power of an upright in a lightweight, compact design, the hand vac's 4 amp motor provides powerful suction, and its revolving brush aids deep carpet cleaning. For those tough-to-reach spots, such as under car seats or between couch cushions, the hand vac has a built-in stretch hose and a crevice tool (ready to use with Dirt Devil accessories). The two speeds allow you to vary your suction, but be aware that the lower speed is very gentle and the higher speed is loud. The 20-foot cord ensures a large cleaning radius, and a cord strap provides tidy storage. This hand vac is not recommended for vacuuming long strands of human hair--they tend to get caught in the revolving brush. Be sure you fill out and mail in the warranty card included in the package so you can take advantage of Dirt Devil's two-year limited warranty. Dirt Devil Red Ultra Hand Vac, Features Include 4 Amp Motor, Powerful 2 Speed Motor, Attached Stretch Hose & Crevice Tool, 20' Power Cord, Built In Bag Adapter, 2 Year Manufacturers Warranty, Uses Bag Type \"G\" Part #3-010347-001, Belt Style \"1\" Part #3-157260-001",
