Normally I'm all about off-brand products as long as they are similar, but this Camelbak product really is superior. The pack itself is lighter, more comfortable, and has more storage room.

These are well worth the price, because you really don't want something that may leak, or puncture, or impart an off or plastic-y taste to the water. There are cheaper versions, but they are not going to last as well, and I realized I'd end up paying the same amount, buying replacements. Buy this once and keep it!",
