Plenty sharp enough to effortlessly cut through our Thanksgiving turkey and ham without feeling dangerous which is a big concern for me since I'm a klutz. That may sound silly to people who have a sure grip but for me, it's a matter of \"do I have to go to the ER this year or not?\" if knives are not easy for me to use. ;) I bought an electric knife set as well but I didn't even take it out of the box because this set worked perfectly! I'm keeping my knife and fork set stored in the box they came in so they stay nice for years to come.",

I just removed the molded insert from the box these came in and put it in the wood brush box and snapped the knife and fork into place and it is now a really nice presentation for a Christmas present.",

It was dulled when it arrived and when I sharpened it it still just shredded the turkey. We had to use a knife we previously had because it was sharper than the new knife.",

      "A BLADE THAT STAYS SHARP LONGER AND AN EXTENDED FORK THAT HOLDS EVEN THE LARGEST BIRD STEADY OR YOUR MONEY BACK - Our Carving Knife and Fork set are each forged from a single piece of stainless steel, with hand-carved wooden handles triple-riveted in place. They're well balanced and will keep you secure while carving even the largest Turkey, Ham, Roast, Rack of Ribs, Goose or Prime Rib you can find.",
      "SLICES, NEVER SHREDS- YOUR PRESENTATION WILL NEVER LOOK BETTER, GUARANTEED - Our Carving Knife has a classic, straight edge favored by top chefs the world over. Other carving sets use micro-serrated edges that tend to catch in the meat and shred it. Electric carving knives use a sawing motion as opposed to a smooth, natural, slicing one. All this adds up to an easier time for you, and a better looking meal for your guests.",
      "TIMELESS AND CLASSIC DESIGN MAKES AN ELEGANT GIFT - The beautiful, sleek design of our Carving Knife and Fork Set makes it an excellent and beautiful gift, year round. It makes a truly thoughtful gift for Weddings, Anniversaries, Birthdays, Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter, Father's Day, Mother's Day, or even just as a simple thank you for the chef in your life. Our presentation-quality storage and gift box adds just the right finishing touch.",
      "SAVE MONEY AND TIME, SHARPEN YOUR KNIVES LESS OFTEN - All A Cut Above Cutlery knives, including our Carving Knife, hold an edge well over time, meaning you'll make fewer trips to the professional knife sharpener. Over the course of a year, most people sharpen their knives 3 or 4 times- and at up to $5 per knife for professional sharpening, that adds up pretty quickly.",
      "LIFETIME, SUPER SIMPLE GUARANTEE AND WARRANTY - If you don't like our Carving Set at any time for any reason, will will give you your money back immediately. We stand behind all of our products without reservation, and we use them in our kitchens every day. Heck, if we don't like them, why should you? But if you don't, we've got you covered. Period."
