      "text": "I would not recommend these roller stands. Three points - first, the plastic locking nut for the hight adjustment is very hard to get tight. A single arm handle would be preferable. Second, the feet need more robust floor-grabbing material (rubber, or other). These can slide if the material is heavy. Third, they just feel cheap and wobbly. Home Depot carries a roller stand for very close to this price and it's much more robust and feels like a quality stand. I have had no tip-over problems with them and the height adjustment holds. Are there better roller stands - yes. But in the $25 price range, I would not buy these Shop Fox stands.",

My only complaint would be that the little rubber things that are supposed to plug the square and rectangular \"feet\" come out easily. Bought two of these stands and I've already lost three of the rubber plugs. Otherwise this is a great product!",

Primary complaint is what appears to be a complete disregard for any of the welds to be square with each other. Since there is no adjustment in the feet, nor the roller head, this is a critical flaw. The stand is unstable on any flat surface without using shims to level the feet. Remember the table at the diner that wobbled like hell every time someone touched it? There you go.
