The vast majority of them are now Irwin. This adjustable wrench has a great feel in your hand, doesn't bind up when adjusted tightly, smooth action while adjusting to proper size. I have NOT had it round off a bolt while using it but I'm generally not torquing on it a great deal. If a bolt is frozen I'd go grab a wrench set. All in all it's a great addition to my \"bucket!\"",
