It keepa my mac safe above my bar surface. Its almost worh getting as an insurance policy against spills. I added a bluray drive and USB/card reader port to the underside... so it is more of a utility dock now. Great setup!",

Their response was, \"unfortunately after time the pads do fall off\" and then suggested I pay $6 to buy additional bumpers from them. The mstand is a premium product, costing twice that of the Amazon brand laptop stand. If the manufacturer knows that the bumpers will fall off, they should fix the adhesive that they use instead of expecting customers to continually pay them for new bumpers.",

I also like the cord management, it helps keep things cleaner. The space underneath works great to hold other things like my ipad when not in use, so my deskptop is less cluttered.

The bad: - It's a bit pricey and with a bigger computer such as an Acer might not be as stable. I would say overall for a $10 difference the 360 is a better option specially if you want to use it for meetings. Click the button if this review helped you at all :)",

You can see exposed glue and it just ruins the quality for me. If it wasn\u2019t for this then I probably would have kept it, but I can\u2019t get that quality aspect out of my mind.

The aluminum has just a little give to it so if you use the laptop keyboard, you might get annoyed with the vibration of the screen as you type. I'm primarily using a USB keyboard with it (it's all about those cherry blue switches!) so I'm not running into that problem. The cavity underneath is useful for routing device charging cables, KVM switch, etc. Way better than running a laptop straight on the desk. It could do with a bit more structural rigidity to keep the screen from vibrating under use.",

The mStand has some nice features, like the downward tilt, which elevates the laptop but keeps it from sliding backwards (and potentially off a desk), and grips so that metal never scrapes on metal. It also has grips on the bottom that keep the stand securely in place. The passthrough port on the back mimics that of older iMacs or Apple displays, with plastic encircling the opening so that cables don't rub against the metal. Plus it matches the MacBook Pro colors of silver or space gray, and looks darn good on a desk.",

Another problem with this product is that is spins far to easily without a locking mechanism. So if you have a ethernet cord or power cable that slightly pulls or pushes it will cause the swivel to turn. Other than the its a nice design but these flaws are just to great to give more than 3 stars. If you get this product invest in a wireless keyboard it makes it that much better.",

      "text": "The stand is incredibility well built. Supports a 2015 15' MacBook Pro well and does not exhibit wobble when typing on a Bluetooth keyboard; note that \"wobble\" would also be impacted by the stability of the surface (desk) the stand and keyboard are resting on. The color of the stand matches the silver MacBook line quite well. There are rubber bumpers for the laptop to rest on and rubber strips at the lip of the stand which prevents the laptop from scratching. Overall, an excellent product.",

Really helps a lot with limited desk space, and is a lot better than the box I was previously using.",

It's sturdy, I've never had an issue with accidentally hitting my laptop and worrying about it going off balance.It's non-obtrusive and takes up very little footprint on the desk (to me at least).",
