Pads are very easy to remove, so you should be careful if you wear them around your neck from time to time (pads can fall off). Apart from this headphones connect and work well with different Bluetooth devices (phones, laptops). Sound is quite good. New: 3. When you remove headphones without turning them off they sometimes make phone to redial last number. In short this touch interface suxx. 4. When you wear a hoodie it sometimes causes touch interface on headphones to do stuff as well. AVOID.",

Right where the headphone part is screwed to the head band it cracked. I couldn't believe it. I can not believe for $150 there is not a metal insert inside the headband but only a plastic piece. What a joke. Putting metal screws into plastic at a stress point is always a great idea right. Nope it isn't. Very disappointing to say the least. All the great sound and comfort are useless if they are cheaply constructed and now unwearable. Fail. Maybe thats why they discontinued them.",

We know you can do better. We WANT you to do better. Oh, and while you're at it, please also make a wireless, on-ear version that is NOT \"XL\". You know, the same form factor you already produce for the wired (non-BT) Urbanite headset. Fix those two things and I'll buy a set right now!",

Cons: I could not seem to get the sound balanced. Without an equalizer they were not bass heavy but they seemed muffled. With an equalizer the highs never seemed to have clarity, almost as if the headset was faulty. Verdict: I returned them as I did not like the sound. Why four stars? Maybe they were faulty.",

I love the design of these headphones. It's has an understated feel to it that I absolutely love. It definitely feels well-built, but you'll notice it when you're wearing it, given its heft and weight.",

Even her dad said they were excellent. Don't expect $700 headphones. But I too listened in and the range was great, bass came through without ear bleed; I would tweak the high end a tick, but that can be done with an app, b/c it might be the wireless element. I couldn't afford to make a mistake, and I didn't lose with this one.",

Battery life is very good and the life indicator that shows up on the phone is a nice feature. Sound delivers as expected. Product well built and robust. Have not had any problems with the \"touch pad\" feature for start, stop, etc. that other's have commented upon. The feature is working as advertised for me. Did notice that the phones are a little unbalanced, one side heavier than the other. Likely where the battery is located?",

And I already own a pair of Sennheiser on-ear phones. These were supposed to be an upgrade, but the only thing I couldn't get past is the small ear cups and the fact that the pads are too soft. This means your ears are cramped and squished against the drivers. I could not wear them for long before my ears started to hurt. Sadly, I returned them. If you have small ears, you may like them.",

Difficult to use, volume control inoperable, pads that pop off when you look at them, are really easy to lose, and then are quite difficult to reinstall. Has something changed with the manufacturing that has harmed the quality? I accidentally left them on the airplane and when the airline called to let me know, I said, \"Don't bother sending them to me, they aren't worth the effort.\"",

The ear cups have a fabric feel and do NOT feel good with sweat. For sitting at a desk they're great. But I wouldn't use these if you are working out or sweating in general. Only \"problem\" is the touchpad on the right ear cup is super sensitive. When it works it's great but accidentally pausing, skipping songs or even redialing (if connected to a phone) is a pain. But for the price and what you get it's worth it. Very premium feel. Sturdy yet flexible headband.",
