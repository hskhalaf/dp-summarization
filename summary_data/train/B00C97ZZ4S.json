But now I'm more interested in the use of macros and improve the quality with other functions. I chose a compact system as I used to have a big cannon years ago and it was a hassle to carry it all over. This is just a good size (unless you are with a tele lens). I've used it for the last 4 weeks and I'm very happy with the images. It has really nice functions to add new details to your pictures. The challenge for me is to start learning more about photography, but this is a good way to start.",
