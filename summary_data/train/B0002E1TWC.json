The strap is large enough for crossbody wear or reduces to comfortable size for over the shoulder. The case will be a great travel companion.",

Seems very durable (but haven't had a lot of use to know for sure yet), has I.D. place and its roomy enough to carry other things. I can finally throw away the box LOL",

I think the bag is way too large for the 330DX, so the tripod kept sliding somewhat in the bag-awkward. - The bag is not padded, so it only provides little protection for the tripod. Conclusion: If you're getting this for 330/340DX, don't! Look further.",
