It takes a lot of fiddling with the volume and wire to get them to play equally on both sides which is irritating. I know you get what you pay fr but I'm disappointed because I had a cheaper model of Skullcandy headphones which were way better than these.",

I have used other phones with the HTC, these skull candies are the best I've had. I am 59 and getting used to the funny looks which the earthlings give me when wearing these phones.

The sound quality deteriorates after only a few months, the cord that is inserted into the actual headphones loosens and that's that...you'll have no option other than to send them back. Don't bother...spend a little more and get a pair of BOSE",

The sound quality is brilliant for the 30 pounds paid, with the bass strong but not being muddy or taking away from the mids, treble. Only improvements could be made is a solid case not a flimsy pouch and possible a higher grade wire (removable so can get replaced easily). Also very comfortable. The seller is fulfilled by amazon and has genuine products which are delivered promptly. Had no reason to contact them.",
