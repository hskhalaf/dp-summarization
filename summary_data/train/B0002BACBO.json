It picks up reflections and nuances of your voice that you usually only get with studio mics. When buying one consider your usual monitor placement on stage. If your monitor is directly in front or behind you I would recommend the BETA 87C. If your monitor is off to the side consider the BETA 87A. Either way these are superb mics.",

You don't need to yell into it, you can be 6 inches away and sing at a normal volume and it picks it up perfectly. It manages to also block out a lot of noises, like a high fan running form my laptop or a tv in another room. Love this microphone It also looks great.",

    "title": "Shure BETA 87A Supercardioid Condenser Vocal Microphone",
    "description": "Style:SupercardioidThe Shure BETA 87A is a premium quality supercardioid hand-held electret condenser vocal microphone with exceptionally smooth frequency response and high sound pressure level capability. Used for professional sound reinforcement, broadcasting, and studio recording applications, the BETA 87A combines superb performance with the ruggedness needed for touring and field production. The BETA 87A features a controlled low-frequency roll-off that compensates for proximity effect and prevents the \u201cboomy\u201d sound often associated with close pick-up. The characteristic Shure presence rise brightens the upper midrange. The tight supercardioid pattern, with null points at approximately 125 degrees, provides maximum isolation from other vocalists or instruments while offering minimal off-axis coloration. The BETA 87A operates on phantom power.",
