They keep odor in (at least my dirty socks) and water out. I carried my laptop in this bag through monsoon rain to work at a coffee shop. I was soaked but the laptop was dry. The compression straps are tough, I put a lot of force into tightening them down and never feel worried about busting a seam. I highly recommend these bags.",

It worked for that purpose although the sleeping bag was never really exposed to any damp conditions. We did however use it for another use on the trip, and that was to hold food over night. While the sack is water repellent, it most certainly isn't waterproof. We left ours overnight outside in the rain for multiple hours, and the contents inside became wet. It could be because the sack was not compressed and water got in through the eVents (it was rolled shut, just not compressed)? Either way, a \"waterproof\" sack should be waterproof all the time.",

I was not entirely convinced when I set out that the light weight materials would keep anything dry. Also whatever I put into this bag would have tons of pressed wrinkles because of the compression. In went my unmentionables and I prayed for a dry bum. To my delight it worked great. It compresses down easily forcing the air out of the bottom fabric. Water found it's way into the boat a few times. The content of the bag remained dry as promised.",

      "text": "When I first got it the outside grey material seemed cheap and thin, but its performance proved that not to be the case. I went on a canoe trip and was able to stick all of my clothes and my sleeping bag in the extra large. I was able to compress it to about 1/2 the size even when it packed full uncompressed. I never submerged it, but it was sitting in a half inch of water the whole trip. Not a drop of water got in.",

No seams are strained. No buckles broken. I'm not going to try a dunk test, but in mild rain, the bags came out perfectly dry. Never store a sleeping bag compressed, but for traveling, this Sea to Summit brand is a good choice. John",
