Drop it? Just pick it up, no need to worry about breaking the screen because it's plastic and therefore not as fragile as a glass screen. I've definitely enjoyed my time with this device and will be using it as my daily driver for the foreseeable future.",

However, after calling Amazon they apologized for the inconvenience and gave me a 20 dollar gift card to replace it, no questions asked! The phone it's self have been wonderful and my husband (a very simple man) appreciates the simplicity of the phone and the range of service it gets out here in the back woods.",

      "text": "The Convoy 3 is a better phone than the Convoy 4. The only upgrade the Convoy 4 has over the Convoy 3 is the flashlight feature. The button used is flipped in functionality. The flashlight works by pressing the flashlight/voice command button quickly on the Convoy 4 as opposed to holding the button down until it activates on the Convoy 3. Also, the Convoy 3 is quite a bit smaller than the Convoy 4, with no advantage in screen size. They are the same size on both. Buy this phone now because Verizon Wireless is set to discontinue 3g in December of 2019. WE ONLY HAVE A FEW MONTHS LEFT!!! FIGHT THE POWER!",
