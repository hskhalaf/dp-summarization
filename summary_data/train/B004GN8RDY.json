I grew tired of paying five bucks for a bottle of water in an airport, so I thought this might be a more environmentally and cost effective solution. IT IS! Went through TSA several times without incident (empty, of course). After going through security, I filled up at the water fountain, and presto! Great tasting water anywhere. It is durable, does not leak, and is easy to clean! Purchasing several more of these as gifts for friends.",

We take large water bottles with us and fill them using this container (simple squirt water into the larger one until its full). We no longer buy any water while traveling. There are replacement charcoal cartridges you can buy as well. BEST THING we bought for traveling. Saved us SO much money amd the water tastes great everywhere we have used it. Have bought more and HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",

The design is great in that they are smaller so they will fit in any holder or back pack slot but the issue is you can only drink less than 3/4's of the bottle as the filter length is so short that you can't get the water out. I found this to be so frustrating as I was traveling and did not want to buy bottled water but a few big gulps and that was all you can get. Dumb design. I wish the larger Brita 32oz water bottle with feeder had a smaller design where the straw/filter goes all the way to the bottom.",

Dont try to save money and buy this, it was just a burden to carry this around in my trip. It definitely is easy to clean, and probably also filters well, but it leaks when you try to drink water. also unless the bottle is full, it will not let you suck water. Also the lid got stuck to the sucker once, and pulled everything out while trying to open it, spilling water all over me at the airport!",

But imagine my surprise and dismay when today it started leaking around the screw-on top, which I had tightened as far as I could. On a positive note, the water tasted great: no plastic taste.

Cheaper than bottled water, which is a nice money saving feature, it does leak, which is the reason I would not buy it again and rated it as 2 stars, but I would probably give it 2.5 since it did filter OK during that time, I just couldn't leave a partially filled bottle in my gym bag without it leaking.",

I always have a water with me.. in the car, shopping...whereever... this is kinda convenient.... because I can refill in any fountain... but i have also left it at my friends..and had to go back and retrieve it... sooo..
