On a positive note, the Amazon return process is excellent. Very impressed with how that worked.",

Out of all of the coffee appliances I have ever owned and used (drip machines, stove-top glass percolators, and french presses), this makes the worst tasting coffee I have ever had. I have used it about a dozen times in the last year, thinking that it might get better. It doesn't. And it's not the coffee, because when I use the same coffee in my stove top percolator, the coffee tastes amazing. On the bright side, it brews the coffee quickly and keeps it very hot.",

The ratio is 1 tablespoonful of coffee to 1 cup of water. I add 1 more tablespoon of coffee since I like a stronger bolder taste. Medium strength coffee works the best but I suppose that is determined by preference. It looks pretty in my kitchen too!",
