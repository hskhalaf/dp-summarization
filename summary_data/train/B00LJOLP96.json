Now I might have got a good one who knows but if they are all like this I wouldn't hesitate in getting another and i'm probably the biggest pain in the arse buyer that Amazon have in the U.K for standards.",

However after about 6 months it 'crashed' and now just constantly reboots without getting to the 'desktop'. I've tried a factory default reset (and lost all my data) but still not working - so It'll have to go back for repairs as there is no was of repairing myself (the whole unit is sealed)... Not sure if 6 months means it's still under warranty...",

Great. - Storage can be expanded with a 32 GB SD Card. - Speakers are OK, but far from great. - Size is great. - Front camera for things like Skype is OK. Cons: - Back camera leaves a lot to be desired. - Using backspace is quirky with the LG word suggestion, but can easily be fixed in settings.",
