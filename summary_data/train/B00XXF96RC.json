This track shoe from Asics is commended by athletes for improving their performance and even helping them break their personal best records. The shoe not being available in wide width sizing is just a minor drawback that most wearers are willing to look past. The Asics Throw Pro, in general, is a reliable performance shoe that any athlete in the sport of shot put, discus, and hammer throw would definitely look into adding into their shoe arsenal.",

So, unfortunately, this information was not good for me and that is why I bought a new ones with the right size. They were very good but now they are more than that..",
