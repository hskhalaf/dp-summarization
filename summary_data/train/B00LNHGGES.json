They play with them in only a supervised situation for fear of finally tearing one open and eating the foam inside... but wow - they haven't even got one tooth mark in them, yet. Double coat them and market them as dog toys.",

They are very lightweight which is probably why they cost more. They seemed pricey at $8 per ball and you need to buy a total quantity of 6 in the package. I would have liked just to buy 3 or 4 at most. I do see that same product is used in children \"gyms\" and obviously they need higher quantities for all the children. They seem very durable so hopefully they will last a long time if we keep them inside or on grass surface outside.",

If you're playing with more competitive people, you might want a ball that weighs a little more so it flies faster, but we had a great time and I highly recommend these.",
