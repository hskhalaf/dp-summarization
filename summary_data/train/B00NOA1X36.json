Amazon was decent in trying to make it right",

I figured it would at least be blown if not torn to shreds but come morning it was still standing! No damage. Not only that, it was completely dry inside. No water at all. I was amazed.

I would have rather paid a bit more and had aluminum poles for something this large. -Minor: there were no instructions at all. It wasn't an overly complicated tent but instructions would have been helpful for the first time set up. Nonetheless, excellent value for the price!",

Instructions were short and vague. being our first tent, we did not know what some of the items were, or what to do with them. the bag it came in was way too small to get the items back in the bag. I bought a large bag to put most of the tent items in. It is up for sale at this time.",
