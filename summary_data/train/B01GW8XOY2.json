That mindset shift helped a lot. I also took the difficulty way down so I could just watch this movie in peace. With its bad fight mechanics, it is just a pain to try to play at higher difficulties. I was disappointed overall as a god of war fan but as a last of us fan, this is a good storytelling type game to sit and watch/ play a bit.",

That said, this game is a masterpiece! The combat system is smooth, the character development excellent and graphics superb. There is a surprise behind every corner. The story does take a back seat to combat, as expected in GoW, but it is still extremely well done. The developing relationship between father and son, with surprise twists and turns in the plot to keep things exciting. This one is already a classic.",

It's a beautiful game in terms of combat, graphics, and challenge. I love how you can switch between throwing your axe, arrows (your son) and punching. Good puzzles, decimating powerful enemies and hunting for upgrades to add onto your arsenal. Caution: there is some strong language when you meet the small blue dwarf and early on it's quite bloody when fighting the stranger. Overall a wonderfully crafted game.",

Was glad to pick it up during prime day for only $15 definitely worth more than that. My only complaint is the fighting system was a little clunky to me at first, but I grew used to it pretty quickly.",

Living as a man outside the shadow of the gods, Kratos must adapt to unfamiliar lands, unexpected threats, and a second chance at being a father. Together with his son Atreus, the pair will venture into the brutal Norse wilds and fight to fulfill a deeply personal quest. \n\u2022 Bold New Beginning \u2014 His vengeance against the Gods of Olympus years behind him, Kratos now lives as a man in the realm of Norse Gods and monsters. It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive\u2026And teach his son to do the same. This startling reimagining of God of War deconstructs the core elements that defined the series\u2014satisfying combat; breathtaking scale; and a powerful narrative\u2014and fuses them anew. \n\u2022 A Second Chance \u2014 Kratos is a father again. As mentor and protector to Atreus, a son determined to earn his respect, he is forced to deal with and control the rage that has long defined him while out in a very dangerous world with his son. \n\u2022 A Darker, More Elemental World \u2014 From the marble and columns of ornate Olympus to the gritty forests, mountains, and caves of Pre Viking Norse lore, this is a distinctly new realm with its own pantheon of creatures, monsters, and gods. With an added emphasis on discovery and exploration, the world will draw players in to explore every inch of God of War\u2019s breathtakingly threatening landscape\u2014by far the largest in the franchise. \n\u2022 Vicious, Physical Combat \u2014 With an over the shoulder free camera that brings the player closer to the action than ever before, fights in God of War mirror the pantheon of Norse creatures Kratos will face: grand, gritty, and grueling. A new main weapon and new abilities retain the defining spirit of God of War while presenting a vision of violent conflict that forges new ground in the genre. Mature 17 plus.",
