I will say that after a couple of years the old suit had a few worn spots on the bum where the color was starting to wear off from sitting, but these wetsuits are so much better than the kiddie ones that had before that were too thin and fell apart in a few months.",

These pools are heated for lap swimmers, but would be too cold for kids who are learning to swim and splashing around in the early mornings, or late afternoons. The O'Neil wetsuit delivers the needed warmth to keep my child from turning blue in the pool! We plan on bringing it to the beach to wear too.",
