It's not a full flow. It is slow and a 1/4 of the width of the mouth when you pour.",

After having both, it seems clearly better to use the non-stream model since: - When you fill the pitcher is usually after you've just poured a glass of water and you're filling it for later, so you're not actually waiting for it to filter in real time - When you are pouring a glass of water, it pours about 5x slower that the non-stream model, slow enough to be frustrating I'd advise getting the non-stream model",
