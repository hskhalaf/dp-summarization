I have a Diono Rainier and love it but it's a bit narrower than this Britax. I love the click tight which makes easier and correct install. And I LOVE THE HIGH WEIGHT AND HEIGHT LIMIT up to 90 lbs in 5 point harness which means I could keep my child in 5 point until 8-9 years old of course depending on growth. Remember keep your children in a 5 point harness as long as possible! Don't graduate them early!",

I'm not sure if it is because it is designed for such a wide range of child sizes but I wouldn't recommend for smaller children maybe once they get older. Have reinstalled several times confirming a correct installation. Also, I'm 6'1\" 220 lbs so it's not a matter of strength it just doesn't cinch tight without extraordinary measures. Was disappointing, particularly because our other child seat is a Britax ClickTight Marathon which I really love and would highly recommend (5 stars on the Marathon).",

Only cons, it's heavy (steel frame), can be a little difficult to tighten (when they are at the lighter end of the weight limits), and boy is it expensive. Overall, I would but it again and I truly believe it is a worthwhile investment in my child's safety.",
