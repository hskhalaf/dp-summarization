The lamp itself however, still looks great! and repairing is much cheaper than completely replacing it. A trip to Home-Depot and about 30 minutes of labor and it's back to working better than new! changing the switch to a new one is very easy and the repair cost me a total of $3.65.",

You have to raise it up some to use it as a desk writing type lamp and that makes it almost too tall for my purposes. The cheap on-off twist knob will be the weakest link. I suspect that knob will wear out long before the lamp does. If it fits where you want it, it's a solid, heavy, expensive looking lamp. Very good purchase for the price (under $20).",

I run the power for the lamps through an inexpensive table-top dimmer and outlet expander (cheap!) so I can easily calibrate the output from both lamps at the same time. By using this well-built and good looking lamp, I've saved room, and benefited from the flexibility that a swing-arm lamp provides.

I am using a FeatherBrite 20 watt, 120v full spectrum compact bulb and that should be good for New England winters. The bulb sticks out an inch beyond the shade, the shade gets warm but not hot. Birds are happy.",
