It gave quirky directions, but I figured it was just taking me home the way it wanted, albeit way out of the way. Then on the trip, on I 90 starting in Ohio, it told me to take every exit until I shut off the sound only for the graphics. When the \"turn right\" every exit did not stop, even in New York, I turned off the unit. It was essentially useless. Nice features otherwise. It is being returned.",

It just enters a halfly drawn self-update progress UI and reboots itself, without applying the update. All previous updates were performed with Garmin Express, which took tens of trials before Windows can detect its existence. It just kept rebooting itself, asking to get into File Transfer mode, and rebooting a while later. It took tens of such cycles before it could be connected. It's possible it has some hardware defect.",

The screen is good, but I've been spoiled with how much better phone screens are compared to the GPSs out there.",

Easy to use, and I get map updates at no cost (most vehicle GPS systems require a new card or other expensive updates).",

I replaced a Magellan unit that was terrible. Accuracy on this unit seems great. The only down side is the internal memory. There is not enough. Buy a Micro SD card at the same time so you can do all the updates. Would definitely recommend this unit.",
