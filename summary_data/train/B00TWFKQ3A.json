We want to use it with out 3d blu ray player and for football season; but there's no sensible way to hook up speakers. The mini usb does not work with a mini usb plug in. Overall: We are returning the device and ordering the 5155 to allow for better (louder) sound.",

Etc. etc. But if you just want a decent and somewhat pretty projector to show your slides or watch a movie in the basement, this may be for you.",
