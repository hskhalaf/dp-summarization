My son has big ears and we both have big Welsh heads and these fit us well. I live in an area with loose fireworks laws and horrible noise for many hours on an Independence Day weekend. I have ptsd. I am happy I got these headphones and will be using them for a long time. They drown out a lot of noise but not the frequencies you need for hearing speech, sirens or announcements.",

I use to buy cheap headphones and finally invested in more substantial ones. They cup the ear just right and cancel unwanted noise. A newscaster mentioned them on a news segment which is how I found out about them. A number of retail outlets offer a cheap set of wired noise canceling earphones; if you want a better set, the next option is $350 plus dollars. Don't fall for this. These offer the technology at a reasonable price.",

The lack of punchy bass was a deal-breaker for me. If you want and solidly built set of cans with a more neutral sound overall they are fine.

They fit well enough to be comfortable being worn all day at work (office). However, after about a year, one of the swivel joints on the headphones popped out and they didn't close around my ears any more. If you get these, spring for the warranty so you can buy a better pair when they break. I just ordered a replacement set of seinheiser headphones...",

      "text": "I bought these to use while mowing my yard. Understandably, that's a difficult environment. They do provide some noise cancellation. However, the audio quality is quite disappointing, and quiet enough that I can't really hear music. I think if you're looking for noise cancellation for severe noise environments in this price bracket you might be better off going with passive noise cancellation and better audio quality. These might be better for less severe environments. However, even with less noise, the audio quality is weak.",
