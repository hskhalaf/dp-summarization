I've had these about six months, using them for lifting 5 or 6 days a week. They are now noticeably looser than when I first got them, especially around the top, where they don't stay in place particularly well anymore or feel tight at all. Because of the loosening, they tend to easily bunch up around my knee joint when doing squats or just walking around, which is annoying. I think I'm going to try some SBD's, which are more expensive but may be better designed for durability.",

Few can match the quality from this brand, it's expensive...very expensive. They sell these not as a pair, but individual braces...so if you want for both knees..which you should then it's actually double the price. It's a shocking amount to spend, but it's worth it and the only reason why the review is four instead of five stars.",

Provides very comfortable compression during knee flexion (squats, lunges, deadlifts, etc.) and even gives a little bit of bounce \"out of the hole\". I would definitely recommend sizing down 1x if you're anywhere near in-between sizes - for instance, my knee measurement was 40cm and I chose a Large, which fits firmly but is not too small. In all honesty, the price point is just a little bit too high ($80 for a set of knee sleeves), but these are likely the highest quality sleeves you can get.",

I love these for keeping my knees in place ;) and also for workouts with a lot of Lunges, Burpees, or any other workout where you have shorts on and your knees will be contacting the floor a lot. Great protection. Also these are thicker and seem to be more durable and well made than the new style gray ones. Just my opinion.",
