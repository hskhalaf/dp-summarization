      "text": "The chair is great for poolside and beach. We bought another one like it years ago. Both are good, but the latest one we purchased is very difficult to close up. We may need some WD40. The flat panel of the seat that's surrounded by the bungie cords is important to have in order to keep from sinking too low. We once bought one with only the bungie cords with no panel and got rid of it. It's easy to bounce of of it, but be sure to use your arms on the side poles to keep it from tipping backwards.",
