I'm curious how long they will last... That's the last criteria I have for these before I jump on more, but I'm using them as minimal shoes to do workouts and walk around in, so I'm hoping to squeeze out at least 6 months. I remember buying the tiger claw shoes when I was younger maybe 10-15 years ago and these are miles better in initial feel. However, those grew on me in time so I'm hoping these will also continue to be awesome.",
