      "text": "Absolutely LOVE these headphones. They are however my first pair of \"high-quality\" headphones. I personally love the foam covers. And they fit my ear perfectly. The carrying case is quite nifty. The only negative is instead of pewter or gun metal gray like it appears in the pics, the headphones are a shiny chrome. I'm not really a fan of chrome. But, they work well. And they go great with a Samsung phone.",

They sound very harsh, very fatiguing even after a short amount of time. The only positive is the selection of included silicon and foam tips.",

      "text": "I bought these earbud headphones assuming that these were high-end. They were discounted from $149 to $24. They look nice but the problem is that the left headphone lost about 90% of its volume after just few weeks! I was careful not to twist the cable and it died on me sooner then another other OEM Samsung white headphones I ever bought in the past. I'm disappointed with the quality but if I had spent $149 on them I would be really angry!",
