My brows are sparse and nonexistent at the outside edge. My hair is white and had been brown. I got the taupe color and I couldn\u2019t be happier. It is easy to use, looks natural, and adds color and definition to my face. I thought that the color might be too light when I first opened the compact. It turned out to be perfect. The color really lasts, too.",
