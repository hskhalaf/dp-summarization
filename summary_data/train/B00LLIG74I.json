I noticed the flame was very low even though I had it turned to high. I removed the gauge and relit the grill. The flame immediately returned to normal. I would not recommend this product.",

I expected (like I'm sure most do) that it would move within the Green but it does not. The close to empty (25% or less tank) and just fill and never uses (100%) tank read the same as the half-full one, again so I'm clear, right in the middle of Green \"GAS\" field on the gauge.",

These gauges only register when the valves are turned on and the system is pressurized.

I use it on a Weber grill that has the tank underneath the grill behind closed doors. Before I start to grill, I simply open the door on the grill and assure that the gauge needle is in the \"Green\" area that indicates that enough propane is still available. This is a great product and I highly recommend it.",

I do not have to worry about running out of propane when grilling, can quickly take it off and take it camping and not have to worry about running out of propane in the middle of the night while running our heater. I think everybody who has any propane tank for camping and or grilling should have one of these. Thinking of getting another just to keep in my camper. It is a fantastic size, does it job and the price is fantastic.WOW just got my second one, Told you it was great.",
