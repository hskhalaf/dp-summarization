Not that I did not a multitude of different shavers and creams but making this an almost zen experience has changed. the way I shave and how to get ready to shave having a good experience, the pre shave oil works wonders the soap foams great using a single blade shaver is very strange the closeness of the shave is amazing, I have yet to get a nick or cut and the after shave balm is very soothing no Gotch alcohol sting.

He loves the scent of Sandalwood and even though the scent isn\u2019t very strong right from the containers, it is stronger once you use it so scent was nice. What was highly disappointing, was that the shave cream itself burned his face badly. It even still burns 3 days later every time hot water hits his face. I wouldn\u2019t purchase again because of the one product not being usable.",

He scent of the lotion is not overpowering but smells nice. I'm allergic to the essence in most colognes but this one doesnt bring on an asthma attack. I dont use the oil so i cant review that. It's funny to think someone can get excited about a daily chore, but I want to convey the difference this kit makes for a morning routine.",

I honestly don't think he will use the brush but it does make it look more substantial as a gift so I don't mind. I cannot wait for him to use it because it really does smell amazing.",

It helps create precise lines. The brush keeps my hands free of the product which makes shaving safer. I would definitely recommend this as a gift or simply to pamper yourself!",
