We also love package dressings, like the Hidden Valley Ranch made with buttermilk. The blender ball works extremely well. Also note, sometimes homemade dressing tends to settle but with this whisker ball, just a few shakes and dressing is good again. I plan on getting another one for our Italian style dressing too. I definitely recommend this.",

It over-pours dressing at every use, so the person ends up having to eat a salad that is swimming in dressing. And it leaks (drips down the side) after each use -- so that the cap and then the bottom become very greasy over time. The inner rubber seal on the inside of the cover fell out within the first month's use and, despite many efforts to re-insert it, it won't stay in. Despite the strong reviews, I would strongly advise against this product.",

It shouldn't be a problem for a dressing with oils but mayo made it a little too thick. I still liked it but it does drip after pouring onto salad.
