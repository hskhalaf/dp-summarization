The lower number of focus points doesn't bother me at all. The silent shutter mode on this is pretty phenomenal too. Great for shooting events like weddings or ceremonies when you need to be quiet, or for photographing sleeping babies or wildlife.

By the way, I was little bit disappoint about bundle lens, EF 25 - 105mm F/4 USM lens. The minimum aperture(F) is too high to capture low light situation. Most of interior shots and night shots were very blurry. I rather buy extra lens myself.",

I upgraded from a Canon 70D crop sensor to this full frame and am amazed at how much better the photos are with a full frame camera (my photo abilities aside).",

I'd say the greatest advantage of getting the 5D mark iii is that you have two kinds of storage cards and this 6D only has an SD card option. But if twice the price is worth that to you....get the mark iii. As for me, I'd been living with only one type of storage already, and I just couldn't justify spending twice as much for a difference. So I bought this and got a lens all for the same price as the mark iii and I'm much happier!!",
