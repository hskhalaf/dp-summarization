Can't beat the price. Wish they had other colors tho. One of them I used for the bathroom with that been said let your imagination fly while using this.",

About the only thing these hooks will fit is a PS3 controller, and if that's all you have then I question if its necessary to buy hooks in the first place.",

The arms themselves are adjustable, allowing you to get as tight or snug a fit for your various controllers. Wish once they were mounted on the wall, they didn't swivel as much/as easily. It's not that bad, however, over time you'll likely need to keep adjusting the mount due to the controllers shifting it in place.",
