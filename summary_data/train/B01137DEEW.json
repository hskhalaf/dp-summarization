I\u2019ve bought a set twice, because they are so awesome and my first set was stolen. Totally worth the price and hours of fun. Easy to understand and learn and you don\u2019t have to count down and sync. They sync automatically once they are powered on. You choose teams by what color you choose to set the gun at. You have a awesome selection of weapons. If you like laser tag, search No more! This is the ideal set.",

The guns themselves are what shoot of course, but they also are the target and score keepers. A great perk is that you can change the weapon system of the gun, meaning you can switch it to a shotgun, rocket launcher, or subgun. Each weapon system has its pros and cons. One slight drawback is that the range seems diminished in daylight, so these work best at night or indoors",

They come in great re-usable packaging. The mechanics of the laser tag system are easy enough to learn for my 5 year old nephew, yet engaging enough for his 12 year old brother to enjoy. We had lots of fun playing with the different weapon settings - pistol, shotgun, semi-automatic, and rocket launcher. This was an excellent purchase, and I hope the boys enjoy them for years to come.",

The kids played out in the freezing cold and only put the guns down to warm up, eat and then all were back out playing again. Active kids will love these even in the broad daylight. I wasn't sure if they would hold up to dropping and whether the kids would enjoy during the day. Not one complaint!!! All smiles and fun.",

Looking forward to the springtime so they can play outside with it.",

Both sets arrived quickly with easy to understand instructions. Great product! We even loaned them to a co-worker with younger children and now they are hooked.",

The first thing I noticed about the faulty gun was the batteries I used in the first three barely want to slide in the battery compartment. The slot is physically ALMOST too narrow for the batteries. I hope to get a replacement before Christmas. Other than the defective gun, they seem like they are going to be fun to play with.",

They prefer to play inside but it's really noisy. Having the sensors on vests instead of on the guns would probably be more fun but, likely much more expensive.",
