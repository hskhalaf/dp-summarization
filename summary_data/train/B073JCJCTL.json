Irregular sizing on Full/Queen. This is not a traditional full/queen size, it is an oversized Queen. This odd sizing has made finding an insert challenging. Overall this is a nice set. However if I were to purchase again, I would buy the comforter set . For the price of this duvet set it should be a standard size duvet insert with inner ties.",
