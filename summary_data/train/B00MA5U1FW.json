Electronics die eventually, and I don't expect a lot from consumer electronics. Even with surge suppressors and line protection, I'm used to replacing a cable modem every 5\u20138 years. But this one failed unusually young, so I give it a low \"durability\" score despite it otherwise performing as advertised. It just stings when something dies so soon after its warranty period...",

Have to let it cool for 10 minutes (or just spray it cold) and it's good until it gets too hot again, which doesn't take long. Which makes me want to avoid buying another Arris to replace this one.",

Messages in Messenger would take a long time to send, etc. Since switching out the Spectrum modem and activating this one, I have had no problems at all. It was (the modem) a little smaller than I had envisioned, but it works great. I just had to call Spectrum and give them the HFC MAC address and that was it. Very easy.",

Being that I work from home sending oracle/sql/exchange databases and other test files to and from our corporate office I heard my internet has been upgraded and I needed a faster modem to obtain said speeds. I decided on this one, since I have had Arris modems for years. I now download at 300-323 Mbps (40 MB average) you won't actually download that fast from most websites but just to know you can do that is more than satisfactory. Just take a look at the screen shot.",

There are vent holes on 3 sides so I would imagine you cannot lay it down due to the heat and need to vent it. Overall, it's a nice unit so far and works nice.
