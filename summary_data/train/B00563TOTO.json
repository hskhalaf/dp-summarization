This is an issue in projects where you need longer tongue and groove overlaps. No big deal, but I would definitely not recommend this for finish carpentry where the placement or alignment of the holes is extremely important. Otherwise, it functions perfectly.

The included screws are pretty garbage though. The pocket holes are the right size for Kreg screws so consider picking some up. It's a great starter jig if you aren't willing to spend the money on a Kreg because you are unsure if pocket holes are for you.",
