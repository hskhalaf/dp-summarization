There is no need to check your meat like you do on a foreman grill. It literally does all the work for you. My 1.5in chops were Cooked to perfection in about 10 mins. One suggestion when using this is to season your meat a little less than usual. I use heavy seasoning when outdoor grilling because a lot seems to melt off on a traditional grill but with this you don't lose a lot of your seasoning.",

I just received my Opti Grill Plus back from warranty repair without a note saying what was done to fix my crappy grill, or what they found wrong with it. It's Saturday, you can best believe I'll be on the phone first thing Monday morning with T-Fal customer service. To pay this much for a grill I expect way better customer service than this, and a much better working grill to begin with.",
