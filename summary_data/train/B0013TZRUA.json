      "text": "This Planar dual monitor stand rocks! It was easy to setup and the instructions were clear. The large base gives enough weight distribution on some Ikea desks like Linnmon. I put a post/leg under the Linnmon table to add more support. I used a 24in Benq gaming monitor and a 23.8 Asus monitor and they both balance perfectly. When I tilt/rotate either monitor, the stand doesn't move a inch. This thing is ROCK SOLID. The stand is well built to last a life time. If you do not want to bolt/clamp down a stand to your desk, then this is the stand you need. I highly recommend it!",

      "text": "Mounted my two 20-inch monitors (VX2035wm). Space is tight - it's up against a wall so no back overhang possible - and these have worked out very well. The monitors hold their positions, so no need to keep reseting or tightening. One note - there's not a lot of vertical play: At max height, the bottom of the monitors are only 5 inches off the desk and the middle of the screen is only 12 inches. Other stands on amazon have more adjustability. The footprint is pretty small, but does protrude about 3 1/2 inches from the monitor face. Still, it's not taking up a lot of desk space. Setup is rock solid stable - no wiggling.",

Once everything was assembled, I began positioning my monitors. I noticed that there was absolutely no way to adjust the vertical tilt, so both of my Acer monitors were angled slightly upward, toward the ceiling. Because of all of the positive reviews of this product, I will assume this is a result of poor VESA mount design on Acers part. Nonetheless, without the ability to adjust the vertical tilt, these stands lose major functionality points, IMO. So if you're considering this stand with an Acer setup, be warned.",

Once the monitors are mounted, their weight makes adjustments difficult. This is definitely not something that you will play with regularly unless your screens are small. Once you get it set though, it is solid, stable, and reliable. I highly recommend this stand if you want to put dual, large-screen monitors on a desktop.",

We have the same/very similar product at my work (they don't have \"Planar\" emblazoned on the base like this one does, but it doesn't really bother me much) and we have never had any issues as far as I have heard. I very highly recommend this product if you're looking for a dual monitor stand that supports up to, I believe, 24-inch monitors.",
