That is only controlled with the left earbud. You cannot use the right to activate your assistant.

What impressed me about the jbuds air was the complete system: excellent bass, good comfortable fit, and what a GREAT idea to integrate the cable into the charging/carrying box for less tiny items to carry. So,I got these air Go 20% smaller for roughly half the price. That price should have warned me. These earbuds have lower max volume and much less bass response than the jbuds Air. The 20% smaller size gives MUCH LESS sound quality. So I don't recommend the kbuds Air Go for music. They sound clear enough for other uses though.",

Sound is mediocre at best the ear pieces are way too big, even with the small size they end up uncomfortable after a short time of use. Update- 7/7/20, Now after charging them 4 times, they no longer turn on. Don't waste your time with this garbage.",

You may get 25 uses or 3 before it happens again. Very frustration. However, the Right one seems to always work, so if you're just using one for calls or podcasts, it works great.",

      "text": "Although they are very comfortable to wear and the battery life is amazing, I can only give 3 stars because the sound quality is HORRIBLE!! They are so low I can barely hear my music even after adjusting the bass and volume at the highest level it can go. I can buy a pair of cheaper wireless pods and the sound quality is so much better. Definitely do not recommend if you\u2019re looking for quality sound.. \ud83d\ude12",
