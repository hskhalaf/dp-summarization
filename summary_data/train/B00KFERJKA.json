Canon website says it is no longer supported so I would therefore recommend you do not buy it if you are in the world of Apple.",

I don't intend using it much on the go but makes a great addition to a flatbed scanner for all those loose A4 sheets of whatever you need to scan. It is very quick and the user interfaces are easy to configure for one touch scanning. I just have it connected via one USB cable, it seems to run fine without the additional power supply.",

Once the software, (Twain Drivers) had been loaded on my computer it worked seamlessly with ABBYY FineReader Pro. Powered from a usb port, it's fast even scanning at 600 dpi. 'wings' on the adjustable paper guides prevent any paper 'skewing' etc. A nice piece of kit.",

Scans photographs very well. An excellent scanner if you want to scan your statements, invoices, etc on to your computer instead of filing away hard copies. Great for a small home office especially if you have little desk space.",

Unbelievable that you can scan double sided unlike an A4 Flatbed or other Portable Scanners that I have researched and scans as fast if not faster as a big desktop scanner The software is very intuitive and easy to use yet gives you functions for editing, renaming, document sorting and many other customisable. Its more expensive than some, but the best value for money",

Their advice is to buy a new product or not upgrade OS if you don't want to lose scanner. I for one expect my peripheral devices to keep up with my PC, not the other way around. So, unless you use an old Mac OS and are happy to stay like that - this scanner does not seem worth it at this time. Will probably avoid canon for now.",
