It's quite frustrating that most people upgrade their phones every year or so, and the manufacturers no longer seem to build things to last. I really don't want a phone that is also a GPS, music player, web surfing device, game console, dog trainer, etc. I just want a phone that can make phone calls and last for more than a year or so.
