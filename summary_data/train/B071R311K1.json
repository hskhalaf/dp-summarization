      "text": "I did lots of research before purchasing these earphones. I have had some true wireless earbuds in the past that have left me disappointed with audio quality and I feared wireless earbuds might not be quite there yet for an audiophile. I decided to try out neckband wireless and I am extremely impressed with the audio that these deliver. The build quality is excellent, a great metal finish whilst still remaining very light weight. My only reservation that I have noticed is that the connection can drop/distort from time to time. Would 100% recommend these earbuds!",

They are light, comfortable and easy to use but the same issue means I am moving on to another brand. Put simply the volume automatically beeps and continuously reduces to nothing, constantly. A sensor may be loose or some of the firmware is not debugged but it happened again on my 2nd par within 3 months of ownership. I am really disappointed as they are a great product but I need the quality to improve before I return.",

      "text": "I have bought a series of Bluetooth headphones looking for the perfect pair. This Forza metallo are great and I would recommend them to everyone as long as they understand a couple of kaveats. First, the wire is simply too long. I believe this is so that they can be wrapped around the ear, but I am not sure. Second, when you get a call the headphone vibrates very agressively and does not pulse. It is one long consistent vibrate which is very obnoxious. Other than that, the comfort is fantastic, the sound is as good as anyone could expect for Bluetooth, and the battery usually lasts 2-3 days for me.",

The cut outs are like a brief blip but become terribly annoying. The length of the cord to the ear pieces are way too long causing the neck piece to slide down your back.

It sits very snug and tight in your ear throughout the entire run. Wireless connection was steady. The issue with long wires could be bothersome to some degree. But it certainly does not outweigh superb sound quality and overall fit.",

The variety of fins and tips provided is fantastic: these are the first earbuds I've owned that don't just fall out of my ear on a regular basis.
