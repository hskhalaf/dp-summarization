My only complaint is that its smaller than a regular tissue box so the tissues don't all fit, the first question you'll be asking yourself is what to do with the small stack of tissues that doesn't fit... The other problem with them not fitting is that the tissues don't come out smoothly, they rip unless you pull them out incredibly slowly and gently. But as the box gets less full it does become easier. Either way if you're looking for a really cool looking tissue box I'd still recommend this one.",
