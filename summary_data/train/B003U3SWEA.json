I do have to say that they are rather expensive, which made me go with an alternative reusable brand, but if you just need something disposable for a short time, these are your best choice over the other brands.",

Plus the sticky bits on the back keep them in place but aren't so overly sticky that they leave a gross sticky patch on my clothes. They come individually wrapped so that I can stuff a couple in the diaper bag, unlike their organic competitors. These are just too good to go with anything else.",

The excess milk turns into a gel-like form which eliminates leakage on your clothes and odor. Found other disposable pads and reusable pads leave a sour milk odor. Recommend buying in bulk for cheaper per unit cost.",
