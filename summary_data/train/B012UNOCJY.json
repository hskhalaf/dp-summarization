My experience tells me I will tolerate this for a year or so and finally be forced to replace this monitor. Of course I need a monitor on a daily basis so I will not return this one. But I am quite disappointed. What I get for buying an unknown brand, I had never seen in use.",

The displayport 1.4 will be the only way on this monitor to get in a 4K 10bit RGB signal, and it has such annoying bugs. So I'd say, don't buy this monitor.",

      "text": "I love this monitor. The colors are very nice and easy to calibrate with my Spyder5 Elite. I no longer have a need for a 2nd monitor, as this one is large enough to act as 2 monitors if I need to work on documents side by side. The included shades that fit on the monitor come in handy when dealing with light that may be shining in from a window to the side. Overall, I really do like this monitor. Sure it's expensive, but I think it's worth it.",
