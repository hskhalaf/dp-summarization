      "text": "This is my fourth soccer ball within two years as I either loose them or their stitches fall apart. Initially, I was skeptical of how this ball will feel/handle on wet grass as it felt quite smooth (almost slippery to hold). But almost after it's first use, I have fully enjoyed it as it holds air well, the outer surface doesn't get rough, works well in rain and on wet grass, feel good to handle and has good control. Quick tip: though it came with air and great packaging (as it's displayed in shops), I thought it needed more air as I felt soft, but I was wrong...and had to take extra air that I pumped out again.",

I didn't have any of the quality issues some other buyers mentioned in their reviews.",

It is a very distinctively styled ball, not unlike the Brazuca during the 2014 World Cup. The coaches love to use the ball for some reason and everyone knows whose ball it is. It's just cool. Style is important to soccer players, but functionally it is a very good ball. The cover is very sturdy and it takes daily use and abuse, both indoors and out. Because it is pretty unique, it's easy to find the ball after matches, practices, etc. Highly recommended",

It is very solid and well made. We enjoy hours of kicking the ball around in the backyard. The ball is solid and doesn't require any inflation. It is glossy and a nice collectors item. However, if you choose to kick it around then it will experience normal wear and tear. My 56 pound dog carries her ball around with her and it still looks great despite a few teeth marks. I have one soccer ball for her to use inside the house and one for the backyard.",

I tried deflating and starting over several times. I tried over inflating and under inflating and although it got better than the initial fill, it is still not round. Perhaps it is the different size patches that make it incapable of becoming completely round or maybe I just got a defective one.",

If the ball doesn\u2019t deflate, it\u2019s plastic or of poor quality that will be painful to use. It will hurt your child\u2019s foot, body or head when he or she kicks or contacts it. Your child will not enjoy playing with a poor quality ball although it may seem more durable and less work because you don\u2019t have to pump it occasionally. Buy a small ball pump and a needle, it\u2019ll be worth it and your kid will be happier with the softer more inflatable ball that isn\u2019t painful and won\u2019t cause injury.",

If sending it in a shoe box, you'll need a deeper shoe box in order for it to fit. I was still able to fit in other items around it, including the air pump I purchased.
