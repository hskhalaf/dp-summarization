Accidents waiting to happen.. it can burn your scalp as well.. so make sure you can handle a straightener well otherwise stick to GHD's that offer more protection.",

I have a lot of hair but the curling took half the time it normally takes with a curling wand. Another massive plus is when I straighten my hair it lasts 2 days and no touch ups needed as I would have done in the past. Definitely best value for money!",

Have ended up with 3 bad burns so far and that\u2019s only for using level 2/5 heat setting!! They also catch your hair in the plates causing it to rip. Really unhappy with them unfortunately and have already ordered new ones in less than 4 weeks. The only and I mean only good thing about them is the heat settings.. otherwise I dont recommend at all!",

When the latch breaks, the case is obviously totally useless. Being that this happened three times, all with the same issue, I recommend looking for a different case, and probably stay away from this manufacturer entirely due to them using a plastic not suitable for purpose.",

MUCH THINNER case than the picture shows. The picture does NOT do it justice. It absolutely does not look as bulky as it does in the photo. Also noted, the rubber around the edge is matte and is not the same squishy rubber as otter boxes. Slides SO MUCH EASIER into your pocket. Wonderful product!",

The rainbow effect you might read about is in compliance to the screen protector is based on its contact with the phone. If you have an air pocket you will have the rainbow effect. The port covers are great but if you aren't worried about dust. Cut them off and you still have a great phone case! This is a definite phone case I am going to keep.",

      "text": "Excellent case that fits very snug! Half the price of an Ottorbox with great protection. I'd buy it again. It's also not incredibly bulky. I actually use mine in a professional business setting so it has to be a nice line between sleek and protection. The only reason I didn't give it 5 starts was the cover for the silent button never worked correctly. I tried and tied and even shaved down some of the plastic. Eventually I cut it off. Still looks fine.",

He doesn't use the clip because the phone fits perfectly in one of his tactical pants pockets. I couldn't even figure out for the get the case apart at first so I knew it would be a good case.",

There is a cut-out for the iPhone home button. I would have preferred to have this like previous cases I have purchased where that is not a cutout, but rather has a lighter film over the button, so the dirt does not accumulate under the clear screen protector. I have had cases before with the cutout for the home button, and dirt ALWAYS accumulates under the clear screen protector from this area. Aside from this, I am quite pleased with the case.",

It's not visible unless you get a glare on the case but it causes the screen to need to be wiped off a lot more than other cases/screen protectors I've used need o.",

After a few months, a piece broke off where the mute switch was, leaving the cover sticking out. So I cut off the cover and broke off the broken plastic entirely. I still use the case because it is still good for protection.",

The rubber grip on this case is an improvement also, as most other materials simply slide right out of a pocket or purse. Simple, small, and streamlined design. The additional belt clip on is removable, although some users might appreciate it. Easy to use, fits well, does not block sound or necessary buttons on the phone, merely covers them for protection and enables use throughout. I highly recommend!",
