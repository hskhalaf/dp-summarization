Really impressed by how the Corner doesn't sit on the clamp so that you don't have to worry about dripping glue or the clamp getting glued to the boards! When I Clamp I use the Can-Do Clamp for the bottom corner, and a smaller corner Clamp for the top 1/2. I picked up a knock off Clamp at Harbor Freight, but Amazon has the Bessey version that goes well with the Can Do Clamp. Bessey WS-3 Angle Clamp  Together they make a great pair. Love my Can Do!",

Unless you have the handle hanging off the edge of the workbench, you can only tighten the clamp half a turn. Then you have to slide the bar back and tighten it another half turn. Terrible design. I removed the tightening bar and made Bessy style handles. The clamps are so much easier to use now. They seem like they will work for squaring up the bookcase for assembly. Time will tell.",
