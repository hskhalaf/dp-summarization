Another reviewer commented about a mood change while taking this medicine and I noticed that as well, I had bad mood swings, more than normal. When these are gone, I'm switching back to Omeprazole. I'll stick with what works best. I will say one thing I especially liked about these capsules: They are TINY, thus very EASY to SWALLOW!!",
