I fell in love with a that a friend of mine owns. The dell was priced about 700. This is an insane bang for your buck price. I came across this one online and and had great specs for the price. I purchased the monitor 5 months ago. I love it so much I purchased a second one for work. It has become my go to for everything I do. It easily stands up to monitors twice this price. 10/10 will buy a third soon.",

Freesync and 75 hz are great to take advantage of, but after a firmware update you need a DisplayPort cable sold separately. If you are using this for gaming you have to have a DisplayPort cable because they only give HDMI. Also, I had to return my monitor due to dead pixels so there may be shaky quality control.",

It's by no means dim though. - It doesn't swivel. - It seems like every audio frequency resonates with the speaker cover, which creates a buzzing sound. - This monitor is setup in my bedroom. When the monitor is off, but still has power, the power button blinks brightly. This is irritating.",

Since I was doing a new Linux / Ubuntu build with a Ryzen 7 1800x and other great stuff, I decided to treat myself and do the new build justice with this monitor. I'm a developer and having the horizontal real estate for my IDE helps with productivity and keeping everything in sight without scrolling. I'm using this as a center monitor in a three monitor setup (the side monitors are LG's as well; 27\" 1080p). Although this is not a curved monitor, it doesn't really affect the experience.",

If I take a screenshot the picture is fine but what I see is not. Attached are pictures of what I see. There are periods where it clears up for a little while then degrades back to this.

When I sat in a position to view the middle of the monitor, there was some distortion at the sides. If I moved to the side, clarity of the letters improved. I would recommend this monitor for games and videos. For me, the inability to see crisp text across the whole screen led to returning it. My problem might be solved with a curved 34\" screen.",

When movies are available in the 21:9 format (like some in the Amazon Prime Video collection) the viewing experience is immersive and delightful, this same applies to games. It is my hope that developers embrace a higher commitment with 21:9 display format soon, specially those working in the interactive entertainment industry.",
