This is perfect for him because he loves building my sets with tiny pieces and sometimes he gets frustrated because of his small fingers lol. Yes I know he is too young for Lego but my kiddo is a smart one and can build experts sets on his own minus breaking the fragile pieces here and there. Get this set for your kiddo or for your own collection when on sale for 40%+ off.",

What\u2019s great about the juniors sets is that some of the pieces are larger so there are a few less things to construct. In this set the main bodies of the planes are one piece which makes it easier for younger kids to build.",
