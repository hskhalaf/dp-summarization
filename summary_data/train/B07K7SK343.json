You can connect to google assistant. This lets you check on status of your garage doors. Open/Close all garage doors or just the ones you choose. If you have more than one garage door you have to buy another position sensor.",

One bug in the system is that during remote door operation, if the door is stopped via the wall button or for any other reason, the app will hang in the transition state and there is no way to recover. I spoke to Genie customer support and they confirmed that the only way to recover is to operate the door locally. This isn't a good approach as I have seen the unit fail once or twice to operate the door. This significantly reduces the overall utility of the app.",

    "title": "Genie Aladdin Connect \u2013 Smart Garage Door Opener \u2013 Compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant - Monitor, Open and Close from Anywhere with a Smartphone (iPhone or Android),(Item Ships in Bag)",
    "description": "For many homeowners, the garage door is the most used entry point to the home \u2013 not to mention the largest. Having up-to-date information about who is accessing your garage at any given time can provide immense peace of mind. And being able to operate your garage door from your smart device is the ultimate convenience! Do both of these and more with Genie\u2019s Aladdin Connect smartphone connectivity. This WIFI garage door opener gives you power over your home by monitoring your garage door\u2019s status at all times. If your garage door is opening or closing, Aladdin Connect will alert you \u2013 whether the user is authorized or not. Aladdin Connects Security Advantage is the sensor attached to the garage door itself so if an intruder disengaged your system and manually opened your garage door, you would know about it! Aladdin Connect Smart Phone Connectivity is now even smarter, offering new time-based features. These include creating a virtual key, setting a close time for your door, and setting a time frame within which to close your door. This means you can use your garage door controller to provide temporary or permanent access to friends, relatives or service repair workers. You can also ensure that your door gets closed each night by setting it to automatically close at whatever time you choose. You can also set the door to automatically close after it has been left open for a certain amount of time, giving you peace of mind if you\u2019re already on the road and can\u2019t remember if you closed the garage door or not! Plus, the Aladdin Connect is also now compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant for the ultimate all-around convenience and security. The Genie Aladdin Connect has a free downloadable app, is easy to install and set up, and increases safety by making your garage door smarter and you more aware. Get connected and stay connected with the Aladdin Connect! Your Wi-Fi router must meet this specification: 802.11 b/g/n, 2.4GHz with WPA2 or WPA Security.",
