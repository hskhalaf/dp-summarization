The only two things against it is the temp doesn\u2019t get much colder than 37 degrees so if you like your beer ice cold, I suggest pairing with a mug out of the freezer. The other thing, and this isn\u2019t against the product or company, is liquor stores don\u2019t refer to these kegs by actual size and each one calls it a different name so it was hard finding a keg to fit but I will be doing some research to rectify that.",

The excess foaming others complain about is due to the fact that the kegs are over-pressurized. Took me a few glasses to adjust it and then it worked fine. I'd try to return this, but I've already gotten rid of the packaging. I don't think it will get much use without the ability to cool. The fan is loud but bearable.",
