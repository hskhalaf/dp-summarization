    "title": "TOPOKO Vegetable Steamer Basket, Fits Instant Pot Pressure Cooker 5/6 QT and 8 QT, 18/8 Stainless Steel, Folding Steamer Insert For Veggie Fish Seafood Cooking, Expandable to Fit Various Size Pot",
    "description": "Perfect combination \n\nStainless steel metal basket comes complete as a steamer and strainer. \n\nAlready assembled one piece combination. Collapsible - It goes from small to large 9\u201d in a snap when petals are opened and comes with a convenient handle inside. \n\nEasy to Use - Frozen bags: single or mixed vegetables. - Raw: Corn, broccoli, cauliflower, or carrots - Try fish: cod, salmon, talapia, etc. Easy lift with 2\u201d handle and o-ring to strain excess water and non-extendable to avoid spring malfunctioning injuries Have you been searching, how to use a vegetable steamer or vegetable steamer instructions ? If so, I have a few tips that will help you use the TOPOKO steamer. 1st - Wash before use! \n\n2nd - Open the steamer and place raw or frozen vegetables inside. \n\n3rd - Close the steamer and place in a pan or pot with just enough water to fill to where the base of the steamer is above the water level. \n\n4th - Cover for a few minutes, timing is dependent on what you\u2019re cooking, how much, and frozen or raw. Raw thin vegetables will definitely cook faster. Use a fork to check for tenderness. \n\n5th - Use handle to lift and strain excess water while removing, season, and enjoy. \n\nMake sure you don\u2019t boil dry. You can listen for when the water has evaporated. If you\u2019re making baby food, you would transition your soft vegetables to some type of blender, where they could be quickly mashed for baby food. You can also manually mash them since they will be soft and tender. Clean up is a breeze. Although dishwasher safe, to preserve the quality of the steamer, it is best to hand wash and air or towel dry before storage. The compact design allows for easy storage without taking up tons of space. Gift Perfect wedding present, showers, housewarming, or a cook enthusiast. Buy Now or Add to Registry",
