I have a highly modified sport car and this camera caught the dealership abusing my car, damaging it, and driving it improperly. Was awarded nearly $1,500 in damages all because of this dash cam (somehow they never even saw it in my windshield). So, the camera has more then paid for itself in only the first year of owning it. Many of my friends have bought this camera as a result. I highly recommend it.",

Beware, if your battery charger port in the car doesn\u2019t shut off when you shut the car off it could cause a problem with the battery. I now have a broken camera and had to pay to have my battery recharged!!! Update: I must say I\u2019m very impressed with the customer service. After seeing my initial review they contacted me and asked if I wanted a refund or a replacement. I asked for a replacement and sent the broken one back. I just received a new one and it\u2019s working like a charm! Hopefully I don\u2019t have any more problems. It\u2019s a fabulous dash cam. Very clear picture.",

Nothing too fancy but it certainly gets the job done and gives me piece of mind knowing that I have proof in the event anything should happen. The picture quality is surprisingly good and the night time vision works way better than I expected. The biggest thing that could be improved is the battery life. The second you unplug it from the power source the battery dies. Other than that, it's perfect for me.",

      "text": "This is pretty much a near perfect dash cam. Setup takes a little bit, but it is easy enough. I like that the time, date amd license plate number is hard coded on the video. The videos record on the memory card and there is no worry about filling up the card because it keeps recording over the old files. The camera starts recording when you start the car and stops recording a few seconds after you shut off the car. The biggest complaint is running the power cord. Trying to run the cord so it is out of veiw of the windshield and not dangling.",

Comes with 2 sticky mounts so you can move the camera between 2 cars. What I'd like to see improved: include the hard wires and gps. Both are available for purchase separately.
