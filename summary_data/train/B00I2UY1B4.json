      "text": "This works as it was designed. I mean no, it won't keep your water cold for hours on end, but if you are using it indoors and add ice to the bottle it does last for a little over an hour. Which is perfect to me since I use these primarily when working out at the gym or during spin class. The mouth of the bottle is wide enough to fit ice cubes in it which is another feature I like since my gym doesn't seem to have cold water coming out of any of their fountains. I originally bought two and I'm thinking of getting another one. Love the different colors!",
