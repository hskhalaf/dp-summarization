We used additional Bluetooth speaker for sound. The sound on the projector itself would probably only be useful in a smaller area and not with a group of people.",

      "text": "When I first ordered this projector for our art studio, for some reason, it was projecting a mirror image reflection! But we still used it, without trying to fix it, until I was reached out by the customer service representative to review their product. After, Elsa found out that i am not 100% happy, she offered to replace it. Without even waiting for me to send back the first one, she sent me the new one. I got it today, checked it and it works great! Everything works perfect and a it projects a good image! I am really impressed and happy with this customer care! Highly recommend it!",

This projector did the trick, while not the brightest or most color accurate one around, the price point on this and the WiFi feature definitely make this a strong contender when you are looking to not invest in a \"cinema\" or \"theater\" type projector you would want to formally setup in your home. I'd say this would be great for kids and gaming (assuming they are not overly picky about picture/color accuracy).",
