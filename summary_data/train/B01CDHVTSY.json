Wicked thunderstorms blew through Daytona Beach today and our tent was blown into our fence/hedge while I was at work. When I got home I thought the tent was finished, BUT it resumed its shape with no rips, tears or bent Poles! Love it!",

We stayed dry through heavy downpours and when other tents had problems with the wind blowing and knocking down poles etc this tent had none of those issues. Absolutely recommend to anyone. As with other reviews one downside is the tent zipper can get stuck easily in the flap in front of it. Also the velcro to keep the flap closed sticks too easily to the screen netting which makes it pull.",

It is easy to set up and fold back. Honestly, if you use it for the first time, 2 minutes are not enough for you to set up the whole thing. It took us about 20 minutes. However, the next time, I am sure I can do it within 3 minutes. That easy.",
