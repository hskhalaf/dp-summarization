It follows comic story lines and allows you to play as multiple characters, both autobots and deceptions as the story progresses.",

Each level and character are incredibly cool, the game starts to cook when you start using Cliffjumper and after that it's pure fun. Grimlock is awesome, the levels are awesome... I'm really satisfied with it. The only thing that might lack is more cinematics. Can't get enough of them to be sincere. Lasted less that 15 days to finish it. It was totally adictive. The Dinobot and insecticon retcon from G1 is pretty clever too.",

I can't believe I missed out on this game it is sooooo good I was skeptical because it's a transformers game and we all know how game companies sometimes ruin favorite heroes/characters but my GOD do these guys do it justice the sotry is great and freakin epic if you're a transformers fan you'll see many familiar faces but even if you're new to the series it does a good job of introducing the characters. Transforming from bot to vehicle mode is flippin great and never gets old anyway this is a must buy!",

In addition, the variety of weapons, enemies, and playable characters was surprisingly diverse. The only negative I found was that on some missions, it can feel a bit unfair when you are faced with dozens of enemies at once. Overall, excellent game! Highly recommended!",

Multiplayer is fast paced and has a ferocity to it, i think its a great buy for any age group.",

Jazz has a grappling hook, stealth as CliffJumper, causing total chaos as the giant Bruticus, etc. The story isn't anything spectacular, autobots are just trying to leave a dying Cybertron as Decepticons try to stop you. My game did freeze about 3 times throughout the whole game and loaded at odd times. Overall, I would recommend this game!",
