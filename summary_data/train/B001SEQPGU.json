The marks don't come out on the pictures, but it's disconcerting. Also, you have to be very careful when you press the buttons. The camera is very sensitive, and it is easy to erase more pictures than you intend to. The camera takes good pictures in different kinds of light, is easy to operate, and easy to understand. It also looks very nice. My son liked it, but this one is mine! I would recommend this camera.",

All the rest is very good: The video is quality fantastic and the outdoors pictures are good. The interface and menus are easy to work with. I don't know if I got a lemon or if this is the standard quality. I returned this unit and will buy the cannon SD780. shame - wanted the wide angle view and the big zoom :-( Thank you amazon for a great costumer service experience.",

I liked that it uses the same battery and memory stick,so they are interchangeable. Disappointed that the cord is not the same; it is something extra for me to take on trips. I love it for sharp close ups. It even does well for distance shots that I then crop. Of course, the blue color is great. I would recommend this camera to anyone who wants to be able to slip the camera in his/her pocket and take very clear pictures.The price was fair as well.",
