      "text": "The first time I used this I made a ham and cheese sandwich. You would think it would be okay since it is a thinner sandwich but no. Everything came out of it and it was so messy. The pockets need to be bigger so you can close it easier and not have your filling spilling out. Also after the sandwich was done the inside was still cold inside!! The cheese wasn't even melted! I have not touched this product since then. What a waste.",

The larger slices do hang over but it still works fine if you lower the preheated iron slowly and let the bread soften til it is easier to close. It doesn't hold much more than a slice of cheese and some thinly-sliced veggies, but we usually just use cheese anyway. I'd love to see Cuisinart make another one without the divider line in the middle.",

    "description": "Color:SilverCuisinart Dual-Sandwich Nonstick Electric Grill. BPA Free\n\nAMAZON.COM\nLunch takes on a whole new dimension with this sandwich grill. Layer cheese, tuna, veggies, mushrooms, or whatever is desired between slices of bread, set on the deep-pocket grill, and close and lock the lid. Sandwiches come out perfectly browned and sealed, with a diagonal indentation making them easy to slice in half. The grill cooks one or two sandwiches at a time, and also turns out waffles and omelets. The nonstick finish keeps food from sticking, although a little butter or oil also helps. A red light comes on when the grill is plugged in and heating up; a green light announces the grill is ready to use. To clean, simply wipe off the grill plates when cool. The grill measures 9 by 9 by 3-1/2, and is covered by a three-year warranty against defects. --Ann Bieri",
