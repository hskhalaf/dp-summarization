My dad had the same problem when he was shooting, and I had it happen again at the end of the day. Not sure if it came with a bad battery, or if it's faulty. Not sure if the recoil of the AK is too much for this thing to handle or what.",

Annoying at the range, but would be a critical failure in an actual SD scenario. While they are cosmetically nice, this is not acceptable for a serious optic. Will upgrade shortly.... One possible cause that I need to confirm is whether tightening the battery door all the way down will prevent this. Next range trip will see if this was the case. If so, still annoying...",
