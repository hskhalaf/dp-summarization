I have returned this item and will get something else. Image quality was ok. Scanner itself seemed ok, the plastic guides for loading the slides were a bit flimsy.",

It hardly communicates and crashes often when transferring files to a computer. Takes hours to scan a roll of film and transfer to the computer. Would not buy again.",

We wanted to have the slides transferred to photos, but weren't sure which ones to have printed. There were over 2,000 slides so the cost to send them off to another company would be astrological. I was able to transfer all of the slides to a SD card and surprise my husband for Christmas. This way he gets to pick out the slides he wants to have printed/enlarged and he also get to see all of the slides. It took several hours to upload this many slides, but it was worth it!!",

Do not get overly aggressive with the compressed air or you could possibly freeze the slide and damage it. I have done this a few times with no signs of permanent damage. Using the compressed air, It probably takes about 10 minutes to convert 36 slides.",

      "text": "Quite easy to use for turning slides into Jpegs and the resolution looks good. Have not done much with the editing options as I put all the good slides through Photoshop afterwards and just delete the others. It would be nice if I could put the slides through a bit more quickly, but overall it is very good value for the price.",

The only difficulty I had was do to the age of some of my slides some over 65 yrs old they were slightly warped and didn't slide through the feeder as easily as I had hoped, but that is more my problem than a product issue. I loved the clarity and the fact that I could make slides that were almost unrecognizable into pictures of the past.",
