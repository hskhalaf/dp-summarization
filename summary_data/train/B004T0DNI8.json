      "text": "I replaced the original HDD from my Alienware M11xR2 with this SSD, and couldn't be happier. I reinstalled Windows at the same time so it's hard to effectively gauge the performance increase, but everything seems faster now, particularly booting, installing and loading programs which went from tedious to hardly noticeable. The installation was a snap. I moved my old HDD to an external enclosure () where it now serves as a backup, and storage for raw camera files and other media that just won't fit on the smaller 300GB drive.",
