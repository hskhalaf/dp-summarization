No idea if the mechanical version is worth more, but this is perfectly fine for me. I use an xbox controller for most games, but this opened up 95% of my steam library to the only way I play games anymore. Seems well built and is comfortable to use. I do wish it were wireless, but I keep the wire tucked under my couch when I'm not using it. FYI it does not come with a mouse -- this wasn't made very clear when I did my research.",

LEDs are bright and a bunch of cool keyboard effects can be selected. Seems very solid. Reminds me of my younger days when *all* keyboards had a solid mechanical action. Now it\u2019s a pricey novelty. Go figure.",

Great lapboard until it fails then its just a useless brick since you can get no warrenty replacement help from the manufacturer.",

Super high-quality, with a nice heft, a great mechanical keyboard (not sure what the nay-sayers were using, but it wasn't this), and everything just really well-thought-out. The pads on the bottom are even nicely spaced out. I suppose my one quibble is the software+lighting -- the light level options are limited so the effect of some keys lit more than others is never particularly dramatic. But it's all a nice glowing blue, so I don't care.",
