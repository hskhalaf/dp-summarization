Since I could return it I tried their 18 guage nails. It worked. I shot about 30 18 guage nails with no problem. My carpenter has a battery gun that is very noisy like a gun shot and when it reloads it makes even more noise. This one doesn't do that. Just a single pop and the nail goes in where the depth is set. It's like a semi auto pistol with a silencer. Pop pop pop job is done.",

But with the addition of this nailer, no cords to chase, plenty of power, easy to load. The only minor downside was that with the extended battery which is larger it gives your wrist a work out after extended use horizontally on base boards and shoe moulding. But it was very tolerable and cut the install time in half. Bravo!",
