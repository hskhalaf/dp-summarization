      "text": "I bought all three and tested them side by side over a two week period. These and the Tomcats performed equally well, regularly capturing mice and killing them instantly. The spring mechanism is very strong but it is very easy to set. The sharp \"teeth\" on the kill bar are better than the Tomcat but very close call. The Victor units were USELESS. After the first three days I did not bother using them. The spring is very weak and the kill bar has no teeth. I thought I could hear the mice laughing at me after the first night.",

Literally as soon as I turned the lights off, went into my room, and set up my diffuser - a trap went off. I checked and found the first victim... It's now after 1am, and we are up to three! These traps are impressive and really work. These are worth every penny. The best part is that in the morning I can remove the dead mice without touching, and set these all back up for another successful night of exterminating.",

Bingo! And easy to dispose of dead rodent and bait again. After one more successful trap, it did not kill the next three. The trapped mice dragged the trap a considerable distance and I was left with live mice to deal with. So it seems great st catching our very small mice. But is inhumane and one was a waste from the get go. Disappointing!",

The exterminators would have put out glue traps, which are horrific, or poison, which is insane, because it's a slow, painful death and then you have dead mice decomposing in your walls. It was easy to set up -- smear peanut butter in the compartment, push the lever down until you hear a click and that's all there is to it. The poor little guys were killed instantly. If the Havahart traps don't work for you, this is an alternative.",

The secret is that the bait does not go on the trigger pedal, but is underneath in a hole. It would be much harder for the mouse to lick food off the trap without getting caught. I tried traditional traps and failed about four times, but these traps have a much higher success rate.",

Don't be worried that the plastic won't catch them. I've had these for years and they're completely reliable. Use peanut butter - catches more.",

    "description": "The JT Eaton 409 Jawz Plastic Mouse Trap is a popular method for pest removal and features a high tension spring to eliminate mice and other small pests. Each trap is easy and safe to set compared to traditional wooden traps and can be set by hand or foot. When the trap is properly set, the red label faces upward to indicate it's ready to go. This makes it incredibly simple to set multiple traps and reduces false alarms. Made of durable plastic, these traps are smaller than multi catch traps for discreet placement underneath furniture and other tight spaces and are fully reusable. This snap trap works best with liquid or solid bait and comes in a 2-pack. The JT Eaton 409 Jawz Plastic Mouse Trap comes with a 1-year limited warranty to protect against defects in material and workmanship. JT Eaton\u2019s mission is to manufacture and distribute products designed to eradicate pests. We continually seek out new ways to provide consumers with the knowledge and products they need to create a healthier and safer world.
