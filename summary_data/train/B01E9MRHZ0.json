I made the mistake of opening the second package before the first package was used up. Don't do that. Only one fits in the re-sealable container at a time, leaving the other to tend to dry out as you keep opening the seal. BTW, I bought a similar item at the pet store and it was more expensive with no container included.",

I have had a box of 100 and it has been open for a couple of months and they wipes are still very wet. I've tried many dog wipes. These have no odor (which I require) and are the most sturdy and effective.",
