I would recommend these to everyone. Wish more stores carried Ryka!",

This style is wonderful, however, I did exchange for half size larger than my size I have always worn. Fit is perfect and feels so good on my walk. The price has come down over the years.

I wore them for the first time to an event where I had to do a lot of walking on concrete, and these shoes felt great. And I also love the color of the shoe. The pink and green accents on the gray shoe is not too loud, the shoe looks fashionable, and not boring.",

I buy workout shoes that I only wear indoors to do my cross-training and cleaning the house. I was so excited to find these on Amazon because RYKA does not make this particular shoe anymore. The other reason I love these shoes so much, is that my big toe is constantly popping up (which makes it uncomfortable to workout) and eventually making a hole. These shoes have enough supported material around the big toe, that I don't have any issues. I do the Cathe Friedrich workouts and these shoes are wonderful for her intense training.",

The last four pairs I have owned have required my pulling out the provided insoles and replacing them with a gel insole topped with a foam one. I figured these shoes would be the same. Not so!
