I ordered the black first, I liked them so well I ordered them in red . For Spring I plan to order them in brown , and maybe white as well. This sandal is perfect for anyone with foot problems . I would highly recommend these little sandals . O yea, they are cute and stylish as well.",

The arch support is just fine, I just have ludicrously high arches, normal humans or even mildly high arched folks will be just fine with these. I also like the versatility of the velcro but I was worried of the aesthetics of it. Turns out from a foot and a half away you can't even see the velcro!

Obviously they run larger for me. So when I ordered on Amazon, I knew the exact size. I like that the straps adjust for each foot since my left foot is smaller. Feels good. I've walked a mile+ without a problem. The coral color I chose is nice, more orange than red. Attractive details on the straps. Heel height is good too--not too high, with nice stability. So far I'm pleased. The shoe stays on well with no slipping out that occurs with some slip-ons as you walk.",

They are extremely comfortable and perfect if you have fallen arches or a foot injury, as I do. I discovered them by accident in TJ Maxx and have been buying them from Amazon every year. The fit is always as expected and consistent among the various styles. My only complaint is that the fabric of the footbed begins to wear after six months or so on the edges, but the comfort is well worth buying a new pair. I hope Clark's never decides to retire this general type of sandal. Thank you Clark's!",

The velcro makes it easy to adjust the size if you have trouble with feet swelling and the footbed is very comfortable. Only sandals I have that I can wear all day shopping and don't have leg aches when I'm done. The color is a soft blue which blends with most other colors. Great pair of footwear!",

Even when my feet swell, the straps can easily be adjusted for my comfort. I will probably order one or two more darker pairs for the autumn season. The straps are so soft and the shoes are made so well that they will probably last for several years.",
