I bought 3 of them and these things smell like concentrated ashtray or burning factory or maybe smouldering tire dump. Contaminates any tote bag we put them in. Makes any office smell like a smoker works there. If you are a chain smoker you won't notice a thing, this mouse pad will work great for you. If not, don't use them yourself, give them as gifts to your enemies. We have them outside on the porch with dryer sheets between them hoping this stench gasses off pretty quickly or they are going in the bin on the next trash day.",

I put it on my desk (still in the plastic wrap) by the window and returned 5-10 minutes later to find the pad looked like a big potato chip (warped) It didn't feel too warm so I placed the pad immediately under some books on a flat surface but it didn't help much. The pad is warped so much it is not usable. The surface must be a very temperature sensitive thermoplastic. I think it would be fine in a room without direct light and away from a direct heat source. I definitely would not recommend putting a hot cup of coffee on it.",

I have another mousepad that's thinner but smoother, and the mouse glides more easily. Not an issue though just mentioning in case you're picky about that. I would absolutely buy this item again.",

I then placed a bunch desicant packets on it with a small desk fan blowing on it and left it like that for a few more days. That still didn't get rid of the smell. There are also times where my mouse loses tracking on this mouse pad and randomly jerks the cursor around, which I have never encountered with any other mouse pad before. I'm planning on ordering an amazon basics pad on my next order. Hopefully the couple of extra dollars means I won't get a stinky piece of trash.",

The top is still the same... provides the mouse (laser or ball style) excellent tracking.....not at all slippery or reflective at all. But the grip pad underneath is now made of a cheap/smooth black foam instead of thicker/heavy gel found on my older pads. The foam doesn't have the weight or coarseness to keep the pad totally level and firmly planted on the desk. Also, the bottom foam has a 'rubbery' odor that takes a few days to air out. In summary, the top is quality, the bottom is junk.",
