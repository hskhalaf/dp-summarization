With these shoes, I have the stability necessary to deliver a powerful punch/kick; am able to easily pivot - albeit due to hip rotation and/or a shift in position or footing; and can easily point my toe while performing kicks. Not to mention, these shoes are extremely light, there I am not compromising speed or power.",

He has large feet and there weren't any local stores that carried his size, these fit him well. He complained of bunching at the bottom, but once we tightened the laces for him properly, that issue went away. We are very pleased with our purchase!",
