NO support from Modaway customer service. They referred me to custom cushion companies to replace the cushions. I feel completely mislead and disappointed. This was the largest purchase I have ever made for our new home. It\u2019s going in the garbage. Now I have to spend more money to repair the rotted part of my lawn that\u2019s it\u2019s been sitting on. I\u2019m so very upset.",

The daybed units can be moved around for separate seating to accommodate a large group of visitors. Some of the cushions can be taken off to create a table area to put food trays on.
