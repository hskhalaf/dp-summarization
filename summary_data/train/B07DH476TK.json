      "verdict": "The Sole Fury SE comes from the distinctive family of split-soled sneakers, whose lineage dates back to the 1990s. As such, the sneaker inherits not only the classic chunky silhouette\u2014which turned many heads\u2014but also the exceptional comfort, support, and stability it delivers to the foot. All of which are cornerstone qualities of Reebok.However, a few have deemed the laces too long and felt the sizes ran slightly smaller. Even so, the Reebok Sole Fury SE still stands as a potential favorite sneaker, up for grabs at a budget-friendly price.",

        "Reebok Sole Fury SE reviewers are almost unanimous in regarding the sneaker as extremely comfortable to wear",

        "Its mesh upper is well-ventilated, a few users have noted",
        "Majority of shoppers are delighted by the sneaker\u2019s bold, eye-catching silhouette, with one describing it strikingly as \u201cin-your-face amazing!\u201d",
        "Its sleek style easily matches any sporty or casual look and even make the outfit look better, according to a handful of customers",

The men pair really aren't that much wider than the women pair. Can't say enough about how pleased I am with this purchase. They look as pictured/described.",
