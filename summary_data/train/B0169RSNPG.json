Hope to not have the same issues as with previous SwimP3, not being recognized by PC, stop working, not charging. The ear pods are much better than ear plug models\\ 5/17: as expected, and as happens with all their SwimP3's, it has now stopped working! After only 4 months. When it is operational, it is great. let's see if Finis customer sx is as reliable as has been in past and that they will replace it.",

I bought these after I was disappointed by the insert-in-ear-canal earbuds (poor seal against water, poor sound) and the waterproof iPod. This Duo Underwater MP3 Player works great, especially while my head is in the water (my head is out of the water only to breathe). I download podcasts on to my computer and transfer two weeks of material (six, one-hour shows) to the Duo. The Duo makes my hour-long swims go by quickly--no more boring swims!",

Overall, I'm relatively happy with this purchase.",

But after three months of usage, the wire inside is exposed where the cable is connected to the side part. It is frustrating because it is a product that's supposed to work in water. And I only swim twice a week at most. And I tried to protect it really well. I used some liquid electrical tape to kind of cover it up. However I really don't know how long it is going to last.",

I love this design over ear buds because every time I took a stroke the ear bud popped out. I spent more time adjusting than swimming. I don\u2019t spend anytime adjusting these. I have also used them in saltwater occasionally without any problems. I highly recommend this product.",
