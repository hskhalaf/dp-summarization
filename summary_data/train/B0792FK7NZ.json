If there's a better TV deal out there, I couldn't find it, and believe me, I looked long and hard. We're totally happy with this set.",

I also didn't want a 4k TV because unless it's over 55 inches you would have to sit really close to tell the difference, so if you are looking for a 50 inch TV, this is the best buy you could get, I am a diligent consumer.
