Got these because I like the black, grey, red color scheme. These boots will probably outlast me. Beware, they are very stiff, and the sole insert is not very comfortable. Purchase a good aftermarket pair of sole inserts, and these will be the best boots you've owned in a long time guaranteed.",

Less than a month after purchasing them and moderate wear, the stitching on seam on the inner left boot started to become frayed and undone. This damage allows dirt, gravel and other debris to enter the boot, which makes wearing the boot become quite uncomfortable. This damage also reduces the \"waterproofness\" of the boots. It looks like several other reviewers have had issues with quality, and given the potential lack of warranty on these boots, I recommend other buyers to not risk paying nearly $250 for a potentially defective product.",

One thing I will say is that these boots are not waterproof.

I've come across several people who had questions about the durability. Seems some had issues with the heel wearing fast. That hasn't been my experience. Using these in slot canyons has produced some extra wear but that's to be expected. Always try boots on with the socks you'll wear before you buy, but definitely give these a look.",
