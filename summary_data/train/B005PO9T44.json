Inside my car would probably kill you, when I open the door to get in on a day the heat coming out is like an oven, at least 100 degrees. I left this bottle inside my car for 2 DAYS. When I tested the water after the 2 days it was still nice and cold! I didn't even have to cool the bottle before hand, just poured cold water with NO ICE, into the bottle and done. Thats how good these bottles are.",

The locking lid means you can throw this into a backpack without worrying about spillage or leaks. For me, this makes all others travel mugs and thermoses obsolete - it\u2019s that well designed and conceived. It\u2019s well worth the money. 16 ounces is about right for me.",

This thermos will keep your coffee hot for an extremely long time; I haven't timed it out to see how long before it reaches room temperature, but I have gotten to work at 7:30 AM and the leftover coffee is still \"acceptably hot\" when I return from lunch at 12:30 PM. Just remember to keep the lid closed or it will cool off faster.",

I tried yeti lids and off brand lids with no luck. Fantastic cup , love the size, slender and not bulky and still fits 16oz. Would buy it again.",
