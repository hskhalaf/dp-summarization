I do prefer the microfiber tip stylus more because it seems to respond better. The microfiber tip stylus has a bigger head though so it's harder to be accurate on very small items.

The special feature is the two sizes of rubber tips, small (0.18\") on one end, and large (0.25\") on other, with a cap to cover either end you are not using. With plenty of extra tips, a bonus.

There is something about the tips that just don't work with my iphone and Kindle. I had to keep pressing the screen and pressing the screen for the stylus to make any type of connection. I tried all 4 stylus's and even switched out all the tips. I am sticking with my tiny stylus's at least they work and they come with a plug so that I can attach to my phone. These did come with any plugs. Very disappointed.",

I emailed the MekoTech, who generously sent a replacement 4-pack without making me go through the hassle of a return. The new pack contained the appropriate 4 styluses, but somehow two bags of fine tips and zero broad ones.

I'll be giving these away. Perhaps someone else will have better luck with them than I did. I've gone back to a fiber mesh tipped stylus, which works much better for me. Update - the company contacted me due to my original negative review posted above, and replaced the tips with a batch that is working extremely well. Highly recommended!",
