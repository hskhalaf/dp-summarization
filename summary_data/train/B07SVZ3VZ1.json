Get past that though and you have a reasonably priced pair of true wireless earbuds that deliver good sound and work well with video content. Call quality is a problem, as the audio doesn\u2019t really pass muster, but for running, at the gym or just general everyday use the Vervebuds 200 have much to offer.",

The sound quality isn\u2019t bad at all; it doesn\u2019t quite have the range or the depth of more expensive buds, but is clear and sharp, and has reasonable bass. I like these a lot.",

Although the design is good with a cool charging case that doubles up as somewhere to store them, and the buds themselves look ok when wearing them, they have really tinny sound with hardly any bass. It\u2019s like listening to the radio on one of those old cheap stereos from the 90s. The buds also are not too secure in your ears. Walking is ok but anything more active like running or other fitness then forget it. I when for a short jog with these in and really thought I was going to lose one as they were constantly coming loose.",
