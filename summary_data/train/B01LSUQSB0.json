It is NOT good for short bangs. 3. It works great however....your hair gets very very hot to the touch. 4. You really need it on the high heat setting to get the full smooth blow out look. 5. I wash my hair twice a week. I would NOT use this twice a week...I can see it doing some damage. If you have somewhere special to go or photos etc etc...YES this is amazing!!!

I usually have to dry my hair with a hair dryer and flat iron because of frizz. I used this and didn\u2019t have to even plug in the flat iron! Lots of body but no frizz! The handle is a bit bulky and it dies get very hot but so does a flat iron. None the less worth it for me!!",

Just be careful not to pull too hard when using the brush dryer as (I find) more of my hair comes loose than in the past. Be aware humidity will ultimately win and in a couple of days (I wash my hair approximately every four days) it will lose that smooth look and try its best to return to growing bush. Ample conditioner and good leave-in products are still necessary.",
