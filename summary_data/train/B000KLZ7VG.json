      "text": "I've owned these headphones for 7 years and have taken them on every work trip, road trip, gym workout - you name it. These are my go-to headphones on the go. Still using original ear pieces, and they sound great. Yesterday, I found them in the washer after running a load of laundry. They went through the entire wash cycle. I let them dry out and plugged them into my phone today, and they still work as good as ever. Unbelievable! Was so ecstatic, here I am writing a review 7 years later to say that Bose clearly knows how to make a great product!",

I ended up using my old sony earphones... I don't even know why Bose thinks these are superior to the in-ear headphones available. my Apple in-ear earphones are the same quality if not better. so... $99? NO WAY... and I'm a music minor. I listen to a lot of music, live music..recorded music.. and these just aren't up to par with my standards. the regular $200+ headphones bose makes are outstanding..but these aren't at all!",

The comfort, quality, and durability are all great. The onl qualms i have with the product is that the rubber pieces fall off pretty easily. If you get hit even lightly or tug on them the wrong way the rubber parts will fall off and are easily lost. Just keep that in mind. But that pales in comparison to how great these are for general usage. Music sounds phenomenal and even computer games sound great with them. Buy these, you wont regret it.",

Like I had the midrange cranked up to the point of blaring, the treble turned off and the bass at normal. Very aggravating for this price. I'd accept this from a $30 Sony. Even the smallest size adapter is too large to stay in my ear. I wish I could return them for a refund and buy some more Shure earbuds. Guess the Bose in my car is in no way comparable to the average over the counter (probably outsourced) consumer product.",

The \"bad\" is that none of the three removable tip sizes are comfortable in the ears. The \"ugly\" is that the latter become easily detached and adrift and that the only way to cure \"hide-and-seek\" is to cement on the best fitting size, causing maintenance/cleaning issues. Worth $100? Absolutely not. Even worth the $30 I paid? No.",
