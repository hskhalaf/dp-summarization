      "text": "I didn't want to spend a lot on my son's first ever 1st base mitt so I gambled on this. Truly a great mitt and could easily go for more money. It broke in fairly quickly and is a pretty big glove but light enough for a 9+ year old to handle. I have 20+ year old Rawlings, Wilson and Nokona mitts and I don't believe this will last that long as the leather broke in too quickly to be good quality leather but he should get a solid few years out of it. Highly recommend this for a young player.",

His first mitt lasted a little longer than 2 little league seasons and some tournaments. I'm not quite sure it is 80/20 broken in. Still needs to be worked in but definitely less than others. This also means that this mitt has worn down faster than an A2000. The leather isn't as high a quality. This mitt is good for the price, though. If he decides to remain a catcher into high school we will invest in a better quality mitt but for now it's doing what we need it to.",

It\u2019s not a \u201cprofessional grade\u201d leather, but IMO youth league kids won\u2019t see the benifits of a high quality leather. They will out grow the glove before it breaks down. Break-in time was quick due to the softer leather, and the low price tag made it easy to give it a shot. Very happy with our choice.",
