Opened the package and was impressed by the heft of the slicer and figured it would make short work of our potatoes and sweet potatoes. It didn't have any problem with a russet potato, but totally locked up with a sweet potato. Now the slicer is bent and shards of metal are embedded in the potatoes. Do NOT BUY this. I doubt I will be able to get my money back, but will update my review if the company actually stands behind their product.",
