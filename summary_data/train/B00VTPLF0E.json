I used to literally stink to the point that if I was away from home I had to wash my armpits wherever I was. (of course I take showers before leaving home). What I do now is I take a shower, then I spray alcohol mixed with white vinegar and then apply FATCO Stank Stop deodorant, and my life changed!! I have been using it for the last month and It has been working perfectly. I hope it continues forever!!!",

I sweat a lot, but somehow when I wear this, I don't smell bad! The scent is very mild, and it does't leave any residue. I have tried almost every other natural deodorant out there, but nothing compares to this!",

This is not an antiperspirant, which I still need, but it does stop the smell. The jar is tiny, but you only need a pea sized amount to do it\u2019s job. And it\u2019s not just for the underarms. It\u2019s good for any place that gets a little stanky.",

I do need to say that I make my own deodorant but wanted to try this for when I run out and don't have time to make a new batch. I've never had the older formula, but from the reviews it sounds like I would have liked that version. It's not a bad for those who don't care about all of the ingredients and aren't used to coconut oil based deodorants that rub into your skin and are barely there.",
