      "text": "Used these candles in 3 glass hurricane candle holders during a wedding & following reception. The candles burned perfectly for the occasion & were beautiful. They did not drip, did not smoke & burned evenly. I had experienced using regular candles during a wedding (big mistake) which dripped on church carpet & consequently I had to iron & wipe wax out of the carpet. A real time consuming pain. These candles did not show any signs of smoking soot & the glass hurricanes shined the whole event. Very reliable candles. I highly recommend them & am thankful I found them.",
