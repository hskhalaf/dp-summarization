The only solution I could think of was to cut a straight line where the window used to be. I thought I'd be at it four hours, but this tool cut a dead straight line through the concrete in about 15 minutes. Bought an extra blade thinking I'd need it, but the one blade did the job without showing any sign of wear. Very impressed. I have other DeWalt tools and their quality is excellent, but this really exceeded my expectations especially based on the price.",

For anyone wondering the grinder model that comes in this is the DWE402 that has no ground on plug, does have the \"lock on\" button even though the picture shows the DWE402n (no \"lock on\" button on the side). I like the guard mechanism that let's you adjust it to multiple positions. Most reasons I took the guards off was how much work it took to adjust the position if the guard. This makes it simple to do with no tools in seconds. Time will tell on longevity and will update if my view changes.",

For what it's worth, I only use DeWalt accessories figuring if they make it for it, it's probably appropriate.

      "text": "I had never used a small grinder before, but needed one to get rid of a very small tree trunk. This DeWalt 4 1/2\" grinder worked perfectly, although its rather shallow depth of cut simply meant that I needed more time to go back and forth over the stump to finally get it below ground level. It's a very handy tool to have in my shop.",
