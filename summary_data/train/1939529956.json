I bought 3 plan books but this one had the best two week menu plan that made it easy to try a whole new way of eating. We have tried probably 20 new menu items and for a person that is steeped in comfort foods I must say I am impressed with the taste , texture and the preparation guides of this book. I highly recommend it.",
