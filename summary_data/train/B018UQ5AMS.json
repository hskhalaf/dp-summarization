Brewing is about the same (which I like). BUT, about 20% of the time, this doesn't work at all. The pump (I guess) makes noise and either doesn't do anything or brews a few drops only. The problem didn't start until after a few months, but I wish I still had my old one. Truth is, I'd seen other reviewers saying the same thing, but I hoped for the best - wish I'd listened.

When it does work, it'll make noises for 3 minutes before it begins to brew and often will brew less than a 1/3 of a cup. Total garbage and $90 down the drain.

However with that said, I have found this basic model to be unreliable. There is something not quite right with the water pumping mechanism that gets the water from the reservoir into the machine so it can heat and dispense into the cup. Only after removing and resetting the water reservoir numerous times can I get it to work properly which is quite frustrating when you just want a quick cup of coffee to start your day. In addition it is quite noisy when operating.",

I thought maybe that's what I got for trying to save a few bucks buying a used one. So I bought a new one here. It too broke down after 4 months. I didn't want to go through the hassle of trying to use the warranty, packaging (I hadn't kept the original packaging) and mailing the thing. Two failures in less than a year was enough to convince me Keurig has quality control problems. Bought a simple Chulux, and it chugs along just fine. No \"well\" or programming, but that means fewer things to go wrong",

This one is totally plastic, and while much brighter red......and quieter.......I am doubting it will last as long as it is totally plastic. It only makes 3 sizes and the overfill that the cup sits on will surely not hold the largest size cup ( when you forget to put the cup under to catch Your coffee.)",
