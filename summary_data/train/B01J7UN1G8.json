This is a great deal, I had to pull up the invoice when the sales guy at Best Buy tried to sell me a really poor quality bag for $150.00+ and refused to believe my when I told him about this one!",

I may still use the waterproof case on canoe trips or something, but this is my go-to method for transporting the P4P for sure. The material doesn't seem that rugged, but so far the workmanship is great - no signs of wear or defects, and I've lugged it around quite a bit.",

Pack is very comfortable to wear, has both shoulder and a belt strep. With the Phantom 4 case inside it also will stand upright on its own. For the price on this one you cannot beat it, works for me both as a regular storage pack and for transport when I am hiking to an area to fly.",

It is basically a nylon bag which in fact was folded up into a small plastic bag when it arrived. This product should really be priced around $20. The phantom 4 pro fit into the bag nicely but you need to pull it around the styrofoam case the P4Pro came in like a skin. The pockets for batteries at the top are just Velcro dividers and do not firmly hold the batteries. It is fine for what it is but again, I feel it is overpriced (as many of these bags/backpacks are).",

      "text": "Awesome pack. Great idea to use the existing foam container that my P4 shipped in. Having the extra pockets just makes it that much more useful. The only thing I would suggest, is add even more pockets. there is a large one on the front part that zips around your foam case, but there seems room to add maybe an additional pocket above it.. maybe something like a smaller pen pocket, or something with dividers for smaller items such as filters, SD card packs etc.",
