I\u2019m running store bought kerosene and no complaints there. One downside compared to pro temp was my old one had the pressure gauge built in from factory, this one you have to add in. Other thing I haven\u2019t tested is the built in thermostat, not sure how accurate it is, there is no temperature rating on the thermostat it\u2019s just more or less heat. Overall happy",

I made a bad choice on my first replacement heater (too big and too noisy), so I did some more research and settled on this DeWalt heater. Going on 1 year later and I've had no problems. Yes, the noise level is a bit higher given the 10k BTU increase for this heater over my old heater, but it isn't bad. I highly recommend this DeWalt heater.",
