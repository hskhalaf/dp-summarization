Pros - hasn't rusted even a little after tons of washes and use fits standard muffin cups nicely muffins and cupcakes both rise nicely stacks well for storage cons - The edge is very narrow and hard to grab to pull out of the oven To make that issue worse the material does not slide easily out of the oven. We have many pans from many brands, but this particular one has a lot of friction with the oven grate that other pans don't have.",

The Bad: They're shiny aluminum which reflects heat, so my 14 minute cupcakes now take 16-17 minutes to cook. Lastly, since they're aluminum they can dent if not handled with a bit of care. The Verdict: For under $12, you won't find a better value. Period. I've searched high and low for shiny cupcake pans to avoid crispy cupcakes and these are the real deal.",
