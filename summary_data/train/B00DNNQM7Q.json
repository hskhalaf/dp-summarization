Not sure how/why there are so many reviews of them being \"too small\" BUT sprint spikes should fit snuggly without cramping your toes. You do not want any excess room in your spikes. Having too much room will cause you to lose power and speed when you race. I am a size 9 and I ordered a size 9 -They fit as spikes are expected to fit. They are light weight and for $30.00 I can't complain. Love the colors!",
