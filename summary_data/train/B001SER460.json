I've dropped it, squashed it, crammed it into my purse with keys and stuff crashing into it, still looks like new. I've taken it horseback riding, parasailing, snorkeling, and let my kids play with it :) But probably the BEST testament for this camera is that I purchased one for my mother in law the Christmas before I bought mine, and hers is still going strong too. I love my MIL, but until I got the D10 for her, she managed to break every camera I gave her. Solid product :)",

      "text": "I have used this camera for years now. I bought it to do a photo shoot underwater when I was pregnant. I had it for almost 7 years now. We are a very active family in the water during the summer. It always does a good job with underwater photos, That is if the water is clear. But that has nothing to do with camera. One of the best things that I love about this Canon PowerShot D10 12.1 MP Waterproof Digital camera is the wrist strap. It is perfect to be able to swim with and not worrying about holding on to it the whole time.",

They jumble around in her purse, get dropped, wet, dirty, and its not long till they die. Not this bad boy. It doesn't have the best sensor or autofocus available today, but at least it works and takes sharp pictures after trips to the beach, being dropped a dozen times, getting caught in the rain, or having drinks spilled on it. HIGHLY recommended camera for kids, or reckless adults. There is a reason they've been making this camera for like 5 years, while all the other models change with the moons. IT'S A TANK!",

Sadly, even with a lot of people who seem to get it, and even pc world doing an article about it, canon refuses to do anything about it. I know have a $250+ paperweight. Will not buy another canon again. I may return the one I just bought for a friend for Christmas and get him a different one. Wish I would have known about this last year.",

The waterproof factor is excellent. As suggested in the accompanying manual, I soaked the camera for a couple of hours every night after using in salt water/sand conditions.

Underwater pictures totally blow away disposable cameras. Not tough to use, although other programs are better to unload pictures than the one Canon provides. If you're moving a lot while taking pictures, they can come out blurry. The reason this isn't a five star review is because there is simply a glass protective cover over the lens, and it's really easy to smudge. I dread the day it gets scratched.",

He kept spraying everyone whether they wanted him to or not. I had him spray me while I took his picture and it turned out incredible! How many other cameras would you encourage a child to shoot a water gun at? I have played with all of the different settings and have really been impressed with the way the pictures turn out. I am looking forward to taking this camera diving in a few weeks! Definitely recommend this one!",

I was able to get it to work again by careful tapping that seemed to free up the lense. Bottom line, I returned it and Amazon was cooperative and then purchased a waterproof Panasonic that I am as delighted with as I was disappointed with this unit, Form factor of Panasonic is superior as well and far far less bulky.",

It also took great shots on land, at the beach in full sun and even overcast. It is oddly shaped, but not unbearably so. Easy to charge the battery and the functions are pretty simple.",

    "title": "Canon PowerShot D10 12.1 MP Waterproof Digital Camera with 3x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.5-Inch LCD (OLD MODEL)",
    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nFor those with a taste for adventure, there\u2019s a camera as bold as the active life you lead. It\u2019s the Canon PowerShot D10. Waterproof, freeze-proof and shockproof; it\u2019s tough enough to take what you dish out. Plus it\u2019s got all the high performance features you expect from a Canon digital camera. You\u2019ve got 12.1 megapixels of resolution plus all of Canon\u2019s powerful, state of the art imaging technologies so you can capture your epic experiences in breathtaking color and awesome detail. \n\nPowerShot D10 Highlights \n\nTake this camera anywhere: waterproof, cold resistant and shockproof\nLife can take you almost anywhere. So Canon engineered a digital camera durable enough to go where you go and produce the kind of awe-inspiring images that will earn your respect. It\u2019s the PowerShot D10 and it's no ordinary digital camera. This unique camera is waterproof down to 33 feet so you can take it scuba diving, snorkeling or surfing. It\u2019s freeze proof and can withstand extremes of temperature from 14-104 degrees (F) so it\u2019s also ideal for snowboarding, mountaineering and more. Plus, it\u2019s shockproof to 4 feet, so when the going gets rough, the D10 will keep going strong.\n\n\n\nUnique accessories available such as customized straps and interchangeable faceplates\nYou\u2019re always up for any challenge. So Canon designed the PowerShot D10 with a selection of versatile accessories (sold separately) that enable you to outfit the camera to meet the requirements of your next adventure. The customized strap is a perfect choice for those who want to have their camera within easy reach, yet keep their hands free. The Canon faceplates let you distinctively mark the camera as belonging to you alone. The carabiner hook offers you a handy way to securely suspend the D10 from a belt, backpack or diving harness. \n\nA World of Advantages with Canon\u2019s Technology \n\nDIGIC 4 Image Processor has evolved Face Detection Technology that tracks the faces of moving subjects and lets the shooter enter the frame seamlessly with the Face Detection Self-Timer. \n\nDIGIC 4 Image Processor \nCanon\u2019s most advanced image processor, DIGIC 4, delivers evolved Face Detection Technology that keeps every face in every photo looking its very best. The technology finds and tracks the faces of moving subjects until you\u2019re ready to shoot, then delivers perfect focus. In addition, exposure, flash and white balance are compensated, so that faces exhibit natural skin tones and backgrounds are properly exposed. \n\niSAPS Technology is an entirely original scene-recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos, iSAPS works with the advanced DIGIC 4 image processor to improve focus speed and accuracy, as well as exposure and white balance. \n\nA Face Detection Self-Timer automatically detects an increase in the number of faces and makes the appropriate adjustments. For instance, to include the photographer\u2019s face in a group shot, there\u2019s no need to rush in. Just put the camera on a stand or tripod, specify Face Detection Self-Timer, and the camera will wait for the photographer\u2019s face to get on-camera before it takes the shot. Motion Detection tracks moving subjects in a much larger range--allowing you to wait for the perfect shot without refocusing. \n\nIntelligent Contrast Correction\nDIGIC 4 also makes possible the i-Contrast (Intelligent Contrast Correction) system, which controls the compensation level in pixel units to brighten dark areas while leaving bright areas unchanged for better images where the main subject is dark, and more natural transition. The PowerShot D10 can even use i-Contrast in playback mode to adjust images that were shot without the setting activated. \n\nRed-eye Correction provides three options for removing red-eye from subjects in flash pictures.\n1) Red-eye Correction during shooting actually identifies and corrects red-eye in human subjects as pictures are taken.\n2) The PowerShot D10 can be set to automatically detect and correct red-eye during image playback.\n3) You can manually locate any red eyes in a scene during image playback on the LCD screen, and command the camera to remove them. \n\nLife doesn\u2019t give you second chances to capture special times. That\u2019s why the PowerShot D10 features ISO 1600 setting that reduces the effects of camera shake and sharpens subjects in low-light situations, giving you greater shooting flexibility. ISO can be expanded to 3200 when you select ISO 3200 Special Scene mode. \n\n12.1 megapixels, plus 3x optical zoom lens with Optical Image Stabilizer\nWith the PowerShot D10, dramatic, personal pictures have never been easier to shoot and share. This 12.1-megapixel camera lets you create impressively large photos of family and friends you\u2019ll be proud to display. The high-resolution images taken by the D10 can be enlarged up to 13 x 19 inches. \n\nThe PowerShot D10 has a 3x optical zoom that gives you the power to shoot distant subjects with razor-sharp precision and stunning lifelike color. \n\nThe PowerShot D10 is equipped with Canon\u2019s acclaimed Optical Image Stabilizer Technology that automatically detects and corrects camera shake--one of the leading causes of fuzzy or blurred shots. Even when zoomed in, you can get the steady, crisp, brilliant images you\u2019ll be proud to shoot and share. And Canon\u2019s Optical Image Stabilizer Technology is so convenient to use. It functions perfectly with or without a flash. \n\nBlink Detection\nNothing ruins a great picture more than having your subjects\u2019 eyes closed. That\u2019s why the PowerShot D10 is equipped with Blink Detection. If closed eyes are detected, a \"blink warning\" icon appears for 3 seconds, allowing you to retake the shot before your subject or subjects move on. Blink Detection provides you with extra assurance when capturing once-in-a-lifetime moments like planting the flag at the summit of the mountain. \n\nSmart AUTO intelligently selects the proper settings\nJust set the Canon PowerShot D10 to Smart AUTO and you\u2019re ready for maximum enjoyment from your picture taking every time. It\u2019s a relaxing and satisfying way to shoot because you can completely concentrate on your subject knowing that the camera has the technical details covered. Advanced Canon technology intelligently analyzes your situation and shooting conditions. Then it automatically selects an appropriate setting from 18 specially defined settings. So whether you\u2019re photographing flowers, a captivating sunset, or your friends at the park, you can be confident that you\u2019re getting dramatic, memorable images. \n\n\n\nShooting Modes \nAdvanced presets for the best possible photos under certain conditions. With 19 Shooting Modes including 16 Special Scene Modes, you\u2019re ready for whatever shot comes your way \n\nWhat's in the Box\n\n * PowerShot D10 body \n * Lithium-ion battery pack (NB-6L) \n * Battery charger (CB-2LY) \n * Wrist strap (WS-DC7) \n * Digital Camera Solution CD-ROM \n * USB interface cable (IFC-400PCU) \n * AV cable (AVC-DC400)",
