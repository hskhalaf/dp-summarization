I feel good about using this product on my daughters. However, I wish there was an alternative to the plastic packaging that is used in liquid soaps. I'm migrating to shampoo bars instead, which are often just wrapped in paper. Without the plastic bottle, I love this product. Smells great, lathers well, doesn't irritate baby's skin.",

My son always smells nice right after his bath. However, we live in a pretty hot part of the country and my son sweats a lot. The vanilla tangerine, combined with sweaty toddler, is not a good combination. I like this soap but won't be buying it again because of the scent.",

I live in a hot climate, so that probably accelerates the process, but I also use it twice a day on three girls (two with long, thick hair) and I can't finish a bottle before it starts to smell off.
