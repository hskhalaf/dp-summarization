Print quality is not on the level of a laser printer but it is very good for it's size. The printer ink cartridges are tiny but I guess I shouldn't have been surprised. The printer is also fairly rugged. It has bounced around in my computer bag for the past month with no problems. All things considered, this was a great purchase and it has served very well as a portable printer. I would definitely recommend it.",

This one fits the bill. It's quite compact and produces perfectly satisfactory prints. I've made a couple of photo prints (which are surprisingly good), but I use it principally for text. I don't know yet how economical it will be (cost of ink cartridges), but there simply aren't many portable printers that will produce full letter size prints as this one does. I'm very satisfied with the iP90v.",
