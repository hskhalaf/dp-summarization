You must register the code to a Steam account (included in the case) and, if you choose, install a portion of the game from the disc or fully install it from Steam. Makes no difference which way you do it. The game is marked up to $40, so buying it cheap physical may be a better option in some cases. Or just wait til its on sale.",
