Comes with a single shot trigger which makes me thing it is geared more to the novice but it does include a red trigger for holding down and nailing.",

I'm using Metabo branded nails (avail. @ Lowes) I've loaded single nails, doubles and triples in it and it fires everything without jamming.

Either the nailer is so tough it doesn't need protection or, the manufacturer's attention to detail is poor. Time and lots of nails will tell. I'm sure not having a tool case is my error.

If I were a pro, this gun is just not reliable enough. It occasionally jams. If the nails are not put into the hopper perfectly, with the heads overlapping each other in a specific way, it will jam or not work. Sometimes it double taps a nail and jams. When building the fence I borrowed a neighbors Hitachi gun and it has none of these problems, but it is much more expensive. Even so, none of these problems detract from the fact that this is the best DIY nailer out there.",

Not sure if that was a factor of the nails or the gun but not a bad number for the volume. Only other issue i had was mis-fires seemed to come in bunches where the pin would go but no nail. Was a combination of needing to adjust the air hose and possibly the nails being stuck. Not a huge issue. This was a big help and I can't imagine hand nailing again.",

They're about the same size and weight unless it's a specialized compact or battery powered model. This is the size a framing gun is. It works the same as a Milwaukee! At more than half the price. Put the oil that is included in the air inlet every 2 or 3rd time of use. This keeps it rust-free and well lubed. This is with any \"air tool\".",

The one thing i would improve is the head of the nail gun to make it easier for the user to know precisely the point the nail will hit the wood for better toe-nailing because currently where the large circular head touches the wood it makes you guess. I would recommend this.",
