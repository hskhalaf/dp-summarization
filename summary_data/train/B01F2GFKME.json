My last one kept collapsing if one of my bigger dogs stood on it. The others didn't reach all the way to the back of the seat. I have a Subaru Forrester and it fits perfectly from one side of the car to the other. So glad I finally got this new one!",

I thought this would be a good \"bridge\" to cover the area between my folded-down back seat in my Subaru Outback and the front seats so the the sleeping deck could be extended for car camping. I think it will do okay for this purpose. What i don't like: that \"pocket\" that goes between the seats has to be on the top, so there's that. Otherwise here's the positive: super-easy installation, I mean 15 minutes for 1 person (me). If I had dogs, it would be superb for its stated purpose, no doubt. So, if you have dogs, I recommend getting it!",

My dog is so much more comfortable now that he doesn't keep falling into the space between the seats. And the strap that comes around the driver seat doesn't bother me at all.",

I've paired this extender with the hammock cover and it's worked really well. I put the extender in first, then a layer of that plastic carpet liner stuff for some traction, then the hammock cover.",

He is able to relax, stretch out and obviously feels secure now that he has a stable base under him. i have incorporated this product and a hammock that allows him to do the above. Prior to the pet bridge purchase i had the same hammock but he never would remain still and always seemed anxious. thank you for this product and i have recommended it to my friends",
