I'm a wide size 9 with a high arch & muscular calves these boots fit perfect with a gel insert & a separate arch support. The buckle & elastic gives enough room around the top for think long johns & jeans. Some of the reviews say the boots cracked after wearing the 1st or 2nd time- can definitely see this being a problem if step on the heels to remove them. Also, these boots are all rubber & will crack over time if left out in direct sun or in extreme heat. Definitely a great deal for these cute rain boots!",
