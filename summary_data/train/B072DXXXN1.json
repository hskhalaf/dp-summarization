      "text": "My use case for the DPT-RP1 is academic; research papers, company reports, etc. . I ordered both the Sony Digital Paper and the Remarkable. I returned the Remarkable. The key advantages of the Sony are: view two documents side-by-side; have a digital notepad displayed beside a PDF to record notes on (or solve a pset); no need for a wifi connection to sync documents (can be done via wifi, bluetooth, or cable); more reliable software suite; erase/highlight quickly via dedicated buttons on the pen instead of having to switch tools via a multi-step process. The Remarkable has two advantages: slightly better writing experience (Remarkable: 9/10 ; Sony: 8/10), buttons so you need not touch the screen with your hands (fingerprints).",

I spoke with Sony and they are aware of the issue as it is happening with a lot of customers after a couple years. They unfortunately aren't willing to offer any extended warranty coverage for this known issue. I tried the recommended software reset multiple times without any luck so it must be a faulty hardware issue. I used to recommended this product, but certainly can't anymore. $700 is way too much to pay for something that is known to breakdown after a couple years. Truly unfortunate because it was great while it lasted.",

This is a serious design flaw and I am going to be forced to return this otherwise wonderful device. If they had an improved stylus with a removable end that would allow the broken tips to be removed I would consider keeping the device, but as it stands this is untenable.",

Its staff member Mr. Stephenson, contacted me and provided assistance shortly after they learnt my problem. I really appreciate it.",

It\u2019s supposed to be portable, but I\u2019m afraid to put it in my bag even with a case because it might break (something might poke the screen, or it might get bent).

My only disappointment was that the case I ordered at the same time I ordered the rp1 was not delivered because it was out-of-stock; this seems implausible as B&H has them in stock.",
