Phone looks ok, the display is not that bad for a mid range phone. Phone runs smooth just a little lag every now and then nothing major. Disappointed in the camera especially the front facing camera which is suppose to be 5mp dont expect any good selfies from this its really terrible. Annoyed outta this world with the chinese apps, even blinkfeed was in chinese had to turn it off could not change it to english at all.",
