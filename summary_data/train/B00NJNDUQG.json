Well, you better look for nvidia shield, nexus 9 or dell venue 8 7000 series. This is a budget device. A lot of reviews are right about lag. You should deactivate some items in Google account sincronization in order to have a decent performance. And also deactivate animations. This is better for a second device not expected to use Gmail. I use mine with fire tv stick and miracast function to view my media content on my tv. Such as FHD movies. I am using Kodi (former XBMC) to view all movies. This was the reason to buy this device.",

Dell released a firmware upgrade. Awesome. Just don't use a custom launcher or google chrome browser and you're good to go. I use dolphin browser and its great. Full HD screen is beautiful. Camera is ok. Sound is hood. Thin. Well built. For $103 its a steal. Disable the bloatware. And get auto ram booster.",

Have used other dell equipment in the past, so really surprised how poor this device is. Not sure if it is because it is an intel processor vs arm, if it is because of the reduced RAM or what but Dell as really produced a loser. Bought the 7\" as well and although it performs slightly better it is still very laggy.",

Don't tell Dell though or they might start charging more. I recommend this tab for anyone.",
