The only thing bad is that if one dog goes behind you, you are the one that gets caught up in the tangle. You get tripped on one leash or end up in the middle of a wrap. You have to control the dogs, tell them to stop moving so you can untangle from them or put the whole thing on the ground to step out of the middle. If not it just looks like a three stooges routine. Someone with a video camera could win money.. hey I'm taking my camera next time.",

But with this dual leash I can firmly walk, jog or even run with them without worrying about their leashes getting tangled again.

We both like it as she doesn't choke and I don't stumble.

      "text": "This product is a must have if you have multiple dogs. I did not expect to love it as much as I do! I love that there is a short length and long length option making it very versatile. This is perfect for walking on trails or to hook them up while hanging out at a campsite/unfenced area. They can both relax on the leash and I dont have to constantly untangle them. This leash is high quality, durable, and allows easy control when walking my 60 and 80 lb babies. I HIGHLY recommend this product!",

This leash allows them to walk together at slightly different paces and stop and smell separately without any difficulty at all. The best thing about it is the bungee which eliminates the pulling. If the dog pulls, the bungee bounces them back a bit to adjust their pace.",
