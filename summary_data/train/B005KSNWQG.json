In addition, my large dog has always been a picky eater but he loves this food, cleaning his bowl quickly instead of leaving the food sitting. His excessive flatulence has also been helped by this food, as has his itchiness. Over the years I have fed my dogs the high priced \"premium\" foods but I will be sticking with this Purina formula from now on.",
