(-1 star) So I searched the net for pdf instructions. There is no such thing. And barely a website for this company. However, I looked up Kanto, watched one of their videos on how to put their model together. It was the exact same thing with the same parts. Once I figured out how to put this stand together I have no complaints with it. Seems solid enough so far.",

Box was missing 3 wheels, ALL documentation. ALL fastener hardware, telescoping poles, TV brackets, AV Shelf, Media Shelf and countless other parts. This is the worst scenario I've ever seen and for Amazon to let this even leave their warehouse is ridiculous at best.",

I will say that there is no good reason that the tray is made of plastic. The rest of the unit is aluminum - including the (somewhat flimsy and very annoying mount arms for the tray). The tray should also have been aluminum for added sturdiness. Instead they used cheap, finger-print prone plastic.",

Don't touch the tray to move things or it comes off completely, only held on by two plastics bushings that 'push' into place, no screws, etc. Also tray is plastic and the arms supporting are not as strong as one might expect given the heavy duty nature of the rest of the cart. Rolls easy, overall a darn good buy at $100, way overpriced at the original price.",

I am using it to hold a TV for watching while I am on a bicycle stationary trainer, so I wanted the TV to be level at least with my eyes while sitting up on a bike seat. This works perfectly.
