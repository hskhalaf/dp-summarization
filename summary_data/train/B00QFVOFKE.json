Otherwise, like me, you have to run down to the hardware store to get either 1.25 or 2.25\" screws for it to fit. I have 22 pieces and I had to buy separate screws and washers to make it fit. What came with it was useless. So just be aware of this.",

Piece of advice when installing them.....make sure when you tighten the screws that the \"brushed\" part of the nickel is installed the same direction on all the knobs. They catch the light very well, and the brushed ridges disperses the light in such a manner that they will look a little off if not installed running the same direction. Your best bet is to run the brush marks up and down vertically. Running them horizontally makes them look a little oblong or \"out of round.\"",

I wasn't able to sell it because of the missing knob, so getting this knob for sub $2 and getting $20 extra in return for my nightstand was totally worth it.",

I have two-toned cabinets with a gray on the bottom and off-white on the top. Both look great with these knobs. I did have to buy the extender screws that you can break to every quarter of an inch for my drawers, but I believe that would have been the case no matter which knobs I purchased. After 5 months of installation, knobs still look new. Highly recommend to anyone to update their cabinetry.",

Installation had a catch that these come with only 1\" screws and in my case I needed 1.5\" so I had to go to Home Depot for that and spend $5 for a 100 screw box which is more than I need. Ignoring that small aspect, I like these knobs. They look good, they are not light, the quality looks good and sturdy. I would recommend these.",

I'm also hoping to replace my appliances with stainless steel....so now the knobs on the drawers and cabinets look so much better. The box of 25 left me with just a few extras!!! THANKS!!",

I can't comment on the screws not fitting like others did here because I reused the existing screws from the old knobs, but I can say that every single knob was properly threaded.
