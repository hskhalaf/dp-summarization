This canister has three positions on the top, one sets to a Food Saver model, second position is for all other machines an then the third position close and storage. Have used this a few times now , have really enjoyed the salmon I have marinated. It's a good purchase and very pleased with its performance.",

Since I am single many vegetables were spoiling on me just lying in the refrigerator crisper,even in ziplocs. And using the FoodSaver bags are a bit of a hassle. I bought the Tila and it does the trick. No offence to quiche lovers! I had it once in the early 80's and actully liked it. Let's see was it Quiche Lorraine, or Lorraine that served me quiche?",
