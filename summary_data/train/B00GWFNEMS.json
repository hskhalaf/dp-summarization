I am not sure whether I like the plastic buckles and wonder if they will last very long. My old pair had leather and cloth/belt that was easy to tighten and hold. That is the only reason I gave it 4 stars. So far they are working out great. We hike at least 3 to 5 miles at a time into the wilderness so need them to hold up.",

I replaced the missing rivet with two washers and a nut & screw and it is fixed. For the price & amount of use I put them through, they are a terrific bargain.",

We did that in our living room and then, once in the park, just had to put the foot in and tighten the clamp. This can be done with one hand and gloves on. Release is also a one-handed operation and very quick. Walking is very comfortable, since the foot is on a hinge and can turn easily, just like walking normally.",
