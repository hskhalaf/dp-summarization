      "text": "Sourcing and cooking heart is a pain in the butt for me, but I do appreciate the nutritional value of consuming heart (and nose to tail in general) on a regular basis. This is a super easy way to cover my nutritional bases while eating a mostly muscle meat diet. Heart is a great source of COQ10 and I believe that I am supporting my own heart by consuming the heart of a healthy animal. Easy to swallow pills, no chalky burp-ups or burning in throat feeling I would get from taking a bunch of synthetic vitamin pills.",
