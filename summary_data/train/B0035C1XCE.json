As the packaging says, the two included cutting tips are good for a large variety of materials. The black blade is intended for steel, copper, aluminum, and plastic. The packaging states the silver blade is meant for brass and cast iron, but I cant imagine why it wouldn't also work on plastic. Shank on the included blades is 3.15mm and the detent is 2.08mm. Replacement blades are super cheap, I can see this tool lasting for many years.",

These deburring tools are so easy to use that once you own one, you will wonder how you managed before. I use them for just about everything except for wood.

I'll keep this tool around for that special piece that needs the right tool for the job but for now it remains in my tool box. Good product though and will not dull. I used on a LOT of metal components and it is still very sharp... unlike the hobby knives which I have to buy in bulk.",
