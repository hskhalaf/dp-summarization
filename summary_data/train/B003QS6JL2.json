The fleas pop up on the fur when you spray it, making them visible and easy to comb out with a flea comb but it does not kill fleas at all. It is mainly a temporary flea stunner. Also, since you reapply it to the dogs, their coat gets kind of messy and you will have to wash them more often.",

I have actually sprayed a tick full of this stuff and left it in a ziploc bag - and sure enough, it died =)",

I must say that the bottle came open and half of the formula was about wasted. Hopefully they get back to me on that. Besides that, great product!",

I could see the fleas and eggs on her bed., I soaked my poor dog in the tub sometimes 2\u00d7 day (without shampoo) They were coming out like crazy, about 50 fleas with each bath, definitely was helping but not enough. Decided to buy flea & tick home spray. Put my dog in the bathroom, followed directions and buum! they were falling on the floor, more and more were coming out! I highly recommend this product. It works!! Smell is not bad, strong but totally worth it.",

I should have returned this product for a full refund. However, it is nearly impossible to reseal these toxins in the bottle, without likely spilling the fluids all over the packaging. Amazon should classify this product as 'food/spoilage item' and not require returning it, yet issuing a full courtesy refund. I hope someone at Amazon is reading this/listening. I ask for a full refund. Thanks",

I think the problem is that it washes off too quickly, and safe for pets is not strong enough for the critters. Having said all that, it is still better than nothing.",
