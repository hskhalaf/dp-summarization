The handle is somewhat flexible, so it has a bit of give which allows you to angle the brush better to clean. And bc the bristles are soft, it makes it easier to fit into narrow bottle openings. So far I am happy with my purchase! It cleans really well without damaging any of the prints you may have on your water bottles or cups.",

      "text": "I wanted a brush to scrub my Chemex with that would be lightweight so as not to break the glass and also long enough to reach inside the coffee glass. This OXO bottle brush works just right and scrubs it well. The price was right - I almost want to buy another one just so I can have one exclusively for my coffee machine. Glad to have this quality product in my arsenal.",

      "text": "This isn\u2019t a bad bottle brush, but there are a couple ways it could be improved. The bristles aren\u2019t very stiff which makes it great for getting into narrow mouth bottles, but bad for wide mouth and scrubbing stickier problems. As others have noted, it is a little short. In my 32oz bottle it goes all the way to the handle. So I recommend for narrow mouth bottles, but for wide mouth may want to look else where.",
