      "text": "Cheap and Short lived!!!!! Do not buy! Ordered these earbuds on April 12th. They probably arrived here around the 15th. The window for return was May 12th. One week after the return date expired, on May 19th, the sound volume started turning itself down on it's own. Today, May 24th, the earbuds would not turn on despite the fact that they had still had a good charge two days ago. Now they are plugged in to charge, in case that was the problem, but it has been two hours and still the light that should come on, to indicate that they are charging, has not come on. Very disappointed in these and in this company.",

They won't take a charge. I use these a lot.. Usually three to four hours a day under heavy exercising while running. I can only assume these aren't water resistant and can't handle any sweat getting near them before they short out. I recommend going with another brand if you use these during exercise.",

I purchased this pair in February and have used them regularly. When I went to use them yesterday and one of the earbuds seems to have cut out though.

They aren't the most comfortable earphones out there so I wouldn't reccomend them for sleeping unless you have a soft pillow and ears that aren't too sensitive.

The monitors stick out of your ear A LOT. OK if you're just walking around the house but impossible to use under a helmet or hat. Putting the helmet on or off either jams them in your ears or knocks them out. Or both. Sound is good though ; )",

And sure, you get an 18 month warranty and they're happy to refund-replace but there's clearly a quality issue across the board. Sound quality for these was ok for the price, pity they didn't actually work fully.",

I have not used these a great amount of time since purchasing them and I'm an adult who takes care of items. I purchased my earbuds in April and this weekend I noticed they were not charging when plugged in. I tried to use them today but they wouldn't work, so I plugged them in again and tried to charge them but they will no longer charge. The earbuds are only 4 months old!!!! Even for the affordable price, there is no reason the earbuds should stop charging already. Very disappointed in this purchase!",

It's also a little weird having them move in my ear the tiniest bit even though they are sealed. It amplifies the shifting noise and is pretty loud. So, maybe not ideal for running but I'm not going to ding them any stars for that. They do what they do perfectly.",

      "title": "UPDATE: 8/27/2019 - Product still junk - Anker Customer service Great!",
      "text": "Not sure why, but this was the third pair I bought of these. At this point I should've just splurged for nice bluetooth buds. First order was working well then my mother in law washed them. Done. Second set stopped charging so I tried a different brand. No luck. Bought these Anker a third time and now this set won't charge. I've wasted too much money these are crap. Avoid at all costs!!! UPDATE - These earbuds were still trash, but Anker promptly contacted me and rectified the situation. Anker sent me two pairs of the updated model to replace my pairs that broke. SO far the newer model has been great. Excellent customer service",
