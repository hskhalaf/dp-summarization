      "text": "This is the first 'wrenchless' arbor I've purchased and glad to see manufacturers are making this process much easier. You just screw it in until the pins line up push the collar to close. I am giving it four stars because it is somewhat difficult to pull the collar back to unlock it. I lubricated it and it still takes way too much effort to unlock. It does help if you wiggle it back and forth as you are pulling, but I feel it should be as smooth in both directions. No problem with functionality though.",

Smaller hole saws that are < or = 1-1/2\" can catch the arbor and push the pins out of the hole saw while you are still drilling! However, other than those sizes this is my favorite arbor! It's like the Milwaukee one thay you just slide in and out but this one dosn't fall apart.",

So those snap packages were repacked in my case with an Irwin arbor. But like I said, it gets the job done. I'm sure I'll lose or break this one too.",
