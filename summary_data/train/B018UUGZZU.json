But luckily we haven't had any issues! My oldest was using a regular toboggan to snow board down our hill, but after she got this for Christmas, she's been so happy to glide right down without having to worry about falling over. I have a 10 year old and a 5 year old and they can both use their scooters without any issues. Everything is sturdy and durable. Very fun!!",

It seems like the handle is too low for him and since it moves, it is hard for him to keep steady. Maybe over time he will get better? He seems to love going down hills with it. I love that there is plenty of foot room for both feet. Our neighbor has a different kind that is also pretty cool, but there isn't much room for his feet on there. So this snow scooter is pretty cool, but I wish the handle went up higher.",
