The laces have shed their skin after only 3 months of ownership - yes you heard that right; 3 MONTHS and the fancy pants, two-tone laces have peeled. I\u2019ve worn CHEAP WORK BOOTS with better quality laces than these ...and it\u2019s not that I draw them too tight, as I can\u2019t abide over-tightened footwear. What were they thinking?",
