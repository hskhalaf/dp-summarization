I'm very surprised that no one else has reported this problem. DO NOT buy these for restaurant work, it is a death sentence.",

The arch in the pair that I bought off of Amazon is further back than in the exact same shoe that I tried on at Cabelas. When I put them on and walked around, it seemed as if I was wearing a pair of women's high heel shoes. In my opinion, the shoe being sold on Amazon, is just a knockoff of the actual product sold in stores.",

They still feel great and fit comfortably.

So glad I did! They lasted me all of that trip, and a couple of years after. I've been buying them ever since!",

It feels strange, I prefer it maybe 8 or 10 mm, just a touch above flat. The sole is very grippy and seems to have a ton of traction.

A podiatrist once told me I had \"weird feet\", so this is a rare treat for me -- to find a shoe that feels like it was custom-made just for me. 18 months later... Still comfortable, but during the past 6 months or so, these Merrell's have developed a loud and persistent squeek, especially bothersome in a quiet room. I'm therefore lowering my overall rating from 5 to 3 stars, as no other shoes I own are this noisy.",
