This app is much more innovative than its precursors, with helpful hints that guide you through the process of connecting the bluetooth scale exceptionally well. You can also choose between conventional, personal, or combo blenders, which is a nice touch for those of us who live by the bullet. The best part of the Perfect Blend this time of year is their soups - I've already tried the minestrone (my favorite kind) which was great, and the celery potato, which is hearty but not heavy. All very good (and simple). Well done!",
