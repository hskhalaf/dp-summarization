The plastic is nice and thick, not as flimsy as Wal-Mart blinds. I would buy them again, I'd just measure a little differently next time. Good for the price and Amazon was immediate about exchanging for me.",

The blind are made of plastic, however they don't look bad at all, actually I was very surprised after that I installed the blind in my window. Some pieces don't fit, actually you will need to bend some holders to grab the main frame in the wall. Anyway, I managed to install it in my window without much trouble.",
