The cap doesn't seal to the rim of the shaker, so as you're shaking your cocktail, the cap is filling up with the contents of the shaker. And there's absolutely no mechanism for the \"slosh\" to return to the shaker once you're ready to uncap and pour. You just end up with a huge mess on your hands, shaker and work surface. I returned it and I hope mine was somehow defective and missing a critical part that would seal the cap and shaker.",

Because of that I have purchased numerous plastic shakers, all of which have leaked, cracked or some combination of both.This shaker is very well constructed, as some other reviewers have said, it does resemble the making of a thermos or travel coffee cup, however I see that as a plus. The jigger has measurements and the outside is very soft to hold. The Jigger also has some sort of rubber which is nice because it doesn't flip over when you're pouring into it. OXO always has good products but this really a favorite.",

It's a cost-effective investment for them to see if they even end up using it much too. Highly recommend this as a My First Cocktail Shaker. You can always move on and up when you're ready to.",

      "text": "I had hoped to use this to replace a blender when mixing powder/drink mixtures. (Trying to avoid the dis-assembly and cleaning of the mixer.)The item works fine as a shaker if you're mixing liquids, but trying to dissolve a powder in a liquid is quite another story. I also find that the top does not remove easily without a struggle - perhaps it is the newness of the item which will improve with further use. Bottom line, stick to mixing liquids only!",
