I decided to go one up on him and get this mousepad. Boy am I glad I bought it. It actually is more comfortable to use and when paired with my M65 works amazingly. Sure, not everyone is into making their desks looking like unicorn barf, but I think the mousepad is a nice touch to the RGB keyboard and mouse that I already have. On a side note. Maybe your cat will like it. Mine likes to sleep on it for some reason.",

One other complaint is the pictures on Amazon make this look grey, but it's much more of a reddish-brown color. Not a deal breaker at all, but I like the idea of a grey pad better. Performance wise, this pad is awesome. Very smooth and feels comfy under your hands and forearms. It's pretty happy to stay where you place it, and feels pretty heavy when you pick it up, in a good way.",

I like that this pad isn't too tall that it takes up almost the whole desk but is long enough for the keyboard, mouse, and even a cellphone or other things next to it. The pad is thinner than one I was using previously but I don't think that's a big deal unless you want a more cushiony feel. One thing I did notice right away is that mouse movements are much faster since the fabric seems a lot slicker than the traditional mousepad. I imagine this would be good for gaming (which I don't do) but also works well for normal tasks.",

Overall, a mouse pad is a mouse pad as far as how it functions. I really see no point in buying this unless you like the RGB funtions, which I was wanting to add to my Corsair mouse and Keyboard. Great combination with all three for a RGB display.",

At this price point I would have like to see it much smaller because when you are using it with a wires mouse or charging a wireless mouse the cable can has a habit of dragging over the bump and that can get annoying in long term teaming gaming sessions.",

If it flashes fast that means very poor connection (always happens) you have to reposition to get slow flash meaning good charging. So, if you forget to move your mouse to the corner at night, it will be dead tomorrow (only 18 hour lifespan on mouse according to my reads). Logitech's charges no matter where the mouse is! Granted this is 60% cheaper than Logitechs and is Qi charging where Logitech's charging is proprietary, but that wasn't good enough for me.",

Enter this mousepad. GREAT price. Full rubber backing for anti slip. And the surface coupled with my harpoon rgb is so satisfying I can't see myself switching again except for a larger or newer model or one with a built in mouse bungee/headset stand. 10/10 would buy again.",

My logitech G503 mouse seems to work well on the surface even with the printed image. I can't speak for other mice as some may have an issue with this and prefer a solid color surface. Happy so far with the purchase as I've been using it every day for several weeks with no issues and no signs of wear.",

I do have to mention that there was an odd odor to it when I first opened it, but that quickly disappeared over the period of a few days. I was so satisfied with it that I ordered a second one for my wife's computer desk and she absolutely loves it. It easily accommodates a large keyboard, mouse, with room to spare. I purchased it while on sale for $15 but wouldn't hesitate to purchase it again at it's full price of $30. Great product and highly recommended.",

My wrist doesn't have an stress marks after LONG uses without breaks. Surface is SMOOTH for my mouse to slide on. Check your desk dimensions before you buy. Check to see if you like the graphic on the mouse pad since it's not pure black and isn't one of those reverse-able. Regular quality o' mouse pad that only cover your mouse area might be $15 but this is an extended sized...its a steal.",
