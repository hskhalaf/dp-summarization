This ice maker makes it so much nicer. Don't ever have to worry again about running out of ice. The shapes of the cubes make them so easy to use them in a soda or water bottle. I looked through slot of different portable ice makers, and this had everything I wanted, 3 sizes of cubes, recycling the water as the ice melts, very portable, easy to use, and a easy drain spout. I highly recommended this one",
