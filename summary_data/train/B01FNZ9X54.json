You only need to use a little bit of the beads in a mixing bowl, cover them with water and watch them expand. They are slippery, but not a slimy mess. My kids are 14 and 16 and loved them. Little kids would have a blast too. You can cover them up to store them and add more water if they seem to start shrinking. This pack of beads should last you many, many bowls full.",

Something about the texture - they aren't slimy which is surprising! There are tons of them! They are teeny tiny but get marble sized in water. Don't be fooled by the small package :)",

I agree with others that have mentioned the beads are easy to break, but I find this only happens once they\u2019re pierced (e.g. medium to long finger nails), which seems to be common for water beads. Overall, I\u2019d say they\u2019re worth the price, but I wish they had more color.",

Definitely wouldn't recommend for any kids that still put things in their mouths, but these were the perfect way to kill several hours with my preschooler and first grader (and even my fourth grader loved them).",

I was worried she wouldn't go near them but she plays with them non stop. my son loves to see them bounce and likes to fill up bottles with them and dump them out. its nice to be able to give them something to keep them busy while I cook or tend to other things. love the various colors of this pack, helps us teach our daughter her colors too. will be ordering these again for sure.",

I didn't see before I ordered them that they were for four years or older, so I was a little concerned to let him play with them. He is only two years old. Everything was fine until he decided they looked good enough to eat. I put them away and will try them again when he is a little older.",
