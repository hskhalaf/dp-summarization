      "text": "D-link AC1900 DWA-192 Drivers are flaky under Windows 10. I've tried Microsoft, D-link and Realtek drivers and still I get 'No Internet' message when connected after a reboot. The process then seems to be to disable then re-enable device in Device Drivers to kickstart the device into proper function. I've looked at D-link forums and there are too many issues with the DWA-192, to help me diagnose my particular issue, with solutions from simple driver updates, to replacing faulty hardware. This indicates to me that the device has too many potential points of failure to be considered reliable. This plus my experience so far, means I cannot recommend this device to others.",

I had to compile a driver from source, for which Amazon will not let me post a link, but if you search for 'tpircher 8814AU' you'll find a github repository with a driver for this Realtek chipset. Works perfectly now, and I can recommend it.",

It worked, the signal quality is good enough for it be used in a bedroom, where the signal is passing through a floor and a wall. I can only give this product 5 stars as it does exactly what I wanted it to do and it does it well, is unobtrusive and is relatively inexpensive.
