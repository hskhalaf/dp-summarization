Sound is fine but the quality of the material is dreadful. I've hardly used them, yet the black finish is already coming off and there are lots and lots of scratches. I don't have long finger nails, I never dropped them, I always carry them inside a soft bag, so the only explanation for this is that it's very cheaply manufactured, something that other reviewers have also commented on.",

If you attempt to take them outside, near any public space or where there is heightened background noise, the noise cancelling does little to help and can actually become distracting. It\u2019s a shame as these are very well built and comfortable. I had bought these as a second pair to take to the gym and for walks outdoors but sadly they came up well short when compared to my Bose QC35. If you are looking to listen with these indoors in quieter environments they will be fine, but if you want to do more with them I would suggest looking at other models out there.",

      "text": "Great headphones but there is one issue. The noise cancellation will drive you insane, it constantly hisses and you can only get rid of it by increasing the volume to ear shattering limits. If you want a better headphone, i returned mine and got the Bose Quietcomfort 35. Great product and no hissing :)",
