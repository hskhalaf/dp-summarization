Bent the support cross bar pushing bearings on.",

I think I will weld all the corners and weld the handle together and beef it up a little and make it more sturdier.",

No problem, I went out to the shed and cut a scrap piece I had to make up for the missing piece. After putting together more of the frame I notice I'm missing the bolts for the top support. No problem, I have spare bolts. I get to looking a little closer and see I'm also missing the springs! At this point I give up! Now I have to pack this thing back up and deal with sending it back...

I initially purchased this unit to handle some Toyota (front) bearings that are a bear to remove - you cannot hammer those out. This press handled that job with very little fuss. The price is great; sure, it's not Made in USA, but for this price, it's gotta be a best bang-for-the-buck winner. The tolerances are not the greatest - we're not doing precision work here, and at this price-point, you can't complain... The powdercoating is pretty thick and durable, so the finish should last quite a while.",
