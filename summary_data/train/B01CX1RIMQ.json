The tings on other blenders tend to bend becaued they are made from thinner steel, and the connection between the handle and blade of the \"best seller\" broke after using it for less than a year. One thing I would like to see is a little larger handle. While the cutter works well, I have larger hands than most women and many men and I have to put one finger outside the handle. Maybe offer the cutter in small and large? Besides that one down-side, this is a great tool.",

It was definitely smaller than I thought it would be, but it works perfect for me. I don't think I have exceptionally small hands, but it fits my hand fine and is easy to work with. If you have a larger hand, I would consider going up to the next size Spring Chef offers.",

      "text": "The dough blender has a great grip. My hands hurt a lot, but I was craving scones that don't suck and that's not so easy on Long Island. Italian bakery, sure. Scones? Not so much. Same with clotted cream; which is a revelation, along with raspberry jam, on a really good scone. I was able to use the blender to cut cold butter into the dry ingredients. I thought I'd need my husband to help, as I often do; instead it was comfortable, worked efficiently, and made me DELICIOUS scones. And yes, I got clotted cream delivered from Tea & Sympathy. It was scrumptious.",
