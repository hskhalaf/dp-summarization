I reverted to using ace bandages - with all their shortcomings - and found them to be at least a useable solution. But this product is just dumb - a pain causing \"pain reliever\". I'm sure there must be velcro-type wraps out there; look for one of those or use an ace bandage. Don't waste your money on this. '",
