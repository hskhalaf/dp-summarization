When full just hit the button. It's very quiet and if you pack it as it shows you can get a lot into it. I love that it's on the counter. I don't have to bend to fill or empty it. Great for a small household. I still wash a few things, like plastic containers and pots & pans. I prefer to wash those by hand as it's only 1 or 2 pieces a day. It's well made and easy to keep clean.",

So far, it has neither leaked nor balked, so we remain sanguine as to its continued adequate performance.",

      "text": "I have a small kitchen with no room for either a built-in or large portable dishwasher. This sits on my counter and fits under my cabinets great. I does a great job cleaning the dishes and is extremely quiet. It comes with the hoses to connect to the sink and is very easy to setup. It does hold 6 place settings as well as silverware which is perfect for my small household.",
