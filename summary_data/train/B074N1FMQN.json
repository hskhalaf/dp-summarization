      "text": "I've been searching for something like this for a while. This back razor works great. For those hard to reach areas, this gives a close, smooth easy shave to the back. Blades are sharp so once you get used to holding it in the right positions, you can lightly stroke those unwanted back hairs away. My back is smooth from just above my buttocks to between my shoulder blades & up to the base of my neck.",

So, I thought I would try this back razor (as my wife is not always available and I cannot reach many spots with an ordinary razor). Overall, I am satisfied. I do have a caution: the blades are very sharp, so go slowly loading, unloading, handling and shaving. It is an acquired skill. Once you get the hang of it, it is helpful grooming tool. Incidentally, aside from the cost of waxing, my body's skin cannot tolerate waxing. I did cut myself before I realized that I had to be very careful. That said, it works for me....",

I had to have my wife finish me with an electric shaver. Having said that, I think this shaver might work better with daily shaving and I'll report back on that. After having my wife shave my back I started using this razer in the shower and it has worked very well! I use it about every other day. The razer seems to be good for about 15 - 20 shaves and I will probably change to the second blade.",

Wet, dry, it doesn't matter, Arching my back helps only slightly, but it is positioned in such an angle, that i have to keep the handle almost against my back which makes it near impossible to get anything accomplished. i end up just using my regular razor again and work on my contorting my arms into very uncomfortable positions while cursing that i even bought this",

However, once you start, you'll wonder why you never shaved your back before. The instruction that came with the back shaver were incomplete, but after e-mail the seller Halo I got a more in-depth guide and they replace a blade that broke in the process. I couldn't be more pleased, I would definitely buy from them in the future.",
