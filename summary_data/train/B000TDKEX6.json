I have thrown this thing in many times and haven't broken it yet, I believe that's a fair judgement on how durable it is. It has taken many strikes directly into the handle and the handle has yet to crack or break. I did work the edge up a little bit to sharpen it.",

      "text": "I've purchased two of these for axe throwing and have absolutely no complaints. Since it's not designed for throwing, I had to sharpen it up a bit, but that wasn't a problem. The balance is good--but different than on most axes due to the hammer on the back of the head. The hammer also changes the rotation, so you have to compensate for that. It is heavier than most throwing axes, and the handle is a bit thicker, so you might have to make adjustments--I know some throwers who file the handles down a bit. But the added weight can help cut through knots on the target.",

After several throws we where pretty consistent in sticking the axe. The only con to these hatchets are the handles are real smooth probably not a problem if used as intended but can be scary if thrown. I just added some athletic tape to one and a Baseball Bat wrap to the other and problem solved .",
