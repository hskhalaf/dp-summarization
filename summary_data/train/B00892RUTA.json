It seems that it is sturdy, but using for new and receiving used is not good. UPDATE: Cheetah not only sent me a new mount that worked perfectly they also sent some really slick HDMI connectors. This is a very sturdy mount. Would not hesitate buying from Cheetah again! I am giving them a\"Mulligan\" on the first mount...",

It took some time to work out attaching the mounting bracket to the actual projector since the mounting plate on the projector wasn't a normal square or rectangle shape. Other than that, it's pretty sturdy and versatile. I will use it again when I need to mount another projector in the theatre. Price wise, it's a terrific value and cheaper than renting a mount when renting a projector!",

It came with ample amount of mounting hardware to install for various configurations but my overall problem has been with the mount itself. The ball and pinion on this is severely undersized for holding the majority of home theater projectors. I have the screws on the ball and pinion tightened down as far as possible but there is still a few inches of play which making it line up correctly with my screen near impossible. I think if you have a small projector this mount might be sufficient, but stay clear of this one if you have a larger projector.",

      "text": "Plenty sturdy and lots of parts for flexibility in mounting. You get 3 sets of screws to match the mounting holes in your projector. Unfortunately my BenQ had M8 holes so it was a trip to HD for those. The socket for the ball mount had burrs that prevented inserting the ball which had to be filed off. There also should have been one more screw holding the extendable tubes to prevent wobble. Another HD trip. The directions are virtually useless. If you don't have a bent for mechanical stuff, this assembly isn't for you. That said, I'm quite happy with the unit.",
