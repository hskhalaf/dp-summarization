The footgear\u2019s rugged build and effective waterproofing also scored plus points from consumers. Its narrow fit, however, left some dissatisfied. So, although buyers can expect enough benefits from this boot, its width is not for everyone.",

      "text": "This is my 3rd pair of Merrells, and like the other two, these fit and wore very well. However, these began falling apart rapidly after mild-moderate use. The first thing to fail was the string stirrups near the toe box. Second was the sole begun coming undone on one shoe. Sadly I stopped wearing them. I am saddened by this due to how pleased I was with the other two pair I still currently own. Hopefully this was just an outlier, not sure if I'll repeat purchasing Merrell products.",

I was wearing very thin black nylon gold toe socks when I tried the boot on at first. The laces were long enough to tie into a square not. But, not long enough to bow tie. The product could have gotten 'average' (3 stars) for doing as competition does. But, my last boot did not have truncated laces. So, these were below average. And, 2 stars.",
