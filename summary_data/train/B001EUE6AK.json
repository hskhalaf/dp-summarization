      "text": "Great headphones. They have great sound, very good and fast bass, solid mids, and treble is great, with no sibilance. They are very easy to drive, sounding great from portable player and my phone. I love how these fold up for travelling. They also look fantastic, and I get loads of compliments on the look of them. These don't have the greatest soundstage, but for a closed, portable headphone, I am very happy. If you have large ears, these may be uncomfortable.",

Once you know this it is not a big problem. The ear pads are so tight that it tends to make your ears hot. Everything else is great. The sound quality is excellent, they are light and comfortable, the accessories are perfect for earphones. The carrying case really works better than any case I have ever seen. It makes them a pleasure to take them on a trip. I now use them every time over my Sony MDR 7506.",

I baby all my headphone purchases and within a few months the ear pads of these were torn. 3 years later the right earcup has fallen off and they are now totally unusable. 3 years is really not a long lifespan for a headphone, I've had other headphones for years longer and they still look like new without any tears. I personally liked the sound signature and portability of these headphones, but with this poor of build quality I would not recommend these to anyone I know.",

I was not familiar with Phiaton, but their name kept coming up in a lot of the reviews here and on headphone sites/blogs as being a great product for the money. They fit great, are extremely comfortable, and sound great. I'm no audiophile, but the bass is a lot tighter than many others I've tried, the mids seem well balanced, and the high end is crisp without being too bright. While the sound isolation/reduction isn't huge, it still works well for travel, and the compact design and nice carrying case really help. Overall, this is a great set of cans for the money!",
