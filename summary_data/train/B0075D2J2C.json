We bought two and tested the other night. Both of us had a great night sleep. We bought the smaller cots due to our tent footprint. I am 6' and 215 pounds. Cot is very sturdy for my weight. My feet hang off the end but I knew that when we bought it. Friends have these too and pointed us in this direction and we are very glad they did.",

      "text": "Buddy and I each purchased one of these cots for a camping trip to southern Wyoming. The ground is uneven, rock/gravel, and not comfortable with a pad alone. These cots were very comfortable. I'm 5'-10\" and under 200 lbs so I'm not putting much stress on the cot, but my back and shoulders felt great every morning. While large and bulky, the cot and box fit nicely on top of a truck bed load to make securing the load much easier (we had a tarp covering everything as well). The box top and bottom fit neatly under the cot to allow for storage inside the tent that you can easily access by sliding the box, an unexpected bonus!",

I would recommend purchasing a 2 inch memory foam mattress topper for it, I bought a twin size and cut it to fit the cot which is smaller than a standard twin size bed. To summarize this cot is comfortable, folds in half for easy storage and for putting it in the trunk of your car for camping or a sleepover somewhere. We have 2 cots that we use for guests and also when we sleep at my mother in law's house.",

      "text": "My wife and I have been tenting camping for years. Now that we are getting up there in years, we wanted something a bit more comfortable compared to sleeping on the ground in our tent. The cots are fairly comfortable with the padding, but when we added the padding that we normally used when we slept on the ground to the top of the cot padding, it was great. Now we can put supplies and other things under our cots and keep our tent a bit more organized. These cots are large and only fold up in half, so storing them can be a challenge.",

I am 5' 11'' and hang off the ends a little when stretched out lengthwise, however the cot is wide enough to bend my knees slightly an sleep comfortably on my side. Its shorter length allows me to set it up in my Wrangler Unlimited (with one of the back seats removed) giving me the ability to get a great nights sleep in the jeep and additional storage space under the cot.",

But not too far, it is a little heavy and bulky. You wouldn't want to carry it on a wilderness trail. It's great in a campground.
