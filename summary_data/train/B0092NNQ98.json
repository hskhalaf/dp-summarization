We had to remove the safety buckles in order for the baby to fit inside without it rubbing and pressing up against him. However, It would be close to impossible for the baby to get out of the seat due to how its designed. So I think the safety is just there for legalities rather than actual safety. Also probably not great for a chunkier baby. It fits our baby because his legs are longer and not so chunky but it leaves little room for leg growth.",

The one downside is that it did have a funny smell, but the one I also purchased and returned at Target had the same smell. After a little warm soap and water it no longer smelled.",

They are still usable, just pop apart easily which is a bit annoying. We are still huge fans of the Bumbo seats. But this tray table needs a design improvement.",
