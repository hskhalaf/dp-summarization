The Origami book shelf works! These are really neat engineering design miracles that arrive flat, fold out and buckle together in an ingenious way, and are light weight but very solid. They also come with feet that screw in which allows for adjustment on uneven floors. Highly recommended. Note: If you are giving me an unhelpful vote, please tell me why by commenting on my review so I can improve in the future. I try my best to make my reviews as helpful as possible. Thanks!",

Now it won't sit flush against a wall because of the rear mechanism and it is extremely light so my suggestion is load the bottom shelves with your heavy books and binders and use the top for any knick knacks or lighter materials and you will be good to go. :)",

Awesome is an easy description. Well made, and looks great. It takes longer to take out of the box than it does to open it up! I've seen put-together furniture with the headaches of screws, nails and numerous pieces at higher prices. The Origami Shelf that unfolds in 30 seconds is a no-brainer of a better choice!",

I can't lift crazy-heavy stuff and hate the prospect of having to deal with most furniture when moving, so I got this because it's lightweight, strong, and collapsible. No complaints so far! It looks decent, and it's definitely sturdy and adjustable. No problems!",
