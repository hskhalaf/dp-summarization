I needed to readjust and lifting up was easy; it didn\u2019t tear. Once I smoothed it out, it cling just fine from the readjustment. Beautiful stained glass look and it has hung with no problem on my door for months!! Big fan and highly recommend!",

I used a scissors and guess-timated, but I recommend getting an x-acto knife to trim it once it's on the window, I think it would have given me a better result. Still, I'm quiet happy with the way it looks, and the amount of light it lets through without being see through.",

Use credit card or use squeegee to get rid of bubbles & smooth out. It looks nice but isn\u2019t very bright. Backside on glass very pale. I was hoping it looked translucent & bright on both sides. Even so, definitely worth the money.",

One tip - make sure you use a generous amount of water, it makes it easier to slide the film around if you need to move it.",

The entire process was simple, and all you need is water, a single edge blade, and a towel. It was supposed to be temporary. I get so many compliments, I'm not replacing them.",
