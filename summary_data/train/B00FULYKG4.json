You need multiple passes on the same area to completely remove all the hair. The ergonomic handle is long but not really ergonomic. I'm not the most flexible but the design definitely makes it hard to reach most areas on the back. Maybe if it was $20, but not worth $35+.",

This one though is different from the ones I have purchased in the past. Because it has a trimmer coil head and not the regular shaver with a blade, it works efficiently every time, without having to worry about the blades going blunt. Second, the tool is light in weight, has a flexible design and therefore, allows the user to use it easily without depending on other family members to help them out. I am happy with this purchase.",

It reaches all areas of my back perfectly and seems solidly built. It shaved my back perfectly and left it nice and smooth with the 2 attachment head. Buy this you and won\u2019t regret it.",

I am patient and have to lightly go over an area a couple times to work effective, but I have no complaints. If/when this one dies, I will likely purchase another one as long as I get at least 6 months out of this one.",

You'll have to figure out adjusting the angle and length so that the head is flush against your skin. A mirror helps you see what's going on so you can adjust as you go, you'll need different settings for side-back, middle back, lower-back, etc. I haven't had any issues with scratching, cuts or irritation even when I don't have the angle right. If you're cutting your back you are pressing way, way too hard. The only negative thing I would say is that this is loud. Much louder than an electric razor or even clippers.",
