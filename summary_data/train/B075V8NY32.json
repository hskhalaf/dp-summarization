(the 5mm reversable mat from Lululemon) But the hole is just a little too small to make getting the mat in or out easy. It seems like I'm rubbing my mat on the zipper too much and forceing it in. Maybe with a less sticky mat, it would be better, but the Lulu grips so much it makes it tough. I will probably be looking for another bag in the near future as this one is already getting to be a pain.",

Zipper should extend through one of the bag side faces like in many other designs to make it easier. Did not realize the extra 2\" would not allow for easy load/unload. I do not want to buy the extra large bag (29\"x11\") or YogaAddict Supreme bag (30\") because don't want a saggy huge bag or needless pockets. I guess will need to return it and buy something else.

Having the external pouch is perfect for your trinkets and having the ventilation slots are a great addition to the bag. It is well constructed and sturdy. You definitely are getting your monies worth. The best part though is the personal message that I received from Richee. This really goes along way instead of just getting an automatic electronic response. I really appreciated it. If you are shopping for a new Yoga Mat Bag, look no further this is the best one!

      "text": "Great yoga mat bag for Jade or Manduka yoga mats. I have the Jade Fusion extra thick and extra long mat: 74 in long, 24 in wide, and 5/16 in thick. This yoga bag fits my mat, towel, and it still has some room in it too. The two zipper pockets are very useful, one on the outside and a mesh one on the inside. The strap is adjustable and comfortable. I got the red color and it's very nice. The price is great and I would recommend this to all the yogis out there. Great company with excellent customer service too!",

After more then a year it looks like new. I think this bag will last for long! I'm really happy with my purchase.",
