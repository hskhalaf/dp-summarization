      "text": "I have been searching for a cosleeper that you can actually put on top of the bed and Im glad I bought this. My daughter outgrew her old cosleeper and this is now perfect for her. She is about 26 inches long and there is still about 7 inches space for her (my estimate). She also loves the vibrating feature. It puts her right back to sleep. The mattress is more like an egg shape rather than an oval so when i remove the mattress cover, i sometimes end up putting it the wrong way making the mattress lift up a bit but all in all its a great product.",

I will say that if you're in a queen bed it better be one person or two small people, and then this sleeper should be either against the wall or between you. i could imagine bumping it off otherwise. Nevertheless that is a problem with all similar products and this one does the job well and I liked not having to get up at night, while also knowing that I wasn't going to roll over my new baby.",

I didn't really use the light or vibration features at all but it's nice that they're an option. I did love how it can fold and travel easily.
