The visual quality of this television is inferior to my 2008 Sony 1080p. That is comparing them side by side. There are verticle shadow lines across the front of the screen, perhaps due to Samsung's inferior design. I've purchased a TCL 4k, at a smaller price, with perhaps 2.5 times the picture quality and performance when watching action movies and playing PS4 with the grandkids. The only good thing about this tv is the remote. It is simple and efficient. Sadly Samsung engineers aren't as capable of designing televisions as they are remotes.",

I was reading reviews that were saying that mu7000 has a better color gammut and firmware. Well, having used mu7000 for a couple of weeks, i did not see any difference neither in color nor the \"smart\" part. In fact it looks like it's the same tv, but with a simpler bezel but a couple hundred dollars cheaper. The reason I am returning the MU 7000 is that it had some pixel anomaly at the bottom of the panel.",

If there is one improvement for Samsung to make is that they should allow competitor apps on their TV (like PS Vue). It is somewhat sad you need a Roku device just to run Vue while the TV itself should be more than capable of running that app. I guess it's more politics than anything... (Samsung vs Sony) Again, overall this is a winner with quick menu response times and crisp and clear 4K picture!",

      "text": "Only had the 55\" version for a short while, but am very happy with it thus far. I was worried about the reviews of the sound given that we view this TV from a decent distance and thought I would need a sound bar, but the sound works very well and no need for a bar. Setup was super easy, the picture is excellent, Netflix and Amazon have outstanding response times, and the remote is very easy to use.",
