My temps go up to 29\u00b0C playing Fallout 4, thats a huge improvement from going up to 86\u00b0C with a fan and heatsink. If it keeps this up, I'm going to be extremely satisfied. Well it lasted literally one year from the day I ordered it. It crapped out yesterday.",

I have an old Intel I5 2500k running at 4.3ghz and this thing is keeping it around low to mid 30s Celsius when idol. Never hotter than 45 degrees Celsius. The fan actually is not that bad either. The radiator core is made almost identical to my old Antek kuhler, which is made very sturdy. Fix the instructions and I will change my rating to 5 stars.",

Don't care for the light on the fan, so I just cut the LED's. However if you like the red lighted transparent fan than you're certainly in luck!",

The instructions do not include any writing information simply a few hard to understand pictures. I seen alot of reviews saying it does not come with the AMD bracket mine did.
