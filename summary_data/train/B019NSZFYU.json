We have no window where they couldn't get to it, so finally gave up and took it down. But that's not the fault of the feeder, which is itself excellent.

Very happy with this purchase, compared to what's available at even greater prices at the big box stores. I plan on getting more as gifts.",

It is of great quality and the suction cups even hold the neighborhood squirrel who sometimes visits. Hysterical. Anyway, I then decided to purchase one for myself for use here in California and I LOVE it! A great product and I highly recommend this to everyone who loves watching birds.",

The suction cups are strong and even after a snow it was protected from the weather. It did take about 3 weeks for the birds to start coming. I would put out a trail of seed on the porch leading up to the feeder (trying to stop my dogs from eating it! ) and eventually they came!",

We have two different brands of clear window feeders currently hanging in our window and this one is MUCH better quality all around. It's bigger, the material is thicker, the food tray is removable, and the back has a circle cut out so you can see inside much more easily. I have recommended this feeder to several friends!!",
