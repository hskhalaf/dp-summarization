It was a fast moving storm but It was so comfortable in the shelter we stayed the night. Thanks Gerber",

However, the hatchet was excellent for shaving small kindling, pounding tent steaks and was sharp enough to cut quarter-inch laundry line at the camp site. Quite a handy convenience tool that worked well for my limited needs. For sure though, will purchase bigger and purpose-built hatchet for splitting logs that are already cut-to-size campfire logs.",

I will say though, the \"hammer\" is really thin and leaves much to be desired in that regard. I use this with my Solo Stove wood gasifier, and it is the perfect size for cutting wood that fits in the stove (very small branches, no more than 1\" thick usually).",

I can recommend this hatchet to all outdoorsmen. You'll appreciate this hatchet once you use it.",

It is good in its role as a survival/camping hatchet and surprisingly sharp out of the packaging. I very much like the full tang design, meaning that the entire hatchet is one piece, which makes it stronger. I would recommend this product for someone who wants a small hatchet for camping, light chopping. Very happy with it so far.",

It is very sharp and wonderfully useful as it can be used as a large knife as well as a hatchet due to the finger notches and the sharpness of the blade. However, be aware that due to the narrow bevel it doesn't split logs overly well. The same size hatchet with a slightly larger bevel would be a welcome upgrade.",

I use this for cutting thru bush when hiking though I think it would struggle on large logs. FORGET the sheath, seems cheap and the loops are barely big enough to fit a child's belt. It also gets coaught when putting in and taking out so use it for storage only. Good finger cutouts make it easy to use when \"shaving\" kindling etc but a bigger thumb area would have been good.",
