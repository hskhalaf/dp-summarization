Setup was a breeze and the 4K video in amazon is great. The only thing this series doesn't have that the 6 series has is the individual backlight zones. What you get in exchange for that is an incredibly thin display and $150 to spend elsewhere. You will not regret this purchase!",

And a huge waste of money at this point. If only Amazon would allow a return for this. Edit: Amazon did eventually make an exception and allowed a return after listening in on a phone call to TCL and experiencing just how impossible it was dealing with them.",

It is 60hz, and uses a few nifty tricks to give the appearance of 120hz. There also seems to be some kind of issue with HPDC, as some programs that attempt to use it end up causing the TV to glitch out, displaying horizontal blue and green bars (or other graphical glitches) until the HDMI cable is unplugged and plugged back in to the TV-side port. I've had this TV for approximately two months. It already has at least 3 distinct clusters of dead pixels.",

Over-the-air programs can be heard fine at about 20-30 points, but when streaming or playing DVDs you have to crank it up to 50-60 or better, unless you turn the volume off altogether and just use your surround-sound system for DVDs.

I was just about to pull the trigger on the 6 series but with all the negative reviews about the banding it I narrowed it down to the 5 series 65 inch and pulled the trigger. Boy am I happy this tv looks amazing and the build is pretty solid. The Roku which this is my first time to use is great and very easy to use. Love the voice activation. With the money I saved 200 bucks that is I ordered a new stand for it.",
