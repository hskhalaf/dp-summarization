I poked a small hole in the top of the bottle to eliminate that problem.",

      "text": "I had just changed my six speed manual transmission oil in my 2000 Mazda Miata SE with a \"major brand synthetic product\" but was unhappy with the way it shifted. After reading many reviews and recommendation for this product, I decided to dump the oil and change to this product. Many reviews commented on the difference in this GL 4 oil vs GL 5 and how the shifting became \"buttery smooth.\" I was somewhat skeptical and didn't really believe the description. Well, needless to say....I couldn't believe the difference! This lubricant is amazing and I am now a believer! This will be the only transmission lubricant I will use in my Miata! Very Happy...Thank you Red Line!",

I usedto pump in the oil and stopped when it started to trickle out of the fill plug.",

GL-5 has additives like sulfur that corrode and eat away \"yellow\" metals. Many differentials can tolerate GL-5 fluid in place of GL-4, but not manual transmissions. This stuff is expensive but it is GL-4 and won't eat away those synchronizers. I think $40 for a trans fluid change is a small price to pay to protect your investment of thousands.",

Most other companies put liquid items into a bag to help contain any leakage that might occur. Might want to order separate from other items.",

I have a MK2 VW with 170k miles on it, and this oil did quiet down some of the wear-related chatter. Shift feel may have improved a bit also. These gear oil ratings are important, so use what is recommended for your car - not necessarily what the latest formulation might be. Its good peace-of-mind to know you have a proper oil in there.",

      "text": "Made a noticeable difference in the smoothness of each of my shifts. Used this on a 2010 Toyota Corolla 5 speed MT, which was beginning to feel very \"notchy\" and sluggish between shifts. Also, I noticed a third-gear grind as well, likely due to a faulty synchronizer; this fluid didn't really solve that issue, so I'm just double-clutching second-third now...not a big deal. Overall I would recommend this transmission fluid to anyone with a compatible vehicle.",

I refilled with MT90 and in a few hundred miles she was back to normal, with no more missed shifts because the synchros weren't catching. If your trans calls for a GL4 75W90 gear oil, you can't go wrong here.",

In this case, (MT-90) the key property is to provide enough friction between gearshifts to allow the synchronizers to slow down and provide smooth gearshifts. This is not an easy task to perform while still lubricating and being slippery enough to provide a consistent oil film, lubricity, resistance to thermal breakdown and long fluid life. If you have an older transmission that's getting more difficult to shift, Redline MT-90 can improve it and extend the time before a rebuild is necessary.",
