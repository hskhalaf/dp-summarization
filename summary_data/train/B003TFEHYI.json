      "text": "I purchased this speaker over 4 years ago and its still chugging along. I use it all over the house but primarily in the bathroom. I've unplugged it and placed it between the inner/outer shower curtain many times and the moisture hasn't killed it yet. I typically leave it plugged into a wall charger but when running off battery I have used it for hours on end while I'm working out in the garage to listen to a ball game. Even after 4 years the battery lasts long enough that I can get through football/baseball game without it dying. This is one of my favorite purchases from amazon.",

I've taken this everywhere and everyone comments how loud and clear it is even when I max out the volume. It truly is one of the best even though now there are other portable speakers out there now in 2013. The battery has a good life and even after five years still going strong. Recommended: I tend to get more without using the bluetooth option for battery life.",

She also talked about signing up for some service (cable/credit, not sure) where they were offering her an option for an iPhone speaker or an iPad as a gift. After she took us out to an expensive restaurant for dinner I was certain the right gift for her was this speaker. She absolutely loves it. Uses it every day. Sorry I don't have any more specific details but I believe this was the best option and she seems very happy with it.",

The bass seemed fine, it's not a boombox but it plenty for that speaker. I even downloaded a equalizer, and it managed to thump its way off my cooler. I do have a problem with the bluetooth cutting out, and having to re-sync it now and then, but I think its my android, because it doesn't seem to do it, when playing off my friends iphone. Worth the price, considering no huge difference in sound and volume on the upper end speakers right now.",

You may want to adjust the music EQ (Settings > Music > EQ) in iOS to get the best sound. 2. The wireless range is a lot greater than expected. At least fifty feet. Maybe more.",

I charge it every time before I use it to make sure it has enough juice to last through the podcast sometimes more than an hour. USB charging system.

They all work seamlessly good!! Great product i must say and everyone of my friends wants to own one simply because of superb sound coming from a small wireless portable speaker.
