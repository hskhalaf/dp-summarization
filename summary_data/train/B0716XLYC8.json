The pictures are just to show the irritation and burning sensation I currently have all over my face. Essentially, if your face is dry and/or sensitive, DON'T use it as a full mask. Rather, just for problem areas. The mask itself was somewhat difficult to work with. You would *literally* need to make this mask thick as thieves, otherwise it's painful & difficult to take off. Honestly, my face hurts & I can't even tell if it removed any black heads, so I don't know what to think of this mask.",

I think the best way to proceed with this product would be using warm and slightly hot damp towel to open up your pore a bit and make removal easier. After the removal, I think using a collagen essence mask would allow your skin to feel more revived and become healthier.",
