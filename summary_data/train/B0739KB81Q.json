However, I can see a lot more clearly with the Besgoods clipped onto my prescription glasses than I can with the ElementsActive pair. So, those Besgoods get used for driving and the ElementsActive get used for yard work. Those are good enough to look at weeds. This is an excellent alternative to prescription sunglasses. I have a pair and was considering getting new lenses with my latest prescription. The tinting is nicer and the combination has the same sharpness. These are wider than any of my prescription glasses and therefore provide better protection.",

In the car it's no problem, outside I have to wear a cap. I wish they made the same product with a clip only, no flip-up, to eliminate that glare problem",
