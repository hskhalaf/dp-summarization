It is heavier than I expected so if you're planning to move it around or store it after each use, it is pretty cumbersome and definitely not the most mobile.

I am considering modifying the stand in order to allow an complete upright setting. Not very pleased with my purchase. I'll keep it for now and replace it later on. If you plan using this for benching, I would recommend spending a bit more for a purpose built incline/decline bench, not this.",

Second the base supports would be better if they were made one inch wider. That being said this is a good bench that is very safe if correctly used.",

I've owned a $350 bench in the past was destroyed in a fire and for the price of this bench, it stacks up pretty good. Of course the more expensive bench was much more heavy duty, but for what we use it for, it works great! Well worth every penny!! Would highly recommend and would buy again! Happy lifting!!",

I also could do without the leg braces, but they are easy enough to avoid. For the price you can't beat this bench. Highly recommended!",

Has 4 different positions. Heavy duty bench, you can use plenty of weight on this.
