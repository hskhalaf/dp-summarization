A few changes to new generations feels like a downgrade. :( Especially the terrible design of the handle release latch, that accidentally gets pushed 15x when pushing your suitcase. Still, the best \"looking\" suitcase around for frequent travelers who want to spend $200-300 max on a carry-on suitcase.",

Depending on the airline it is 2-4 inches too long. Had I known this, I would not have purchased this bag, but we have it, we use it for checked baggage and it is great quality.
