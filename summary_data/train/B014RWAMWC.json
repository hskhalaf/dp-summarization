With that extension cable, my wifi would disconnect every time I tried to download anything. With this new amazonbasics cable, I can download all day to my hearts content without a single hiccup!! The funny thing is that this amazonbasics cable is about half the price of 'cablematters'. Go figure, cheaper is better here haha.",

      "text": "I have been using a USB cable purchased from a chain store. I was constantly getting a power surge message and it finally failed. When we use laptops on our laps, there is torque on any cable connected as the cable droops off our laps (duh). So the quality of the connectors really matters. This AmazonBasics USB 3.0 Extension Cable - A-Male to A-Female Adapter Cord- 9.8 Feet has very sturdy connectors at both ends. And the connection from the USB component to the cable is also sturdy. This is much better (and cost less) than my first cable. Thanks, Amazon...",

Very affordable fix instead of trying to get a more expensive headset. Highly recommended USB extension for any devices.",
