The hard drive is too small, so as soon as there is an update - the hard drive is not large enough to cope (even if you delete everything you possibly can). What is worse is you cannot use a USB drive to resolve the issue. Whilst they seem a great buy (and work perfectly until there is a Windows update) ... they are impossible to keep updated (and therefore secure etc). IMO these items are not fit for purpose. I will happily correct this if HP can explain how it's done (something I've not found from hours of googling, various attempts etc)",

Most of all, both HP and Amazon should warn buyers that over 25GB, out of a total 30GB, are taken by the default Windows 10 system. That leaves you with less than 5GB storage. After a normal 3 months use and storage of a few photos and videos, it is almost full. Windows will permanently ask you to erase files, in order to be able to update its system. The rest is OK (design, weight, hardware, ecc).",

Microsoft won't let you quietly ignore updates any longer so you are constantly pestered to perform updates that will fail. Wiping and reinstalling a fresh copy of Windows saved a little space, but Windows creates a lot of junk files that are hard to identify and disk cleanup wont sort. Ultimately this device is just not suitable for running Windows 10.",
