      "text": "good surface to mount it. One small problem is that while the jaws have a cam lever to actuate the jaws you need an allen wrench to rotate the jaws. I have it mounted at waist height to a cabinet and rotate the jaws to clamp to the angled down tube of my bike. The clamp is placed so I can sit on a bench for work, including truing the tires and that works well. However, when I change sides on the bike I need to rotate the jaws, a bother with a wrench. An nice, easy and fairly cheap fix is to replace the bolt with a seat post quick release.",

Is the picture you will see a gap that gap is where it gets tightened around the orange pipe. But as you tighten it the plastic bores through from the Allen bolt and nut. Theirs no washers to prevent this from happening. This is the case with all bolts going through the plastic bracket. Also the adapter where the orange pipe connects to the plastic piece that slides on the wall bracket has no groves to prevent the pipe from spinning freely. Simple fix if the manufacturer added groves or notches to prevent uncontrolled spin.",

      "text": "Pros: - Solid construction; the clamp and mechanism are both very sturdy - Comes off the wall when not in use - Wow, that price is low. Cons: - If you don't balance the weight of the bike in the clamp, the arm may rotate until gravity achieves the balance itself, no matter how tight the bolts are. For this reason, I have given this workstand only 4 stars. Other notes: - The base is 5 inches wide, and 6 inches tall. - The bolts holding the arm can be loosened to rotate the arm. It comes with the proper size hex keys with which to make these adjustments, but they are standard sizes.",

My bike has a large frame tube (65 MM) I carefully measured before ordering, and noted that the description claims that it fits up to a 75 MM tube. Further, because of the unarticulated design of the jaws, they don't remain parallel at wide openings, so won't properly grip a wide tube. In short, even with the jaw wide-open, it simply doesn't fit my bike because the clamp doesn't match it's advertised specifications. So I reluctantly returned it.",
