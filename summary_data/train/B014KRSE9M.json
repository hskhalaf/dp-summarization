Both the duck and salmon worked wonders. They can easily be broken into smaller bits too if you want to save some for later. Funny story is after I left, the cat found one in it's wrapper and worked his way through it to get the jerky while everyone was asleep. You might want to hide them in a drawer. This isn't a cat that typically goes crazy for food so these must have made quite an impression.",
