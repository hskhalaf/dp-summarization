I dont expect anything that is made in China to be worth more than something that is made in Japan or the USA. Another reviewer stated that Dewalt had stopped making these in the USA or change supplier and they did not last as long as the ones made in the USA. I have ordered the Evolution Power Tools equivalent. I just had the hope that Dewalt had a trial run and came back to the USA blades. LET US NOT PAY THESE BIG NAMES, BIG MONEY FOR PRODUCTS THEY MAKE CHEAPLY IN CHINA WITH QUESTIONABLE QUALITY!",

Unfortunately, after using Chinese made blades before finding the US made DWA7747 , I'm expecting this Chinese blade to now produce the same sub par life and low quality cuts as all other Chinese blades produced. Nice job DeWalt on showing your true colors, not Black and Yellow but Red and Yellow.",

Mostly worth it anyway because I had some small I-beams (W6x12), a dozen 2x4x1/4\", and some 1\" flat bar that needed cut and it would have been hard to do it any other way.... Amazing while it lasted, now I'm going to try the MK Morse one which is made in the USA like this DeWalt blade used to be and hopefully that can last me through the rest of my shipping container house project!",

My grinding after every cut has been \"cut\" down to almost none which saves me all kinds of time. I've only had this blade for a week but I would recommend this purchase to anyone using abrasive wheels. I'm amazed and unless this blade fails right away I won't be going back to abrasive wheels any time soon.",
