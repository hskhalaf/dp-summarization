This has happened with various primers: Lanco\u0302me pro base, Laura Gellier mattifying, benefit poreprofessionals to name a few. I know this can double as a primer but sometimes I want a little more! I have tried waiting 15mins before apply primer but that\u2019s just a thought.

It is good for oily skin. It has a bit of alcohol in it, which has the advantage that the moisturizer dries quickly, but could be bad depending on your skin sensitivity.",
