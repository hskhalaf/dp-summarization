The small was very constricting and perfect for intense exercise like running. However, I wanted to wear it regularly (and I didn't want the constant tight feel) so I returned the small and ordered a medium. The medium definitely is looser and would not work well for running, but is perfect for light to moderate activity (yoga, cardio) and daily wear. Overall, if you're participating in strenuous or intense activity like a marathon, order your true size for maximum support. If you just want to wear it day-to-day like me without feeling constricted, order a size up.",

It's smooth without being slippery, and there's zero chafing. 3) It doesn't have a bunch of extra stuff. I can't stand the sports bras with zippers (owwww!) or unnecessarty pads that end up crumpled into a wad after one wash. It's a one-piece, no-fuss, perfectly supportive sports bra.

I am a tiny gal, 5'2\" and 110 pounds, and it is so difficult to get off. After half a day of classes, biking, and MMA, I already feel uncomfortable and constricted. I would definitely get a medium next time I were to purchase a Nike sports bra. It is my last resort of a sports bra in my collection, when the others are in the wash.",
