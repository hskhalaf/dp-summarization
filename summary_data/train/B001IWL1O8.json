I can't say much about the other stuff out there, but this has worked great, and I will continue to use it.",

I'd suggest changing your transmission oil every 30k miles to be on the safe side, considering its really cheap and makes your shifts nice and smooth once again. I've never had any issues with metal flakes or grinding with either fluid, so they both work well.
