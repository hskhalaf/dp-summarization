I have a 3month old daughter who loves the water an I was having to hold her bc she is still to tiny for your typical baby floats.

He does get wet which does not bother me because I want him used to the water. It floats nicely and I can slowly glide him through the water with ease. Everyone who sees this float is very impressed!!",

The incline of the seat is comfortable positioning for him to float safely. I love that it keeps him dry and has handles for us to keep him close with ease. The sun canopy can easily be adjusted with the snap closures.",
