I realized that most often I had to pull my computer forward and turn it just to insert/remove my old memory card reader, this reader with the usb cable is invaluable. It\u2019s also convenient to have SD, MicroSD etc all available at the same time without adapters or multiple readers. It\u2019s also proven very fast so far. Granted I only took short video clips to test this, but transfering video was instant with the usb 3.0. I\u2019m very satisfied with mine, and would recommend it.",

This one works just fine--it works perfectly copying large RAW files directly from an SD card I have onto my computer for post-processing. The USB 3 speeds show a marked improvement over transferring over USB 2.0--much faster on the order of 1/4 of the time needed. I like the fact that this comes with a 12\" cable instead of the 2\" pigtail obligating you to buy an extension. Will keep this at 4 stars because the 1st one promptly smoked and died when plugged in.",

      "text": "This reader replaced a unit that had Maxell's name on it, likely as a promotional item; while the older device worked, it would periodically lose its connection with my Windows 10 laptop and my Surface 3, probably due to an issue with its cable. The Ugreen feels solidly constructed with a nice thick USB 3.0 cable; once I plugged into my devices, it was instantly recognized and configured. Its connection remains solid as a rock, and it read my SDHC cards from both of my cameras without any issue. What more could I ask?",

Double sided tape to attach it to something should solve that.
