Otherwise I\u2019m quite pleased so far. Quality is good. Unit is quiet. Heats up fast. WiFi was easy to set up, stays connected and reconnects automatically after power interruption. Will edit this later if for some reason it fails to perform when the temps drop in the next few weeks. Mid winter update : it\u2019s still great. Happy with it and would buy again.",

I attached the legs so it could be more portable, but it appears it will easily attach to the wall as well. I was pleasantly surprised by how much heat it generates. The thermostat allows it to shut off when it's reached the desired temperature so that it doesn't run continually.",

The included level made it incredibly easy to mount and keep out of reach of our wandering toddler. I will definitely be buying more for the rest of my house! Update: after several months of use, i can now see that my winter electric bills on average have been about 13% than last year using other space heaters, and our home is much more comfortable! Ive bought two so far and will be buying more for other rooms of my house!",

Overall, I'll keep it as it's small and easy to have in a room, it does heat ok, just not as well as they suggest, and because returns are too much work, but I wish I'd have purchased a different heater. :(",

The unit takes time to heat a room (several hours if you are starting with a room ~40 degrees F), but ultimately performs excellently and smoothly. There is no odor, noise is appropriate (not too loud), and it simply works just like a standard thermostat-regulated heater (not a space heater that requires constant manual fine-tuning on an arbitrary dial).

      "text": "What a great unit (bought two, wifi enabled). Compact, designed well, and great heat output. Installation is a breeze. Comes with a pre holed/level screw placement. Line it up pop a couple screws in. I have a 1000sqft room with 2 of these guys and it keeps the temp exactly where I need it. For the people saying it cant even warm a <400sqft area I suggest you insulate, put in a ceiling fan to direct the heat back down etc. The unit heats. Great product, going to get another.",

This keeps my garage at 60 with no problem. They roughly cost about $20 a month for electricity. I love the fact i can tell google to turn heat on or off, Al what temperature the room is, raise and lower the heat and turn the heater on an hour before i get home. The only feature i wish it had was an energy monitor that i added to monitor the power usage.",

Unplugged it and went to pick it up and the handle was really really hot. I'm lucky it didnt catch on fire and burn my house down. The outside is made with a cheap plastic material, so imagine what the inside is made out of.",

Just the right noise level for my sons nursery. Not to Loud but it does make a little bit of noise. I really like it and I will probably be buying more of them. Also love that I can co York it from my phone.",
