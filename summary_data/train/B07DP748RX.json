Hope it continues to work, and hope someone finds this useful.",

Needles in two lengths, so that you can work on small-diameter things with the shorter tips, but for larger things, have the longer tips. Three lengths of cables... which are so super tiny! Multiple keys and a pair of end stoppers. And really well designed cases to hold all these tiny things. The black snap pouch holds the needle tips securely . The red zipper pouch holds the black case with needles and the cables; in a second smaller pocket, the tiny accessories can be stored. Really love this. It would be a great gift for knitters who work with small-gauge things.",

The only complaint would be I wish this set would come with the silicone heart to make tightening and loosening the needle cable join easier.",
