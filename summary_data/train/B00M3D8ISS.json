While this game is not ground breaking like th original, it is fun, and if you can, take some time and play Doom in VR. WOW!!!",

The controls feel surprisingly tight and responsive, and the graphics are wonderful as well. The singleplayer story is a BLAST, though multiplayer is a bit... meh. They tried to integrate too many elements of other shooters (CoD, Halo) to appeal to a mass audience and it didn't work out well. To be fair, it was developed by Id - Id's multiplayer team was busy working on the new Quake. Id's multiplayer team has come back to patch up the game, so multiplayer may improve.",
