You use Windows Media Player to manage your music and down-load it to the player and the Sansa simply plays what you've loaded. No extra software required, just drag & drop into the player; cool! The player is VERY light weight and straight forward to use. I also realy like the capability to upgrade it later on by adding an SD card - nice! Pros: Light weight Easy to use No extra software Upgradeable Replaceable - AAA battery Cons: Battery door seems a bit flimsy (use the case provided to protect this)",

Using CD quality I could only have fit half of that without using an expansion card, another great feature of the device. The player comes loaded with accessories too, including a sync cable (that works great with Window's Media Player's synchronization and straight drag-and-drop), a clear protective case, an armband, and a pair of in-ear earphones that have terrific quality. It also features an FM receiver. I highly recommend this player to anyone looking for a robust, expandible MP3/WMA player loaded with accessories at a great price.",

My only problem is that to go to the radio feature you have to select it in the menu... wouldn't be a problem if the menu was in english. It's in chinese or korean or vietnamese or something. I'm going to be contacting the company to see if this can be changed, or at least to get a translation so I can use it.",

The complaints about the armband case are puzzling - it's tight, but you just need to push it down from the top rather than pull it - comes right out! Maybe my MP3 tastes are not as advanced as some of the other reviewers but I think this is a great expandable player at a very affordable price.",

Another thing: where can you get it new for less than $50?",

Another big plus is the arm band that comes with it so it perfect for running or walking and you don't have to stuff it in a pocket. The one downside is that you can't create a playlist and have to thumb through the songs manually. But it is easily compatible with Realplayer and a real find for the money.",

The navigation works out pretty well, but the yes/no on settings & stuff is a bit hard to get used to. And I just love the fact that I can load up a spare SD card with someone else's music, then take it out when I'm done. Overall, I think I'll like this. I originally had a negative review about this product, but I added this one once I figured out how to adjust the sound it was very good.",

I'd recommend spending $10 and buying a new pair -Only 493/512mb are available to save songs to",
