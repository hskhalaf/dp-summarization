I will continue buying the coconut one for years to come, however I advise everyone to stay away from the Strawberry flavor. I'm excited to try Cookies & Cream next :)",

I'm not that into sweet though, so for me, it is a bit too sweet.

Looking on the ingredients i think its fair to say this is a very clean protein powder. I did research it before buying and im glad i did. Another important thing is that it does not hurt my stomach any at all. I have acid refulx and this protein powder goes down easily and stays down. Highly recommended, cant wait to drink some more.",

I\u2019ve used it in a lot of frozen fruit smoothies. On its own with ice and a frozen banana, it basically is like eating guilt-free ice cream! I love that it doesn\u2019t have any carbs, and is a great way for me to meet my macros at the end of the day.",

My favorite flavor was peanut butter and cookies n cream! but I suggest you try them all, they are all pretty good. The Strawberry one was a little bit too sweet for me but other than that they are all delicious and blend very well.",
