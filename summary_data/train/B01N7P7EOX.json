Rhino\u2019s instructional video was a little more helpful but not much. Watched another instructional video with much more detailed instruction on how to use ratchet straps. After that I have had no problems using these straps. Easy to thread, tighten, and loosen. Would definitely recommend if your looking for quality tie downs. Just redo the video to make it clearer for first time users.",

I had to look up a Youtube video on how to use them, but once you get the hang of it they're super easy to use and extremely secure. I used these to tie down a roof bag for a trip and they were just great. I carry them around in the trunk of my car and I am sure they'll get a lot of use. The straps themselves are very substantial and strong, and the hardware is simple to use but well made, I had no worries about them coming loose even when hanging off of them to test them.",

I have different straps, that are supposedly \"weaker\", that I've used, hauling much heavier things, travelling at highway speeds that have never come apart. I was excited to get these new straps in because I only have 10ft straps and the extra 5ft is great. I was very let down by this experience.",

I contacted them and they sent me a new complete set, which was great, but just as cheaply made. Two uses later, another strap snapped.

Those make getting things strapped down much easier, especially when alone without someone to hold it in place. Both sets have been great and the included bag and straps complete a nice kit. Also having the Velcro keepers to keep things organized is nice too. I would buy them again.",

The ratcheting mechanism is more precise and releases easier than cheaper straps made in China. I gladly pay more for American made products that outperform their foreign competitors; the better product is cheaper in the long run and my purchases keep Americans employed.",

But in an emergency last weekend, we actually used these to tow our Subaru Forester out of a steep, rocky incline, on a 4x4 road. We underestimated how difficult the off-roading would be, and our friends had to tow us out with their 4runner. We didn't have any tow straps, but luckily, these worked in a pinch. These are rated for 1,823lb, but my Forester weighs about 3,500, plus a full car of camping gear, and the straps didn't snap or break. The material covering the hooks got worn down, obviously, due to the extreme load... but oh man. These are incredible.",

Sometimes on the cheap straps after you've used them a few times the releases get to where they will kinda go cockeyed but these seem to stay square. I'll probably keep buying rhino stuff. Price is good and the products are legit. Kids stole the rhino stickers for the Barbie 4 wheeler so they dig it too.",

If I ever think I need more than 4 straps, I'll be sure to get these exact same straps again! Interested in seeing what else this company makes based on the quality I saw from these straps.",
