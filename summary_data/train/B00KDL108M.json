With silk- (and satin- but she said silk is better) your hair will slide. This damage can also happen with car headrests. The pillowcase is very soft and nice. Now I just need one for my car!

Now it\u2019s a scratchy remnant of what it used to be and I can\u2019t believe I paid over $20 for it. I saw some decent ones for 9.99 on amazon, going with these next time just in case.",

Very happy with my purchase! (Originally got one non-dyed pillow case, I bought another one!)",

I'd say my hair is a bit less frizzy too, although I changed product around the same time as I got the pillowcase so I can't say for certain which it is.",

I made the mistake of throwing this pillowcase in the wash and didn\u2019t take it out before my husband dried it, so I feel like drying it did change the feel of the fabric a bit. I would recommend using a solid white pillow cover under it because if your pillow has patterns on it or texture, it WILL show through - at least if you get the white one.",
