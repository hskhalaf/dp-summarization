Second, I tried to play Sonic 1 and 2 (the only reason I bought this console) and all it allows me to do is watch demos of levels being played without me touching any buttons. The controller works in that I am allowed to pick which game to play, but once I hit play none of my controller keys work and the demo videos just keep playing. It can\u2019t be me doing something wrong as I chose Sonic and Knuckles the same way and it actually allows me to play that one. Buyer beware!",

I ordered because the included controllers are wireless, and it does allow you to play real Genesis cartridges, if you've got them. Unfortunately, the included games are barely playable.
