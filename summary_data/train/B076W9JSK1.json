Was very frustrated... just saw the map on the amazon item marketing and assumed the unit was a chart plotter and sonar combo. My mistake.. .but I still rated it low for false advertising. I would have sent it back but it was installed and after the 30 day return policy before I ran my boat...",

I don't need charts on our inland lakes, so saving several hundred over the chart versions from Lowrance, Hummingbird, and Garmin was fine with me. The Quickdraw feature is getting a workout mapping our lake where commercial charts don't exist anyway.",
