This phone is on all the lists of \"Best Phones of 2018\"....not best phones for the price, best phones period...so I figured what the hell take a chance. Holy cow, may be my best phone ever. Great camera, great display, it's fast and peppy, and I love it! I smile to myself every time I think about how much money I saved, but completely aside from the money it's a great phone.

However, it does not connect with or even detect some Bluetooth devices - they don't even appear on the list of paired or available devices when you wish to connect. I own a Moto G4, also purchased from Amazon, which does not have this problem (which is why I purchased the G6), and I wonder if the problem is in the G6 software or the hardware, but whereever it is, it's a serious flaw unless you have no plans to use Bluetooth. I'm hoping that it will eventually be corrected.",

Low light photos are really good for a budget phone Finger print reader Great screen for the price Expandable SD System is repsonsive and seem fast enough for me. Seems durable. Cons No support for Google Pay Would really hope the next budget phone from them adds NFC. Other than that this phone does everything I want.",
