The second one had a corner lift off and got full of lint, which made it hard to see and didn't stay on. I registered for the lifetime warranty so when I put the 3rd one on I emailed the company about my disappointment. I was promptly offered a replacement or refund. I took the refund and will look for another product since I don't want to go through 2 every month.",

I did this before going to sleep so that I wouldn't be tempted to touch it and so far so good! It fits very nicely and there are no bubbles. The fact that it comes with 5 others just in case is great too. I would reccommend this to friends!",

The installation was a mess, you have to watch a video. Why is that necessary for something as simple as applying a screen protector? In order to apply you must spray it down with solution. You get six in a pack because it may take you two to three tries to get it on correctly. Ten minutes to complete a task that should have taken one is a bit of a hassle. Also, the finish of the screen is cloudy. Would not recommend.",
