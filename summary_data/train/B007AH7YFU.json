      "text": "Overall, these headphones are great for their price, but make sure you buy them new. I bought a used pair and received a pair that had a crinkle in the diaphragm. Because Focal has designed the diaphragms of these headphones to be relatively hard, any damage to them is irreversible. There was a noticeable crinkling sound (imagine someone crinkling a candy wrapper) with the volume only turned halfway up. That's the risk you take buying used, I suppose. I now own the Focal Spirit Professionals, which are excellent \u2013 these headphones are quite good for their price, but I'd recommend buying new just to be safe.",

There was clearly something wrong with the sound. No base or clarity whatsoever. I exchanged them for another pair that developed a rattling on the left side within a couple of weeks. These were replaced in February. I have had no issues with the current headphones and I have been enjoying absolutely incredible sound. It is open, distinct, and entirely immersive. While it has been a journey, i am completely satisfied with my purchase.",

I'd say they're not quite as good as the NAD HP50s in terms of their ability to handle a lot of types of sound simultaneously, and they don't sound quite as \"open,\" but they do have slightly punchier bass and do a good job reproducing music accurately and with a slight injection of fun. Would recommend to a traveler.",

Unfortunately their reviews very rarely test the durability of a product. The durability of a product is tested by the same consumers which takes some time. Too bad I rushed into buying this set of headphones which have not been on the market for that long.",

The headphones were purchased in the USA (7 June 2012) during my vacation or home leave. I hand carried the headphones on my return trip to work in Indonesia. I want to return for repair or replacement. This will be another experience, I'm sure. Terre",

BEFORE second set had problem, the sound was a bit tinny, but the sound was very precise, sharp, and spacious....They are very good for Jazz and Electronicas....the voise is a bit shallow sometimes..... I assume they release second release from factory in China (Yuk!!!!)....because Apple stores, and other Hi-Fi shops didn't have them in stock.....perhaps Focal recalled the products....",
