We played the game with 12 people (6 people each team). It was an instant hit. Highly recommend the game! I would suggest buying small dental retractors if you are planning on having kids play the game. The retractors that come with the game are pretty big; I am not sure what size they are but grown men had a difficult time putting them on.",

No one wanted anything to do with it till I put in the mouthpiece, then everyone was laughing so hard we could hardly make it through a round. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Tip: Make sure you brush your teeth and have a spit towel handy. Also look close at the picture on the back of the box to make sure you don't try to insert the mouthpiece backwards.",

We found the mouth pieces very easy to put in, and the directions were simple. We had a great night full of lots of laughs. My only complaint is that by the second time we played the game with my husband's family, we already had some of the answers memorized. I wish it came with more cards.

    "title": "Speak Out Game (with 10 Mouthpieces)",
    "description": "Get ready to be doubled over with laughter with this ridiculous mouthpiece challenge game! The Speak Out game brings friends and family together for laugh-out-loud fun as players try to say different phrases while wearing a mouthpiece that won't let them shut their mouth. In the Speak Out game, players draw from the deck and read the phrase as best as they can, but it's not so easy to do when the mouthpiece is hindering them from forming words correctly. The timer counts down as players try to say phrases such as \"he's my stealthy pet ferret name Garrett\", \"slow down, you careless clown\", or \"pelicans love pollywog falafels.\" The laughter continues as players try to decipher what in the world their teammate is trying to say, and must correctly guess the phrase in order to earn the card. The team with the most cards at the end of the game wins. The Speak Out game includes 200 double-sided cards, 10 mouthpieces, and a timer.
