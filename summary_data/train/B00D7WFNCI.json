It has seen many washes, sweaty butts, and hours sitting in the sun light, yet the only thing that has failed is the piece you'd expect, the plastic. If I really wanted, I could keep going with my original, but I've decided to treat myself. This thing is perfect in size, allowing you to keep everything you need and takes up minimal room while doing it. See you guys in another 4 years.",

This may just be that it is new. The -1 star is because of the Swiss-style button on the magnetic clip. As was mentioned, it is quite thick and completely unnecessary.
