They aren't as big as some rentals I've had which were 11s, so that is a plus. I've worn them twice now and they have been comfortable with the right socks and haven't really gotten any major scuffs or damage, so they seem pretty sturdy.",

But the boot was annoying the back of my calves by the end of the day. They are more comfortable when worn not to tight. Got the job done and the seem a good enough quality to last for years",
