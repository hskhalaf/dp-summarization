      "text": "My absolute favorite pair of headphones! These were a runner up in a Wirecutter Under $100 category one year and I bought them on that recommendation. They produce the best sound of any headphones in this price category and I've gone through at least 3 other pairs including Wirecutter's topic pick, the Brainwavz Delta. The Kransens are better in my opinion. Strong bass but not overpowering, clear and rich sound in every range. The earbuds click together to reduce tangle and the other end has an appendage to tie it together. Cons: The sound that travels up the cords is a little louder than other headphones I've used, but it's not unbearable.",

The wrap conveniently, and this kevlar (I think it was kevlar...) covering on the wire is absolutely brilliant, I have not had them tear or start to rip, and I carry them around with me all over the place!",

      "text": "Probably the most intelligently-designed headphones I have ever owned. I have never seen a pair of headphones with a more intelligently designed means of preventing the tangling of left-and-right buds, since they clip together, nor the integrated cable tie built into the plug to keep them managed. The plug did not quite seat in the headphone jack of my phone, but a little trimming with an exacto knife solved the connection issues. The buds are a mite on the large side, which means that people who don't have a nice large crook for the buds to rest in like I do might want to look at the smaller Urbanears Bagis. I might get those next, if and when these die.",

When I press the remote, I get noise in my ear, but no status on phone. Other mic/remote earphones work with my phone. Go figure. I give the earphones five stars for use as earphones, zero stars as a headset. I like the sound and durability enough to recommend them despite this failing, but I would not have bought them without this feature initially.",

Great headphones, I love the notch in the strain protector to keep them from coming unwound in my pack. The cloth cord protector keeps them from getting snagged or stuck. Great, rich deep audio quality/tone. Only down side is the ball joint that splits the cable is rock hard and will poke your sternum.",

You will have many options for USD50 price range so, the decision was really difficult but I'm satisfied with this purchase. After burning a while (two nights of continuous playing) the sound of this earphones improved a lot. Very nice design and good quality components. The only complain it's the same for Sennheiser's earphones: the cable transmit some frictional noise while you are walking. But besides that, I'm happy with this earphones.",

They have perfect noise isolation (the sound won't bleed out so others can hear), and they are super cheap. Truly epic headphones. Everyone that comes into Best Buy - where I work - I always recommend these headphones. Congrats UE on yet another killer in-ear set. GET THESE NOW.",

Most notably is most all bass is not played with out the play/pause button held in at all times on the remote. You can resolve this by wrapping a twist tie around the button to hold it down at all times but you shouldn't have to do this.",
