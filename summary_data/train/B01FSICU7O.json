      "text": "These are such adorable little cups. They're only about 8 oz, so they don't hold a whole lot, which is pretty standard for a champagne flute. They do have a little indent sort of near the middle, where you would hold the glass. So I think that's why it's there, to give you a little grip on the glass itself. The bottom is very slid and sturdy. The glass gets more fragile as it gets to the top. All of mine came intact and there were no stickers on the bottom of the glass (so no annoying residue to clean off). Happy to have these in my collection.",

      "text": "I just recently ordered these for a champagne brunch I host four times a year for my girlfriends. I already have a number of stemmed champagne flutes; however, I was very surprised that many of the ladies preferred the stemless glasses over the ones with the stems. I originally ordered them simply because they were affordable and easy to store, the stemless aspect was a preference my guests had that I wasn't aware of. My beef with all stemless glasses is that it warms the chilled beverage faster than stemmed glasses simply because of how you have to hold the glass. The warmth of your hand speeds up the warming of the beverage so drink fast lol...",

Otherwise, I don\u2019t believe casual use would have caused damage. Just comes in a plain brown box.... nice white elephant gift. Wouldn\u2019t say it comes in a nice giftable box though.",
