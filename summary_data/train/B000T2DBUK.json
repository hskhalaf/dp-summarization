Desperate to increase the available floor space in my laundry room I searched for a solution for storing my weekly stack of newspaper/paper for recycling. The basket I've used for years (16\"x19\"x 9\" high) was just the right size for stacking newspapers, but the footprint of the basket has always been annoying (see photo of rack vs basket). This rack is perfect! It holds newspapers, cardboard, and other paper flotsam/jetsam securely, yet the footprint is next to nothing! I am very satisfied.",

I put it along side my tv stand and no longer have to clutter up the stand ;) The only thing I can say negative about this product is that you can't put more than say, 10-12 magazines in this without it looking just way bulky.. If you want to hold more magazines, I recommend going with a flat bottomed model.. Overall for me, this is a good product at a great price.. You won't be upset with the purchase..",

One practical aspect of the rack is that it is large and deep, but does not take up a lot of room from one side to the other...I guess it is longer than wide. This means it can be tucked into a small space and hold quite a bit of magazines and newspaper. The finish and the metal seem durable, there are floor protectors on the legs, and it is, in our opinion, an unbeatable value for the $13. price tag!",

Only downside is that smaller mags like 'Prevention' need to be put in rack carefully since they can more easily fall out. Only reason rack didn't get 5 stars is because there was no color choice so I had to paint it to blend in with rest of my bathroom. Not a big issue so I'd give 4.5 Stars if I could.",

They didn't have black bolts so I also purchased black caps for the bolt heads. Total of $8 but made the mounting look nice. I agree with another reviewer that having specific slots for the mounting screws would be a nice improvement, but happy with finished product. It holds more magazines then should ever accumulate in a restroom!",
