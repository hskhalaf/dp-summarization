The replacement for that came a week later with one of the flaps completely dented it I didn\u2019t even take it out of the box. I just want a good looking piece. Hopefully third time is a charm if not unfortunately I will be looking elsewhere. Beautiful item poor construction and packaging.",

I was able to get rid of it with bleach spray. After washing the inside liner, one of them started to unravel after we took it out of the dryer. Definitely not the best quality product.",

This one is a very good size, each side holds a large load of clothes. And best of all, when you pull the clothes out, the liner doesn't come out! It is a removable liner, but it's nice to not fight with it every time I wash a load of laundry! Very pleased with this purchase!",
