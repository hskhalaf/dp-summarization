I was so excited to get this product and now I wish I had never bought it. What is even worse is apparently this is a problem Microsoft is aware of but are there any solutions other than pay them to replace the entire unit - NO. But they continue to sell it even with the known battery problems. I would NOT RECOMMEND this product to anyone. To have to in essence pay for it twice in 6 months is outrageous. What a HUGE disappointment.",

The aspect ratio of 3:2 makes it the best way possible to read comics digitally. A US comic single page size has an aspect ratio of approx. 1.53, and the SP3 comes closest at 1.50!",

I went on the internet and found out that this is a known common problem with the Surface. Luckily I was able to find the process to get the Surface to turn on, but when you spend $800 for a Surface it would be nice if Microsoft actually made sure they worked properly. Considering the Surface has been out for awhile and this is a known problem Micorsoft could of and should have fixed this issue.",
