You get an extremely long working time with the polish as well. I have actually used this outside in the heat on a hood with fantastic results and a long work time and NO dusting which is a huge plus for me. A product like Meguiars M105 works well but covers your car in dust! This will be a staple in my business!",

It is more aggressive and really helped me eliminate my etched water spots. This car was only one year old and already had horrible water spot problems. I purchased the Griot's buffer, fast correcting cream, and finishing sealant. With a little patience and work my paint is fixed. For those hesitating, don't! I'm telling you I tried just a cleaner wax and it did nothing for my spots but the correction cream did the trick. Good stuff!",

Can buff on this stuff all day, great working cycle. One of the best compounds out there. The boss line is phenomenal. This compound is in my top 5.

The first step after cleaning the vehicle was the Griot's Fast Correcting Cream with the Random Orbital Buffer. After repeated steps, 90% of the scratch was gone! In the next step, I used the Finishing Sealant with the appropriate black colored pad. That removed the additional amount of the scratch. I topped it off with carnauba wax and it looks amazing!

    "description": "Size:16 OunceIf your paint is tore up from the floor up our BOSS Fast Correcting Cream will make quick work of removing the most severe defects, adding depth and clarity to your paint. This is the bottle you reach for when you have a lot of serious scratches, swirls, and oxidation then, for future polishing sessions, you will likely move to a less aggressive formula as you prepare your paint for perfecting and sealing. A BOSS Fast Correcting Foam Pad or BOSS Microfiber Pad, our most aggressive BOSS pads, are recommended for use with BOSS Fast Correcting Cream. However, the Best Of Show System is designed so you can use a softer BOSS pad to reduce the aggressiveness of the cream. We\u2019ve poured 25 years of pursuing perfection in each bottle of BOSS cream we produce so you can cut to the chase when it comes your paint correction journey.",
