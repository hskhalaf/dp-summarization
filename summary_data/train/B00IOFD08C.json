The shredder allowed me to get it done all in a few hours on the same day. It was quiet enough that I could watch TV while shredding and I didn't have an issue with it over heating. It has a fan and it would kick on if it started to get hot. Very happy with it and worth the money.",

The very limited \"Instruction Manual\" did not address a flashing red power light and a halted shredder, nor did it include any contact information. Google and Amazon pointed to a manufacturer in China and a US retailer with a forwarding.com phone mailbox. As it was out of warranty, the Amazon representative said I would probably get nowhere. I've faithfully maintained this equipment with regular lubricating and never overfeed it. It's supposed to have mechanisms built in for eliminating the most common problems with shredders (jam protection, auto-reverse). None of these has ever kicked in.",

I wanted it to have a descent duty cycle and be quiet...shhhh! This excels at both. The best is how quiet it is since so many shredders are horribly loud, even $100+ units. Yea, this was about $150 the quiet and durability make it worth it. And how do they get such a long duty cycle allowing you to run it for an hour before a possible cool down?...simply by adding a fan to the shredder motor so it cools as it shreds.

There's no way to open up the shredder to attempt to repair it, and there's no easy way to return the shredder because the company's based in China. Even if customer service were useful, there's no way I'm paying to ship a 23-pound shredder overseas. It's a $150+ paperweight now.

Sprayed one page with WD40 as it was going through per bag. Very quiet. Definitely recommended.",

It's still new so I can't testify to it's longevity, but so far I'm very happy with it. It was worth it to spend more.",
