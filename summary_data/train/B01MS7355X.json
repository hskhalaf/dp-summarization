      "text": "I have been buying burt's bees baby shampoo & wash for over 5 years now! I originally bought it for my newborn but started using it myself as a gentle body wash. I love that it's 99% natural ingredients, has a minimal nice smell and this pump style bottle is super convenient. I read some negative reviews prior to purchasing stating the product had been diluted. I compared my bottles consistency to the store and it looked exactly the same so I wouldn't be concerned about that issue. I recommend this style bottle if you have children as they tend to dump too much out of the pour spout type.",
