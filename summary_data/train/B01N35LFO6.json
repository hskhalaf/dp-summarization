Decided to give Gator a try since Gorilla was still going. Well, Gator feet were eaten off immediately. About week later the head is slowly being eaten. On the upside, my Dobermans poop is easy to identify at the dog park. It has flecks of bright green rubber in it. For aggressive chewers stick to the Gorilla.",

For whatever reason, he spent a lot of time licking this in addition to chewing. Very pleased overall.",

I did try the kibble inside early on, but there's no way for a dog (or a human) to get it out, so, I don't use that feature. Three blue monkeys came in the package so there's always one handy.

      "title": "BEST fetch toy ever!!",
      "text": "Great toy for the dog who can't get enough \"play fetch' time. Best thing about the gorilla is, the dog doesn't know which way the toy will bounce so he never gets bored. This toy is great for the owner with shoulder problems because you just have to hit the ground with gorilla & the toy does most of the work. Not for most indoor use, unless there's nothing to break in the room. if you've that, then this toy will keep your dog happy regardless of weather outside",

It is easily washed with soap and water, and he's yet to be able to even make it look like it's been chewed on.",

I decided to try it because she needed something for her stinky breath and this got very good reviews. She has had this for over a week, chewing it constantly, and has barely made a dent! Also, her breath is much fresher! I will definitely buy this again when she wears it out but it\u2019s looking like that will be a while from now. Yay!
