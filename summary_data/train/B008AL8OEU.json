The first month while using it it would randomly just turn off even though the propane tank was full. But about a month later it is now to the point where we can't even get it to stay lit for more than 5 minutes at a time. It's not hard to get it going again but it's incredibly annoying when you're trying to relax by it. If it worked properly I'd give it 5 stars but unfortunately I can't do that at this time.",

My husband bought a decent cover for the unit and covered the top pieces with 4 pieces of floor tile applied with construction adhesive from our local Home Depot. Bought an additional 1/4\" pack of glass rocks. (colored blue and white). Installed a 1/4\" steel mesh (as seen in other comments) to keep the 1/4\" rocks out of the gap in the burner tray. (he cut ours to 16 1/4 x 16 1/4). Put it all together and it came out really well. We are very satisfied with the product now.",

It is fascinating to watch the flame reflected in them. It also generates a fair amount of heat. I can't wait until the weather improves and we get to use it more.

It does take some time to build it but if you order this on prime and it gets delivered right to your door, thats the trade off. I recommend buying some glass rocks separately, as the ones that come with the fire pit will be a little beat up to due transport. Don't just dump it into the grill, as there will be glass shards and dust at the bottom of the bag. Lastly, this does not give off a ton of heat but it sure does have a quality build.",

My husband and I built it together in one evening, and did not find it hard at all. Some of the previous reviews mentioned the box arriving in poor shape, we did not find this to be our case. We are so pleased. Considering the price, and free shipping, this is a great value. Similar ones at Sears and Orchards were over $600. and we prefer the glass over the lava rocks, so this fit the bill perfectly. Highly recommended.",

It only works 1/5 times and you have to turn it to \"high\" as soon as u get a flame.

The glass that came with it was pretty, but a bit plain. We chose to add some smaller blue glass for more color. We did purchase a rain cover for it as well to protect the finish.
