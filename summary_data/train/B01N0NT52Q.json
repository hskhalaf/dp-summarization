I am experiencing round ligament pain, and I notice my body feels better and haven\u2019t strained any muscles while I wear this band. I make sure to use it when I\u2019m on my feet for long periods of time, on walks, during yoga, cleaning, or at the grocery, and the support really helps. For added support and to hide the band, I tie a pretty scarf around my waste below my belly. This combo has been so helpful during my last trimester. I also like how easy it is to take on and off, especially because I don\u2019t love to sit down while wearing this band.",

      "text": "Love this maternity belt! Bought it at about 20ish weeks for my twin pregnancy and now at 31 weeks I almost never take it off. Helps a ton with lower back pain and supporting my belly. It\u2019s a little scratchy to wear underneath clothes- but I put it over my shirt/pants/dresses and feels amazing. Also helps me with a lot with longer car rides love the mesh as well- keeps it from feeling too hot. Well worth every penny and then some!",

So I found and purchased this one. It helped tremendously. I have a bad back to start with so the weight of the baby was really pulling on me. I was a little worried about the fit because I am bigger in the midsection, but it fit perfect and I had lots of belt to spare. My sister is currently pregnant with her first and the baby is big so I passed it on to her \ud83d\ude01",
