As it was, I overlooked the long and short trestle bars and accused the company of the parts being missing. The company was prompt in sending me the 'missing parts' and as I continued to assemble the bed, found the 'missing parts' mixed in with the bed slats. They were of the same color and about the same length and width. My mistake. The bed is very solid, it looks great. Very satisfied. Just embarrassed for the hard time I gave the company over the 'missing' parts . . . . David Adams Mobile, Alabama",

Stained and perfect looking just like the photos. We were not missing any parts, had no issues putting it together except for the support beam that the directions weren't super clear on, but we figured it out and it has held up well. The bed is high, so a mattress that is on the thin side would be best, no box spring. It looks great, is sturdy and we are very happy with the purchase and the price.",

For some of the positives, I do like the headboard and the storage for books and things. The design is very nice. Be sure to build it in place where you plan Not to move it. This bed will not move easily and if slid across the floor will most likely break.",

The main issue was with the center rail (part 8). The holes were drilled in the wrong spots so the distance between parts 9 didn't not fit properly in step 7. Also part 8 had two sets of holes with anchors for the screws on set large, the other small (for the C and B bolts). They were flipped so they didn't align with the roll slats in step 8. I had to flip the anchors and also drill another hole for the proper distance to make make it all work for part 8.",

Other nice things about this bed include: lots of under bed storage, great stability, and the fact that it has metal thread devices that the securing screws go into, make this bed long lasting, even through multiple re-assemblies! Unfortunately, the first time I purchased this bed, was through a furniture store and I paid $1200 for it. Then I found out a couple years later about Amazon's amazing low price! So beware, this IS the same exact bed you will find in a store, however much cheaper and free delivery on Amazon!",

The draws are wonderful and very sturdy and hold a lot. You will definitely need a step to get into it but we love the height. Enjoy!",

I was afraid the construction quality might be cheap and poorly made but it is moderately easy to put together but it will take 2 people most of the day to finish the project. The instructions are easy to follow but some experience building these types of complex projects is necessary.",
