Before, I was using several products (frizz control, smoothing, straightening, finishing spray), but after having the treatment done, this is the only product I use before blowing out my coase, thick, curly hair. It does not feel as oily as other products, and leaves my hair smooth and frizz free for up to one week. That's hard to accomplish here in Miami. Very pleased with this product and will purchase again.",

I tried it anyway just to see if it worked the same, but it did not. It made my hair look greasy and it was still frizzy. So again, the Coppola Keratin Infusion was great.
