It is strong enought to sit on but the bottom is paper thin and it will come dented... one could only hope it is dented in teh back. In a nutshell... I would not buy it again.",

Mine did not come dented, BUT one latch was completely broken. I just decided to take it off instead of sending it back. I think it is much sturdier than what other reviewers said. In fact, my husband is able to sit on it comfortably to put his socks on. I was able to pack quite a few blankets and extra things inside.",

It is a little small to be a bench used on a regular basis for seating, such as a dining room bench at a table, but perfect for what I needed. From a distance (maybe 5 feet away or more) it looks fantastic and high end. As you get closer, you can tell the rust is manufactured and not necessarily authentic. But only to someone really looking. Love it!",

We do have pets who enjoy sitting on it to see out the window, but unfortunately their claws have snagged the clear plastic protection layer over the seat.
