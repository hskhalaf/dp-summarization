After comparing prices, I hoped this would be a decent one for $20, and I'm more than happy with it.",

You couldn't put your smallest teacup (which I don't have, I like BIG mugs) on the hook and have it hang, it would just be lying on it's side on the counter. I ended up placing my \"tree\" on a container that held the coffee and rigging it up so it wouldn't slide around. It's fine for it's purpose, but I wouldn't have bought if I had known this before hand. All in all, not worth the money.",
