      "text": "I bought a different, plastic ice shaver on Amazon and it lasted exactly 4 months before the motor ran out. I wish I had seen this earlier. Even though it is more expensive than the other one, It is well worth the price. As a person who loves to eat shaved ice plain, I use this several times a day. The remaining ice that gets caught inside does melt and leaves small puddles but I have found a solution (see picture). I just took an inexpensive pan that I bought at Walmart and set the machine inside. At the end of the day I dump out the small amount of water and wipe dry. I highly recommend this product.",

But it is nothing that would stop me from purchasing again... I actually plan on buying another one for my parents for a bday present :-)",
