I was in a local gun store and was trying to piece together enough instruments to get all of my guns clean and before you know it I was well over $100 and started looking for multi kits like this one. I quickly decided to order this kit while standing in the store after realizing that this kit offered approx twice the attachments that most of the kits I was looking at while being half the cost. I have cleaned all of my guns with this and am really happy with the product.",

It did include two empty bottles for lubricants/oil (which we purchased separately). I like this case because it is not bulky or heavy which makes it easy to carry and easy to store away.
