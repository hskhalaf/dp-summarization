Can't wait to see how good those come out. Looking forward to it. If you like gin then I would definitely recommend the homemade gin kit.",

We have already gone through half of the gin she made - really, we don't have a problem ;) as it's both fine for sipping as well as mixing with some of our typical gin cocktails. We're looking forward to making another batch - I am curious to find out if they have additional botanical blends they may use in the future.",

I haven't done anything with mine yet I just wanted to say when I got it the seal on the box was already cut clean with a knife, the cardboard inside was badly damaged so the bottles were clanking together and it came with no invoice. I'm concerned because there is consumables inside of it so make sure to check the package very well before using. Not new condition.",

Unlike the pine needle gins I've had in the past, this made a spicy, complex, botanical gin that paired phenomenally with ginger ale and muddled berries. It only took 2 months for me to run out an order the refill spices to make another batch. I used Three Olives brand vodka the first time around, at the recommendation that a finer bottle isn't needed and it did not disappoint.",

Even with double the recommended amount of vodka, the flavor was over the top for me. (I prefer Plymouth and Larios gins, taste-wise.) As I can harvest my own juniper berries on-site, I will use the kit to adjust the herb levels -- some of which I also grow. The kit gives me all I need to experiment.
