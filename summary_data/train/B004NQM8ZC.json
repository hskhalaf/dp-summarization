It also developed rust on one end that had to removed with metal polish and must be polished every week since I got it. I didn't know if this bar was actually worth the expense when it was ordered, but it is great for shrugs and I like it for squats due to a shoulder injury that won't allow me to shoulder a standard bar. I also use it for light deadlifts; I don't go heavy anymore so I can't evaluate it for anything over 315lbs.",

The knurling is sufficient to give a good grip, but not so deep that it's painful. There is enough room for at least 4 x 45 lbs. Ivanko polyurethane plates & collar per side, but I have not actually loaded the bar to see if a 5th will fit. The chrome finish is not even everywhere, and some of the welds are a little messy but appear to be strong. It appears to be an excellent bar for the price.",

Bar is more compact than expected but for me it's a good thing if limited space is factor. Sleeves are also on the shorter side so if you progress to over 500lbs this bar will not accommodate you. You will definitely pull more weight with this bar versus standard barbell deadlift due to leverage. Also this bar is not rackable so if racking it for heavy pulls shrugs or presses then look for one that's rackable. Overall I'm happy with this purchase and would recommend it.",

I've used it several times now, and it works as you'd expect it to. When you place the bar down on the ground on top of the raised handles, it doesn't sit completely flat, so there's a very slight bit of warpage there, but not a big deal. Otherwise, it seems pretty solid, though I haven't put more than 300 pounds on this thing yet. Still, if I were to buy another bar of this type, I wouldn't hesitate to buy this one again.",
