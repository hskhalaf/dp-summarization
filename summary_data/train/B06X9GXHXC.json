If you have ever seen the cheap socks they sell for leg compression you'll understand that I wanted something warm, and thick for colder months. I was skeptical about the L sizing fits 11 through 13. I am a large WIDE footed 13, and have very large calves compared to most. They went right on. I wore them all day, and to bed that night. Woke up with skinny ankles, which was my hope. So I rather like these socks, and closer to winter will likely buy more pairs. Thanks MudGear folks....",

Didn't overheat my feet on a hot day on the trail. I'm on the more \"mature\" spectrum of age, and they are great for me. I did accidentally dry them and thought I ruined them but they were just fine. I have around 15 pairs of compression socks and these are my favorite. I'm planning on trying them in my ski boots this winter and in my winter boots for snowshoeing. Cannot find any to say negative.",
