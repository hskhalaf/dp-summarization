The stitching has come loose in a few places when I try to pull them on tight as there is no wrist strap, however it so far has not affected the integrity of the gloves. Also, I am very pleased with how well these clean. I have cleaned them by hand and thrown them in the wash (to air dry) and no matter how muddy they are, they come out just as white as before. I am a female playing flag football and bought a youth size. Measured my hands based on the guide and these are pretty close.",

The only thing I would note, is that his size, XS, the gloves don't have a velcro strap. The gloves just slip on, which can make them a little difficult to get on. However, that is a small price to pay, to finally find gloves that fit. I would highly recommend.",

      "text": "My son is 64lbs. The fit was fine, maybe 1cm long in the fingers. I don't remember the size I ordered but I'm sure it was the smallest. The problem was the durability. He did not use them every day. He used them for 1-2 hours per day about 3 days per week and the material in the palms that allows for \"sticky\" catches peeled off. Also they were coming apart at the seems in 3 places. This occurred within 5 weeks of very limited use just tossing the ball at home, not during football games or practice.",
