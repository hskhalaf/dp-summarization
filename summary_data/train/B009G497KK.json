I tested about 15 days after my period, and the strip would show a faint line. I tested each day, twice a day (because I had so many strips) and each line showed darker than the previous, until the test line became equally as dark as the control line, which meant I was ovulating. Flash forward nine months, I now have a beautiful healthy baby boy! Good luck!!",

This was very frustrating because I have an irregular cycle and was hoping I could use this cheaper alternative to track my ovulation days. I'm not sure if this was a bad batch or not, but through my experience I would recommend just saving your money and purchasing a better monitor.",

Below is a picture of a negative test from the day before ovulation (CD14), a positive test on the day of ovulation (CD15), and a negative test the day after ovulation (CD16).
