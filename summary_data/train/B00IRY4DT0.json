You definitely want to strap this in to a wall, it tends to lean forward and rock easily on carpet, I had to stuff cardboard under the legs to straighten it out.

It certainly serves its purpose but will not be an enduring piece of furniture. Also the drawers are not as deep (front to back) as I would have hoped.",

Fake wood, cheaply made, staples showing in back which is not a solid piece but rather a fake black backing. Also own the matching night stand. Middle drawers are double drawers, so are deep, and having 7 drawers does provide lots of storage. Overall, its probably higher quality than other cheaply made dressers, but if you shop around at local stores, can likely find something made from real wood for a similar price.",
