I love the Intex but always say in a puddle of water and it was a pain to inflate and deflate. The Sun dolphin was a great choice for me! I\u2019m 5\u20197 and 240 lbs and this kayak was super stable, easy to maneuver on the water, and I can lift it and get it tied down on top of my car by myself. I tested it out on a nearby lake yesterday and absolutely can not wait to take it out again!",
