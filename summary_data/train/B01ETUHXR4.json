      "text": "I'm a fan of the LED lighting technology, especially the 5000-6000K range. I wanted a flood light for the backyard so I purchased this in hopes it will mean all my needs. After installing this on my garage, which was fairly simple, I turned it on and was very pleased with the results. It is BRIGHT and the lighting range is very good. My only issue is during backyard movie/sports nights, I have to cover the light or kill the power to it, since I can't completely turn off the lights. Maybe I need to re-read the instructions again... but I'll figure it out either way. Overall... this is a great floodlight for the price! Thanks.",

Upon removing the light to prepare the return for refund, I noticed one of the pre-wired connectors was loose. I grabbed some black tape, secured the connection and tested again. It worked. So I've canceled my request for refund, though I think they should QA the product more carefully before shipping. To be sure, this was an easy enough DIY fix, but the point is now I had to remove and then reinstall the light. Time is money\u2014and these guys at Hyperikon have wasted mine.",

Hyperikon lights are more stylish, have a smaller profile, output more light, and are much more reliable in sensing activity, etc. In my opinion, the Hyperikon security light is a great value.

Vertical mounting would have been easier, but this installation was a retrofit. Ultimately, it worked as expected and my in-laws were happy.

I don't mind this as we had \"strangers\" crossing our yards and has proven to be a very good deterrent. The unit is quite compact and the housing is very durable.

So you can aim the vast majority of the light exactly where you want it. (But consider the 3 head light if you want to light a wide area.) It doesn't seem to have any false triggers, but a cat can turn mine on from 40' away and it isn't even turned up all the way. Great light!",

      "text": "I'm a licensed electrician with over 25 years experience. I have installed hundreds of motion floods. This one mounts to wall or eave and installs easily. It's a no frills unit, it doesn't have the \"dual bright\" or other non-essential features that a lot of the Home Depot units offer. That's a plus in my book, less problematic. It's extremely bright, in fact, it lights my entire back yard! All in all seems to be a good product. The only unknown is long term durability as it's still new, but I have no reason to question it at this point.",
