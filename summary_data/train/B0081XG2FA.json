Eddie was getting diffident about his food, and there was a lot left in the bowl when I fed him. Now Eddie's a member of the Clean Plate Club. This good basic food and it encourages foraging behavior to keep Eddie alert and to keep him from getting bored. Thank you, Amazon, for carrying this food.",

A handful of food will have several of these pieces, which is way too much to give in a day. So I have to pick them out and break them up. If you\u2019re switching from plain pellets to a variety mix this would be a good choice, just beware that fruit can cause serious problems when given in surplus.",

This contains the normal pellets they need, but it also has a myriad of healthy and natural food items for chinchillas as well.",
