      "text": "Washable?? My almost 3-year old son loved playing with these and I was excited to have a less messy paint option. Was surprised to discover the paint does not easily wash off skin with soap and water as advertised. Left his hands stained for a few days after washings and baths and I tried scrubbing his hands a bit immediately after use. I see some other reviewers have said the same and others have said it washes off easily...? How are people having such differing experiences with these? Is there some trick I'm not aware of or has the product changed? Would love to be able to use these more without having a stained toddler for days after...",

      "text": "Although these markers are advertised as washable they are not washable. I've included two pictures with my review. The only way I could get the marker off of a plastic kids table is to use rubbing alcohol period soap and water would not take it off. When the kids got it on their clothes or their hands it was not easily removable with soap and water. It lasted a few days on their hands and lasted through baths. The concept for these markers is a great idea and the kids do have fun with them but if you're looking for something that is washable I would not suggest these.",

I find that the mess is super easy to contain, as the markers do not drip and even if they fall they do not squirt paint everywhere. It's also super fun for toddlers who are beginning to experiment with paint and art materials in general. My daughter thinks it's the funnest thing to make paint dots on paper; she makes noises as she makes the dots and has now figured out that if she applies enough pressure, she can also make longer paint strokes. Great developmental tool to stimulate the artist in your toddler! :)",
