Either the company had chosen to greatly \u201cskimp\u201d on material and technique, or I was sent a substandard product of some other origin. Either way, I was not happy with what\u2019s I received and was forced to (unfortunately) send it back to Amazon. I am very unhappy about this, since I really wanted a carryon bag as smart as this one advertised itself to be, with the capabilities of being able to carry my charger, as well. Oy!",

The only thing that doesn't make this the perfect choice for me is the handle design. Having two loose handles that velcro together over the bag doesn't give you the leverage needed to lift the bag into the overhead bin. I have had to resort to grabbing the top of the retracted handle to be able to lift the bag.",

It has a lot of storage area for a second set of clothes, iPad, laptop, and miscellaneous charges and cords. This even had a side pocket where I kept our itinerary for easy access.",

So I had to take out what I needed and put it in the overhead. That was the whole point of buying it. :( However, I think it might fit under a middle or window seat. Not positive, but will definitely try next time. (I don't really like aisle seats anyway!) If it does fit, I'll update my review. Though it was nice to be able to roll my carry-on bag through the airport instead of carrying it. So there's that!",
