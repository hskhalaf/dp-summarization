      "text": "Never owned an Nespresso machine before until now. Well what a difference in a cup of coffee this made for me. I put in (2) Originaline Nespresso pods to give me the BEST 8oz cup of coffee I have really ever had in my life. Seriously! This is so much better how it brews up compared to my old Bunn coffee maker. Small little bad boy with tons of power at 19 bar for a robust flavorful Java! Powerhouse is an understatement, but best thing I can come up with in such a small package. Get you one to try out and all I can say is my experience has been nothing short of AMAZING!",

It's a bit noisy (it sounds a lot like a 12V powered air compressor) but it's trying to produce 19 bar of pressure so it's understandable. I've noticed the buttons have a tendency to get stuck if you press them towards the outside edge (it's happened to me with both the espresso and lungo sizes) but just press them again to free them up. I been using it everyday once or twice a day for the past two weeks and so far, so good.",

I have to hold them in place or the coffee will miss the glass because the vibration causes it to move. Aside from this minor annoyance, it is a fine machine. Love the fact that it turns on very quickly, makes great espresso with the required foam and then either turns off automatically after a few minutes or I can turn it off manually immediately.",

      "text": "Was looking for a small machine, as we already had a keurig on our counter. Also wanted it easy to keep clean. This is perfect. I have a separate small battery powered milk whisk -aero latte- , so I heat some milk in the micro, then have the steamed milk and foam. It\u2019s great. Easy to use and clean. Makes a noise but not really loud and it all makes U feel like a barista. Love it",

      "text": "This little espresso machine and milk frother combo is dope. The Nespresso pods make good coffee, it\u2019s quick, tasty, and efficient. The milk frother makes amazing foam and combined blows Starbucks coffee right out of the water for a fraction of the price. I\u2019m super pleased with how easy it is to use and how easy it is to make nice and fancy feeling cappuccinos and lattes. The footprint is incredibly small, takes up almost no counter space (especially compared to the Keurig) and heats up fast.",

Two: Empty the pod catcher and clean out the water collector. Do it often so it does not fill up with cups and water. Three: after each use, run the unit with out a pod. Let it rest so it can drain. Enjoy!",

      "text": "I thought about buying a Nespresso machine for a long while but didn't see how that would fit with how we drink our coffee (being used to a pot of coffee to drink over time). Well, once I tried the Pixie by having an Americano style of coffee (by pushing the lungo button an extra time), I was sold. We bought one, love all of the different coffees, and now put our regular coffee maker away. The taste is just so much better, and I like the ease in making it. I also like that the pods are recycleable (or we wouldn't have bought it).",

The noise could wake the dead! I REALLY love how it looks. Main reason for return is that pod coffee never tastes as good as fresh ground beans. I am keeping my Nespresso frother, though, (the newest model 4; forgot name). I love it and can use it for coffee, etc. Still, you might consider this machine. It's almost perfect.",
