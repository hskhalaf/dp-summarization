      "text": "the plates they give aren't the right size to do anything, when trying to press out a hub the frame bowed apart and it dropped the middle bolster. the space in the middle bolster isn't big enough for a hub to fit through so you need to build up something to have room for the hub to be pressed out, which is the main problem. there has to be space below the object being pressed out so it can move. I feel I've wasted my money for sure.",
