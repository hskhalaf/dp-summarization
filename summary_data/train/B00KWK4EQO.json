      "pros": [
        "Quick-drying Open Mesh makes up the upper unit of the Sense Link",
        "The Sensifit overlays offer a more secure fit while the Endofit features a sock-like interior construction",
        "Injected EVA is the midsole cushioning component of this shoe, which brings plush underfoot support based on the comments of some runners",
        "Most runners appreciated the Contagrip outsole, which provides reliable traction over various terrains",
        "The low-cut design and non-prominent outsole design brings freedom of movement and the capability to function on roads"

      "cons": [
        "The upper material easily broke down for some testers",
        "Others noted that the mid-sole unit wasn\u2019t very efficient in its cushioning purpose"

Also the heel ridge and edge around the shoe opening is very stiff and uncomfortable. I'm hoping it breaks in with more wear, but we'll see. Right now, I'm not wearing them much, after the first day.",
