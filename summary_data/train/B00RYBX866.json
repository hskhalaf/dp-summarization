I personally use my original chocolate palette more because it permits more colors combinations. But this one is also perfect as an addition, more in the neutral-brown range (warm+cool) + a nice blue. Colors names are written on the palette and not on a separated sheet (more practical!) I agree with the opinion of other people; the pink color is very disappointing, it doesn't transfer on the eye even with a MAC Fix+. But all the other colors are just perfect and easy to use.",

      "text": "This is such a pleasure to use. I am addicted to the chocolate scent. The black is now the blackest shade I own; it applies like gel. Some of the colours don't show up very well on dark skin so I have to use a white base or concealer to get good payoff. The light sparkly pink is meant to just add shimmer I think and not an actual shade. This is beautiful. Trust me.",

I know many people dont like the pink one, but I think it is great to put it over another color to give it some shimmer. The blue is really not very pigmented, but all together I would recommend this palette!",

      "text": "Colors look great in the bar until you swatch them. They have hardly any color payoff and are chalky and don't blend well. It's a fake pallet. The real one at Sephora has amazing color pay off and blends beautifully. Yet again Amazon is selling fake product. Will be returning. The picture of my arm shows you how the colors look very bland and sheer chalky. The picture of the zoomed in swatches that are more uniform shows you the REAL pallet. Notice the big difference!!!!",
