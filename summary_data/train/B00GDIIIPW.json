Maybe at least a 4GB card should be enough, preferably a 5 or 6 gigabyte card. Games like Titanfall supposedly takes 3.7 GB. So if you wanna push 1080p with all settings max 3GB might be a little short depending on the game. I hope evga and others will soon come out with a 4GB or more version of this card.",
