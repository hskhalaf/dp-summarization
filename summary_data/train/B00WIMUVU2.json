It\u2019s not perfect; however, like I said, our carpet is from 2011 and old so I didn\u2019t expect it to be pristine. Definitely worth the extra money as this worked much better than previous carpet cleaners we have purchased. Definitely spot treat any heavily stained areas as it makes a huge difference!

The smell permeated the first floor of our home for two weeks. I'm also not impressed with how well it cleans carpeting. Woolite's carpet cleaner works just as well combined with Oxyboost.

Decent smell, didn't bleach my carpet (light beige), got rid of like 90% of the stains and smell. Am definitely going to buy this product again. So overall like a 4.5/5 stars.",

A caveat...if you have pets, you may need to clean out the brushes of pet hair a couple of times while using it. That is to be expected since this thing is working deep in the carpet fibers to pick up whatever dirt and animal hair has been deposited. Of course, you need to vacuum first.

I use it as an all purpose cleaner for my carpet cleaning machine.",
