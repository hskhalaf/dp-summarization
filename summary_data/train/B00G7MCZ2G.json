Has many reviews and many people claimed it to be very thin and warm, which allowed for easy packing on a carry on. Its not a bad product and i very well may have given it more stars if it didn't try to market itself as an ultra thin solution for travel. It doesn't fold very flat and i have owned better blankets. It works fine if you are not looking for a high tech solution and just a regular Micro fleece",
