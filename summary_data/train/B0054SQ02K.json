Super comfortable and can't feel it in. No leaks at all. I didn't have any problems inserting or removing. Most of all, I love that this is eco-friendly and re-usable. If you are thinking of trying a cup, this Lunette is AMAZING!!! I will be buying a second cup as a back up. Love Love Love it!!!",

It's especially good if you are trying to save money or the earth, as you won't have to buy so many products every month that you'll end up throwing away. It's very easy to clean (just some alcohol and then boil it for 20 minutes once a month). I would highly recommend this product to any woman; definitely a 5 star product!",
