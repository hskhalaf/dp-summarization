Great irons for me at a great price.",

I hit them very well. The lower clubs went 10 to 20 yards longer. I expected the 7 through 4 to be shorter from what I had read, but because they were lighter I hit them longer. Played a course I always play and usually shoot 95 to 98. Shot an 88 today, first time out. Great clubs, I would recommend them to all.",

Some reviews have folks not hitting as far as their old clubs.....guess what..that is how they are supposed to be. The four through seven will be a bit shorter than standard as they are shorter, so less clubbed speed and weight. Eight through wedges will be a bit longer as the shafts will be equal to a seven, so faster clubbed speed. It is all just getting used to them. If you have some trouble with the long irons, then this set is for you.",
