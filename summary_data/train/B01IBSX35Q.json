There are two probes, the smaller one is just right for face, the bigger one can be used on the hands and legs, very humanized design. It is very comfortable when using, just like at the beauty salon. My face feels hot and obviously, I can feel the pulling of the skin. Sometimes I will apply a hydrating mask when I finish it. I feel more than comfortable. My face will feel tighter. I'm relatively diligent, so I will stick to use it and expect better results.",

Also having the timer helps so you can evenly distribute the use on your face/body The supplier answered my questions quickly - so no waiting around for a response. The product is exceptional in delivering the results I wanted I would certainly recommend this product to anyone .",

It works like ironing clothes, with the heat and weight of the iron, the wrinkles are stretched and smoothed out from the fabric, so does the skin. There are two probes that depend on your needs. While other reviewers use the small probe for face, I found the big one is even better for facial lifting and also good for massaging the loose tummy and arms. It saves me lots of money going to beauty salon. I would recommend it.",

Luckily, a bottle of gel comes with package, which is convenient. As I understand, it\u2019s better to use this device often, but not to exceed 3 times a week to get optimal result. After the treatment, I massage with some serum to help my skin heal better. Slowly, I feel my skin looks tighter and smoother. In conclusion, I recommend this product.",

My best friend advised me to buy a face lifting device which is proven to help skin elasticity and enhances skin health. I don\u2019t want to spend much money on beauty salon. So this home use beauty machine becomes my best choice. after 20 days using, I can see the difference, my face looks shinier, toned. So far I\u2019m using it two or three times per week. This machine does take time to get the visible result, it isn\u2019t a magic wand however I think this rf machine is worth it!",

Gel used up pretty fast, but there are always replacements you can get. I can see my lines are smoother. This is an investment that is worth it.",

The one middle-aged women shows really no significant improvement and the girl with the nasolabial fold on just one side, which is unusual, could have had that easily corrected with filler.

Probably would have kept at it but for the price and the 30-day return policy, sent it back, to bad had really really hoped it would do something, guess I'm looking at a facelift in a few years :( sounded too good to be true. BTW they show a young girl using it, why would a young person bother using this?",
