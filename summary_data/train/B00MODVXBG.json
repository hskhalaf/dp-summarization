It doesn't seem flush enough when it gets zipped up and I could see it \"letting\" something in or out. the zipper doesn't seem to nestle up under the end of the fabric and mine had a small gap.

I'm not worried about bed bugs and such so to alleviate this minor issue, I just leave the zipper partially undone so the air can escape easily. You can't have t both ways.

The terry version is a snug fit. It is great if you have pillow cases that are a little big. The terry grips a bit and will hold the case in place. If you have a snug pillow case I would order the smooth version as it will fit better.",
