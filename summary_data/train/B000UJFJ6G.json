      "text": "The fireplace worked fine for 10 months, then the motor assembly burnt out. First it started making noise and burned out a couple of days after. I spent hours on hold with Dimplex with the final result being: The two replacement motors they sent (without directions of any kind) were not the part I needed. I could tell just by looking at them. I tried one anyway, but the wiring is completely different. Apparently this is a discontinued model that I purchased. The rep said they don't make the part anymore so I'm out of luck, try to get Amazon to do something.",

It's not going to heat a large room on its own, but it does add heat to the room for sure. And the flames look really nice! This purchase was well worth it!!",

We have about a 700sq foot basement and this unit definitely takes the chill out of the air. We have owned this unit for 5 months. Pros: #1 - Great Price & FREE shipping with Prime! (This purchase alone makes prime worth the subscription) #2 - The unit is absolutely beautiful with great realistic flames #3 - Extremely easy to assemble. Assembly took less than half an hour with 1 person #4 - Gives off enough heat to warm up a small area or just enough to take the chill off a large one Cons: None",

The powder coated black firebox was packaged separately from all wood components in a single large box. The flame is realistic and the heat blower is extremely quiet--this product is a great choice for a bedroom or reading room. The wood frame is color rich and well built. Overall, this is a very nice fireplace.",

      "text": "This unit was purchased to warm a living-room about 15' x 20' with standard 8' ceiling. The previous fan-forced electric heat source was extremely noisy and obtrusive, making it nearly impossible to hold a comfortable conversation. We have used the new fireplace for about 3 weeks now. The Dimplex Fireplace warms the room quickly and efficiently and quietly, and maintains a constant pleasant temperature with no annoying background noise. It also offers a life-like fireplace experience. It is a beautiful piece of furniture, not just a great heater! I recommend this to anyone who needs a quiet heat source. It comes well-packed, it is easy to assemble. 5 stars all the way!",

He did not need any tools because the screws had attached wing nuts for easy tightening. Also attached Dow pins for lining up purposes. Amazingly easy to assemble. Yes there is a dome shape on firewall that just adds character. If I could fit one into another room I would buy it in a second. It took longer to unpack (because of excellent packaging) than it took to assemble. Perfect condition. No scratches. No scrapes. Just waiting for Nite to try out this beauty.",
