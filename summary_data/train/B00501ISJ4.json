We had a few issues but all were minor. Now I'm going to purchase another for my son who is entering the 6th grade. It's perfect for a student(teach them to handle it with care....the metal is soft and the keys can bend easily) But it is a good value.",

It is a good quality saxophone and sounds great. The case is nice, and much lighter than his friends' saxophone cases. We also had a great experience with the seller, KK Music Store. We had a small defective part on a trombone we bought for our daughter. They replaced the entire slide free of charge.",

Great tone and ease of playing makes the instrument fun. The lacquer finish is beautiful and the gold pads accent the color in a way that creates the 'wow' factor when people see it. The case is durable, the accessories seem about complete. The only thing I went out and bought was a new neck strap, as the one that came with it felt rather sharp and scratchy. I bought a nicely padded one. :-)",

I decided to give it another try because this was so affordable. It isn\u2019t a $1000 to $8000 sax but I\u2019ll tell u it is definitely worth $250. I picked it up and got right back at it like I never stopped. Went to the music store and bought a good book. It is really well crafted and sounds great for the money",

However, it must have been dropped badly by the previous owner. The octave key was bent badly and so the instrument only played the upper end of its range and there was a piece broken/dislodged that rendered one note impossible to play. One of the black wire pieces that hold certain keys in place; I\u2019m not familiar enough to know the name. Also, a screw on the neck was broken so it\u2019s a little loose.
