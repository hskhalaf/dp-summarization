I couldn't be happier. Yes there are pits in the castings; yes they have knurled handles for grip, yes there may be scratched paint from shipping, but they are weights meant to be dropped and thrown around while making your body stronger, not placed on a shelf to look at.",

      "text": "This is a high quality set, with everything well machined. No rough casting edges here, it's all smooth and the collars thread onto the handles very smoothly and quickly. One thing to be aware of that was not clear when I ordered. According to my scales, each handle with its collars weighs 4.9 lb. That's not a problem for me since these were intended to move up incrementally from a set of fixed hand weights that top out at 5 lb each. With the assortment of weights in this set I can increase weights gradually as far as I'll ever manage.",

My two complaints are: 1) The grip on these is pretty rough; you definitely need gloves if you're going to lift any substantial amount of weight or do so regularly with these bad boys. And 2) the ridged part where the cap screws on is pretty long, so if you don't have a ton of plates on these, they basically have metal poles sticking out which are easy to poke yourself with when doing a shoulder press or bench press. You get used to it, but beware on your first few lifts! You'll poke your eye out, kid.",

      "text": "This is by no means a pro set of weights. The plates are essentially just spray-painted black and chip easily. I have flakes on my floor straight out of the box. But I didn't buy weights to have them sit on my mantle and look pretty. If you're looking for the cheapest way to sling around 200 pounds in free weight, this is it. Not a 5-star set, but they 100% serve their purpose. By the time I need heavier dumbbells than this (if ever), it would be more cost effective to just drive to the gym.",

However, if you're changing weight too often, you may not like these. Locks are not the best and you need to check them every new exercise. Overall these are very good option if you're on the budget. I have them for over a year, and so far I like it.",
