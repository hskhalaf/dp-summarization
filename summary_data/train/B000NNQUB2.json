Every time she reads a book, she can choose from very cute seasonal stickers to track her progress!! Every season is just adorable! The little ice cream cones are adorable! Only drawback is they are a little on the small side. They are about dime sized, maybe a hair smaller.",

We use the behavior clip chart in our room and when my students clip off the chart they get to decorate their clothespin with a jewel of choice. These are very nice looking jewels. They come in various colors, sizes, and shapes. There is enough to last me all year I think! Perfect for what I need. Con: I use wooden clothespins so these don\u2019t stick as well to the clothespin as I had hoped but nothing a little bit of glue can\u2019t fix. I give it 4 stars.",
