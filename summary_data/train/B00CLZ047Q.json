      "text": "This monitor was fine... for a while. It's been 3 months, with light use, and now it doesn't work at all. First the screen started to flicker - I figured it was because of the adaptor I had to use to connect it to my Macbook Pro (it only has USB-c ports). But now it won't get any signal, I just have a black screen. I tried connecting it to an old PC I have w/ a VGA connection and... still no signal. Tried a different VGA cable - NO SIGNAL. So it's definitely the monitor. I definitely don't recommend this. I consider it a $100 mistake!",

It is wobbly like the other reviews have mentioned (that\u2019s why I rated it 4 stars and not 5), but I left the clear plastic on the piece that inserts into the base to give it more traction and also have it sitting on a table directly next to my desk, and that decreases the wobbling. It does its job though, and it lets me work more efficiently so I can\u2019t complain.",

They look great, but are a pain to assemble and get all of the little plastic wrapping off of if you're going to use a lot of them. Pros: Image looks great Can be used without the base with it's little kickstand thing if you're into that sort of thing. It matches well with a mac mini. Cons: Doesn't have an HDMI input. Stand is a little on the flimsy side. Un-packaging these is very time consuming, more parts than the average monitor because of the little kickstand thing.",

The stand it comes with doesn't feel exceptionally solid but works, and there are no holes for VESA mounting. After connecting the monitor to the desktop, Windows Update pulled an updated driver for it immediately. After adjusting the settings, contrast was great, color was decent, but it still just isn't quite bright enough.",

The screen is not vertically adjustable but can tilt up and down. The only complaint I have, and it's minor, is that all the buttons are on the back of the monitor, so it makes it difficult to navigate the OSD menus quickly.
