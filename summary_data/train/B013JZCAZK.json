I read the reviews & this company seemed reliable BUT AFTER trying to install the protective screen on both devices it was apparent that the side which needs to adhere to the iPad screen had smoodges or bubbles which made the screen protector unuseable without the defects being noticed immediately. I do t see an option to email the seller & if I\u2019m contact I will update my review. I should have listened to the last review but I\u2019m hoping the seller will reach out to me because I would hate for the matter to be u resolved.",

This irritated me at first, but on practical use I find they are so small and unobtrusive that I don't notice them. In fact, I have to look for them to see them. So that turned out to be a non-problem. The glass looks very strong, and using the machine after installation is, functionally, exactly like using it beforehand. Packaging was great and the whole product exudes a top-o'-the-line aura. I'm quite satisfied - this is a great accessory. Nice job, Sparin!",

Installation is easy, just make sure you wipe all dust and fingerprints from your screen. I had no issues with air bubbles. No major problems with fingerprints or smudges, but it also wipes clean easily. The only reason I docked a star is because it does have bad glare, however it hasn\u2019t interfered enough to make me want to remove it or try another screen protector.",

You just have to be very good at getting all the dust, dirt and things off the screen, and then getting the airbubbles out once the screen is on top of the iPad. It finally worked out for me... with two small airbubbles, but I am glad I have this protector!!",

No bubbles. Effective pre-installation cleaning kit and the instructions are easy to understand and follow. I have never seen a totally smudge proof screen, it just happens b/c of the natural oils and lotions on our hands. This screen does wipe off easily with included screen cloth and there are no lasting smudges right after wiping or cleaning.",

I just will not stay on that corner, then slowly more air gets under it and I'm having to press out the air again once more. This happens every day. I wish it didn't do that because I really like this protector for my brand new iPad.",

I just used the dust grabber sticker to get some specks of dust off the screen. After peeling off the backing, I let the protector down on the screen and it just did it\u2019s own thing and adhered to the screen with some minor bubbles that were easy to take out. All in all, the screen protector worked great and I installed on 2 of my kids iPads as well!",

For those of us who are more visually oriented, there were instructions on YouTube. (There were cleaning/drying packets included for the screen, too!)
