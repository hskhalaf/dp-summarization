The two scissors work great, are sharp and are great size and quality. The wooden shovels look great for decoration, haven't really used them-- I guess I might down the road when I re-pot the plant, and the rake works ok for fluffing up the soil a bit. Great long tweezers for pruning. The bamboo brush thing is really stiff and kind of useless but I didn't care about it much.",

Aside from that the wood was dislodged from the shovel unit. It's just a cheap horrible set, I'm going to eat the $13 on this but I want everyone to be aware that this is not worth the money.",

Today, I was using them for snipping waxed Irish linen in a beading project. They make very precise cuts. I did not oil the second pair because I didn't want to get oil on the linen. So, I will use 2-3 pair on my potting bench for flowers and another 1-2 pair in my beading basket.",

He hasn't used the tools yet, as he's deciding how to shape the tree. My only criticism is that it took a long time to get the tools. This was a Christmas gift, and I was afraid they weren't going to arrive before Christmas. They did arrive a couple of days before, thankfully.",
