I love the graduated measurements inside the pot and the fact the fuel canister fits perfectly inside it. (One word of warning- don't leave the fuel canister inside for storage as the metal ring on the bottom will rust and stain the inside of the pot.) The rubber coating on the handles helps with grip and avoiding heat transfer from my MSR stove, which is a huge plus, and it packs up so compactly and lightly for storage. I'm planning to order another set for my son, as this set far outperformed his older camp cookset in both usability and weight.",
