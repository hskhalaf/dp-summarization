This time, I followed the instructions on the video on the Amazon page for these screen protectors. It worked like a charm. The screen protector fits perfectly, gives complete screen coverage and protection, allows good touch screen abilities, video is crystal clear, fits in the dock perfectly with the protective case installed and has a second screen protector included just in case anything happens to the first one. Very good value for the money. It fits like a glove. Definitely a recommend from me.",

First, I would suggest not using the included alcohol wipes, they are so over saturated they end up leaving more residue on the screen than they remove; I would suggest using a camera lens wipe. Second, it's good the kit includes 2x screen protectors because one of mine came pre-scratched; there's a good 2-2.5 inch scrape on the bottom edge of one of the protectors. Overall I would say it's worth the money as it will protect the switch's plastic display, but I would be careful with the install and avoid the terrible alcohol wipes.",

So far, close to two months, and there are no scratches on the screen protector yet from un-docking the switch. I feel that this will hold and work for it's intended purpose without any issues. I definitely feel secure that this screen protector will fully protect my Switch's screen. Definitely recommend.",

Second, the including piece of protector air bubble squeezer is kinda soft to do the job. I have about half-inch air bubble, I have to use the squeezer but it is so soft to press to take air bubble out of the protector. Finally I have to use my credit card to finish it.",

I feel confident in even pocketing the system in my cargo pants with this screen protector installed. The unit still fits fine in the dock. I gave the spare to a friend who also got a Switch.",

I decided to try Orzly and first try it was perfect. I was so happy because I have terrible OCD about screen protectors and was worried there would never be one that I got on perfectly that had no issues. None of the adhesive is showing after multiple hours playing dock. I did let it rest for 48 hours before I played however. Quality is great and screen is crystal clear. This is better than the AmFilm one and deserves to be the top Nintendo Switch Protector!",

Overall I love the screen protector itself, I got it because I was scared of the \"dock scratches\" everyone has been talking about, but now that I have one I love it for more than just that. I'd go so far as to say it feels and looks even better than the plastic screen the switch comes with, it's so sleek and feels more sturdy than the plastic, highly recommend!!",
