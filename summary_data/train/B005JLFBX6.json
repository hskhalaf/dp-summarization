I'm not a foodie and usually I pour the olive oil straight from the bottle, but I had a drippy bottle and bought this to fill with a funnel. It is excellent because you can control the flow and do not use too much oil by accident. It is a bit difficult to fill with a regular funnel because of the angle of the bottle neck, and it is a little on the small side for my taste, but it has an excellent handle grip and it is really a work of art. Yes, buy it.",
