Covered some white tile with our company logo embedded within the resin and placed the tile surrounded by the same white tile and its the only one that stands out now because its yellow surrounded by white. Poured a kitchen countertop in one of my rentals.. Blue marble effect.. A renter placed a hot frying pan on it and it scarred the surface. Will have to sand and rebuff everything to match. I decided to go with SC instead.",
