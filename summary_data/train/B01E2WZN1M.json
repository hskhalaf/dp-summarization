After a month of using, the stitching is coming out of the bottom of the part that covers the metal strip so now half the metal is exposed with huge hole in bottom because its coming apart at the seams. Don't waste your money. I wish I could give this zero stars. I am very disappointed it didn't last very long and now my daughter who has mild autism and loves tents is now without it and I have to purchase a new tent but will not be another one of these.",

The tents were as described and the costumes were just as pictured. None of the items came in damaged or defective. MY BIGGEST CONCERN is the use of fiberglass frame connectors! Upon setting up the tent and putting the frames in....I got a handful of tiny, damn near invisible shards stuck all over both my hands. I have a 1.5yr and 5yr old, if for any reason they shattered the framing they would be embedded in shards. For that reason alone i cannot give this the 5 stars it would have deserved.",

I've already spoken to customer service and they have taken care of me on that front. Honestly the wings aren't that big of an issue, because that's not why I made this purchase.

It is spacious enough that she can bring in several dolls and have room to play inside. Comes in a zippered carrying case which makes storage and portability a breeze.

      "text": "This is such a cute princess tent. Everyone likes to play inside. I bought it for my granddaughter, but the cat and dog like to play with her inside the tent. We play in the ball pit and spend time reading and playing with other toys. I can\u2019t wait for our first overnight in the tent when she gets older. I imagine we will use the castle tent for many years. The princess outfit is an added bonus! This item is such a great value.",

We also gave her 300 balls to put inside of it; she likes to roll around in the balls and of course she likes to throw them out of the tent just as fast as we throw them back IN. I've seen her roll the tent on to its side without damaging to the tent -- it's held up really well to a rambunctious 2-year old.",

I love how it collapses and goes right back in the bag that comes with it. The ball that are pictured do not come with it. Fun can be had even without them.",
