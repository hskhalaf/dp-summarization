After I did some research I found took a guess and got the correct Windows 10 drive and it worked! So my recommendation is Anker should have a forum or clarify so users can easily picked the right driver. Otherwise, non-technical folks will probably return this product...",

Also, the things that appear to be air vents on the top and bottom are completely blocked off. There is no airflow going through this dock, and appears to be engineered to fail.

One of the ways they keep it small is by not putting many holes to plug into, but sometimes you need those holes. This fixes that, the video works flawlessly, and you get a bunch of USB connections. Admittedly, the USB connections are a hub, and some stuff doesn't like to be plugged into a hub, but I have never found a way around that. This is small, lightweight, and works well. 'nuff said.",

I will update my review again once I get to using the product, but this alone gets FIVE STARS! Thank you, Anker!",
