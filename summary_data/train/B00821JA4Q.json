I would highly recommend going with a more breathable coverall if you are not trying to protect yourself from liquids or hazardous chemicals. Tyvek while great for liquid resistance has too low of a vapor permeability to be comfortable working in for me. For what I used it for all I needed was contact protection to prevent the spray foam from contacting my skin or clothes. Next time I will try something like DuPont ProShield coveralls.",

    "title": "DuPont Tyvek 400 TY122S Disposable Protective Coverall with Elastic Cuffs, Attached Hood and Boots, White, X-Large (Pack of 6)",
    "description": "The DuPont Tyvek TY122S hooded coverall features an attached respirator-fit hood with elastic around face opening designed to cover neck and chin and fit around respirator face mask. Longer zipper extends to chin for complete coverage of neck area. Elastic opening for tighter fit at wrist. Attached Tyvek FC boots have special coating to provide added skid-resistance. Comfort fit design based on extensive wearer input to provide our most comfortable garment design that: enables a greater range of movement while stretching and bending, provides a more tailored fit, offers reinforcement in high stress areas for fewer blowouts, utilizes a longer zipper for easier donning and doffing and an elastic waist to better position the garment. Tyvek garments are composed of flash spun high density polyethylene which creates a unique, nonwoven material available only from DuPont Tyvek. Tyvek provides an ideal balance of protection, durability and comfort of any limited use fabric technology. Tyvek fabric offers an inherent barrier to particles down to 1 micron in size. Protection is built into the fabric itself; there are no films or laminates to abrade or wear away. Tyvek fabric's durability advantage over microporous film and SMS fabrics delivers consistently better barrier, even after wear and abrasion. Applications include: lead and asbestos abatement/remediation, general maintenance/operations, spray painting, general clean-up. Serged seams. X-Large size. Available in white color.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nDifferent jobs require different levels of protective equipment and clothing. DuPont Personal Protection offers a wide range of protective clothing and accessories to meet those varying needs.",
