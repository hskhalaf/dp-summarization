I could barely fit a few pieces of fish or pasta in it without squishing it down. It might be enough for an infant, but not a child. In addition, the cover is so difficult to align and to open, especially for a child. The rubber gasket in the cover is extremely complicated to remove for washing & to put back in. Also, it only keeps the food lukewarm after just 3 hours. I do not recommend this product. I'm sorry I bought it.",

It's a super cute design though, and again...they food is hot even hours after sealing the thermos. We do follow the manufacturers recommendations and make sure to condition the thermos with each use by adding boiling water for a few minutes and then we dump the water and add our soup/liquid...works great. It's also a good portion size.",

It is leak proof, I did not have any problem soups leaking or anything like that. It has one more plus point, which is steel interior. No plastic inside. I always wash in dishwasher and it is as good as new. Nicely put design too. This is my third container. Pretty happy with my purchase. I wish I could get this container in the shape of sandwich box also. I highly recommend this.",

I haven't tried putting ice in prior to putting in cold food but I imagine it would work the same although I don't think this step is necessary since it will keep the food warm for at least 5 hours.
