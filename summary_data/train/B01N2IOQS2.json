      "text": "So far I am impressed with all the products this company offers. Washing my toddler's hair is one of my least favorite things to do. She fights me every way she can. She hates having water poured on her head no matter which way I try. I have learned it is something I have to deal with. That being said, it is essential to find a very gentle shampoo because water does get in her face. In no way can I have her lean her head back. This shampoo seems to work the best at not irritating her eyes. It also leaves her hair unbelievably soft which is a plus.",

I would prefer to be unscented, and use other brands' shampoo for regular bath time but as this does the job well to take care of the cradle cap I will continue to use as needed.",
