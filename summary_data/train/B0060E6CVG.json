I've been throwing them in my basement at a homemade target for a while now, and the only thing that I can think of being wrong with them is that a few ricochet throws have put little scratches in the paint and folded over one of the edges on the blade near the handle. Overall they are fantastic for the price, if you're in the market for a knife to learn to throw, or just some blades to beat the Christ out of, these are your knives!",

Sturdy as hell, i'm throwing into a fence and if they don't stick or they bounce back it's onto small rocks and these blades hold up nicely. A great price and very strong knives. Highly recommended for gifting to a youngster whos learning as they aren't heavy and they won't break the bank and they'll take some modicum of abuse. I only have four stars because they are so very feather weight. And I like a meaty blade. But I do really love these throwers. Great backups. They're always with me in case I need them. \ud83d\udc4d",

Turns out that a sharpened butter knife is EASIER TO THROW, EASIER TO SHARPEN, and actually HOLDS AN EDGE FOR 3 SECONDS. DO NOT BUY THESE",

One problem I had was being all black makes them very hard to find in some cases. I was throwing in a grass backyard that had some dirt and straw. I've spent at least an hour cumulative searching for knives, even though you watch it go to pick it up and can't find it. A fluorescent color for training might be helpful.",
