The competitor's radon test turnaround is just over a week from when they receive the test if there's not a rush and shipping isn't included (an extra $3.50). This test takes an extra day to complete in the home, 3 days instead of 2, but that was no biggy for me. The result seemed reliable. If you have to do a few radon tests, this is the way to go to not break the bank.",

This radon Test Kit contains granular activated charcoal, which absorbs the radon gas entering the kit from the surrounding air. At the end of the test period (3 to 7 days), The kit is sent to the lab in the pre-paid mailer for analysis. The significance of radon exposure is based on the average exposure over time. Testing for radon is crucial to protecting you & your family from excessive radon levels. Note: unfortunately, these Test kits are not available To New Jersey residents. Environmental protection Agency (EPA) general guidelines The EPA recommends fixing a home If the radon level is 4 PCI/L or more & to contact a qualified radon-reduction contractor about lowering the radon level. Buying or selling a home - Use two short term tests at the same time & place to measure radon, then average the results together. Carefully follow all instructions provided with the radon Test Kit. Close Windows & Outside Doors 12 hours before testing & Keep Closed as much as possible during the test. Do not Test during severe storms or unusually high winds. Do not Disturb the test at any time while testing. Operate the home's heating/cooling system normally & Use only those that re-circulate interior air. Do Not use fans or devices that bring in outside air. If a radon-reduction system is in Place, Make sure the system is working. Place in a frequently used, lowest level room such as a living room, den or bedroom. Place the test at least 20 inches above the floor where it won\u2019t be disturbed. Do not Test in high humidity locations or in a kitchen, bathroom or damp basement. Do not set Test near drafts, high heat, or exterior walls.
