Some nail clippers seem to leave a slightly rough edge (almost like they cut at a funny angle), but these never do that! The one slightly annoying bit is that sometimes when I'm flipping the green bit (to trim or put them away) the little piece holding it on pops out. It's super easy to fix though and I will definitely buy more.",

These do not compare at all. These are cheap, weak, aren\u2019t sharp enough to clip a baby nail. The quality of these is far less than the ones I bought 2 years ago. Would not recommend these.",

The piece is also easily swallowed, which wasn\u2019t an issue for us but could be for some families. This is solved by keeping the clippers away from the tot, which is much easier said than done.",
