The controls aren't very intuitive or especially easy to use, even after following the enclosed instructions. And some of the extra features don't seem to work as expected. Also, the chirp alerts from these things are LOUD! And I've never been able to figure out how to turn them down (the instructions to do this didn't work). But the sound quality is good, and they have plenty of channels so there's not much problem with interference. Overall they are decent.",

Slight changes in the menu make them not functional as walkie talkies. These require adult level users imo. Other than that, they are great.",

Our kids could be at a neighbor's house a half mile up the road and we can get them. There is a beep function that they can hear if you are trying to get them. This has allowed me to get them home without knocking on 5 doors! Awesome!",
