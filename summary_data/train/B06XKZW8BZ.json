I the bag it is light and comes with the backpack style carrying straps. The only negative is I wish the bag had more pockets. There is only one small pocket which I use for tees and ball makers and they all get mix up and it can be tough to find what I want without taking everything out.",

I put a larger grip on the putter (4/5 stars) and jumbo grips on the rest of the clubs. Compared to my \"good\" clubs, these feel somewhat dead on most shots. The exception is the 3 wood. Don't know why but the club is magic...almost impossible for me to miss with it. For what I paid, they are certainly adequate. Bag is a cart bag...not a carry bag and the shoulder strap is very awkward to use. Overall...adequate...I got what I paid for and a little bit more.",

Only negative thing to say is that my 7 iron did come a little bent from the actual head to shaft, however I still use and it does its job well.",

If you're looking at getting this set because of the price, just know that you will have to add the cost of replacement clubs. The only redeeming quality of this set is the bag. Overall, my advice would be to stay away and spend your money on better quality clubs. You'll save in the long run that way.",
