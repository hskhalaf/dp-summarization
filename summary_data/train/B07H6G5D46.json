I came across this piece and thought to try and we love it. It is cheaper and give you all the functionality what kitchenaid offer. So let's Beat the hype of Kitchenaid stand mixer and price. I am Indian (Asian) and we use it daily for our Roti(chapati) dough making and it works perfectly. My wife prepared dough for cake as well and no issues.",

I have no problem inserting and removing the whisk, paddle, hook, etc. as others have reported. The specifications and performance information were not readily available for the Kitchenaid even after contacting Customer Service. In fact, I felt like I was given the run around by the Customer Service person when I asked certain pointed questions.
