My diffuser is stored on top with my essential oils in the sliding drawer and my distilled water jug in the bottom section. It has room for other things but as of yet, I haven't decided what all will be stored. Probably a book or two and the remote for the lights once I get that installed.",

The worst thing that happened during assembly happened as I was adding the last screw to attach the pack side of the table. The screw hole wasn't big enough so pressure built up and split the rod. It's not noticeable since that side sits against my wall. It was the last step of assembly so the table is still very sturdy. I added black/grey contact paper to the top of the table and inside the drawer ~ everything pictured, included the rose knobs were purchased in Amazon.",

I really don't understand how it was being sold as Best Seller? When I contacted the customer service they offered some discount on damage item or gave me option to return the damage table after disassembling it that was not a pleasant experience.",
