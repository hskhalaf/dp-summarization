You can't even download any real apps one might actually want! It's mainly for streaming from the big name apps(Netflix, Hulu, YouTube etc). I decided to go with the H96 max plus box running Android 9.0 and I couldn't be happier! It's running pure Android 9.0, it has on/off functionality, dual USB ports (one USB 3.0), Ethernet, 3.5mm jack and stays cool due to its vents. And.... It's only $43 on Amazon. I'm not sure how they can sale it for that price as amazing as it is!",

It's been fully functional since day 1, picture is very good quality even for non 4K signal. The user interface could be made a little more intuitive. The volume control on the remote is very handy.",

I suggest a double sided tape or command strip under the box because it is so light. It moves around. Can't download external apps to it, sonif you're trying to do titanium or typhoon tv, look for another box. (Can't get browser on this box to download the files). Hope this helps someone!
