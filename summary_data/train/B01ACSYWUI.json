It seems that I had a small malfunction of some sort, but after rebooting and disconnecting the unit, it is now working without issue. I really do like the keyboard - Ultra Quiet and Responsive. Now lets hope we do not experience any other malfunctions with the keyboard, because its really hard to go back to my old clunker or any standard keyboard after this jewel.",

As others have probably said, the keys have an interesting sensitivity where you would have to double check if you actually hit the key or not. I use this as a portable keyboard for plugging into a server or a laptop when I need to, so I don't use this very frequently compared to my main keyboard. It also seems like you will need to be careful with this keyboard as it has a disclaimer to \"not twist\", which I don't think I want to test. I do like the layout of keys and the look of it, and it works pretty well for what I use it for.",

This one uses a different key layout, so I was cautiously optimistic the keys would be more responsive. They're responsive all right. Not only does it respond quickly to every button press, but it keeps responding to each button press. Nearly every letter is repeated. Yes, I could use my computer's usability settings to adjust the key response rate - but that would introduce other problems, and it would slow down my typing.",

When it was new, the keys are surprisingly responsive. Just make sure you hit the right part of the space bar. I used it in my office at my desk, so it received moderate to high use.",

The only negative is that the shift and return keys are smaller so that causes a lot of typos for me. I can type really fast and this hasn't slowed me down too much.

Once a single key goes out a keyboard is useless, let alone 15 keys. I am meticulous about the care of my possessions and I guarantee you I did absolutely nothing to harm this thing. I am anal about my stuff. This thing is junk. Unfortunately for me the return policy sucks and I can't return it. HUGE WASTE OF MONEY.",

If you're a gambler, by all means, buy this. If you want a robust keyboard that will work as expected, you might want to keep looking. The one I got lasted from Monday to Thursday.",
