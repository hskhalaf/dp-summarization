Even when I bought a vac with no rotating brush the insides got all wrapped with long hair. So far I love this one with no trouble with tangled brushes. The lift off section was easy to use on the stairs. The small head was a bit noisy echoing on the stairs but cleaned really well. I think I have found the one that is right for me and I'm very pleased.",

Works just as well on hard floors and finds dirt I didnt know was there. It is a little heavy so not really suitable for anyone with disabilities but if you want a clean home - this is it!",

Also, the dust collection cylinder is *tiny*, meaning that you'll probably need to empty it on each use. Not recommended.",

The liftaway is great, but the wand for stairs, curtains etc. is a little cumbersome and inflexible. It is difficult to clean car interiors and round a stairlift for example. It would be good to be able to just have a hose upon which to fix the attachments direct. The hose itself, like Dysons, is too rigid, and stretching it just ends up with the undesirable effect of knocking the body over.

I defy any Shark representative to come and show me how their feature is supposed to work - it certainly does not do the job. Apart from that - the cleaner is nearly as good as our Dyson on carpet but not as good as our Henry for power.",

It has lived up to its promise in terms of cleaning ability, and the facility of adjusting the strength of suction has proved useful. It is very good at retrieving the many excess hairs of our golden retriever! It is still heavier than we would like (we are both in our seventies), and although it is much more manoeuvrable than a Dyson the weight can limit this feature.

Not as bad as my previous vacuum but a few do need cutting out after every clean.",
