Easy to hold and lightweight, I was very surprised and excited to notice that this case did not have the extra \"bulk\" most sturdy and durable cases do. I went from an Otterbox to this case, so it was quite a difference regarding the overall \"look and feel\", but it was definitely worth the switch. Highly recommend if you're looking for a cheap, durable, and sturdy case without any of the additive bulk most higher-end cases have.",

The camera fits just fine with a small space around it (dust and stuff can get in there). The bottom is designed for the X, since it has a symmetrical bottom with the speaker/microphone next to the charging port. Compared to the \"apple designed\" cases, it doesn't cut off the the one side were the mic is, which no one will really notice. Grip is good, haven't had any lines start peeling after a month of use.

Unfortunately, the case didn't look nice for very long.
