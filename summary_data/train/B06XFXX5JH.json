They don't sound blown, it appears to be an issue with the technology. I have played music and watched netflix and movies and the sound is good, but when it comes to this game, it just can't handle it. Please take this into consideration if you play FFXIV. Good graphics, bad sound. If you use headphones to game, then it isn't an issue that should concern you.",

      "text": "This was really a great value. I use this monitor for a combination of work and gaming. You can easily have two files open side by side which is nice for work. For gaming, I think it is pretty good, its not the top of the line monitor, but for most games its great. In my opinion if your looking for a better monitor for gaming you'd have to spend a lot more. Likely three or four times the price.",

It was great while it lasted; I enjoyed the immersive gaming while it was still working. But now it's dead and I need to buy a new monitor in order to work efficiently in 2020. Sad that my HannsG monitor that is 10 years old lasted longer than this ultrawide.",

Looked online and it might be the capacitors. LG warranty states you send in the monitor first, making you loose 3-6 weeks of time without the monitor, instead they should send a replacement and have you send the faulty one in, period. lol ooo LG.....never buying LG again.",
