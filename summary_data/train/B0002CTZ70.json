At 100 yards, the target is very clear and with enough magnification to easily see 556 holes in white paper targets. At 300 yards, with full magnification, the focus is a little fuzzy and I could not see 556 holes in white paper targets but when I used splattter targets with yellow on a black background, I was able to make out my hits. Not crystal clear but enough to make the necessary adjustments. Can't see this scope working for shooting much beyond 300 yards but 300 or less, I think it works well enough for the money.",

      "text": "Great scope, but when digiscoping (using Celestron's own T-mount for Nikon) the T-mount threads always get stuck to the end glass of the eyepiece, where the T-adapter threads are. Since the threads are the same direction as that part of the eyepiece, this means every time I go to unscrew the T-mount adapter it takes the last element of the eyepiece with it, and often there two get stuck together. Last time this happened I couldn't get them unstuck until I bought a lens spanner wrench to get enough torque on the eyepiece element. I'm not sure why the eyepiece itself isn't purged and sealed instead of having this easily unscrewed piece at the end able to come off.",

Anything above that the scope is unable to provide a clear picture despite efforts to keep focussing. The worst part of the lens is that past 20x all the way to 60x, there is very bad purple fringing which makes it impossible to be certain what colours the birds are precisely.

    "description": "Style:80 - 45\u00b0| Configuration:Spotting ScopeThe Celestron Ultima 80 series was designed to perform well in a range of viewing situations.

You\u2019ll also receive a Limited Lifetime warranty and unlimited access to technical support from our team of US-based experts.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n \n\nCelestron\u2019s popular Ultima 80mm Zoom Spotting Scope offers images that are noticeably brighter and sharper than entry level 60mm spotters. The Ultima 80 is a refractor style spotting scope with an Achromatic objective lens. Excellent light transmission is assured by multi-layer anti-reflection coatings on the objective lens as well as on the zoom eyepiece and the BAK-4 prisms. The multi-coated 80mm objective lens delivers 77% brighter views than a 60mm scope, and the built in zoom lens produces sharp images from 20X all the way up to 60X magnification. The Ultima 80 features a sleek, waterproof design and includes a padded soft case with zippers on both ends so the scope can be protected even while mounted on a tripod. Including the eyepiece the Ultima 80 measures just over 18 inches long and weighs about 3.6 pounds. The rubber eyecup can be removed to expose a standard \u201cT-thread\u201d for attaching a camera. I like the 45* angled eyepiece because I can use a shorter tripod to support the spotting scope while viewing or while taking pictures with a small camera attached to the eyepiece. \n\nThe focus ranges from 27 feet to the horizon with just a few turns of the focus knob. When I fold down the rubber eye cup I can keep my glasses on and see the whole 2 degree field of view at 20X magnification. With my glasses on I need very little focus adjustment while I crank the zoom eyepiece from 20X up to 60X. Sometimes though I like to take my glasses off while observing because the view seems to have just a little more contrast and sharpness. I like the fact that the Ultima 80 gives me a sharp image either way. \n\nThe drawback of the tradition crown and flint achromatic lens used in the Ultima 80 Zoom Spotting Scope is a bit of false color, also known as blue fringing or chromatic aberration. Blue fringing seems well controlled at 20X magnification, but it becomes increasingly noticeable as I zoom up to 60X. Celestron also offers the Ultima 80ED and the Regal 80 F-ED spotting scopes which use exotic ED glass lenses to virtually eliminate blue fringing and produce the sharpest possible high power views.\n\n\n\nShot at 20X zoom at about 20 yards, cropped 50%\n(Click here to see uncropped)\n\nShot at 20X zoom at about 50 yards, cropped 30%\n\nShot at 20X zoom, uncropped but reduced in size\n(Click here to see at 60X zoom)\n\nShot at 20X zoom at about 50 yards, cropped 30%\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe Ultima 80mm offers a step up in aperture from the 65mm, offering 50% brighter images. The 80mm refractor features excellent multi-coated optics packed into a portable and durable refractor design and it comes standard with a 20-60x zoom eyepiece. This series was designed to perform well in a range of viewing situations, making it a great all-around optical instrument. Youll love it for observing nature and long distance spotting. The green metal optical tube allows for subtle observation in any nature environment. Ultima spotters are a great companion for any nature or outdoor enthusiast.\n\nSee more",
