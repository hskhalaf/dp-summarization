The trouble is the charger. Once the original chargers go bad, and they do. A standard off the shelve, Walmart, charger will not work with BLE phone. I Do not know why. Perhaps the rapid charging in the phone? However I did find a charger on Amazon the works. The MND 2.1 ah for $13.95.",

It is good for about 3/4 day, but I still have to charge. It does charge very rapidly. My main complaint is that the phone compresses images for sending texts. My photos look really strange when I send them. I also have trouble with various apps.",

Battery life is also great and if used as a regular phone(talk/text only) one charge will last me 3 days. . . With heavy internet usage it will only go down to probably 60% battery after a whole day of usage. All in all its a great phone for $200.",

The focus mode picture is also great. Only con I would say is the battery area gets heated up on usage, especially on GPS mode.

That is the only reason that I gave 4 stars instead of 5. Also the user interface is kind of like an iPhone. I hate iPhone. Just a minor annoyance.
