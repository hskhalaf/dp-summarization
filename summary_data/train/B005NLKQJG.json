      "title": "Decent Deadbolt Design Flaws",
      "text": "While this lock works well and looks great, it does break easily. The deadbolt automatically closes after 30 seconds (programmable feature). If the door is partially closed when the deadbolt tries to extend, the pocket in the door frame doesn't align with the deadbolt, which jams and stops. If this occurs periodically over time, the deadbolt mechanism eventually fails, and stops reliably sensing the deadbolt position. It must then be replaced. We've had one deadbolt fail in this manner. A second had a defective pin header for connection to a wifi module (which required replacement). Pretty decent deadbolt overall, but they are expensive. I'm not sure I'd buy them again.",

Installation was straightforward and the voice prompts for programming were helpful. Battery life in my application appears to be in the 4-5 month range using Ni-Cads. Integration with the Samsung system was painless. I specifically was looking for a system that did not require a monthly fee to use remotely and this system fits the requirements.",

I have tried the known paperclip unlock pick and it didn't work. used a whole variety of metal rod thicknesses with no avail. So either I'm a terrible criminal, or I have an improved lock.

I couldn't find a feature to quickly delete all codes, so somewhat tedious to manage codes from the touchpad. The the version I bought came with a z-wave radio module that you plug into the inside of the lock. Z-wave setup took a while, but we got it working with a USB stick. Privacy mode is a great feature to lock out all codes from the inside, just hold the interior button until the lock announces, \"privacy mode\".",

They last barely a month before they need to be replaced. In the end, I had to remove the network modules, because more often that not, the locks were dead. Since I removed the network modules, battery life has improved significantly, but it defeats the whole z wave thing, doesn't it?",

It has the coolest interactive touch screen with voice prompts and futuristic sound effects, and the entire body is made out of metal. In stark contrast, the competing Kwikset Z-wave model has a flimsy plastic back without a touchscreen. This Yale model is literally years ahead of the Kwikset model. I love unlocking the door for visitors from afar using my cell phone, because the lock makes a futuristic melodic tone when it unlocks, and the touchpad lights up with the numbers scrolling in a cool pattern. Rock solid quality, and in comparison the Kwikset model looks like a cheap toy.",

One MINOR nit -- and I'm not knocking off a star for this because it's not really the product's fault -- is that the rectangular shape of the unit doesn't quite give enough \"coverage\" at the bottom to hide the original deadbolt's impression into my wooden door. So I had to sand, apply wood filler, sand, and paint my whole door again -- just for the sake of about a half-inch at the bottom ... and because I'm a perfectionist. Anyway, that all done, it looks GREAT on the door, and works very well. And it rather impresses folks who come to visit. :-)",
