Our carpet was matted with short dog fur and the difference was immediate. My wife almost had a stroke when she found out how much I'd paid, but on seeing the results, she was blown away. The house even smells cleaner, which she noticed right away. Not only do they work extremely well, but they're also a pleasant machine to look at. Do yourself a favor if you're undecided and just buy a Dyson. Also, no, I don't receive any compensation from Dyson, but do have the utmost faith in their product.",

Now less than a year later we can't use it as the burning smell is overpowering and I'm afraid it might catch fire. I took the front roller attachment apart to see if something was stuck inside but don't see anything. Will throw it away and get a Bissel or Hoover.",
