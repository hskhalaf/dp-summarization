I have another sony noise cancellation over the head earphone, it was a gift (one of the awesome gift I ever got). but it was too big to use at work, hence I wanted to buy something small. As I was much impressed by the over the head model performance, I wanted to buy this sony earbud (not much of a price difference from other major brands). Problems: * Phone call voice was not audible . It was discreet. * By default right headset gets connected, everything seems good until then. After connecting left headset there is audio lag even in youtube videos.",

Sony WF-SP700N is light , the noise cancelling is fantastic, xtra base is unbeatable no other true wireless brand can beat Sony WF-SP700N. The sound quality is so good that I can ditch my Beats studio2. Optional: I added COMPLY FOAM bud on both my Sony MDR xb50bs and Sony WF-SP700N which probably enhanced the comfort and sound quality. The COMPLY FOAM 200 series (i bought it on Amazon) is compatible with my Sony.",

After about 6 months, the left bud which is the \"master\" of both stopped charging, thus making the headphones useless. I tried to contact SONY support and got nothing.
