I started working out in August and I finally decided that I\u2019m not being satisfied with my result so I\u2019ll just invest in a protein powder. It was hard choosing and getting so many references made it even harder. I chose to go with Syntha 6 and it was a great decision, I love this flavor and if you follow the scoop with 4 oz rule the flavor taste great!! I also started seeing results! I am lifting much more weight, and my body isn\u2019t as tired as normal when I get done lifting ! Great product! Can\u2019t wait to try other flavors",

This time there is something different, 1) the powder doesn't dissolve like it used to (I'm not using a blender, just a blender bottle and it doesn't work right anymore). 2) the taste is bitter now, it use to be super sweet and that's the only sugar I have but this doesn't taste right anymore. 3) any time I open the bottle it's like a dust storm comes up from it, old stuff wasn't like that. Guess everyone is going to cheaper quality while they jack up the prices. So sad cause this was my favorite. Got to find something else now ....",

It does have a higher carb count than other proteins that are non-mass building but seriously, 15 grams in this (versus 3-5 grams in the other brands) per serving is nothing if you're not cutting.",

It is so good i almost want to return it because i don't deserve to taste something this good in my life. I paired this with a sandwich made by my girlfriend and i almost cried because i thought i was drinking a milkshake and killing my eating habit. Nah, i said to my self. Young man, enjoy yourself a second scoop.",

Not only that but it tastes great. I've only tried the chocolate peanut butter but I'd give it a 10/10. Mixes great with a shaker cup. No clumps or chalkiness. Just a great protein shake. Highly recommend.",

I will say I have never just had it plain with water. I always blend it with vanilla soy/almond milk and some kind of frozen fruit. But again, compared to several other brands I've tried, this one is hands down the best.",
