      "text": "Not only is there plenty of room for 6 rubber animals, complete foam alphabet and 10-digit numbers, and other random toys, this organizer actually sticks to the wall! I used windex on the wall just like the instructions explained, turned the hook, and voila! They stuck to a wall that's not exactly a flat surface. Also, I love this toy bag because it leaves corner tub space available for shampoo,mconditioner, and soap bottles. In my house, that extra space is priceless! Don't look any further than this product. It is AWESOME,",

Kristin was so helpful and for my troubles she sent me a whole new organizer and upgraded me to the deluxe for free. This is excellent customer service! I also LOVE the organizer. It fits all the shampoo and body wash bottles perfect and the toys. The deluxe comes with an additional large single pocket toy bag that I just don't need right now. The bag seems very sturdy and the suction cups are very strong. Just received the other day so can't review it's long term durability. Will update if that changes.",

The included instructions were very helpful. Now my son has a place to store and help clean up his bath toys. Cons: check the sizing - it does take up a lot of space on the wall.

So the point doesn\u2019t even matter now because it can\u2019t hang. So it was convenient while it lasted. Now it\u2019s pointless. Great product, excited to fill up. The extra hooks are also super useful. I have four kids who love bathtime so this definitely will come in handy.",

Downside though is we've gone through the extra hooks it comes with. They're very cheap and break so easy. It has a flimsy plastic peg to keep it \"secure\" in the middle. We have not been rough with them, just sliding them around the walls of the tub to find the perfect spot and they've broken. Besides that, it holds a good amount of toys and just recently got the first bleaching since the bottom was starting to change colors. Highly recommend but do find better hooks!!",

I am so glad to have found this nifty bath organizer. It consolidates our scrub brushes, sponges and razors in such a tidy way. Aesthetically it looks much better in comparison to our old system of piling them on a shelf. Another plus is the light weight but strong netting allows faster drying time for wet items placed in the organizer. I am impressed how strong and secure the suction hooks are. It also comes with a set of 2 adhesive hooks for porous or non-smooth surfaces. Hooray! No more falling shelves!",

Now my child easily cleans up after his bath. No more stepping on hot wheels when I get in the shower!",

Both hooks are held together by a small plastic piece and both hooks had that piece fall away and get lost within a few months. Since the mesh bag held up I just kept that and used command hooks. Annoying. The suction cups held to the tile walls very well. However they are unusable if the hooks aren't there.",

I contacted them about our plastic hooks, and within an hour they responded and are going to send us replacement hooks for free!!! I would definitely buy the tub cubby again!!",

Only con is that one side does occasionally come down and I have to reapply it, not a big deal though. My suggestion would be to make sure you clean the surface of your tile before putting the hook up and don't overload the net with too many heavy toys. It's a great product for the price and it does what you need it to do.",
