There is no audible feedback when BT disconnects occur (which is a dealbreaker when the headset disconnects as often as this one does), no convenient mute button on the headset (or perhaps my phone mis-maps the button as On/Off?). YMMV but IMO...use the $ to buy something with more features and a better mic...one that is not so sensitive to 2.4GHz interference. Perhaps you literally need to be a truck driver, out in the middle of nowhere for this to work as advertised?",

Also, the microphone voice quality sounds like you are talking into a soup can and you end up repeating myself so that other could clearly understand my words. The ear foam piece is not very comfortable. Finally just reverted back to my old corded device. Update: The new replacement model is far superior to the old model. Sound is clearer and more comfortable. Battery life more acceptable as well.",
