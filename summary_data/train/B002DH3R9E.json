This is a decent sheath to house a knife that you throw in your glove box, but you probably wouldn't want to take it on a wilderness survival adventure. I got it for around $7 delivered, so I really can't critique it much. The velcro tab holds my puuko in place, but there is definitely some wiggle going on.",

      "text": "I got this today in the mail and I really liked it at first. It felt nice and looked alright. The velcro strap is just useless and barely holds together. Then came the biggest upset ever, I slid my knife into the sheath and bam, the tip of my knife sliced right through the sheath and cut my hand. I guess it's an alright sheath if you don't keep your knives sharp or pointy. I just threw the thing away and bandaged my hand up. What a complete waste of time and money. This would be okay for a toy knife.",
