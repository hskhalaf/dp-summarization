      "text": "Over the years, I've owned multiple Sennheiser products, and they have all been quality pieces of equipment. As soon as I opened the box, I knew that this wasn't authentic Sennheiser. It looked and felt cheap, the logo wasn't right, the plug wasn't right, and the way that the wiring was assembled made the earbuds almost unusable. When I examined the packaging, I found that Sennheiser's QR label and authenticating holographic sticker were absent. The final nail was going to the Sennheiser website to discover that there is no such model as the CX 300 II. The current model is the CX 300.",

After just over one month of usage (purchased these on July 3), I'm now having to buy yet another pair of earbuds. They will not be Sennheisers.",

I had before a Sennheiser LD101 with great sound if you were alone at night in a room, but during the day at traffic they had no good noise isolation.. this one has!

Some of you don't know why one side of the earbuds has an adjoining wire that is longer than the other side. I was not expecting this myself, but I prefer this. For those that are confused this has many applications, but I like it because it reduces the wiring as a whole from getting in the way of what you're doing. Just use it for awhile and you will know what I mean. If you really don't like this style then don't buy these headphones.",

These are among the best earbuds I've ever used, period. They sound isolate, so when the bud seals your ear canal you get low lows and high highs. I only bought these because I needed a similar pair to the ones I bought years ago for home, office, and travel. These do sound better than the old pair, but only if you really strain yourself to hear the difference. One of those things you use almost every day so do yourself a favor and get a great pair!",

Informing the foregoing comments is my experience with (1) circumaural headphones--Panasonic RP-HTX7, which retails for just around $20 and a pair of well-regarded Sennheiser HD595, (2) Samsung earbuds pre-packaged with a Galaxy phone. Even the free samsung earbuds seem to have greater audio fidelity, although their low-end is wanting. In sum, these earbuds are good exercise headphones because they isolate noise adequately, but their performance audio-wise is simply mediocre. This conclusion is largely consonant the impressions of this headphone on such online fora as Head-fi and Audioholics.",
