It may take some getting used to, but end the end you'll learn to appreciate your favorite music more without head rattling bass. Cons: - If you're going to need to used these wired (ever even once) you will need to order the 3.5mm jack that is made for this headphones. Almost all other 3.5mm connectors will be too wide for the input hole which is inset for some crazy reason.",

And after a few months the right side completely snapped, as shown in the other picture. The sound quality is great, but for a high end headphone and price the headband should last more than a week. And more than one year. I highly discourage anyone to purchase this product. Note it comes with a hard case to store the headphones and I used the entire time!",

Reduced the noise greatly, and the options for when the attendant comes by so you can hear and speak is just a wave of your fingers over the outer touch adjustments. Sitting in KSA now using them to listen to some music and tune out the noise outside. Highly recommend.",

Traveling with the Bose is slightly easier as the case is a bit more compact, but nothing beats the feature of the Sony's to be able to cup your hand over one ear and hear someone talking to you. That alone puts these over the top. These are well made and sound as good as anything in the 300-700 range.",
