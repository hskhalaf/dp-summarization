The last time I painted these shutters it took 2 days with a paint brush. It was my first time using a sprayer and only wish that I had discovered it sooner. I thought it would be complicated because I am female and not familiar with thing like that. I used SW latex with primer paint and put a little water to thin. Clean up was easy just follow directions but do clean it good so it won't clog. Hopes this helps!!!!",

Then I tried thinned alkyd enamel and had to put so much spirits in that it was hard to even keep the thinned paint mixture consistent. It finally sprayed okay with that, but it was waaaaaaay thinned and just a huge pain. Do yourself a favor and buy a more powerful sprayer. This is just a frustration.

This collects any small bits or particles which keeps the sprayer from clogging up.

Yes, you can try to thin the primer - but at what cost to your goal of applying a good primer coat. So I will retain it for non-latex jobs around the house, and purchase a unit that can spray Kilz. Not a negative review - just a \"heads-up\" to those of you who need a sprayer for latex paint priming of anything. If I had experience with these, I might have already known this.",

Doesn\u2019t leave streaks like normal paint rollers if you do touch up strokes after your initial strokes. It also dry the paint quicker as well.
