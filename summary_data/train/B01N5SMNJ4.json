Very happy with results - see the dog door entry was embarrassingly filthy. Thought we\u2019d have to replace carpet. It took a few tanks but just look at the carpet now. Really great results. Assembly is easy, only two screws. I like that you can empty the dirty water with having to disassemble the other tank. Have already recommended to a friend.",

My son contacted amazon and was told he needed to take it to a service center, I could understand that if the cleaner was several months old but this has been used 4 times and has leaked every time it has been used. To me that is a lemon and needs to be replaced, I suppose we will see what happens. So far very disappointed.",

I have to say I am very impressed with this. It cleaned the carpet very well. The machine parts themselves are so easy to clean because it comes completely apart with a snap or a lever. The tanks for the solution and clean water are separate. No mixing and easy to fill. The dirty water reservoir is good sized and easy to remove, empty and return. It really is nice to use! Not like those bulky, heavy rentals. I highly recommend it!",

In February, we purchased this carpet cleaner. We've been very pleased with it. We keep it ready to go so that we can clean any accidents with it immediately. A week ago, we had our normal carpet cleaning appointment with a friend that is a professional carpet cleaner. He commented that our carpets look very good. They don't have the normal stains that usually show on pet owners carpets. It's a good machine and the price is reasonable for what you get. I highly recommend it.",

This thing obliterated that stain and erased the dinginess of the carpet from the years of issues my cats have had on it. I love how much water it holds and how you can choose to spray water with cleaning solution or just water by itself to rinse. I was able to clean the high-traffic/spill/accident areas of my living room and bedroom before running out of water.",

Plus a toddler. I\u2019m so impressed, these results were on the Quick clean setting, not even the deep clean. These stains have been on our floor for Atleast a year, without stain treatment prior to doing this. So far I definitely recommend, I have not used it on the stars or the hose yet.",

It will stop suction prematurely if you have too much soapy water returning. Long story but I don\u2019t expect most people to have that issue. If you pull the grey filter down a touch and leave about a quarter inch gap, it solves that annoyance. Otherwise it is a fantastic machine, very happy with its performance.",
