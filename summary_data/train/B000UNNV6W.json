It took us 2 hours to figure out how to get one on. We thought the second one should be easy, but we worked for over an hour on it and gave up. We are going for the traditional snow chains that are idiot proof.",

      "text": "Purchased the 245 size, which is the recommended size for my tire (225/65R17). After tightening them to the last tightening link, they were still only draped on the tire and would not tighten any more. After contacting Konig and showing them these pictures they recommend trying the smaller size 240. Thank goodness I purchased them through Amazon with their awesome return policy. Many retailers will not accept tire chain returns and if they do there is generally a restocking fee for something that looks used. The difficulty is fitting these to the tire without getting them a little dirty/banged up because you have to drive on them for proper fitment.",

I would never have gotten up both if not for the chains. Highly recommend. I put them on right before I get to my road which has an incline. Very happy with them!",

I checked the size, and the chains appear to be a little large for my 2007 Honda Odyssey, since the tightening mechanism runs out of chain, but I was able to re-thread a few times to take up the slack. My only wish is that Thule would include a few rubber adapters to give the chains a tighter fit, or they could give me the option to shorten the chain used to tighten up the slack. Overall, not a big deal.",

    "description": "Manual tensioning system: one stop to fit the chain and one to tighten it. Suitable even for muddy ground.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nWhen the winter comes, Thule has the snow chains that get you there safely, easily and in style. Thule, known worldwide as a manufacturer of highly innovative automotive racks and accessories, is proud to offer the newest in their catalogue of winter gear. Thule's award-winning design team has worked extensively with the world's leading automobile manufacturers to re-engineer the standard snow chain. Tested in the Italian Alps, this line of snow chains is surefooted and safe, as well as remarkably easy to install and remove. To make sure you find the right chains for your tires, check the Thule Snow Chain Fitment Guide and find your tire size. \n\nSuperior Engineering and Design \nThule snow chains are hand-made in Italy and are constructed of durable, hardened manganese nickel alloy steel. They feature dual-sided D-shaped links that provide exceptional traction and extend the life of the product. These snow chains utilize a patented self-centering and auto-tensioning system which adjusts itself for a perfect fit. Once the chains are wrapped around the tire, the installation process is completed when the vehicle is set in motion. As the wheels turn, the self-centering and auto-tensioning system activates and the chain tightens around the tire. This eliminates the need to exit your vehicle and brave the elements to re-adjust snow chains. For easier installation in the dark or during the day, all attachment points on the chains are color coded. Additionally, each set of Thule tire chains comes with a hard case, installation mat, pair of gloves, and spare links. \n\nThule XB-16 - Specifically Designed for Heavy Duty Applications \nIf you frequently travel off-road or drive a large vehicle, Thule has created a snow chain just for you. The XB-16 features 16mm D-link chain, the largest and most rugged that Thule offers. This large-diameter chain bites deeply into snow and ice, giving large commercial vehicles and motor homes unsurpassed traction control and safety. The color-coded assembly points and quick-adjust tension control band allow for hassle-free fitting. Removal is just as fast. Simply lifting the tension control hook out of the chain link frees it from your wheel, allowing quick and easy removal. Functional, practical and economical--Thule XB-16 is the snow chain that gives you confidence both on and off the road. \n\nHow to Choose a Snow Chain that Fits Perfectly \nTo choose the right snow chain you must follow a few simple criteria. First, check your vehicle\u2019s maintenance or owner\u2019s manual to verify it contains no warnings advising against the fitting of snow chains on your particular vehicle. Once verified, take careful note of the three measurements on the side of the tire. The first number indicates the width, the second gives you the aspect ratio (sidewall height as percentage of width) and the third denotes the diameter of the wheel expressed in inches. Then click on the Thule Snow Chain Fitment Guide to choose the most suitable model and size for your vehicle.",
