      "text": "What a great compact camera. I have been using this camera for a relatively short while but really like it so far. It is an excellent size, small enough to fit jacket pocket or purse yet large enough to grip and hold solidly. The view screen is very clear and bright and easy to see, even on a bright day (although I am a big fan of eyepiece viewfinders, I find this one of the few cameras I have tried that can handle most brightness without the view screen image becoming bleached out. The camera turns on quickly, focuses quickly and takes excellent photos. Very satisfied at this point.",

      "text": "What I like the most about this camera is the 10X zoom and the HD video. This is one of the few cameras that allow you to do OPTICAL zoom on the video (canon only do digital zoom while in video mode). The zoom is 38mm to 380mm (10X). Not that good for wide angle (38mm vs 24mm or 28mm in most P&S), but I prefer to have more zoom (380mm) than wide angle for short distance pics. Also the video format is MPEG4 which I believe is easy to manage and good in compression. Price is also perfect, got it for $230. Overall great camera!!!",

The automatic focus is quick and works fantastic. The intelligent auto mode and scene recognition work too. Face detection is great. Battery life is good. I love the zoom capability. It's small and lightweight, thanks to the small battery. I really can't think of any cons! UPDATE 12/2012: I've had this camera for over 3 years now. I still love it.

It's very easy to understand and to use, even the Manual features. I holds a good level of Megapixels (10.1) making your photos look stunning and almost professional. It takes the best photos during the day, thanks to the sunlight but night photos are also good, there's almost no noise shown on them but if you want the best quality on them be sure to use a tripod.

The on screen camera mode definitely helps with selecting the proper settings. The video feature is terrific and play back is very good quality. If there is one negative, it's the battery takes too long to recharge, so having a second battery solves that problem.",
