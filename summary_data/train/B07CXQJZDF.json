But once you are familiar with the operation process, it will be very conevenient for you to operate it. In addition, I have to say this is a brilliant way to go keyless and I hate those key lock and bluetooth lock that need to install app. This fingerprints recognition is really good and fast. It doesn't have to install any app., that is a good news for me! Now, it has been working perfectly for about 2 weeks now. Haven't foresee any problem yet. Will update this review if it need.",

After setting you just need to press your finger on it then it unlocks. The battery is strong as well and holds for long time(more than 6 months according to the manual). The lock is very sensitive to your fingerprint just like iPhone screen lock. You can add several fingerprint as you want. The size is small and it is easy to take. The lock is safe and sound. Best lock I have ever use! Strong recommendation!",

The bizarre part is that even though what the directions said would happen didn\u2019t yet their fingers were coded in so it wasn\u2019t as hard as it seemed. After I didn\u2019t follow them, I got my husband & kid in. Also the lock part isn\u2019t that thick so I\u2019m sure it could be cut open, but anyone willing to take the time to cut to get into the shed can have the lawn mower. I\u2019m just happy my kid locks it now!",
