      "text": "I've used a gig bag for the longest and desperately needed the upgrade. This is a great case for the money! It may be just plywood but it's a very sturdy build. The interior is black and very soft so it won't scratch you're guitar. It has a compartment inside for some accessories, smaller than I thought it would be but does the job. The latches work perfectly and it actually locks! However my guitar does move around inside but it's not harming anything...yet, for that I remove a star. Considering the price though, this is a great case that'd I'd recommend for occasional travel and to rehearsals.",

So, obviously we don't carry it around everywhere taking it from place to place in order to play said guitar. One of the buckles has never closed all the way but our move was last minute so we didnt have time to return and get a replacement. The handle broke off yesterday. It has been picked up maybe half a dozen times? The guitar isn't made of concrete. If you need this for more than a safe place for your guitar to live I would recommend looking for something else.",

The Pro Series case features are definitely a huge plus - the guitar (I used it with a Strat) fit like a glove, the guitar didn't move at all, which is always a good sign. The interior looks great and high end, too. However, the top was fairly fragile, easily bent/wobbled when open and even when shut, it would rock back and forth a bit. So - despite the great and snug fit of the guitar I don't have much confidence in the stability of this case and wouldn't take it on the road or (air) travel with it.",

Great construction, nice inside with good compartment. Not as plush as the more expensive models but it will get the job done. Latches work well, one is a little stiff but that's not a big deal. ChromaCast Badge is nice looking as is the material and stitching. I have confidence carrying my guitar around in this case and am very satisfied!",

Inside, a lot of the surface is covered in a mix of velvet like material and plush material. Is it as nice as a case you get with a 2000 dollar guitar? Nope, but it is more than enough to keep your guitar safe around the house and for the occasional gig. Highly recommended.",

Bad: Plywood used is weak making the whole case fragile. Hardware used is inferior for case in this price range. Locking latch is a joke that did not work. 'Plush' lining was thin with plywood showing through due to careless assembly. Overall: Terrible execution of what could have been (as described online) a good guitar case. Would not buy again (even at lower price) unless materials used and quality of assembly improves.",

Built in compartment holds all my pics, strap, extra strings, tuner, guitar tool and a 10 foot cable. So I am very impressed. So why only the 4 stars? Because the case hardware that snaps the case shut has key holes but I did not receive any keys in the package or case. Not a big deal, but if they are going to have locks, there should be keys. Great case",

This is a good sturdy case with three latches, well made, a perfect fit my guitar, and a great price!",

It came in 2 days and did not have any damage to the case. The case is well insulated/lined and includes keys for the lock, which I haven't used yet. It is a lot heavier than I expected it gives me peace of mind that my fans wont be damaged when travelling.",

I probably wouldn't use this case for this guitar if I was a touring or regularly performing musician, but it works great for home storing my guitar that I pull out once a month. Would not use this case to carry an expensive super-sweet fancy custom axe. This is not heavy-duty by any means. It is light weight and quite suitable for light use.",

A slightly thinner guitar like my Gibson SG fits in the divot ok and doesn\u2019t have this problem since the body doesn\u2019t hold it off as high.
