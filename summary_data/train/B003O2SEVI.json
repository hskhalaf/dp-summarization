I'd give it a 5 star except in my experience with 2 different Keen non Targhee boots they are not terribly durable and when they fail, it's not telegraphed, they just fall apart and you have to limp to your car ASAP.

Uses them every day, alternating pairs, walking the dogs 2.5 to 3 miles a day, alternating pairs, in 0* winter snow, spring showers, mud, 90* heat, high grass and fall leaves. Just works.

Last couple pairs had problems with bottom of boot splitting after a year of use, so there has been some slippage in the quality of materials or the method in which they had been applying those materials in the last two years. I usually hike between 50-80 miles a week. Still if you need a bit more roomier hiking boot, without going to a size E, then Keen is a quality product I have used for the last 20 years.

The only issue I have with this boot over my more expensive boots is that it has one top eyelet. Most good boots have two and that gives them a lot more ankle support and a tighter fit around my ankle. I would recommend these boots. They are not $200 boots, but if you don't have $200, these will do well enough for light hiking. If you plan to hike with a heavy pack, these are not the boots for you. You'll need something with more support.",

My feet are a little wide, and this boot showed up in lists for people with wide feet. You know that feeling when you slip on a shoe and it just fits? That was it with this boot.

But being a person with slightly wider than average feet, these have the foot bed recommended to me that is so important to a person with wide feet. These needed to be ordered a half size larger than you wear, but that was fairly clearly explained at the time of ordering. I am glad I saw it though. They would not be as comfortable if I had ordered my actual size! All in all, excellent boot and worth the money. I am enjoying breaking them in!",
