      "text": "This clear lip liner is awesome. It's 100% clear and keeps my lipstick in place. The one thing it can't do, of course, is create nice sharp edges or enhance lip shape, due to being totally clear. I bought this because I didn't want to have to buy a gazillion different lip liners to match each of my lipsticks - and because I find it tough to match liner and lipstick colors. It helps a little with that and works well in other ways, but I'll be going back to colored liners after this one because I like the look of cleaner lines.",
