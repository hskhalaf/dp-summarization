After months of not ovulating and having extremely long cycles (like months at a time), I came across this product and thought, \"It can't hurt\". After just one month of use, I ovulated for the first time and it even happened in UNDER 20 DAYS! I will definitely be purchasing a second box! UPDATE 1/27: Even though I did go on to purchase my second box, I never needed it! I received my BFP after only one month of Pregnitude!",

We were so happy when we got our big fat positive pregnancy test.. but unfortunately due to my own body\u2019s misfortune we Had to have emergency surgery because they found that the pregnancy was an ectopic hiding behind my right ovary. but I do recommend this product when we are ready we will try this product out again. Also it\u2019s got a lot of other good benefits also well.",
