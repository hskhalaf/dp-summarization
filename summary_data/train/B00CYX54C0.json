The right portion of the space bar is working fine, but is this just the beginning? I've used Microsoft ergo keyboards for years on multiple systems (work, home, secondary system) and never had any issues until this series. It just doesn't seem durable compared to earlier versions.",

DO NOT mix the adapters up, or lose them otherwise you have to get a whole new keyboard set instead of replacing just the adapter (like with Logitech devices)",

This keyboard and mouse did the trick; I can scoot it under the computer screen risers (was unable with my last, high-profile ergonomic keyboard). My only complaint, really not a big deal, is the hand rest part of keyboard is a matte finish and looks sorry easily. I just use a baby wipe or cleaning wipe and it comes right off.

For security reasons, Microsoft locks the keys into the dongles at the factory (unlike at least one of their competitors) and they can't be changed later.

I had high hopes for this but I tell you after several months of use I am finally giving up. The keyboard feels good but many times I have to hit a key several times before the character will appear. As for the mouse it is rough, lacking the accuracy of other mice, meaning it takes too much effort to align the cursor with what you are trying to do. The split key board with the numeric pad was a mistake. A waste of money.",
