I was considering to get the mail chime but it is a bit expensive in terms of price so I thought I will give motion detector a try as it's cheaper. I had trouble using duct tape or Velcro tape because my mailbox is plastic and it just falls off. My husband used a nail to secure on the mailbox door and it worked like a charm! Just heard its chime 30 minutes ago then I went out and got my mail, it was amazing! No more walking out every hour to see if my mail is here.",

Destroying the case appeared to be my only option for opening it. I'll buy something else.",

Would not recommend for outdoor usage especially where you have bushes, trees, shade and sun movements that will constantly trigger this sensor. No way to adjust sensitivity.",

    "description": "The 1byone driveway alarm provides a solution to alert you the moment someone enters your property. It's not only very convenient but also extremely affordable. \nWhen movement is detected, the Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor sends a wireless signal to the receiver from up to 100m/328ft away. Adjusting the receiver, you can choose to be alerted by a high or low chime or alarm tone, or instead, with just a silent LED flash. What's more, the receiver can pair with up to 50 sensors, effectively securing a large area. We offer many combinations of sensors and receivers, just choose what best fits your needs.\n\n\nTo avoid false alarms: \nDon't mount the PIR sensor in direct sunlight (as moving heat sources would trigger the PIR) or in a place affected by wind. When installing outside, it's best to mount it in a shady, protected place with minimal changing temperatures. Also, avoiding mounting on UPVC or metal doorframe surfaces which may reduce the transmission range.\n\n\nSpecifications:\nPower Supply (Receiver): DC 6 V or 1.5 V C Battery x 3 (not included) \nPower Supply (PIR Transmitter): DC 4.5 V (1.5 V AAA Battery x 3 )(not included) \nMotion detecting range: 5 - 8 m/16-26ft\nOperating range: 100m/328ft <br> Ring Volume: \u2265100dB ( within 0.5 m/1.6ft)\n\n\nBox Contents:\n2 x PIR Transmitters \n1 x Receiver \n1 x Instruction Manual\n4 x Wall Plugs \n4 x Screws \nHere at 1byone, we stand by our products 100% with a 24-month warranty. A happy purchasing experience is our #1 priority and we will happily send a product replacement if any issues arise.",
