      "text": "These are quality surge protectors, and the outlets are great - but it has one serious flaw (or maybe it's a design element) - there is a \"circuit breaker button\" for the top outlets that disconnects frequently. I put these surge protectors on my wall (cord going down), and noticed one morning the \"top button\" had gone off in the middle of the night, so my phone didn't charge. If you plug things into the bottom two outlets, they're \"on\" constantly, but the top 6 outlets are connected to that breaker button. I have two of these and they both work that way, so understand you're going to have to constantly re-activate that breaker to get these to work!",

The socket timer does the auto shut off for 3 different time selections BUT the reason I subtracted a star is because the reset switch only functions as a toggle back On . If something happens & you need to leave earlier than planned , The switch does NOT function as an off switch . I think the cost of a switch that also functioned as an Off would only raise the price a bit & would be a better choice .",

      "text": "Pros: Good construction, name brand. Cons: Standard #1 Philips screws, but case needs to be pried apart to open. Comparison: Compared this to three other switches. The Belkin has a low intensity green light, can be used with a night light and non-distracting. The non-lighted variants will have less internal wiring, so that would be the benefit. Conclusion: For a lighted and grounded switch, I would recommend the Belkin. For a non-lighted grounded switch, I would go with the Leviton. The GE would work as well. Cannot recommend the Uninex due to quality issues.",

Sometimes electronics need more than 1/2 hour but less than 3 hours to charge, and the light is extremely bright in a dark room, so if one is trying to sleep then to turn it off it's necessary to unplug the whole thing. First-world problem, I know. Purchased this in June 2012 & it's still going 5+ years later (unlike a couple of other Belkin items I've purchased).",

I suspect there is a defective relay inside because the green \"controlled outlet\" switch LED glows green when you turn it on, and fades back to dark over the next 3-8 seconds. You can't get inside, because they have those \"irreversible\" screws that won't let you unscrew them.

Something went awry with my dryer and it no longer shuts itself off predictably, leading to fears that it might burn the house down while left on all day long. No longer! If the dryer malfunctions and keeps going, this will limit the time it stays on. Simple solution to a problem that would probably require a much more expensive repair otherwise.",

I just have the tv plugged into it. So when my son completes a task I can easily turn it back on with just a button and whatever he was watching on netflix is still there. :) Bought a 2nd one for myself for the powerstrip my hair products are plugged into. This way they never are left on. I plan to get another for my sons electric train because he leaves it on.",

      "text": "In the past, I'd been guilty of putting my electronics on a charger and sort of forgetting about them. With modern battery minder software, I've found that this behaviour can shorten battery life (in terms of number of charge cycles it will tolerate before it starts to degrade the number of hours the electronics will run untiil another recharge is needed). Using this little gem, you can pick from 3 different charging times and be assured that you won't walk away and come back after a few days and find your battery full charged (... but secretly a little fried). It's a bit pricey, admittedly, but it's better than having to get a battery replaced prematurely.",

      "text": "Too many times I have driven away from my house with the nagging question \"Did I turn off my straightener?\" Since I love my straightener and didn't want to spend $50+ on a new one, this Belkin Conserve Socket was the best solution. It has three \"conserve\" options, the shortest time limit being 30 minutes. You just plug it in and push the grey button on the top to get the electricity flowing, and it shuts off at the selected time period. It's been reliable turning off at the set time and has given me peace of mind. Even if I accidentally leave my straightener on, I know the Belkin Socket will cut off its power soon.",

The package comes delivered in its original box, not in a protective envelope. The seal on my package was broken on delivery.

An on/off switch makes sense - you can turn something off without unplugging it. Not only is that less wear and tear on the plug and wall socket, it is also safer - less risk of being shocked or electrocuted. It can also save you money by cutting off any standby power the plugged in device may be using. This little device solves all of that. I have been using them for almost 2 years and love them. No problems to report. They just work.",

    "description": "Style:Energy Conserve Surge with RemoteBelkin Conserve Switch - Energy Saving Surge with Remote (F7C01008q)\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe Belkin Conserve Switch Surge Protector with Remote lets you control power to your whole computer system with a single click. The included wireless remote makes it easy to shut off power--including standby power--to up to six devices at once, such as your computer, monitor, printer, external hard drives, speakers, and more. Additionally, two Always-On Outlets stay on for devices that need continuous power, like your router or cordless phone. Place the remote on a desk or shelf, or use the included wall mount.\n\n\n\n\nF7C01008 Conserve Switch\nSurge Protector with Remote\nAt a Glance: * Wireless remote lets you control from up to 60 feet away\n   \n   \n * A single click eliminates power to 6 remote-switched outlets\n   \n   \n * 2 Always-On Outlets for devices that need continuous power, like routers\n   \n   \n * Includes wall mount for wireless remote\n   \n   \n * 1-year limited warranty; $100,000 equipment warranty\n\n\n\nWith the Conserve Switch, you'll easily reduce power consumption and save on energy costs.\nView larger.\n\nUp to six devices can be controlled by the wall-mount remote switch. Save Energy with a Single Click\nA typical household spends an average of $30 per year by leaving computer system devices on but not in use.* The Conserve Switch Surge Protector helps to eliminate wasted power and to keep your electronics well-organized and protected. The included wireless remote has a 60-foot range and does not require a line of sight to the surge protector. Eight Versatile Surge-Protected Outlets\nThe Conserve Switch offers a total of eight surge-protected outlets, six of which are switchable and two that are always on. This means that you can connect up to six devices that can be controlled by the remote, and two devices that will always stay on. The Always-On Outlets are useful for devices that require a constant flow of energy, such as routers, alarm clocks, cable modems, or DVRs.\n\nFor easy operation, the Conserve Switch features a re-settable circuit breaker, a \"not grounded\" light to indicate when a ground is not present, and a manual override button to control switched outlets. It also protects sensitive electronics from power spikes or surges with 1000 joules of surge protection.\n\nSmart Space-Saving Design\nThe Conserve Switch has a slim design that saves space. A sliding safety cover on every outlet provides added protection, and a cable management system keeps cords neat and organized.\n\nSave Even More with Conserve\nFor greater convenience and energy savings, you can place additional Conserve Switch units throughout the house and control them all with a single remote.\n\nThe Conserve Switch Surge Protector is backed by a limited one-year warranty and a $100,000 connected equipment warranty.\n\nAbout Belkin's Conserve Products\nBelkin Conserve products help you to do your part by making it easier to reduce your energy consumption.\n\n*Calculation based on a computer, printer, scanner, monitor, external hard drive, and external speakers on, but not active, for 20 hours per day, at $0.117 cost per kilowatt hour.
