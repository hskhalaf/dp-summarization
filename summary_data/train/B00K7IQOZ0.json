This has a very stiff and bulky inside layer of plastic surrounded by a cloth exterior. They are not easy to turn inside out to clean. It takes way too much effort to clean out the inside corners if you're using this for food. I could fit 2 small sandwiches in it, but I think I'll be using this for something other than food from now on. This isn't the same construction as the Planetwise wet bags that you'd use for cloth diapering.",

Compared to similar, pricing was reasonable; seemed to have high customer stars/comments, and there were many colors and there are many designs to choose from. I purchased 2 sandwich and 2 snack size to alternate through the week. My 15-yo daughter likes using them. They are much less bulky than Tupperware/Rubbermaid type containers, so better for school/backpack. I\u2019m glad I purchase. Only unknown - how well holds up in the wash; however, rinsing and drying them so far, seem easy and works. Will likely purchase more.",

I've used the small size and the larger one both- for slices of cold meat, cheese, various fruits. I will say that I continue to use a plastic container with a lid for things like crackers, pretzels etc - mostly because it keeps them from getting crushed, plus I suppose it's more airtight and keeps them crunchy. But these bags are great, so glad I have them. I feel very gratified, thinking of all the plastic bags I WON'T be sending to the landfill during my son's school years!",

We'll likely buy another one but a different brand to see what the difference could be. I love the zipper b/c crumbs don't get stuck in it like with the velcro type bags. Hope this review helps.
