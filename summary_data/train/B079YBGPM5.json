I use it for about 30 minutes per day while eating an early breakfast and it keeps me going all day! I cannot say enough good things about this light. Also it is small enough to be portable which is very convenient, it would fit anywhere in my apartment. Highly recommend!",

The stand is fine for basic desk work, but annoying if you use it in bed or on an uneven surface. Overall though I love this thing and the price is great.",

After using it for ~10 minutes in the morning, for 3 mornings in a row, my \"face disease\" was activated.... (which is a strange itchy/numb/swollen/burning/bumpy/weeping rash that I get around my \"muzzle\" for 3 days, then slowly dissipates over the next 7 days, and I know is activated by the sun, and no it is NOT herpes, I was tested 4 times for that....)",
