And the top platform is very large and comfy to sit on. There were a few holes that had to be pre-drilled before I could assemble but no big deal. All in all very happy with this ladder. Saw a review that stated it floats but I haven't had that problem, just filled the legs with water as instructed",

I have the 32'x16'x52\" Intex Ultra Frame rectangular pool and this ladder sits just above the top rail of the pool. I used the stabilizer bars just above the top rail and some stakes on the outside legs to keep it from moving at all. The wife loves the sturdiness, the wide platform at the top, and the fact that it can be locked to keep kids/others from using it is a great bonus. I would definitely suggest buying this!",

We had to improvise to attach it to the pool ledge. It is an intex ultra frame so we used some bungee cords to wrap around and through the ladder and onto the pool ledge. It has worked just fine. This one feels much safer than the one that came with the pool.",

The steps and overall build of the ladder feels sturdier than the Intex ladder that came with our pool, but climbing up it, turning around at the top and climbing down into the water, the ladder is still very wobbly. We had a hired handy man put it together with his drill. He said he had to cut out the opening of the holes because a lot of plastic was covering them, so it took him about 30 min to put together or so. Not too bad. Just wish it didn't feel as though it was going to tip over using it (it hasn't....yet.)",
