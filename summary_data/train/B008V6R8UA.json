I had bought this because I really liked the glossy, sharp look of it in the pictures however in reality looks like a piece of lumber was dunked to a white glossy paint before the wood was sanded, smoothened and treated appropriately. I called in, they asked for pictures, I took pictures of the cracked areas, and sent all the pics to them asking for replacement,they said they will contact their producer, and will get back to me. No one did for months. I called back again. They said they will send replacement, but they never sent them.",
