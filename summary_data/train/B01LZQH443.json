I tried the Blue Blur on a cold stormy day with 16\" of fresh powder and it was terrible. I stuck really bad and it made it nearly impossible to ride the flats. My friend who I waxed with just an all-temp did better on the flats then me. I don't recommend using the Blue Blur unless its a cold groomer day, even then its not ideal.",
