With that said, once we discovered that our baby liked being worn, we moved on to the Solly and ring slings, as the Moby has a ton of fabric (compared to other carriers) and is really hot. Still a good budget choice! I don't regret this one at all.",

That said the material is soft and it is good quality. I ended up getting the baby bjorn which does not have to be as tight on the baby to keep them in position and offers better support so that he doesn't slouch when I am carrying him.",

Very light weight and doesn't take up too much space...and listen to your wife when she says to make it tighter, mama knows best!",
