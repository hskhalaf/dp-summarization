The size is small, but that's all I need in the small bathrooms. ** Grocery store shopping plastic bags work well inside these and are easy to remove, tie up and dispose of. Nice value to be able to buy two for a reasonable price. Thick plastic-like sturdy material, and withstand a drop on the ceramic floors easily. Sturdy and well built and do the job in a small way. Converting from \"quart\" size is tricky, so I posted the measurements in the photos to help you decide if this is what you want to buy for your need.",
