      "text": "The contour fit of this kettlebell is by far the most ergonomic and is worth paying extra for, I can assure you. When you are in any 'racked' position during your exercise routine, the contoured ball fits snugly against your forearm and causes no discomfort at all, unlike other round kettlebells. The grip is very comfortable, although the handle could be just a bit wider for those with bigger hands, but that's not a huge issue in my opinion. Overall I believe this is the best ergonomic fit in the market right now.",

Start with the 7 lb. and work your way up in weight. This way you won't get frustrated with your progress. I ordered the 10 and 15 lb bells to be a constant reminder that I must move up in weight. Exercise Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, be patient and you will feel and see the difference. Watch the video several times, learn the different exercises, then practice each before you start the full routine.

I have fairly large hands, and I find the handle on this to be a good size - not too big, but both hands can hold for swings without being cramped or overlapping. The vinyl on it is a nice feature as well. As I gain strength, I'll be getting the next size up of this kettle bell.",

The design would be so much better if the edges were more rounded. Give it 2 stars for the good idea and the quality seems good, but to me they do not offer the ergonomics I was looking for and I will be returning the two that I purchased.",

I use the 20 lb bell and my wife has the 10, we both love the compact form and contour for overhead presses/thrusters, etc. The handle is grippy but smooth enough for changing grip mid exercise without irritating your hands.",

The plastic coating is non evenly sealed on the bottom. The 2nd bell I purchased is perfect. They need to improve their quality control.

Also, the DVD emphasizes the form for kettlebell swings and deadlifts, teaching you to put the weight on your heels, keep your back up, and use your hips, not your back, for elevating. There is even a warmup wall squat without any kettlebell weight to drill the proper form. After hurting my back 3 times because I wasn't paying attention to the correct technique, I now use strict form and haven't hurt my back since. Highly recommended.",
