I have mine overclocked to 165Hz, and it's a dream. The stand is VERY durable and very tall. Having the option for G-SYNC is amazing.

If will even stay slightly warm even after \"resting\" for the whole night. I'm turning it OFF with the switch on my power strip, but this annoyance is still here - especially for the guys who leave computers on or just in sleep.",

Only negative at this point is a single pixel stuck at green. Tried some of the methods to unstick it and no joy.

They are still shipping monitors from the factory with bad firmware that can only be corrected by you shipping the monitor back to them at your own expense. Obviously they should simply install proper firmware in the first place. This has been a problem for over two years. That reflects poorly on Acer, not just this product. Other issues: the color is way, way off. You have to correct the tint in the monitor OSD and in your video card settings to get it right.",

It's also a little easier on my very sensitive eyes as long as I turn the brightness way down from default. I do wish it had HDR and a better color gamut, but out of the box the color accuracy is far better than anything else I've ever had. My one real gripe is that there doesn't seem to be any sharpness setting and it's oddly slightly too low.",

Would definitely recommend if picture quality is important but you are looking for higher FPS. I don\u2019t really like all the gamer settings and stuff, they are pretty dumb. The speakers as expected were pretty bad, but the settings and speakers were not why I bought it. So I am very happy so far after day 1.",

With a black background it looks like I have a gradient going from a decent black all the way to a light gray background. When I get home from work I'll try to take a picture. AVOID",

So I was annoyed and in a hurry to get a better monitor and just bought this one for $700. It's a great monitor minus the usual IPS bleeding, but you can't really do much about that. Just make sure you get it at a decent discount, or look around for other monitors with the same specs at a better price.",
