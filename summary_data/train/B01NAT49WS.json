I write with a Fine point fountain pen and get very little bleed-through with this paper--only in places where I intentionally make certain areas extra bold. It writes very smoothly. The paper is coated enough that the ink does not bleed out but also absorbs/dries fast enough to not smear. The binding is very good, and it does fold flat for ease of writing all the way to the margin on both sides of the sheets. The pen loop is a nice feature. This makes a great personal journal. I wish they had an A4 size that I could use for work.",

The best part, in my case, is the thickness of the pages so I can use a standard ink pen and not worry about it bleeding through. The cover feels like a suede-type material and is very \"grippy\". Makes it easier to write in awkward positions like in your lap or standing and have a better hold on the book. The pen loop on the spine is a nice addition so I won't loose my ink pen easily.

I'd have given it 5 stars if the pen holder elastic didn't immediately stretch to the point of becoming useless (see image). The closure elastic also stretched out much too easily, but that has less impact on usability and the pleasure of using it.",

I historically used Moleskin but decided to try this one out because I liked the pen loop feature. I will not be going back to Moleskin as this notebook is clearly superior. The paper is thick and smooth, easy to write on, and you can't read through on the same page. If you like your notepads, I recommend this one,it is the best I ever used.",

The supple covering that it used to have is now a cheap, plasticy/pleather feeling material, and the fabric spine is now a gray pleather, with black markings that look like grime or dirt. In addition, one of the pages had not been cut, so it stuck out past the others. Just returned it, and will NOT be seeking a replacement from this company.",

Along with the elastic strap on the binding to hold you pen, as well as, the elastic strap to hold shut the notebook. Very excited to use.
