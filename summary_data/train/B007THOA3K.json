My cats used go crazy trying to eat it out of my hand when I would break it into little pieces but now one cat just sniffs it and walk away and the second cat spits it out after putting it in his mouth. The pieces used to be very dry, white cubes and now are greasy, pink flat shapes. It also appears the other flavor my cats liked, beef, is no longer available. Did the company get bought out or something?",
