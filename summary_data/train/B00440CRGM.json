My only issue is that the mdf is loose enough that in a couple of spots the screws used to attach the top didn't have much to grab onto before you could feel them starting to slip. Fortunately, that was the top, which will be held in place by gravity and it was only a couple of the 7 or 8 screws that had that problem. Other than that, it went together easily and my mother in law is very happy with it.",

Assembly took about an hour, by an experienced handyman, but there was a lot of chatting throughout, so could probably be done faster. Remote control works fine and is easy to use. If I were to buy another fireplace, I\u2019d spend (a lot) more money to get a more realistic one; I\u2019m hooked on the electric fireplaces!",

The only problem I experienced was the dowels that came with the fire place were too small for the drilled holes. I had to replace the dowels with ones I had on hand. I don't know if it was just the unit I received that had the wrong diameter dowels, but if you're not handy, you may have problems assembling it. The fireplace really accents our room and has become the main focal point.",
