The perfect size (24 can) for a guy like me (6' tall, walks 15 minutes each way to work) that puts 3 each 16oz cold drinks in it, an small umbrella, and a good sized lunch and snacks for the day. -Has a detachable strap (which is important, read the cons). Cons: -Too expensive. -Strap is designed for very short distance walking, i.e. is only 3 feet long and has no shoulder cushion. Painful to use on day one. Had to spend another $9 to order a new strap via amazon that is much longer and has a shoulder strap. -Zippers are hard to use at times.",

For those of you who are upset about not getting the front pocket you need to pay closer attention. The smaller lunch box (12 can model) does not have the front pocket and if you select the small model the picture does in fact show no front pocket. The larger lunch box (24 can model) has the front pocket. So no, there was no false advertising. I ordered the red/black 24 can lunch box and it has the front pocket.",

The main zipper on top is too snug to the plastic interior making it difficult to unzip. t's not uncommon that I have to pull on several times to get the cooler open. 2. The loopy zipper pull themselves are all the same color and cross each other, therefore when the cooler is closed, sometimes I pull on the wrong one. Apart from the zipper irritations, overall I am very pleased with this cooler.",
