We hung our beach towels on it but they were dragging in the sand and the wind was whipping them around so, I don't recommend it for towel use, especially if you are sitting under the umbrella. Hanging things up under the umbrella also disrupted our view so, I believe this would be more useful when hanging smaller items. After affixing it to the umbrella, It tightens by turning a good sized knob. The strength of it \"staying up\" is dependent on how tightly you are able to fasten it.",
