I've been using it since April 18, 2017 and I still have a really good amount left and I apply this day and night. LilyAna Naturals was very quick to respond when I had a question about the order of applying this with my skin care regimen. Will order my next bottle soon!",

I'm 32 but my skin has never been great, lots of random breakouts and even nodules. My outbreaks are usually in response to food or stress etc so I don't expect much change there. But I do see a good change in my skins tone - more even, skin looks brighter, more hydrated, and nice and firm. And I would even say lesser outbreaks due to good moisturizing. Lack of hydration is what causes it a lot of times. I'm very happy and will definitely buy again.",

      "text": "LilyAna Naturals Vitamin C serum is every bit as wonderful as all of their other products. I have extremely sensitive skin that tends to react badly to new products, even when they are introduced slowly. I never experienced this with any LilyAna product, including the eye cream, face cream, retinol cream (I began with every other night application for the first two weeks) and finally the Vitamin C serum. This serum goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly and never dries with a sticky feeling. For daytime use, when I follow it with eye cream and face cream and then use my primer before makeup, it never causes 'product roll up'. I highly recommend all LilyAna Naturals products!",
