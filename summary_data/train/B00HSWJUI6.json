When weighing normal luggage about 50lbs then its impossible to get the reading fixed. It will bounce 3lbs up and down and you can only guess the correct weight. It can cause some surprises in the airport. With smaller weights there is no problem to get the correct fixed weight. 2. When weighing luggage around 50lbs scale makes noises like its about to crack. ITS a LOW QUALITY and worthless product!",

My last scale had problems once it went over 30 pounds... and, it seems my bags are always over 30 pounds. This scale had no problem with the weight and it's sleek design made it easy to weigh. An extra bonus was it's small size makes it easy to pack into a side compartment just before you leave. That way you have your scale with you when you repack for your return trip.

If your bag is over weight, your scale is inaccurate. I work for an airlines, I know what I'm talking about. That being said, every passenger that I've encountered using a hand weight has advised that they have been accurate so far. So let's hope it's true..

The downside is that you must be very still for somewhere on the order of 10-15 seconds for the number to lock. After many uses it may have locked only once for us, varying up to two pounds and point levels, ie. 48.8 to 50.2 and such. Maybe that's because of the sensitivity. It gave us a general idea, but never an exact number so we played it safe and tried to stay away from triggering the number 50. Also it is very easy to accidentally change the unit of measure with one button. Takes a bit to figure out what's happening.",

I have used it weigh calibrated weights and find that it consistently weighs light. It measures about 1 lb light with a 10 lb weight, 2 lbs light with a 25 lb weight and 4 lbs light with a 30.5 lb weight. That is not even close to their claims of accuracy.",

But you can look at the screen and memorize the weight that it shows. The weight I recorded on the scale was about 1.5 kg lighter than the airport scale. I would most definitely assume that the airport's scale is more accurate. This was a bit disappointing, as 1.5 kgs are a lot.",

Simple enough, the part I find hard is holding the luggage steady while the digital scale calibrates the weight. You have to hold it for a little while, but it being heavy, I have a hard time keeping the luggage suspended. Other than that the product itself works fine. The reading is accurate as well. You want to weight it a couple of times to make sure you get the same reading each Time.",

So we returned it and ordered this one based on the Amazon reviews. Actually, I ordered two, one for each home. It does work as stated. One must ensure that the item is balanced to get consistent and accurate readings. When the suitcase is 50lbs I need to have my husband weigh it as I can't lift that with one hand. This item is perfect because we will need to take it with us when traveling in Europe due to the strict regulations on the cheap airlines.",

Its tough but it can be done. Anyway, that's not the fault of this product, it is the form factor and you should be aware of it.",
