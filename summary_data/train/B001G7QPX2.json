    "title": "Breathe Right Nasal Strips to Stop Snoring, Drug-Free, Large, Clear for Sensitive Skin, 30 count ( Pack of 2)",
    "description": "Breathe Right Original Clear nasal strips are breathing aids for your nightly routine. They lift and open your nasal passages to help you breathe better so you can sleep better. Use them to reduce nasal congestion due to cold, allergies, or a deviated septum and help reduce or even stop snoring due to nasal congestion altogether. Breathe Right nasal strips are the only nasal strips that use 3M technology for comfortable fit and removal. Made with flexible, spring-like bands, they open your nose up to 38 percent more vs. decongestant sprays alone.\n\nNo matter what kind of nasal congestion you have, there\u2019s a Breathe Right product right for you. Breathe Right nasal strips come in a variety of strengths, sizes, and types, including original (in sizes small/medium or large), extra strength, tan, clear, and lavender-scented strips.
