I don`t see any good LPS in Target or Walmart anymore. Hope at list they keep selling on Amazon.",

Instead of coming in normal LPS package, it was in a brown box, and so when my daughter opened it, she had no idea what it was and I almost chunked it to the side for later. I think she would've been more excited if it had come in original packaging. However, it is well made, and just as pictured.",
