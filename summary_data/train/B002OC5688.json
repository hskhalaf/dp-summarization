I wanted to buy a second one for my boyfriend to use on our trip but the company wouldn't allow it. I ended up with a different model for him (the ALPS Mountaneering MicroFiber Camp Pillow) and it packed smaller but also didn't fluff up as much and he had to double it over to use it. We both much preferred this one.",

I found these pillows--light, non-inflatable (I sew, so if they ever pop a hole, no worries, they'll still be useful). They were fantastic! We family backpack, so gear is spread out among family members. For our needs, this was great--soft fuzzy flannel on one side, cool polyester (?) on the other. I switched mine from the cool side to the warm side as the temp dropped at night. We will always be using these for backpacking and car camping. I recommend these!",
