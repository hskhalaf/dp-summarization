The Micorsoft Wireless Display Adapter is so easy. However, it does have one drawback, specs say up to 23 feet but in reality less than 15 feet is the best. Since I have a small house, this was fine. Other than that, I highly recommend this product for Windows users.",

One other thing to keep in mind, Microsoft is coming out with a new model for $50 starting March 1st. It's available for preorder on the Microsoft Store website.

I have not had one sessions where i didn't have to reconnect at least twice which is frustrating. Overall it's a great idea and does work. Doing powerpoint presentations this works great.",
