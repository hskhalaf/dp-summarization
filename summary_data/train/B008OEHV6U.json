Overall, it's very portable, comfortable once you get used to it, and is fairly responsive.

It seemingly would shut off, I think the connection with the battery top was too loose. Overall, I liked this mouse and would recommend it.",

Presumably the fault is Amazon's poor selling practice, not Microsoft.",

It has happened a number of times that I have opened my bag and seen the blue light glowing. Battery usage is really low so it hasn't been a big issue. The power button probably should have been a slide on/off button.",

The whole mouse rocked when pressing the left click and initially, I thought this was just part of the design. But, upon further inspection, it rocked because the bottom slide rails were just not set correctly.
