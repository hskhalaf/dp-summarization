I think it is enough high quality parts used even it is not Sanwa parts as I tested before remove lever . It can work almost all current gaming hardwares. (I only tested with Switch, PS4Pro, Steam with XInput though). After I converted to HitBox style, I can use all platform as same as before. So I'd suggest this for first time purchase of arcade stick. If you are picky person, following might be better. Note: Elite model has used Sanwa lever and buttons. F300 Elite for possible HitBox conversion. F500 Elite for no HitBox conversion.",

As a plus, it comes with an 8-way gate so you can swap it out without having to buy anything extra. Overall, a great investment if you want to get an entry level stick for yourself or a friend.",

Everything is standard sized but restrictor gate has 4 phillips in addition to the normal 4 tabs.

Get the F500 instead so you can plug in your 3.5mm headphones directly into the stick instead of having to plug a usb headset into your console. Headphones do not work while plugged into your controller which will have to be plugged into the f300 for it to work with your Xbox or PS4.",

I'm super excited to continue to learn how to best use it for games like Soul Calibur 6, Street Fighter 5, and mk11(consumables are evil). If you are new to fight sticks or are looking for the best bang for your buck, look no further.",

You cannot get a third party play and charge cable for your wireless controller. OTHERWISE, IT WILL NOT WORK. Apparently, the same goes for third party wired controllers. (Hat tip to the YouTube reviewer who reviewed three fight sticks including the Mayflash who helped me troubleshoot this problem!!)",

For the price it seems like an okay product but the huge amount of lag makes it useless for me and you will soon find yourself wanting to replace the joystick and buttons to something more high quality, bringing your total cost to over $100 keep that in mind.",

      "text": "Works really well once you figure out how to use it properly. Response well in fighting games and the buttons are not that clicky. The downside is you have to have a controller plugged in at all times, so if your controller isn\u2019t charged then you will have to have another fully charged controller on standby",

Executing stick combos is pretty easy, and the size is great. It\u2019s easy for finger to reach from button to button with ease. Would definitely recommend!",

It's kind of annoying because i rest it close to me but I don't want to bend my cables. If you are on the fence about this stick, buy it. It's so versatile with systems it feels good and you can customize the hell out of it until you move to a new stick and can even transfer your parts to that one!",
