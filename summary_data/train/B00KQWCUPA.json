Hmmm. Took the tape measure and measured the drapes - 62\", well, except for one side of one curtain, which is 62 1/2\". Frustrating. Having trouble rating this, they work as they should to darken the room and the fabric looks nice and drapes beautifully. Still, two stars off for the length discrepancy. Tip: measure the drapes before hanging them and if they're not 63\", adjust your rod placement (which I did) or request an exchange.",

I only used a skinny rod but you could put up to a 2\u201d rod through the back tabs. The drapes make the room pretty dark (but we also have a room darkening shade on the same window).

      "text": "Holy cow. If you are thinking about these but aren't sure, buy them. They are worth it. I bought the black curtains. They are as black out as you can get. I'm a night shift worker who hates sleeping in the light...even eye masks don't work 100% for me because of the tiny bit of light they let through. These are amazing. I can go from light-it's-high-noon to pitch-black-could-be-midnight in a second. I'm also hoping these help keep my room cooler as it tends to be the hottest room in the house.",

The only downside is it\u2019s a bit complicated to completely get all the wrinkles out but that can easily be overlooked.

      "text": "Since we've been thinking about selling our home, we didn't want to invest a fortune in new curtains. But the old ones definitely needed an update. We searched the stores. We searched online. We finally settled on these for the price (and Amazon Prime's return policy). They won't be going back. They fit well and look pretty darned good. The price we couldn't match anywhere. Oh, and not sure why there are some complaints that they don't block enough light. The set we bought block the light significantly.",

My only complaint is one panel was extremely wrinkled at the bottom. I sprayed with water, tugged, pulled...and wrinkles didn't budge. Next time I do laundry, I will try putting them in the dryer with wet clothes. But overall, very nice and durable and the price was right!",

I ordered the gray and they are a little darker than I was expecting, but sill work with my decor. You can put the rod through the whole curtain or through loops on the back. They pleat and hang nicely. As much as I like these curtains, I can only give 4 stars because they are not \"blackout\". They do darken the room a lot but you can still see the sunlight lines between the shades. They darken the room plenty for me, but for someone that wants true \"blackout\" you may want to add a sheer behind or get another curtain.",
