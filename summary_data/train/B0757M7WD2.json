The only minor issue is that they're not great at external sound cancelling. So, if you like keeping half an ear open to stuff happening around you, these are great, if you're looking to pretend you're isolated from the world, not so great.",

Well the company has reached out to me to fix my problem. I will updated if they follow through and resolve this. Quit working after 3 months of use. I bought these for my son, he loved them, they worked great and he said his friends could hear him clearly. A couple of days ago the mic just stopped working and you can barely hear any sound coming in. Too bad these are not worth it. I am going to buy him some turtle beach they are more reliable.",

Works for both xbox & playstation controllers with your basic headphone jack. The mic was clearer than expected & even picks up background noises if your settings are too high. I'd definitely recommend these to anyone! ***9 MONTHS LATER!*** I'm honestly surprised that these held up so well for so long! The sound is already giving out but can't complain for the price & amount of time I've owned these! Still highly recommend!",

Not all that great for a streamer. Sad too, they are pretty comfortable and i loved the volume adjusting on it. Though muting the mic doesnt mute it. Just make a loud buzzing noise. Save your money and get another pair that actually works.",
