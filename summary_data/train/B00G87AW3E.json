I bought mine in 2014 and it still runs like it did when I bought it and I know I have exceeded the 10,000 hour life span on the bulb. Use a lot for gaming with Xbox One also for watching TV and Movies. Definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a great Projector for a reasonable price. Edit: Still going strong 3 years after purchase. Just now getting a warning about the headlamp coming up on time to replace. But still works fine. It has been used a lot for gaming, TV, and movies. Fully recommend for the price.",

One thing that was not mentioned was that it does include a regular length SVGA cable, but that's not a bad thing. Definitely suggest it as an economic but completely equipped projector.",
