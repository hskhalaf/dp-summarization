Called Philips, and they sent me out a few replacements, after they asked me send pictures of the receipts and boxes, but I don't hold much hope for them either. The guy at Philips customer service actually told me it might be the electric wiring in my house that's causing the bulbs not to last. I guess the fact that the florescent bulbs last for years doesn't matter, huh? Won't be buying these ever again.",

      "text": "When a reputed company like Philips says, \"10,950 hours and 10 years of light (based on three hours per day)\" and I use my bulbs 5-6 hours a day, I expect to get 5 years of life. But in reality, my bulbs died within 1.5-2 years -- far short of the Philips promise. I bought 4 of these when they were selling for $21. Now Philips has jacked up the price from $21 to $30 - ridiculous. No way I am buying them at this price, knowing they will barely last 2 years.",
