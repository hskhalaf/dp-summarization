He was able to put it together in an afternoon and, while I hate to admit when I'm wrong, this is a great purchase. We've had some fun family matches and the kids enjoy playing with their friends. Hooray! Something to do inside that doesn't involve electronics.",

I build and DIY around the house, so I am not new to projects. The table simply takes a lot of time. Directions could be clearer. The many bolts and screw packages are labeled well. But the diagrams could be better in certain steps during the build. Overall the foosball table seems sturdy and we as a family enjoy it. I would recommend this product for buying. Overall 4 star just because of the time to put together.",

Myself and my 7 year old son did it in couple hours. Go slow, look diagrams and it all goes smooth. I will say the only thing I did for the players and poles was to use the pictures on amazon for that. The diagram was not greatest for pole placement. But great table. Plays well. Very steady and solid frame. Be lots game play on this for years to come.",

This table is a bargain for the elegance it gives off and for the quality of the table.",

Still, with a drill bit, I was able to make my own holes and assemble the beast of a table. It is quite sturdy once assembled. Some of the pieces were damaged during shipping.

I bought aftermarket rubber grips because the wooden handles were too skinny and not balanced. My only issue is that the human-like players are not balanced properly, so there is no way to stick their legs in the air. The negative result is that when you\u2019re playing 1:1 your offensive players\u2019 feet are always blocking the shots of the defensive players. The table comes with another set of faceless non-human players, so perhaps the problem doesn\u2019t exist with them. (To find out I have to disassemble the players and pole and handles...",
