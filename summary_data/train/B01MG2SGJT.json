I\u2019m someone who can\u2019t sleep without a blanket but the combination of these 90+ degree summer days and having my bedroom at the top of the house means tossing and turning and waking up sweaty. This is very lightweight \u2014 heavier than a sheet but not heavy enough to add too much warmth. Perfect. The color is as vivid and pretty as it appears in the picture and matches my turquoise sheets perfectly. I love that it\u2019s reversible when I want to change up the look without too much effort.",

I haven't washed it yet, so I can't speak on whether it holds up after a wash, so I will come back and add to this review on that front.

Its light and breathable for people like my husband who sleep HOT, but thick and warm enough for people like me who like their blankets to be heavier than a sheet and who get cold easily. Pet hair doesnt stick tot he comforter either which was a HUGE plus. and its machine washable. 10/10 recommend. Its perfect!",

I washed it as soon as i got it on a normal cycle, it remained soft and fully in tact afterwards. I think the colors are nice and it is great for a lightweight blanket. I am happy with my purchase. If you live with someone who gets very hot at night i think this is a great choice, in the winter I will probably continue to use this just with an extra blanket on those colder nights.
