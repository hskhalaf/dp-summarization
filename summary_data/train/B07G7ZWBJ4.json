Those who have tested this New Balance running shoe feel that it employs a capacity for quality performance and long-lasting enjoyment. The responsive cushioning system, the wallet-friendly price, and the lightness of the build have been highlighted as the elements that elevated this product. On the other hand, the complaints center on the irritating overlay on the toe box, as well as a break-in period that is needed before achieving full comfort.Fans of neutral running shoes meant for the roads are the target market of the FuelCell Propel.",

The shoe is not as reactive as I thought it will be. Breathability, I get a little bit too hot with them but is not a major problem.",
