      "text": "This works so well. I just had surgery for a broken thigh bone, and am in a wheel chair for now. So this gives me the support I need to use the loo. And it does not hinder clean up. I have just ordered a second one. The one I ordered for my second bathroom hurt my hands. This has ROUNDED FRONT OF HANDLES and they are SOFTER, BUT FIRM and COMFORTABLE. No pain in my hands now, which started from using a walker for 4 months. This is the BEST ONE bar none. THANK YOU.",
