Few minutes to pair the printer with your phone over Bluetooth and download the brother app. Next time you want to use it just open the app and you areready to print. If have iPhone iPad then you will have to go to Bluetooth settings in your phone\u2019s settings every single time you want to use the printer. It also works great on iOS but a pain to always connect the printer before use. This printer however doesn\u2019t work with PC or macOS. Would be nice to edit labels on the computer.",

Would be better if cane with an AC DC adapter. Note that it requires a bit of a specialised one. Available, but double check before buying. It is meant to have batteries, which means it takes up more space than if it was simply plugged in. I guess that would be important for some people, just not me.",

Also wastes a lot of the tape each time it prints so I have to then use scissors to trim the label. Pretty average at best!!",
