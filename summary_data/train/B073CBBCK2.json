There is a converter that converts the USB to 120v power that requires 1 screw to mount. Came with 10 or so plastic clips that makes the install tidy. Usage is equally good. Night vision is clear. Microphone is crisp. Speaker was a little quiet but what do you expect? A bullhorn? Takes a pic when it sees a face and records video. All while requiring a Wi-Fi source and a simple power outlet.",

I called Nest and requested to return the camera for a refund, since the camera is now useless as a security device, and my request was denied.

Wasn't thrilled about doing that. Barring those two things the camera is pretty solid. Night vision was much better than I expected. Seems well made and durable.
