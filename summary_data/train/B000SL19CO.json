I liked it so much I am in the process of getting one for my office. One of the things I like the best is that Kodak is keeping the ink prices reasonable, unlike HP and the other printer manufactureres. They have low printer prices but really rip you off on the ink. I like Kodak's approach of a fair price on the printer and the ink.",

Cons: NO LINUX DRIVER for the millions of lnx users. And, apparently, no plans for one. I've also had occassional problems w/ duplexer. Also, it doesn't allow me to plug it into a router so I can use it as a network printer. (Have to shell out for a server device)",

I don't know how long this one will work. But is very easy to use, and prints great looking pictures faster than any I have had. Guess they will get all the kinks out soon.",

I would just add the feature of scanning right to a SD or memory stick with no PC at all. I've tried all features, from printing to copying, from faxing to scanning and found them quite easy to work with. Use Kodak high quality photo paper, otherwise your pictures may look blury. And please, get awsome professional-quality pictures at home at a price you could just have ever imagined.",
