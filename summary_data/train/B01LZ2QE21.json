It's a nice size to accommodate plenty of disposable diapers, and a few all-in-one or pocket cloth diapers would also fit well. I also like the fact that the dividers can be removed to make the caddy more versatile for future use. And, thankfully, this one shouldn't break if my daughter decides to step in it!",
