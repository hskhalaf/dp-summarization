This router just can't maintain a connection. It keeps dropping out every 15 minutes or so, sometimes recovering slightly, other times needing to be powered down and rebooted. I've updated the firmware and software since Linksys's claims those needed to be installed for the router to be more reliable. That didn't work at all... and by the way Linksys, having a product actually work out the box isn't a bad thing. All I can advise is to stay away from this one. Linksys doesn't deserve our money to support junk.",

On Mac OS 10.5.7 systems complex web pages load much slower using wireless N, G, and Ethernet. What use to load in 1-2 seconds now takes 10 seconds to fully load. On my PCs web pages load only a little slower. Linksys does not have the older Jan 2009 B10 firmware for download anywhere. The lesson learned is that Linksys may build good routers but because firmware IS NOT TESTED it can not be recommeded.",

Wish it had better range, though; My wife and I expressly got the wireless so we can sit on the couch and surf or VPN to work ... it's only 30 feet away (though through one plaster wall) yet I only get 3-4 bars (I'd expect full strength at that range!)

      "text": "This is without a doubt the best Wireless Router I have ever used. Considering the fact that I have experience with commercial Routers including Verizon high speed, Benkin, D-Link N and several other Home Office N Routers, but none came close to this Beast. It is truly a Monster. It is extremely easy to install. Security code can be change as often as you wish. The only con is price, a little expensive. I do not hesitate to give this unit a five star, 10 out of 10. Needless to say I do recommend this Router very highly.",

I can still use the wired gigabit ports but no wireless and the router cannot accept connection to view the config page, resetting and powering on/off did nothing.

    "title": "Cisco-Linksys WRT610N Simultaneous Dual-N Band Wireless Router",
    "description": "Linksys Ultra RangePlus, Simultaneous Dual-N Band Wireless Router The Dual-Band Wireless-N Gigabit Router is really four devices in one box. First, there's the dual-band Wireless Access Point, which lets you connect to the network without wires. There's also a built-in 4-port full-duplex 10/100/1000 Switch to connect your wired-Ethernet devices together at up to gigabit speeds. The Router function ties it all together and lets your whole network share a high-speed cable or DSL Internet connection. We've also included a Storage Link that lets you easily add gigabytes of storage space onto your network using readily available USB 2.0 hard drives -- or plug in a USB flash disk for a convenient way to access your portable data files. The built-in Media Server streams music, video, and photos from the attached storage device to any UPnP compatible media adapter. And you can get to your files from anywhere in the world through the Internet. The Access Point built into the Router uses a dual-band version of the very latest wireless networking technology, Wireless-N (draft 802.11n). By overlaying the signals of multiple radios for each band, Wireless-N's \"Multiple In, Multiple Out\" (MIMO) technology multiplies the effective data rate. Unlike ordinary wireless networking technologies that are confused by signal reflections, MIMO actually uses these reflections to increase the range and reduce \"dead spots\" in the wireless coverage area. The robust signals travel farther, maintaining wireless connections much farther than standard Wireless-G.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nFrom the Manufacturer \n\n The Dual-Band Wireless-N Gigabit Router is really four devices in one box. First, there's the dual-band Wireless Access Point, which lets you connect to the network without wires. There's also a built-in 4-port full-duplex 10/100/1000 Switch to connect your wired-Ethernet devices together at up to gigabit speeds. The Router function ties it all together and lets your whole network share a high-speed cable or DSL Internet connection. \n\n With Wireless-N, the farther away you are, the more speed advantage you get. It works great with standard Wireless-G, -A, and -B equipment, but when both ends of the wireless link are Wireless-N, the router can increase the throughput even more by using twice as much radio band, yielding speeds much faster than standard Wireless-G. But unlike other speed-enhanced technologies, Wireless-N can dynamically enable this double-speed mode for Wireless-N devices, while still connecting to other wireless devices at their respective fastest speeds. In congested areas, the \"good neighbor\" mode ensures that the Router checks for other wireless devices in the area before gobbling up the radio band. \n\n \n\n The incredible speed of Wireless-N and gigabit wired networking is ideal for media-centric applications like streaming video, gaming, and Voice over IP telephony, and gives you plenty of headroom to run multiple media-intense data streams through the network at the same time, with no degradation in performance. With the Linksys Wireless-N Storage Link Router at the center of your home or office network, you can easily add storage, share a high-speed Internet connection, files, printers and multi-player games, and run media-intensive applications at amazing speeds, without the hassle of stringing wires.\n\n\n\nSee more",
