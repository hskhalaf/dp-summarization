Even after dropping the driver 15ft. onto concrete a few times (not recommended) and using the drill to bore through ironwood until it started smoking (also not recommended) they kept on trucking. I just bought a second set for a big project coming up and I'm sure they'll both work marvelously. The batteries are also great so long as you don't let them sit for a year without charging them. Over all I'm learning to love Milwaukee tools even more then the DeWalts I used to use!",

The bag is durable and certainly has room for other stuff besides just the drill, driver, charger, and batteries (I keep a big set of bits in there, too). I've mostly just used these on projects in wood around my apartment but I've yet to come across something that gives them any trouble. Having both the drill and driver is really convenient when working something that requires pre-drilling. I plan on buying other M18 tools when I have the budget.",

I've been installing sun sail shades on my house to create a nice shaded patio area. This involves putting 2X1/4\" inch lag bolts into the side of my house. While I still drill a small pilot hole (so I don't split things), the impact driver puts them in like butter.
