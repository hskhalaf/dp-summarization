We contacted customer service who was good and helpful, sent us out a new battery that showed up 7-10 days. Charged another 24 hours then day 3 died again. Contract customer service again and they sent out a 3rd battery. The dirt bike is now dead again and worthless. This is an extreme disappointment for him. I wasted $300, lots of time and have nothing for it. Please Razor. Step up and make a decent product that works.",

It has enough speed to get him going but not too much that we get too worried. It is light weight enough that it can easily be loaded into the back of the car and my son can pick it back up and get on it on his own. I highly recommend this bike we have had no issues.",

I think he will get a couple years out of it before he is ready to move up to a bigger size. Battery life is great also.",

In dirt, I recommend lower tire pressure just like on a gas bike. The battery will not last as long in dirt but the bike does great riding around on flat ground and smaller hills! Don\u2019t let your kid brake skid because that made our tire susceptible to nails, gotten two already.",

But.....our razor motorcycle has been PERFECT, my kid has been riding it in the dirt, the snow, the street, it performs perfectly, he loves it, he is Five years old, I recommend this bike as a Beginner bike for kids before the gas powered bikes. So if you are thinking about getting one, I say go for it, I think Razor has worked out all the bugs from earlier models. Also; the battery has lasted at least 30 minutes, my son has not worn out the battery yet, he gets tired before the battery does, so thats great.",
