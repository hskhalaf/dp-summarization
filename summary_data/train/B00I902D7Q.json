I really like that the bottom has little grips. Depending on how you pack it it could definitely fit more than I put in mine. I know for a fact I could fit at least 3/4 games in their cases in this along with the other stuff. Definitely 5 stars. My only \"complaint\" is it kinda smells weird but other than that it's amazing.",

I recently purchased this case and find that it has plenty of room on the inside of the case to carry all my items. I have an Xbox One Elite which fits snugly in the case. I can carry my elite controller with its own case, an extra controller, the brick power strip and all cables. There is still plenty of space in the inside for other items. The outside of the case has a large pocket that expands and a smaller zippered pocket. Very happy with case.",

Packing and unpacking of components is fairly quick, meaning that I can now bring my console with me and be up and running within minutes.

I don't carry the kinect, so haven't tried that, though it looks like you could carry either the kinect, or power supply, but maybe not both. Note that this is speculating though, I haven't tried it.
