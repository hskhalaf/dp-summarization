      "text": "I found the Parrot hands free bluetooth equipment was easy to use, had a good quality sound depending upon the radio it is hooked to and a easy way to dial using the voice command in your cell phone's address book. You can easily manipulate and see your phone book in the LCD screen using the center knob of the Parrot; whenyou see the name you push the center knob and your call is accomplished. The only negative was the installation. It must be done by a professional. I now have a parrot installed in each automobile. I love the convenience of having a hands-free instrument and not having to go against the law in my state.",

I would recommend these to anyone. My only issue was the self-install is very complex. I would only recommend self install to those accustomed to car electronics installations.",

    "description": "Product Packaging:Standard PackagingParrot CK3100 LCD Bluetooth Car Kit\n\nAMAZON.COM\nWith the Parrot CK3100, you will be able to place and receive calls in comfort and safety, without ever touching your mobile phone. At a time when legislation is tightening up to restrict the use of mobile phones in vehicles due to safety concerns, the Parrot CK3100's benefits are not just for the sake of convenience and comfort -- they are fast becoming a real necessity. The Parrot CK3100 wirelessly connects with all Bluetooth phones on the market and is compatible with all brands. The display of the CK3100 provides the same visual information and functions as your mobile phone, such as caller ID, carrier signal strength, or last calls received, in large well-contrasted digits easy to read at a glance on a screen that can be clipped in the ideal position for the driver to see.\n\n Turn on the car engine and the phone connects wirelessly to the Parrot CK3100 Car Kit. The screen unit has easy-to-navigate menu options just like your phone, and your mobile phone book is wirelessly downloaded to the car kit. Calls can be dialed either through the screen, or by using voice-recognition speed dialing. According to your phone's model and firmware, most features are accessible from the hands free console, including one-touch redial, dual call, and auto-answer.\n\n The Parrot CK3100 Bluetooth car kit can be installed in almost any vehicle, and is designed to automatically mute the radio during use. Incorporating high-quality sound, the CK3100 includes both echo cancellation and noise reduction technology. As with all Parrot car-kit devices, the CK3100 Bluetooth car-kit offers the user seamless, hands-free use without the inconvenience of wires, headsets, or cradles. This unit also features user connection priority management for up to five users, up to 200 voice tags for its voice recognition, multi-user use for up to three phones, private conversation mode, and much more.\n\n Please note this car-kit will not work in cars that use optical cabling. Check with your car dealer before ordering. Also, since this car-kit is installed by hard-wiring to the existing car stereo, professional installation is highly recommended.\n\n What's in the Box\nThe CK3100 electronic control unit, LCD display with buttons and cable, microphone with cable, radio mute cable with line output (ISO cable), power supply cable, and a user guide in 7 languages.",
