It'll take some practice, but after only ten minutes or so of practice, the 5-year-old was able to jump a dozen times or more at once. I recommend practicing either outside on grass, or on a carpeted floor, because the bottom part will slide out from underneath the user on hardwood or linoleum, and you're likely to fall right onto your tailbone.",

Now our 3 year old has declared this toy broken and refuses to use it anymore. We have tried what we can to convince her that it still works to jump on but she has made up her mind. We are disappointed especially because she got about 20 hops of use out of the toy.",

Also please take in mind, many houses have dogs.. and this sound will drive them crazy as well and will even make it a worse situation.

My grandchildren are five and seven, and have a great time jumping in the living room. It makes a small squeak as they jump, so you can count their best jumps in a row. They really enjoy it, and it\u2019s healthy exercise when it\u2019s too cold to go outside. I\u2019m sure that these toys will be fun in the yard, during our short summer, too.",
