      "text": "Vita: 5 Stars Memory Card: 1 Star Borderlands 2 port: Freaking awful I love the Vita dearly. I picked a bundle, because why not, but the B2 port for this system was pretty bad. The worst thing is the choppy animation and lack of animation. Things happen but you can't see them because the models just lack keyframes for any kind of feedback. Same with projectiles, most are missing or choppy. No lighting either. It makes for a frustrating and uncomfortable experience. I'm a Borderlands veteran and know this game thru and thru, but this is bad. The Nvidia Shield version makes a much better effort. Too bad, this could have been so much better coded.",

While I appreciate that this newer Vita actually has a universal USB charging port, rather than that proprietary crap from before. It's also slimmer and overall nicer than the original model, but, the new screen is nowhere near the quality of the original. It still looks very nice, but the colors are dulled and don't pop near as much as they did on the original model. Still, overall, it's a great little product and the extended battery life is certainly a plus.",

After I wiped the dust off, the system is clean and has almost no cosmetic issues. It appears to be in like-new condition. I should also note I had to charge it out of the box before I could make sure it works. Everything appears to work, it connects to the internet and loads games fine.

If you want to play as Zero the Assassin his skill is completely broken - in a bad way. When you activate his skill, not only do you become invisible- but so do ALL OF THE ENEMIES- thus rendering it useless for killing sprees. The console itself is great. Granted it flopped so there aren't really new games being added- but it still plays well. Borderlands 2 is still a fantastic game- this version just has some super annoying bugs.",

The price is finally right for most budgets, and the game library is huge now that you have 4 years worth of backlog games to play (as of 2016). Great graphics, fun games, and intuitive controls. And on top of that, for those with a PS4, the remote play is amazing. Especially if you pick up a 3rd party case that turns the back touchscreen into the L2/R2 shoulder buttons. This pack is a great starting point, and totally worth the price.",

It does not show off the systems capabilities well aside from the fact that it's amazing that it plays on a handheld at all. I would recommend picking up another game but the bundle is still a deal for the handheld and memory card.",

The unit is light, easy to carry and hold and the new features, like charging via a micro USB connector are useful. The newer releases for this console are solid. Mercenary Killzone looks and plays like a legitimate console game. Borderlands 2 is OK. Resogun (released yesterday, 12/23) is outstanding. Many other games, especially indie titles, exclusive to Vita, are great, too.",

My code worked perfectly for Borderlands 2 and said it would expire in 2017. So, from other reviews here informing other amazonians that their code was expired seems like a bad batch. I'd highly recommend this to any avid gamer and enthusiast. Also, do yourself a favor and get kill zone.",

It's doubtful you'll get internet speeds high enough in a hotel to take advantage of the remote play over internet.

Battery life is great as we'll. overall, I happy with it. Note that I bought it used and received a defective unit. The right joystick kept moving the cursor by itself, rotating without me touching it. This made playing any game impossible. Contacted amazon and they helped out immensely. A+ customer service.",
