I put Velcro on my banner for the craft shows. And it's much neater than strings or zip ties. The 'feet' of the poles are more substantial and will stake into the ground very well. So far, I haven't needed additional weights for them. And the wheels on the carry case are handy too as this is a heavy canopy. I am well pleased with this purchase.",

Most tents have those buttons you push and you run the risk of pinching your skin. This mechanism is on the outside and it seems highly unlikely you would ever have that problem. I wish they were cheaper so I could purchase more of them. But, that overall quality of this tent is better than what you paid. I would highly recommend to anybody.",

I really like the additional side panels that can easily moved around to block the sun or rain. Just be sure to have significant weights when using the side panels, it's like a sail catching the wind. I mixed an 80 lb bag of concrete in each of four 5 gallon buckets and cured a horseshoe clamp in the mix for an attachment. The use four cam lock type motorcycle straps to secure the tent corners to the buckets. Seems to hold very well in small storms.",

I should also knock down another half a star because NO WAY is it as easy to put up as you see in the video. But I'm also willing to concede that if my wife and I put up as many tents as the folks at Eurmax do, we'd probably think it was easy. So, if the first time you are going to set this tent up is AWAY from wifi, FIRST download the video on how to do it from their website. Otherwise, a great tent, very strong construction, and we are glad we bought it.",

The only change I would recommend is to make the wheels bigger. We rolled it down the doc but ended up carrying it to the beach because the wheels were no match for the sand. I would definitely buy this again.",
