I used work for an herb shop/wellness center and they were big on New Chapter. 1. they derive their vitamins, by fermenting actual food and herbs, and this creates the probiotic in the supplements. Back in 2012 or around then, New Chapter was sold to Proctor and Gamble. A lot of concern was that the content and quality would suffer. I am not sure if this is true, but I do know many of their supplements were discontinued. Anyway, I continue to take their vitamins and have not noticed any changes.",
