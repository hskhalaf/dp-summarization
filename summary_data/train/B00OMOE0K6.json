I found this one which looks almost identical to its more expensive counterpart and figured I\u2019d give it a try. I didn\u2019t wash it after reading the reviews of it shrinking but that\u2019s ok because the baby will never touch it anyway. I ironed it and put it on and it fits perfectly. I wish it was a little bit lighter in color but otherwise it is perfect.",

Bought it to go with the Nurture Imagination Nest bedding set, and it is a perfect light blue, a little longer than most skirts, and blends well for a soft look that works for a boy or a girl. The quality is also very high, higher in fact than the skirt that came with the set. It has a soft and durable cotton section that goes across the springs under the crib mattress, as opposed to a stiff, almost mesh like material that so many have now. I highly recommend.",
