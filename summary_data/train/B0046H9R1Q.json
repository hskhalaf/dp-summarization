To me the one-piece upper is key. I have a narrow foot with relatively long toes. the one-piece upper allows the boot to bend in the right place for my foot, unrestricted by any seam. They run narrow, the regular fits like my old B width, but I read that in other reviews, so I ordered a regular width and it fits well.",

If it lasts me the rest of my days, I'm a happy guy. Initial fit was good with room for extra socks. I wore them all day at home for the out of the box experience and it was a good day. They came with an \"Airthotic\" insert that fits under the heel and arch. It promotes circulation to keep your feet from getting hot or damp. Great idea.",
