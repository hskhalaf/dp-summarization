Unfortunately the surprise wasn't a pleasant one, as half of the objective lens was shattered and in a Ziploc bag. It appears to be a good telescope for the money, but unfortunately someone returned it damaged without indicating such. The manufacturer wouldn't have packaged a telescope lens in a sandwich bag, and surely Amazon wouldn't have sold it if the damage was known so I can't blame either. Things happen. I'm hoping the replacement that's on the way is useable and that my daughter will understand.",

The other company gave me headaches for almost an entire month. We haven't been able to use the telescope very much yet - foggy skies - but look forward to learning more about it !

    "title": "Celestron - AstroMaster 90AZ Refractor Telescope - Refractor Telescope for Beginners - Fully-Coated Glass Optics - Adjustable-Height Tripod - BONUS Astronomy Software Package",
    "description": "If you\u2019re in search of a high-quality, professionally designed telescope that is easy to set up and use, the AstroMaster Series 90AZ telescope by Celestron is a superior choice. The AstroMaster 90AZ Refractor Telescope for adults and kids to be used together is a user-friendly and powerful telescope engineered with a lightweight frame and fully-coated optics. Our Celestron telescope features a fully-coated 90mm primary mirror. It also features an AstroMaster Altazimuth manual mount that includes a panning handle that allows you to make precision adjustments to easily follow celestial objects as they appear to move across the night sky. The two eyepieces combine with the 90mm aperture optics to produce amazing magnification. The 20mm eyepiece offers 50x magnification, while the 10mm eyepiece provides up-close views up to 100x. This allows you to focus on distant objects with amazing clarity. We have designed the AstroMaster series of telescopes for kids to enjoy exploring the cosmos with adult supervision. Superior materials provide crystal-clear, bright images of Saturn, Jupiter, and the Moon, along with deep space objects including brighter galaxies and nebulae. You can also use this telescope for viewing land-based objects during daytime hours. The telescope is quick to set up and requires no tools. The kit includes a rugged, pre-assembled tripod with 1.25-inch steel tube legs, which provide a stable platform for hours of safe use. As a bonus, download our BONUS Starry Night Basic Edition astronomy software for interactive sky simulations, a 36,000-object database, and printable sky maps. It\u2019s the best way to learn about the night sky, download printable sky maps, research thousands of celestial objects, and plan your next observing session. Buy with confidence from the world\u2019s #1 telescope brand, based in California since 1960. You\u2019ll also receive a two-year warranty and unlimited access to technical support from our team of US-based experts.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n Celestron\u2019s Astromaster 90AZ refractor telescope is a good choice for anyone who wants a dual purpose telescope. With more than double the light gathering power of 60mm starter scopes, it\u2019s a great introduction to astronomy and it can double as a long range spotting scope. Bigger and more impressive than it looks in pictures, the Astromaster 90AZ is an adult size telescope that stands nearly five feet high and weighs about 20 pounds. With it\u2019s fully illustrated quick set up guide, the telescope is easy to assemble, and the package includes an erect image prism, high and low power eyepieces, and astronomy software for your PC. \n\nRefractors are known for their crisp, high contrast views of the Moon and planets and the Astromaster 90 delivers sharp views right out of the box. The low power 20mm eyepiece (50X magnification) nicely frames the moon, while the high power 10mm eyepiece (100X magnification) delivers a crisp close up image full of detail. The sharp Achromatic optics of the Astromaster 90AZ show me memorable views night after night. On a moonless night I like the way the 20mm eyepiece frames the ghostly glow of the Orion Nebula. Zooming in with the 10mm eyepiece, I can easily pick out all four stars of the Orion Nebula\u2019s embedded quadruple star the Trapezium. \n\nThe AstroMaster 90 AZ also features a newly designed Alt-Azimuth mount and tripod. The tripod comes fully assembled, and the telescope simply clamps into a standard dovetail. This new tripod seems reasonably solid, I had no trouble focusing on the Moon and stars even with the high power eyepiece. An Alt-azimuth mount, of course, is best used at low to medium powers because it does not track the motion of the stars. As soon as you get the Moon centered in the eyepiece, it starts drifting toward the edge-this is caused by rotation of the Earth. Celestial objects will stay in the low power field of view for three or four minutes, but with a high power eyepiece they may disappear in a minute or less. \n\nCelestron\u2019s AstroMaster 90 AZ is one entry level telescope that offers great views during the daytime as well as at night. The sharp optics produce a right side up image, the mount is easy to use, and the included planetarium software helps you find planets in the night sky. --Jeff Phillips \n\nPros: \n\n * Crisp clear views both day and night \n * Rugged refractor design \n * Quick and easy no-tool set up \n * Erect image prism and two eyepieces included \n\nCons:  * Alt-Azimuth mount doesn\u2019t track stars and planets \n * Star pointer not so easy to use \n\n\n\nQuarter Moon shot at 50X with a powershot camera. \nMoon as seen at 100X, shot with powershot camera. \nMoon as seen at 200X, shot with a powershot camera. \nFinches shot at 50X at a distance of 20 yards.\n\nFinch shot at 100X at a distance of 20 yards.",
