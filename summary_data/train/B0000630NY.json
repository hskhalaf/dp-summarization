Or is it that Anchor Hocking is the glass manufacturer only? I have bought other Anchor Hocking plates that were labeled as such. Not sure if these plates will meet my quality and safety standards if they are not actually Anchor Hocking glass as advertised. Has this happened to anyone else?",

It's a shame when you but something made in USA and get junk instead of a superior product.",

What this one has going for it is that it has a stopper that allows you to close the cruet and not have an air-exchange when not in use. What I dislike about this cruet is that it pours quickly and it is hard to control the amount of oil (or whatever) that is poured out. In contrast the Chef's Planet 8-oz glass cruet drizzles oil very slowly which I love. The only negative about the chef's planet is that it always allows air to move in/out of the cruet through the small opening.",

      "text": "I read the reviews, thought the new design would correct old problems. What a wrong assumption! I like Anchor products, but these plates have no quality control to speak of. I don't know if it's a production issue, or if Amazon customers are getting the reject pile at this price. I ordered two boxes of 6, 12 plates total. Each one had a flaw, ranging from jagged edges, bubbles, embedded lines; and scuffs on every plate. The packaging was satisfactory. The contents were not. 30 pounds of glass, I now have to carry to the UPS store. Just save yourself the trouble.",

It seems that when they are put away warm, they cool and grab onto each other when stacked. Then when picked for use, they can be stuck and subsequently chip. We have changed our storage methods, but the chipping damage was already done. Just be careful with stacking. Otherwise, just the right size for cereal or ice cream, etc.",
