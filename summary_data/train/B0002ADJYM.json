From what I have researched, older cats do tend to have more of a problem digesting since their pancreas doesn't produce enough enzymes to aid with proper digestion. I have used this for about a year and will be buying more soon (1 bottle has lasted over a year). Great inexpensive price. Would recommend.",

If we don't use this or run out, I notice my dogs have much more gas and their stools are not as well formed. I definitely recommend this, especially if your dog has gas or digestive issues. The dog I originally began purchasing this for has now passed, but he had awful digestion issues. This product and a more natural diet largely fixed his issues. We continue to use it for our other dogs and like I stated, it helps with their stools and gas.",

It was very difficult giving him the digestive enzymes and probiotics that I knew he needed, since it seemed that they all had some sort of flavoring added. I was SO HAPPY to find this Animal's Essential's Plant Enzymes & Probiotics supplement! Now, all of my pets get their enzymes and probiotics and I don't have to buy different products to suit each taste. Fabulous!",

    "description": "Animal Essentials' Plant Enzymes & Probiotics relieves the extra burden placed on the digestive system by breaking down fats, carbohydrates, cellulose and protein. It contains a blend of plant and microbial produced enzymes, none of which come from animal sources. Animal derived enzymes will work in only one area of the digestive system (stomach and intestines), while plant and microbial enzymes work throughout the whole system. Since our enzymes also work over a broader pH range they are active longer in the entire digestive process, reducing the food into usable components.",
