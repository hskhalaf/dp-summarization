You wont get 60FPS on Metro:Last light on the highest settings out of the box, but manages to handle Crysis 3 perfectly. What I didn't like about this card is that the BIOS made the card throttle during intense load. Had to ask for procedure and new BIOS to flash the card to make it work as advertised. For some people this is an easy procedure but I was not comfortable messing around with my brand new GPU BIOS and this is an issue that should have been resolved by MSI before thinking of selling the product.",

The card never goes over 75 degrees Celsius for me, which is just perfect. Idle, it stays at about 33 degrees Celsius. This is a must buy if it fits your budget.",

Also read later that it's a general R9 issue where the GPU goes into a low power state and loses stability. MSI wanted to RMA one of them to see what was up and send me a refurbished unit. For this price, no. Love you, Amazon, and your return policy. On plus side, card is very very quiet and looks great.",
