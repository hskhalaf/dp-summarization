      "text": "The unit arrived very well packed and worked right out of the box. Neon-appearance is super neat and the CD works well as does the bluetooth connection. However, radio does not display the channel selected and station tuning is very difficult to use with no manual tuning and spotty scan-tuning. The remote is fussy about working if off center from the unit. All in all, worth the money (but not much more).",

There is no manual dial or digital dial, you have to listen to each station and wait until they broadcast who they are. It isn't as retro looking as the other table jukebox I had on my list which I will be buying once in place of this one. The sound was ok. I never tried the CD player or bluetooth. I also could never get a station saved, tried several times. I now have made reading the reviews and descriptions a religion.",
