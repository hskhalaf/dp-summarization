I am very disappointed at Logitech, they used to have great products and customer service, now they lost both, and lost me as a customer as well.",

The keyboard and dongle are 4 feet away. Besides, I suspect the USB transceiver is malfunctioning as it was working up until a month ago. I also have the \"el cheapo\" Logitech EX110 cordless keyboard/mouse combo and this thing works through walls (server...) and up to 10 feet away without issue.",

But for about 5 minutes per day it can be the most frustrating keyboard you have ever typed on. It seems to go through a fit once a day for a few minutes where everything you type stutters and lags or adds extra letters and it is downright unusable during that short stretch. Logitech won't acknowledge the issue even though forums across the internet prove it is a wide spread issue that no one knows how to resolve.",

Adjusting mouse sensitivity is easy. The only problem I've had is the USB connector that receives the signal needs to be in plain sight, which is a pain. Initially, I plugged the USB connector into the back of the CPU, but the mouse was extremely sluggish. I then moved it to one of the front USB ports and it was better, I don't like the USB connector sticking out of the front USB ports, so I'm unhappy about that for aesthetic reasons.",

Maybe because the MX Revolution is so comfortable, the MX1100 actually caused a cramp after mousing around for a few minutes. I wish Logitech would make a Wave keyboard and MX Revolution combo so that I do not need to use two differed RF receivers and free up one USB socket.",

I had had a Microsoft wireless keyboard and mouse but the mouse went bad and when I priced the wireless mice I found it more cost effective to get another keyboard and mouse combo. I wanted a change from the Microsoft and I'm glad I went with the Logitech. If there is one downside, I prefer to change a battery rather then plugging the mouse into the computer for it to charge.

My only complaint is that there is no caps-lock indicator. The mouse performs well, but it is very tall. For people with big hands that shape may be comfortable, but it made my hand ache after using it for a short time. I had to switch to a mouse with a flatter profile.",

The mouse on the other hand isn't that bad. Another thing is that distance I can go before it becomes totally useless is about 8 feet. Maybe I just got a faulty device. And this is definitely not worth the $200+ price tag. I got it for about $65 which is worth the price. For over $200 you can get something way better.",

Makes it etemely hard to type psswords that are not sent in clear text. This thing is going in th garbage and I'm going back o my old $10 corded keyboard. It isn't the range as the keyboard is less than two eet from the USB thingy and has a lear line of sight. DON'T WATE YOUR MONEY!",
