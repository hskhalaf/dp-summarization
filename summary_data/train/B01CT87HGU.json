There is no fix available and it\u2019s not a lot of fun to spend that much money for my grandson for Christmas and get something that doesn\u2019t work.I am very disappointed and will not buy from this company again. Such a simple fix and they don\u2019t take care of it.",

I'm glad i got this on a lightening deal because I would have been quite angry if I paid $50 plus dollars for this thing. It lasted for one outing. The red things were lost/broken instantly and it wouldn't fly for more than 10 seconds without crashing. You can't learn to fly if it won't even try to stay aloft for more than 10 seconds. It would rise and then it was like it lost connection and crash. I dunno. Ridiculously hard to control.",

It didn't come with a standalone controller, but you can download the CX_WiFiUFO app (iOS) and link up to your phone. The copter accomplishes this by broadcasting its own SSID that you can detect and link up to with the app. After that, the controls are similar to a standalone controller but you might have to adjust your trim level. Good for scaring your cats with and getting cool shots around town.",
