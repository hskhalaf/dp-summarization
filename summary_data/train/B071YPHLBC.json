      "text": "Looks great once put together and comes with some faux wood grain stickers to cover up the screws, you really cannot tell they were ever there. I was able to fit about 100 DVD's and an Xbox in the cubbys and have a 37 inch flat screen on top and it seems very secure. The wood is not as \"espresso\" as the photograph would have you believe, it is just a little bit lighter and has a slight greyish patina, but still looks very nice.",

With that in mind, I believe this TV stand is everything it claims to be, as an inexpensive, easy to assemble (if you are patient and think ahead) and sturdy piece of furniture. I personally find it to be reasonably attractive and also found the color to be very close to the pictures provided. I mounted a 75\" LG TV and bolted the legs to the base. I would not hesitate to purchase this again.",

My only issues with it are that the TV mount comes with no way to attach the TV to it (it\u2019s just a bar with holes in it, no screws included) and the cam bolts on the unit don\u2019t \u201clock\u201d and just fall out. Just the process of moving the completed TV stand two feet to its final position caused two of these bolts to work loose and fall out. I guess you could squirt glue in there but the instructions only mention using the glue for the wooden pegs.",

It's flimsy material and if you're going to put a 70\"in TV on it you will need to add extra support legs in the middle so as to support the weight. All in all, it's a good buy if you have the expertise (or problem-solving skills) to put it together.",

So long as you don\u2019t beat it up, dent it, or scrape your consoles on the wood and the stand will maintain it\u2019s sleekness. All in all it serves as an okay basic TV stand.

The broken pieces were indeed marked as \"Only for Packaging\", and truly meant to protect the actual TV stand parts, which they did! The actual tv stand parts are numbered.
