The reseller who sells this blanket on Amazon for Serta, is not a reputable company. They have a customer service number where the mailbox is always full, a product review page that doesn\u2019t exist, and also never return emails. This is a SCAM!! I doubt this is even a real Serta blanket, but a bootleg of Serta blankets. A blanket that cost me 155.65 dollars should last more than 2 months. SCAM, SCAM, SCAM!!

    "title": "Serta | Luxe Plush Fleece Heated Electric Blanket with Safe & Warm Low-Voltage Technology Queen Pearl",
    "description": "Color:Pearl| Size:QueenWe've designed the Serta low voltage blanket with one thing in mind. To be the best, most comfortable and safest blanket that you will ever own. This electric blanket starts with super soft micro-fleece fabric that is refreshingly smooth next to your skin for the ultimate in luxurious comfort. Constructed within the blanket is the patented Safe and Warm low-voltage technology. This blanket includes a small power supply box that changes 120 volt AC home current into non-hazardous low-voltage DC current (very similar to a battery) to provide warmth, protection and safety even if the blanket becomes wet. Unlike other warming blankets with their thick bulky wires, the wires in the Serta blankets are so small and thin; they are virtually unnoticeable. During construction we place the thin wires 3-inches apart and evenly distribute them from head to toe giving more of an even heat and all over penetrating warmth with no annoying hot or cold spots. The queen size blanket is divided in two separate zones and comes standard with two easy to read, easy to turn, non-slip computerized controllers to adjust the temperature of each side of the bed giving individual comfort and control. A giant backlit display with auto dimming feature provides more convenience for night time adjustments with out having to turn on the lights. An automatic pre-heat and hold feature makes sure that your bed is warm and cozy before you climb in for the night. You simply turn it on and the blanket will warm up on HI until it reaches the temperature that you pre set your dial on and then adjusts itself to hold it there. For your safety, convenience and power conservation it has an automatic shut off feature that will shut the blanket off after 10 hours just in case you forget. It also comes standard with built in over-temperature protection for that extra bit of safety and peace of mind. Easy care feature means that it's machine washable and dryable and will not stretch, pill or shrink.\n\nThis warming product has been designed to provide you a gentle relaxing heat. It will NOT feel warm to the touch of your hand, even on the highest (HI) setting.\nYou must actually use it to experience the cozy warmth that it will generate.\nIf the control lamp is lit, it is working. We suggest you start at the HI setting for the first use and then adjust down to your personal comfort level. To receive the most pleasure from your warming product, read your User Manual.\n\nThis warming product has been designed to provide you a gentle relaxing heat.
