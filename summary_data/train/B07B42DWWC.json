It appeared to have been dragged during delivery, but it is quite heavy. We were concerned about the smell due to reviews that we had read, but we noticed no odor and were able to use the mattress the same day. The pillows are very thick, too thick for our liking, but they have a zippered closure that allows you to remove foam for individualized comfort. The NECTAR mattress is one of the best purchases we've ever made.",

Be very certain it is laying almost exactly where you need it to end up when you lay the roll down. Upon cutting the plastic sheet wrapping it up, it quickly swells up and, at 100 pounds, gets a little awkward to move after that. Appears to be well made with a small pillow top built into it. So far, very comfortable, as we are replacing a water bed mattress with this using the same frame. California King is a perfect fit.",
