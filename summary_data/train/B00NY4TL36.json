These blocks fit the bill for this purpose. Two of the letters are not perfect--it looks like the paint on the top is kind of smeared, but that's only the case for two of the blocks and the rest are perfect. And the size is nice. I found a smaller set for much cheaper but the blocks are not nearly as big as this one, and for my purpose the size was important.",

I let my 7 month old play with a block that wasn't damaged, and within a half hour he was able to chew off the paint and part of the wood. I'm fairly laid back about things, but this is just not right. I would not consider it safe for children who might chew on it, and even then they are poorly made and can be easily chipped. I actually just tested scraping at the paint and it comes off with just my fingernail. Do NOT buy this product for your child!",

This is just a simple small alphabet block set and I'm happy with my purchase. Just be aware of the size that you are wanting as the blocks are small. Other then that I would recommend this block set.",

It becomes personal and it is a fun activity at the shower. The blocks came on time packaged very well. I love how they are not HUGE but a good medium size. They are just as pictured, colored well. The tote they come in is very nice for storage and an added bonus! Also, the price is crazy reasonable for these! Love them! I have used them at a different shower in the past and they are great quality! Thanks!",

It makes her feel like a big girl when I place the backpack on her back.
