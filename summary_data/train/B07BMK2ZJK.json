But the reviews convinced me and my 11 yr old, 8 yr old, 5 yr old and Daddy played it last night and they loved it. Which says a lot because we are a GAME PLAY FAMILY. Of course one ball Is already lost! Grr. Anywa, they said it\u2019s very fun and easy to play and glad we got it. With the age range of the three kids playing and the Dad making his own thumbs up comment I think it\u2019s a good buy!",

The idea of the game is easy to understand and learn...but the backboard portion of the game doesn't hold up in position after using a dozen times. The design of the backboard is to catch the balls and have them roll into the slots, but the weight of the backboard (along with the balls) seems too much for it and it ultimately falls down. I wish that was designed differently, but otherwise its a fun game.",
