      "text": "I ordered two pairs of these Beeswax Clark's Original Desert Boots from two different websites for comparison. One from Amazon, and one from the Clark's website. There are noticeable differences between the two. (SEE PHOTOS) The pair I ordered through Amazon (on the left) are made of thinner, less quality leather. The ones from Clark's (on the right) are a much beefier, thicker leather with a higher quality grain and have more of a \"real leather boot\" feel. Whereas the ones from Amazon feel somewhat like cheap knockoffs in comparison. They are still a decent shoe for the price. But compared to the ones from Clark's they seem much flimsier.",

You will have to order at least a size down, possibly a size and a half.

They are primarily casual footwear that go well with chinos, jeans casual pants of most colors and even shorts. The great thing about them is that they are comfortable straight out of the box and become more so as the leather softens. I recommend the use of silicone protector spray for suede - this will prevent spots and marks from liquid spills and dirt.",

These Clarks may not be as sturdy as the Red Wing, or as amazing (and expensive) as Salvatore's beauties, but given the combination of their high quality, great looks, amazing comfort, and unbelievable price, they are pretty much my all time favorites.

The leather is very stiff, and requires what I assume to be a week-two week break-in period. I'm on day three and do not wear them repetitively. The sole is nice and quiet when walking on hard floors, however, deteriorates faster than I would have hoped. (I am not a dragger, nor do I walk with a swagger that would inhibit the longevity of the shoe.)",

      "text": "The Clark's Desert Boot is a classic. I got the Beeswax finish. They are some of my favorite shoes. They can be a bit warm on the feet. Quiet sole. Love them. Update: These shoes can be a bit tight over the top of your foot. Sometimes they hurt a little. And they have very little arch support. Essentially none. Still great shoes. But if you need to insert orthopedic arch supports you will need a whole size larger shoe. At least I suspect that would work. If I put inserts in mine the shoe becomes too tight from top to bottom and then hurts across the top of my feet.",

The crepe sole wears out very quick and you will find yourself getting them resoled or just throwing them out after 100 or so days of regular use. It also provides little support if you are using them for outdoor shoes. As the sole wears it starts breaking apart and picks up all kinds of hair. The leather isn't the best quality, but it can hold up and you can keep it clean with proper cleaning and conditioning, I expect more for a \"boot\" at this price.",

One thing to note, it seems like the idea behind the shoe finish is to give them a nice worn look, you bend the toes once and it leaves a lighter mark around the crease.

If you hit them in anyway you will leave a scuff mark but luckily the boots are like self-healing for majority of the light scratches just fade away but also gives the boots character. The gummy soles of the shoes make walking comfortable but could use a little more padding in the inside though.

When they arrived, I tried them on. I wear 11, and these were just my size, so I'd advise ordering a half-size down to be safe. I will say, however, that I still gave the 10.5s to my friend, and he finds them comfortable. I don't think you can go wrong here if you like these chukkas. The price on Amazon competes nicely with nearly every other place I shopped.",

I think for the quality and durability of these shoes, they are completely worth the price. My only complaint is that they run a little big, so I would recommend getting a half size smaller. Mine still are incredibly comfortable even though they have some room. Also, these boots go with everything!",

That was still a half size too big. I wish I had gone with a 9.5. 2) The sole of the shoe is a crepe sole and will quickly turn black.
