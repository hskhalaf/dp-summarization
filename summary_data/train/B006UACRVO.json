Some configuration parameters are unconventionally presented and not documented, and I was unable to change the local IP address parameters. Multiple factory resets and attempts at different approaches, but no success. So, it's a nice package and I'm sure perfect for a simple network, but it goes back.",

Easy to install without installation disc, but a little tricky in upgrading to most recent firmware, following online directions. When downloading upgraded firmware file, comes in unzipped single file, which you have to separate instructions from software file after download, then use only software file for correct installation. Received resolution of this problem by calling Amped Wireless Elite Support with assistance from Steve (speaking fluent English!!), who guided me through successfully. However, after upgrade all old settings are lost, requiring reinstallation, which even Steve didn't know. Love the power down timer. Paul Lorenz, Fort Myers, FL",

Don't bother with this product you will probably do much better by buying one of the routers recommended in the other reviews. I am returning this product ASAP.",

It is actually slower than using my cell as a hotspot but the main reason I suggest you look at another company is their absolute complete lack of product support. I am still waiting for their technical people to contact me. Their support people work bankers hours so if you work for a living there is no way your schedule and the support departments schedule will synch up. I have already made arrangements to return it. My suggestion, go with a more established company.",
