      "text": "I purchased these shoes based on the style and how they look only.When worn after about a dozen times they start getting loose and a little yellowish. DO NOT BUY TO WEAR EVERY DAY!! Get these shoes only to add to your shoe arsenal.They look great but THEY WILL NOT LAST AS AN EVERYDAY SHOE!! Do yourself a favor if you are considering buying this product and take this review seriously.(I wear these shoes about 2 or 3 times a month because I like how they look)",

Outside of that a fair shoe. The bottom design under the shoe does not offer much traction say in foul weather.",

I think I know now why they were under $35. I have already worn them so I will not try to return. They will have to do for now though.",
