I'm just used to higher batteries on phones . the phone did had some problems running high graphic games and will heat up a lot specially while charging and for that reason I returned it . other than the overheating issue I really liked the phone , I just wish an update can improve the kag and overheating .",

The screen can get pretty warm at times but it hasn't overheated. The camera is really nice just not great in horrible lighting and the battery life can drain pretty quickly depending on the activity, but that's fine lol my only real gripe is that there aren't any good (protective) cases for it.",

The camera however for the high pixels wasn't that great and the phone couldn't record any videos, all we get was a black screen with audio only. After a google search we weren't the only ones experiencing this problem. Haven't experience overheating but do get random power off where only a hard reset will solve it, not reliable if it shut off and you're expecting calls or alarms. The seller and shipping was great, not so much the phone. I say pass and get something more reliable and less bloatware.",
