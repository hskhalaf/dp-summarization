You get a TON of crayons, a lot of colored pencils, oil pastels, an eraser, a pencil sharpener and 2 pencils just for $24.79! The colors are really pretty too. Also, the carrying case is SO nice! It is a good quality wood, and it is really big. I CAN'T believe how great it is! :) :) :) :) :) Bye!",

The art supplies are the cheapest you can imagine, and the box itself literally fell apart the very first time we unlatched the front to open it up. Half the crayons were stuck behind the bottom drawer. The packaging was minimal at best. My artistic daughter was very disappointed, and so was I. Do not waste your money on this product and get sucked in by the numbers; the Frozen art set from Crayola that I got for my other daughter was well worth the money if you are looking for an awesome art set.",

My biggest cokplaint is that the box and its ingredients have a pretty strong chemical odor. It will sit outside for at least a night or two. As far as the quality of the contents I think it is fine for the price. I think this is really a kids set. If I went to a local craft shop I think the contents would cost the same or a little more without the box. If you want better quality I would suggest you spend a liile more.",

The only reason I rate this a 4-star instead of 5, is that one of the wooden drawer knobs came right off the case just as my Grandson unwrapped his gift. And the knob would not go back on. Maybe we can fix it with some glue?? Too late to return or exchange item, by the time Grandson 's birthday rolled around. What a shame, brand-new too. The case looked nice enough until this happened. Should have gone with a Made in America product perhaps.",
