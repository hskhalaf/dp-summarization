I've been through several weeks of rain in this jacket and it has done its job every time. If you are patient, you can get it for around 3 bills.",

      "BETA AR JACKET - The streamlined Beta AR Jacket provides the backcountry minimalist with durable storm protection in a lightweight and packable format. This hip length GORE-TEX Pro jacket reduces layering overlap and bulk, a helmet compatible DropHood offers quick storm protection, and reinforced shoulder and elbows survive alpine abuse.",
      "ALL AROUND - A mainstay in the Arc'teryx lineup since 2000, the Beta AR is the do everything, most versatile waterproof / breathable jacket for mountain environments. Hand pockets, athletic fit that accommodates layers and a hood with an internal collar mean comfort in storms, climbing, skiing or simply enjoying the outdoors.",
      "JUST THE RIGHT LENGTH - Hip length is the easiest to work with when layering waterproof / breathable garments. Not too short so it doesn't ride up or expose the lower back and not so long as to be cumbersome underneath a harness or a pack belt, the Beta AR hits the middle ground.",
      "THE HOOD - A good hood is a crucial detail on any serious alpine jacket. The Beta AR features the Arc'teryx DropHood, a helmet-compatible, fast adjust hood with a separate collar for draft protection.",
      "THE KEY PIECE - The Beta AR is a solid, well-rounded piece. Durable, lightweight, with hand pockets and pit zippers for ventilation, it can manage storms, rock, snow and cool seasons. GORE-TEX Pro delivers the highest level of waterproof / breathable performance."
