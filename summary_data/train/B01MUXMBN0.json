I have quite a wide foot and these are wide enough to allow my feet to spread without restriction. The cushioning on these is phenomenal, it feels like you're running on memory foam. I also bought the New Balance Zante V3 and these were far more comfortable, so the Zante went back.",

They are well cushioned and comfortable, and have enough room for my feet to expand into when they get a little warm. They're also fairly breathable, which is a bit of a drawback if wet, but then I'd rather my feet be able to breathe, and these aren't meant for trail. All in all, a good purchase.",

    "description": "Asics Dynaflyte Running Shoes The Dynaflyte is your entry to the fast category. Packed with GEL cushioning in the rear foot to cushion every step without adding weight. The Dynaflyte features an Impact Guidance System (IGS) to match your natural movements and anatomy. 3M reflectivity keeps you visible in low light conditions and thanks to the guidance line your foot is given complete support and guidance from the first impact to push-off. Breathable Mesh Upper The breathable mesh upper of the Dynaflyte works to keep your feet cool and comfortable by actively and efficiently wicking away the build-up of excess sweat and moisture. Once the sweat and moisture have been wicked, it is then transported from your skin to remove any distraction or discomfort that may hamper your performance. A ComforDry X-40 Sockliner features higher rebound properties while providing excellent moisture management and high-level breathability. The sockliner also guards against irritation such as chafing to deliver a more comfortable feel as you clock up the miles. 3M reflective material improves safety and visibility in low light conditions such as early morning or evening runs when the light is at a premium. The reflectivity also makes you visible to passing vehicles. FlyteFoam Midsole FlyteFoam technology is remarkably 55% lighter than the industry standard. Whilst midsole constructed with FlyteFoam tech isn't just super lightweight, it benefits from organic super fibres that bounce back into their original shape in the space of each stride, providing you with perfect adaptive cushioning from the start of your run to the finish. This engineered resilience also makes midsoles with FlyteFoam technology far more durable than their predecessors, so your body benefits not only from an elite level of cushioning, but elite cushioning that will perform at its peak longer and stronger than ever before. Additionally, the Dynaflyte wouldn't be the same if it didn't have the gel that sit",
