The fit feels about 2 sizes too big and the quality was so different it would almost make you question the originality of the item. Very disappointed. The most expensive trying on of a pair of shoes ever by the time I paid postage both ways!!",

Quality is where these fall down, I bought them as I'd had great success with Merrell shoes lasting me years previously - these are wearing thin on the soles after a few hours of strolling around city pavements. Terrible.",
