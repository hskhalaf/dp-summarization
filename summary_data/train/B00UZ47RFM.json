I washed them (hoping the fabric would tighten up a little bit), but I think they're mostly man-made material because they didn't shrink at all. It feels like I'm wearing cheese cloth on my feet... I wore a couple pairs and then just threw them all away.",

Is Hanes spending too much money on advertising when they should be spending that money on FABRIC. I guess now-a-days when you buy Hanes you're buying HYPE. If there's anything I can't stand: it's a short sock. These will be going right to the thrift store, where perhaps 50 cents/pair is a more realistic \"retail\" price. I hope Hanes investors are making money - because I just threw $12 away.",
