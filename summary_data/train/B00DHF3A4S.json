I'm a fan of this franchise now!! Great graphics, weapons are awesome, and the zombie's and boss fights are great! I will say this as well...Whoever came up with this game, has one sick and twisted mind and I LOVE IT!!! Keep em coming!!",

I get the whole \"use what you can find, because you're limited!!\" Shtick, but c'mon. It took my 6 attempts to smack a thing in the head with a bottle, and even then I died all 6 times I tried.

Use sneak attacks, and stay in the shadows. Some negative points. There do appear to be some glitches with the recognition from enemies, and some times the escape routes are not straight forward enough which can cause major frustration with the way the game saves, and sets your spawn points back. You'll find yourself repeating a lot of things, but this can be overlooked, and may come with patches to prevent such nuisances in the future. Guaranteed to scare you!

Its annoying at times when you cant figure out where to go. I suppose they were trying to make it realistic. Like he doesnt know where to go, so you should as well.",
