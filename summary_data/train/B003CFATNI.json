I recently realized I was maxing out at 100mbps thus spending money unnecessarily. My issue was my Network Adapter that was a part of my Motherboard. Buying this adapter allows me to use the most of the MBPS I am paying or. I am averaging 294mbps using this adapter and I couldnt be happier. I can finally watch 4k and 8k videos without a ton of buffering. Installation was straight forward and anyone should be able to accomplish in 5 minutes or less. I highly recommend this adapter.",

Unfortunately, the reviews on the product page are a mixture of any one of many devices. This antique didn't install and the system could not find it or recognize it. The installation instructions mentioned Windows Xp, so that gave me some indication of the age of this obsolete design. I don't think it's plug and play and the driver (latest downloaded from the manufacturer's site) didn't install it. Funny, the read-me file said something about realtec and not TP-Link. So, I recommend you look elsewhere for something designed in the last 10 years.",

That said, it would be a good idea when purchasing this that you download the drivers ahead of time (to a USB flash drive) so they're easily accessible at the time of installation--I never trust the 5-year-old drivers that are included on the disk in the package. Otherwise, this is an excellent, easy to install and use card and works perfectly at Gigabit speeds.",

Basically all you have to do is extract the driver VMware_bootbank_net-r8168_8.013.00-3vmw.510.0.0.799733.vib from 5.1 version, inject it into the 5.5 and you're good to go!
