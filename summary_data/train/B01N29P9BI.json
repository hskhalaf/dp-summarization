Doll is cute, as well as her outfit. My 6 year old likes to do her hair. My daughter has zero complaints. She also does not play with it too much, unless shes doing her hair. This being the first American Girl doll that I have ever purchased...I will not buy again. It is WAY over priced. You can buy a My Life doll for so much cheaper and there is no difference except the ridiculous price tag.",
