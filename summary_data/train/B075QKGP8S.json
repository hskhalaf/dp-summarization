It wanted flesh. It needed flesh. fortunately for me, the teeny tiny staples that ship with this thing couldn't penetrate drywall, much less human skin. This was a terrible experience all around. And now I need to shop for a stapler with normal packaging and some real staples that will actually go through paper.",

Perhaps this was a defective piece, but my experience was awful and I returned the product.",
