We told it \"play bedtime thunderstorm\" and instead it played erotica. See the attached screenshot showing it correctly understood the request. On a normal Alexa, this plays white noise. How they could they possibly build a Kids Edition that ignores the normal requests and instead plays erotica?? I contacted support who told me we should say \"play bedtime stories\". How is that the solution?",

Super frustrating and super disappointed by such a bad roll out of a kids edition. My son was so excited to get this but he cannot do anything on it. Not matter how many times I try and add free time it doesn\u2019t work . Save your money and time.",

Set-up was a little interesting, I had to \"click\" off and then back on the Free Time setting in the Alexa App ( it was already enabled) to get it to activate, but after that, it was easy to register, set-up and install. The kids' version of Alexa is great. The speaker is not that of an Echo, but kids don't care and it sounds good. It's not bad in anyway. It's completely controllable and has a ton of parent offerings. I'm very impressed.",

For example, the Drop In feature was really exciting so I could chat with my children or eavesdrop while outside. However, it only connects about 1 out of 20 times. Another limited feature is asking basic questions like \u201cwhat time does Dairy Queen in Bozeman open?\u201d \u201cIs REI open today?\u201d She cannot answer.
