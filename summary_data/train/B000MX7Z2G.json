      "text": "I've been spoiled by owning the models where both wires retract. Other than saving money, the one wire retracting hasn't much going for it. A tiny nibbin in the middle of the non-retracting wire seems to make shaking the phone to untangle any issues once the phones are tugged from a pocket. But big whoop. Spend another ten bucks and buy the doubles. I bought this item because all I saw was silver headphones and a really cheap price. I didn't see what is frequently commented on by purchasers: Only One Cord Retracts.",

They would stay in place and not fall off. I wouldn't wear them longer than an hour because it will start to hurt. These saved me from a lot of pain so i would recommend this to anyone else who is looking for something to cover your ears to prevent them from getting too cold during a workout.",

In fact, the bass is exceptionally weak and I've had to re-adjust my equalizers to compensate. The clip-on attachments feel very secure and comfortable. The retractable cord is nice. The cables are thin, so I would worry about their durability over long periods of time, but so far nothing has broken.",

About 20% of the time I listen though, I get some white noise in the background. I still haven't figured out how to adjust the headphone cord to mitigate that--it just goes away after a while. I've gotten pairs from Sony for only $20 before, sadly those were discontinued...",
