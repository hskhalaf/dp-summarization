      "text": "This is a great set of goggles for anything FPV related. The opening fits over my glasses and lack of fresnel lens inside means that the image is really clear. The padding is soft and fits my face w/o any light leaking. The diversity screen can be removed and used externally if needed, that makes it really flexible. The menu system is intuitive with a small 5-way joystick at the back and it has DVR! The battery pack (not included) fits into a pocket on the strap behind your head. I would recommend this goggle to my friends.",

      "text": "Very comfortable, battery on back of headset balances out the screen in front. If you wear glasses this is the best option that I have come across. It uses 2 signals for diversity and the controls for the screen work well. It uses a micro sd card to record your flights. Only negative thing is it uses a fatshark type battery connection to connect the battery to the headset. You can find these easily but the price is higher than most batteries of the same size.",

      "text": "There is no battery included with these goggles so figure another $15-20 for a good 2S battery with XT60 connector. It doesn\u2019t include a micro SD card or internal memory so that may be another expense. For those reasons I think the Viper is a bit overpriced. Aside from that these are good goggles with a very clear image, HDMI in, AV in and out, plus DVR capability. The channel/frequency menu is top notch and you can even save your favorite combos if you use more than one for racing, etc.",

I wear progressive bifocal lenses, and I can see the screen without trouble. I particularly like the removable bottom light shield, and that is how I've used them since day one. Highly recommended!",

They are definitly better than any other box goggle I have tried, both in comfort and view. No eye strain. Very comfortable. If the smaller form factor of fat shark style goggles is what you want, spend the extra money. But if lower price is what you want, you can't go wrong with these. My only complaint is the case for these is kinda big and does not fit into my backpack with all my other gear.",

I recorded the flights, but have not had a chance to watch them. From this experience I am super happy with them. I would recommend them. Just have to watch how long they last now.",

She loves them they are easy to use and the XT60 makes it easy as they hook to every battery we own. The only downside we have fount to them is the focal distance. The screen feels so close to your face it\u2019s hard to observe the whole screen at once. Easily the best box goggles we have tried to date and will be buying another set eventually",
