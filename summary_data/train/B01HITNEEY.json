So far he's grilled hamburgers, hot dogs, and pork steaks that all turned out amazing. It took him about an hour to put it together. The grate is really easy to clean after use which really made him happy. He uses the different burners to cook different foods on each side and turn one off when necessary. I would highly recommend this grill.",

The slats in the grill are a little bit farther apart then a standard grill so you have to be careful squashing down on the burgers until they are a little cooked.

The result was a good sturdy gas grill. It seems to work fine. The Amazon listing offer expert assembly for $75. I would want a lot more than $75 to assemble one of these.",
