I was surprised at the quality of this, from the nice boxed packaging to the cable itself which is that braided metal kind of feel/look. Everything about this looks high quality, and the results of my recording sounds great too (although to be fair, i'm not really sure what constitutes as amazing quality vs average). the cable is plenty long for what i need it for, and with the construction, there is absolutely no tangling. I'm really loving this, one of the best extension cable (of any kind) i have ever bought.",

But the second I start playing audio, the crackling goes away and it works great. My old one was silent when audio was paused (but the cord was too short), with the same phone in the same car. So it's definitely a default of this cord, but it's still serving it's purpose perfectly and the long cord is awesome.",

Perfect snug fit for something the cat might have lost it's life chewing on. *(No, the cat didn't lose it's life, but it's no longer an inside cat as it went through about 6 sets of headphone and earbud cords, several stereo cords and one power cable. It ate the power cable last...and hasn't eaten any cords since. Wonder why ;-) )",

However, when I plug in my headphones, I can hear a LOT of noise being picked by the cables even with no source on the other end. I don't get any of that noise when I plug in the cable that came with the speakers. I will be looking for cables with better shielding.",

For a main headphone cable it's not a bad choice, though I personally prefer a cloth sleeve or a more bendable type of rubber instead of the woven plastic style this has. It's also very thin which is great for wiring things up. Not much else to say I guess, overall happy with purchase but again for an audiophile you might want to look at higher end products.",
