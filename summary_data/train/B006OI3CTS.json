There was a plastic sleeve it might have once fit into; but the sleeve had a slit on one side, and was obviously not adequate protection to protect the game. I am extremely displeased, and do not recommend this 3rd party seller if you\u2019re considering a used purchase. We will be very lucky if the game still works!",

The drop system takes some getting used to, but it's not as irritating as you would think. It actually helps you get the most out of Sora and Riku's worlds and issues. The Dream Eater creation aspect makes for fun builds and sidekicks. This is an incredible game so far, and I've only finished Traverse Town with both soon to be Keyblade Masters.",

Anyways if you love kingdom hearts and want to know about the next game you should buy this one.=)",
