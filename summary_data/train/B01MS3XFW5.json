They do fill with water pretty easy and get a bit of weight to them but their comfort and protection makes the minor inconvenience worth it. They feel fantastic walking on the deck of a boat, beach, boardwalk, payment, even gravel roads. They do retain a quite a bit of sand so I recommend washing them off outside and not trying to do it in a sink or tub. Update: I had the chance to wear with dive fins and they fit perfectly. They actually made the fins fit much better.",
