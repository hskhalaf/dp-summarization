      "title": "I would highly recommend a subwoofer",
      "text": "There isn't a lot of bass to this speaker. However, it's adequate for nearfield listening or close to a wall. I would highly recommend a subwoofer. Though the bass isn't deep, it has decent impact, and all frequencies have a lot of detail. I have the Elac B5s as well, and these are better sounding with regards to transients and detail. The bass is the only problem, and the Elacs still need bass for some genres and movies. The build quality is superb, it comes with a nice pair of cables, and the packaging is great. I highly recommend this!",

      "text": "The speakers were ordered on the 9th & arrived on the 11th. They were boxed as if there were a million dollars in there. Got them out & now in my system. They are something much more than expected The build quality is 5 out 5 stars more important the sound is excellent. For got that the stereo was on & thought some one was speaking in the room. I put the port plugs in because I have a 15\" sub to take the music down to 25hz and the Q's blend in very well. If you are looking for a pair of bookshelf & you want to spend 250.00 don't think twice.",

I have listened to piano, violin, guitar, Hammond organ, female and male opera, Alice Cooper,...you just can't beat it--nothing to complain about and I am very picky about my music. You need a good subwoofer to take care of the bottom end. You can't do better for anywhere near the price. Beautifully engineered--you would have to spend $3000 to get a better sound stage than the Q Acoustics 3020. I am very satisfied with these small speakers.",

I have them in my bedroom (20' X 20') they are plenty loud enough for a room that size and sound and look like much more expensive speakers. The fit and finish is great. They have 5\" \"bass units\" so needless to say, if you like bass, you will definitely need a subwoofer. They also come with a 5 year warranty.",

For more critical music listening I do prefer my KEF Q100 speakers though a different amp. I love the look of the Walnut veneer and the rounded edges. It looks awesome sitting on my TV console. The magnetic grills are a nice touch that I wish more brands would do. I think the 3020's actually pair better with the R-S202 than the KEF's do. It's hard to beat this combo for the total cost of $400.",

Though small, these speakers deliver a very clear and rich sound worth speakers many times of the price. Currently I do not have funky receiver or a CD player, but even with that, I am able to hear nuances of sound that frequently I haven't noticed. The QED cable that the company sent together with the speakers are excellent and improve sound by a lot than using no brand name wire. Overall, I recommend these and I am sure you can also be satisfied with other similar speakers from the Q Acoustics.",
