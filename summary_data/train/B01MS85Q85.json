In this day and age of identity theft, it's just uncalled for! And, unfortunately, some features of this device are not usable without that software. Which makes this only good for personal diagnoses use. Not great for customer presentation. Would rate 2 1/2 stars if I could. If anybody knows of 3rd party software that can be used with this please let me know!",

It works well enough but the screen is garbage. There\u2019s 3 blurry lines running vertically on the display and blotchy, white pixels, at the top and right. Worst of all, Flir discontinued all software on the Apple Store. This is a huge issue considering I don\u2019t own a PC. How am I supposed to update the firmware to maximize it\u2019s effectiveness if you\u2019ve given me no way to update the software? Great idea... poorly executed.",

I would still like to see LARGER images (downloaded), a protective and waterproof case (I purchased a Pelican which was perfect), a video mode and bluetooth mode. Additionally when you transition the before and after photos it takes the WOW factor to an entirely new level.",
