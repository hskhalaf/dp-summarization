I have even owned this one but after a few years it gave out. This one was already out, but it's condition was \"used-good\" it was good as long as it was not around moisture.",

Never any issues with water-leakage or from rough care. I also find battery-life to be good. The reason I give it a four rather than a five is due to picture quality; due to pixels and a somewhat weaker lens than my Canon 11 I sometimes wish for more pixels. But for the price it is a good buy.",

The version 1.1 camera firmware update, already installed on my camera when it arrived (no need to have it downloaded with the Olympus Master 2 software - although there is an update available for that as well), allows support of memory cards greater than 2GB. The camera comes with an adapter to convert microSDHC cards (8 GB for example) to the XD format needed for the camera. I was impressed with the ease of navigation through the camera settings using only one hand to hold and navigate at the same time.",

But if waterproof is the ultimate goal this is definitely the way to go. I took some great pictures underwater and outdoors in general. Nice size and robust built. High recommend for its purpose but if artistic/great shots is your goal, go for a DSLR. This is a bit pricey too, and I got it because I broke my last two cameras because of water spills.",
