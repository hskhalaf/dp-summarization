This wireless card did nothing though. Even though it said I had a 100% signal strength, it would not communicate at all with the router. Sorry DLINK, your product doesn't work and is being returned.",

After a few hours of reading some wiki's and messages, I had WPA running and my \"new\" Linux laptop was on my network. Piece of cake! Great card and great chipset!",

Even if you don't I'm sure you have a guru fried that will hook you up. Bottom line if you have a need for speed this product will more than get you there and is easy on the pocketbook.
