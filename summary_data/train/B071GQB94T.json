If anyone whose name & number you have programed into the phonebook calls it says the name when the phone rings. IIt also automatically block calls from \"private caller,\" no name callers, out of area caller and other nuisance calls. Since we installed this phone system we have been able to eat supper without many interruptions It also has a good wireless range that allows us to move about all parts of the house and outside when working in the yard..",

It may take reading the manual to figure some things out but the caller ID voice announce was feature I had before with a caller ID and I found I could get it with this. Same Panasonic quality Ive know for decades at a very good price. Hopefully this will be the last phone I will ever need, no complaints!!",

Super range when I take it outside, far more than I ever dreamed, almost a city block with other cordless phones and wireless routers in every house on the block.

The rechargeable batteries are standard AAA size. I don't see much that can go wrong here. The only cons would be that the handset is a little slippery and light/small - so cradling the phone in your neck is not that easy - but it fits in your pocket and the speakerphone works great. I consider that a reasonable trade-off because there are no large handset cordless phones anymore. I also bought a white version with two handsets and an answering machine for $16 more.",
