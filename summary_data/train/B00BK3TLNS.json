      "text": "The quality of my Keter Borneo 110 Gallon Resin Outdoor Storage Bench and Deck Box is mediocre at best. Every piece had excess plastic that had to be trimmed. Every piece also had sharp edges in the plastic that had to be smoothed. In addition, the lid does not close tightly. It looks like a factory second to me. After all the good review, I expected better. I called Keter about it and they told me to take it up with Amazon. I called Amazon and their new policy seems to be return it or keep it, we don\u2019t really care. I guess I will buy locally from now on.",

Sits firmly on the concrete patio, lid can be locked if desired. Looks like no bugs can get inside-time will tell about that. Very happy with this product - so much so I ordered another for folding patio chairs & a foldable chaise lounge. Would definitely recommend.",

I did however caulk the vent holes in the bottom and glued pieces of screen over the vent openings at the top. I did not want bugs and spiders getting in. So far it works, the cushions stay dry and the box is bug and spider free.",

I sprayed the hinges with WD40 because I read in some other reviews that they sometimes rust. I will spray the hinges a couple times a year in hopes of preventing that issue. Even if they end up rusting eventually I\u2019ll still be happy with this purchase. Great size and awesome price! Thank you!",
