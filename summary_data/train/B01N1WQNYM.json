Best plan is to put liquids in motel fridge overnight each night. BTW, it is easy to clean!",

Later in the day I took the bag into my home and while on the mains it achived a level of 36 degrees on the surface of the foil inner liner. I had planned to use this to keep my prescription cool on hot July/August days while out on a day trip. Now I will take in car on daily basis to use with daily shopping.",

      "text": "I purchased this item for a road trip to Florida June 27 2018. The plug was damaged during minor movement in the vehicle. It was pushed in and is inoperable. The food was therefore ruined and the unit cannot be reused. Unfortunately I found this to be an inferior item. I stress that no heavy movement was placed on the plug. I do not recommend this item. **Since I reviewed this item I have been in contact with the seller and they have been more than gracious in solving the problem. They are in the process of sending me a replacement cooler, and I am very grateful for their prompt and professional response **",

Tried it one more time. Again everything was cold, unplugged it, I was out of the car for 37 minutes, came back, the bag and my food was warm. Had to throw out my food. Returning product. I DO NOT RECOMMEND. Also, I bought the adapter to use in the house, guess what NO RETURNS!!! SO I AM RETURNING THE COOLER THAT DOES NOT WORK, BUT I'M STUCK WITH THE ADAPTER. SHADY COMPANY.",
