Easy to trim for fit, I have used them in work boots, hiking boots, cowboy boots, and sneakers. Your cowboy boots might need to be a loose fit , but all other shoes they will work with your normal size.",

I would totally recommend, they were a game changer for me.",

Wanted the insole to really fill out my shoe . Could just be a problem I have personally , just seems to be very narrow .But still super comfy on my heel which was my main concern",
