      "text": "I have used Head racquets for decades, starting with my first tennis racket in 1973. I've been playing racquetball since 1980, and the Head Radical Edge racket has been the worse product I've ever owned. Over a period of 15 months, the racket broke 3 time...in the same place on the frame. The first two times I received a replacement one from the warranty (I did like Head's response to my requests in that regard). This third break convinced me to cut my losses. I'm a B+ player, and know enough to be careful. But collisions in a doubles match happen, and this racket seems to be very prone to breaking with any degree of impact.",
