It cleans up well, after some scrubbing with soap and Bon Ami powder, the white panels are white again. No one complains about it being too hard. It's not as soft as a cheap foam-padded outdoor ball but you can't have everything.",

Sure, I can buy a cheaper ball, but will it feel good when you power through a 3 person block? I have no clue. I'm still learning, I'm still trying to get my timing right when it comes to attacks.

The ball feels smaller than traditional balls, I'm not 100% but it really does feel slightly smaller.

It'll take some adjusting at first in your passing since it's a little more bouncy but overall you'll enjoy a much better game/experience.",

The only problem I had was the ball came deflated and the creases where it was bent haven't fully disappeared yet after 2 weeks. Please stop shipping balls deflated. I will not take any stars off though because it doesn't affect play and because this review is about the ball not how seller ships it.",

I usually play with the Molten L2s or Pro Touch balls and this one fares well with it. However, when playing pick up, I occasionally get complaints. I dont know about breaking in the ball... pumping it full of air makes it pretty hard.. So i just leave it a bit deflated for the perfect softness and bouncey level..",
