There were no issues with the construction of this product. It helps to have someone assist in putting it on and taking it off but it can be done alone also. For the price it's hard to beat. The delivery was fast and on time. I would recommend this brace to family and/or friends.",

It also works well by actually pulling your shoulder back with a decent pressure on the shoulder and clavicle versus some brands that put a lot of pressure on the clavicle. Seems to be somewhat effective, start slowly and work up.",

I have a 42\u201d chest and ordered the XXL which ended up being much to large. The discription read size for 37 and up. Reordered a XL and that works well, and has pleanty of extra space.",
