The RT-AC68U works fine with BT TV and provides similar WiFi performance and range to the Netgear R7000. The firmware/software interface is much better on the Asus than the Netgear and has significantly more features and monitoring capabilities. The Adaptive QOS works well and is very easy to configure, the Asus AI protection is also useful to stop people going on websites that contain viruses/spyware etc. Overall very happy and will likely buy another Asus router in the future.",

It was almost a plug and play replacement - you need to continue to use the BT Openreach modem (white box) and swap out the BT Home Hub 3 router. The one challenge was getting the router setup wizard to log on to BT Infinity broadband. Eventually worked out that you don't use your BT account login: you use bthomehub@btbroadband.com as the username and any character (I used *) as the password. Once that was sorted, the wifi network worked extremely well with fast speeds throughout the house and no more dropping out.",
