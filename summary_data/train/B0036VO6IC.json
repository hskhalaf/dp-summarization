I do sales presentations and the sound of laptop speakers always stinks. The sound out of this speaker system blew me away. Such a great deal for the price. The bass sound is not amazing but you won't notice it unless you're really listening for it as the mid and high ranges are so good. Sure, probably not most amazing speakers ever made, but they've just got to be the best around for cheap notebook speakers. Combine the great sound with the great form factor and functionality and it's a winner. Big time.",

My review mirrors many of ones here, works great to watch movies on a laptop.

Would definitely buy again. Sound is as good as more expensive and less portable speakers I have. Great buy for $20!!!",

If you prefer to use the headphone jack for your audio, or analog 3.5mm out from another media device or mp3 player, this is pure WIN. While in digital audio mode, the volume and power control work flawlessly. I've used in the Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx) and can attest yo it good sound and ease-of-use. Only cons that I know of: will not clamp to the thicker LCD monitors, but should suffice for LCD laptop thickness. However, the clamp is designed to also function as a free standing pedestal.",

Good sound projection, a bit tinny, and meager bass(you should expect this), but it still is a decent upgrade for my laptop at a fair price. I listened on interent radio and was pleasantly surprised.",
