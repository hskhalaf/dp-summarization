The shelves are bolted in so they don't shift in shipment, but it's done so once they're released you can't tell. The 2 units I ordered were the exact color as I expected. They're sturdy, well built, a nice addition to my furniture.",

The bookcases are well made, solid, and nicely finished. While the units are not a full hardwood, they do have some hardwood pieces, hardwood veneers, and the particle boards used in cores are very nice density. We expect the units to last decades and they look great!",

The manufacturer was courteous and asked to reach out to Amazon for this problem. I gave up since who would send such a big thing back and what is the guarantee that the next one will not be damaged. Issue is that the delivery guys do not open and check causing this unfortunate situation.",

They do provide all the hardware, just be sure you don\u2019t lose any mounting screws they are small and it is easy to lose them. Once unpacked and assembled it was fine.",
