I have been diagnosed with contact allergy/sensitivity to certain metals, and my dermatologist went on about my need to be caution about even stainless steel watches because some aren't truly that. I am happy to report, I have had no issues with these watches. I was able to use my at home link adjuster kit to make the wristband shorter. Easy to read. If you are big on your watch not looking too cheap- I would recommend the silver Fossil watches over this one. It looks much cheaper than my silver one of same price. For me it's not an issue.",

But I'm sure will go away once the watch has been worn for a longer period of time. Also the watch hands glow after you charge them with a bit of light, only down side is they don't glow that long, doubt it'll last 8hrs + Otherwise, money well spent :)",

The watch does come with a tin box, which makes it nice when giving it as a gift. However, the watch did fall out of the tin during transit, but did not sustain and scratches. Overall it is a beautiful watch, and makes for a perfect gift.",
