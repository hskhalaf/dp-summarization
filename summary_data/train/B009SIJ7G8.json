I use a 1TB drive for non-essential program installs and storage, and put my OS, Chrome and my most used programs on the SSD. Boot times are under 30 seconds from button press to idle desktop (Windows 7 x64).",

      "text": "This Technology is very promising, however, the SSD Product Drivers required and the conflicts in the various operating systems are sometimes difficult to overcome. I Have installed (2) SSD's with one each of windows 7 and windows xp sp2, as external drives. Both were difficult to get up and running correctly. Finally I was able to Get Them Operational. I Am Not Positive yet, about using the ssd as a C: Drive. I Think More Work Is Needed By The SSD and System Manufacturers in the Plug and Play areas. At This Time I Don't Recommend them, unless you have a SSD Knowledgeable Computer Technician Available. I Consider MySelf more than the Average User.",
