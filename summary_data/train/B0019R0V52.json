Needless to say, I layer on sunscreen. I like this one because I can dab it over my make up when I need to reapply, while that's not an option with creams. It's great for sweaty beach days because it absorbs moisture unlike creams that run off.This stuff definitely works. It's a little white but I wear it almost everyday, you can't really tell if you use it sparingly over make up.",

Cannot say how much sun damage it is protecting me against, but I know it does not do anything funky to a full face of makeup.",

It was not a match for my olive skin - but I exchanged the translucent powder with no issues or hassles from Amazon and purchased the Golden powder instead. Now this powder is perfect. It looks great on my skin and I love knowing that I have an additional protective barrier to help prevent sun damage. 100% will purchase again!",

Personally, I think Tarte has the best applicator/powder suncreen stick but I wanted to try something I could get from Prime for efficiency.",

      "text": "Love all the Jane Iredale products and this is no exception. The concept itself makes me happy. I can apply this powder on top of my makeup and retouch my makeup for added sun protection every 80 mins. This powder just absorbs all the excess oil and makes skin matte which is what I'm looking for. Using it multiple times a day everyday makes the skin dry and may cause irritation(I experienced it couple of times). I also have problem with the sponge applicator. I use my Real Techniques Flat Kabuki brush to apply this product.",
