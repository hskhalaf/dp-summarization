Bought another for the 2500 sq ft upstairs' I had problems with it where it may have been damaged in shipment. I communicated with the tech over a five day period, he tried to walk me through some trouble shoot it with me, not to mention it was Christmas week and I did not expect a response till the next week, but the tech was responding night and day to assist me, ended up returning for another unit which works great.

Noticed a minor leak from the water regulator in our crawl space below the house after we bought it that was causing a mold and mildew smell primarily in the bedroom adjacent to it. Ran the machine one time and the smell was gone. Also asked a question of the manufacturer about the safest timing for returning home after \"away\" ozone feature is used and it was answered within 12 hours! Will continue to give it a power shot now and again to be sure, but after a week of use, we are 100% satisfied.",

After it runs for an hour or so, the smell gets down to a point where it's tolerable. The second issue is the how loud the fan is even on the lowest speed. My guess it's a cheap fan. I wish I would of paid more attention to the return date as I would of returned it. We had a different brand some years ago and it was much more controlled than this one is - and quieter.",

The manual shows how, and I won\u2019t lie, ,it looks a bit involved. So with that only to discover - so far this does a great job of freshening up the air.

    "title": "Green Air Classic Air Purifier Ozone Generator",
    "description": "Working in conjunction with its carbon filter system, our air purifier pulls in unclean air from the rear, first passing through the carbon filter which removes airborne particles. This filter also acts to deodorize any unpleasant odors. Air then passes through the inner PCO cell, further filtering airborne contaminants. The anion emitters, now moved forward of the fan to the front panel, release trillions of negative ions into your home, attaching themselves to dust particles, and dropping them straight to the floor. This advanced function is ideal for eliminating dust, animal dander, and other harmful particles that float in the air. Left behind is fresh oxygen rich air. The sterilizer function turns on the units blue UV lamp. When you need to eliminate strong or offensive odors in your home, the Purifier/AWAY mode creates activated oxygen (ozone) based upon the square footage of your home. Perfect for eliminating tobacco smoke odors, cooking odors, chemical/cleaning agent odors, paint odors, etc. The activated oxygen will also clear pollution embedded in walls, ceilings, floors, carpets, furniture, clothing, countertops....all surfaces in your home. Use Purifier/AWAY mode (ozone function) when home is unoccupied on units built in timer. Ozone reverts back to oxygen after approx. 30 to 45 minutes. Return home to fresh, clean, oxygen rich air....provided only by the 4 advanced technologies of the Green Air Classic!! 2 year warranty.",
