However, I was very uncomfortable climbing the ladder, it did not feel secure to me and thus did not use it any more. My most difficult situation was that I was in the process of asking for a return, however, we were in Florida at the time and got caught up in the Irma Hurricane and thus as a result missed the return window.",

I swapped it with my son's bunk bed ladder, because his bed is heavier and much more sturdy.",

They come with rubber tread covers to provide bare footed comfort. Multiple attachment methods are included for convenience. Use either a small hook and extrusion for a positive attachment or the larger hook so no fascia board needs to be drilled. These bunk ladders can be trimmed for access to shorter bunks.",
