One heater on \"High\" brought the temp up from 26 degrees to 52 degrees, but two brought it up to 78 degrees in 24 degree weather. I will be overriding the internal thermostat this week and installing a manual thermostat for each unit to better control the garage temp. Great heaters. Each heater is rated for 500sf.",

The only slight negative is the mounting bar, which is fairly flimsy. It'll be just fine if you mount to the ceiling and hang the heater that way, but if you mount to a wall the bar will bend and sag.",

    "title": "Fahrenheat FUH Electric Heater for Garage, Factory, Basement, Warehouse, and Outdoor Use, Beige",
    "description": "Heating large, drafty spaces can be difficult to say the least. The Fahrenheat FUH Electric Heater offers an easy and effective way to provide lasting, comfortable warmth in even the most hard-to-heat areas. Suitable for indoor spaces as well as several outdoor spaces, this heater mounts easily to the wall; it provides warmth in home spaces as well as commercial spaces. It comes with a remote control to easily operate from a distance. It works smart; the automatic control delays fan use until the heating element is warmed. For added safety and durability, when the heater is at maximum capacity or turned off, the fan continues to operate until the heating element is cooled. By preventing the circulation of cold air and preventing an output of an excessive amount of heat, your space stays comfortable longer. Fahrenheat is part of the Marley Engineered Products family, which provides a wide range of innovative, quality engineered, commercial, industrial, and residential electric comfort heaters and ventilation solutions. All our products are engineered with aesthetics, functionality, safety, and structural tolerance in mind.",
