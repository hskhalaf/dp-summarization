The wrenches included are too small and also have a screwdriver attched which stabs you in the hand when you try to fasten. Also be sure to fasten the screws underneath the seat, both my bike and my wife\u2019s were loose and the seat bounced around for a while. Once assembled these bikes rode great. Sleek look, good sturdy material, nice paint finish. Overall thrilled with the quality of the bike.",

You've also got to adjust the brakes, and tune it up properly in order to achieve a squeakless-clean assembly. However, I'm certain you could say that of any bicycle that comes in a box, and not from an around-the-corner shop. The assembly instructions could be more clear, they send a version that includes several bike styles; but I managed to get it done. I do have one scuff on the handlebars that neither came from delivery or assembly - must be factory. But personally, I can live with that.",
