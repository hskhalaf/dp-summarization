The handle does feel a little flimsy, so I'm concerned about long term durability. Biggest annoyance is dissembling and reassembling the grater for cleaning. The handle needs to be unscrewed from the grating cylinder, and there is nothing to grip onto on the cylinder end opposite the handle. This makes it extremely difficult to get enough force to unscrew the handle. I've seen similar units with knurls or some other protrusions on the output side of the cylinder to assist with grip. This unit needs something like that.",

If you want to grate anything other than Parmesan (or similar), get something with coarser holes. Yes, it comes apart for cleaning, but it\u2019s next to impossible to get a grip on the slippery plastic in order to unscrew it.

So much better than the old dried up stuff in the jar they sell at the grocery store with the million other ingredients and preservatives in. Fresh is the way to go!!! You will love it!!!",
