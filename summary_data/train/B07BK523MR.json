UPDATE on REVIEW: I first reviewed this without trying the brushes so let me revise my review. It is not a set of brushes for deep cleaning. The stems/handles are very soft and bend, you can get the brush where you need it. It's just to light weight for me. I like strong bristles these are very soft. If you need a set just for light duty this is it. Unfortunately I am returning this set.",
