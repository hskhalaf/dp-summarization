I have bad pain and numbness in my back and neck from having a desk job. This is the first one that has really helped relieve the tension. The handles have helped more than I thought they would in being able to get a full back massage. It has multiple modes and speeds, and you can turn the heat off and on depending on what you want. I also love that it comes with a car charger and carrying bag. I plan on purchasing at least 2 more as gifts.",

So when my husband uses it he has to sit up in his chair and keep it propped up on his neck, hence the awkwardness. Otherwise this product is as described and shipped super fast and well packaged.",

My sister and I thought it would be just another product that would break after a few uses but after a month+ of using it multiple times a day, this product was well worth the $50 price tag. If you have chronic neck/back pain, nab this for the same price as a massage and you wont regret it.",

The bottom line is you WILL unplug yourself when you move/stretch... it's just a given and I'm sure everyone who uses this product deals with this. They could do so much better by having a firmer connector and a longer power adapter.",

      "text": "I bought the Resteck Neck Massager because a good friend recommended it. I took a bad spill on Christmas Day and effected my neck and shoulders for some time. My friend suggested I purchase the Resteck Neck Massager from Amazon because it had worked so well for her. Shazaam, she was right! It helped almost immediatley. The stiffness and soreness gradually subsided and did some good. I do advise that the first time you try it don't be tempted to use it too long, use it gradually in small bits of time. I love it, it is easy to use, once you get the hang of it!",

      "text": "This is the second one of these we bought because we love it so much -- need one for each of us. I have a different manufacturer version of this, but it was bulkier, the massage balls hurt, and it somehow heavier. This RESTECK is fabulous. Love that it comes with a convenient carry case. Easy to use wherever you need a great massage. Choice of heat or no heat and massage rotation direction. Great value. You'll want to make this a regular part of your end-of-day routine. And you're supporting a small U.S. business. Win-win.",

Do not spend money on this on just because it costs the most. The company is a rip off and is trying to get as much money as they can for a product that many other manufacturers on amazon sell cheaper and may even be better.",

I'm super picky with massagers because it never gets the rights spots but this one does and it's as gentle or firm as you want it. The straps help to place it exactly how you want it. It comes with a small back that fits in any little corner. I love it and thanks to this little machine I feel better and less painful. Thank you!",

Because I bought a massage machine for my feet and calf, I was hoping this belt can do the rest, on my legs, back, , neck, etc. I was very disappointed to find out that this product could only be used on top of body. It\u2019s bulky and thick - one can not sit on sofa to be flat and comfortably against it without feeling pain from the protruding big balls, whether for the back or the neck. I am quite tolerable to pain, but I have to say that this product was just too much to lean against.",

So I am glad I found this, I have had for about five months. Originally purchased for Christmas present, but I use it more so it\u2019s pretty much mine. Hits all the spots and the fact that it heats up is a nice touch. I will be using every day till it breaks.",

I\u2019m a taller person and when I went to apply more pressure, I could hear the motor straining and it was much slower. 2. Short straps. Like I said, I\u2019m taller and the straps are not an ideal length. It can make positioning the massager really awkward and difficult. I\u2019ve used a homedics massager that was amazing and I chose this one because it looked extremely similar, was half the price, and had high reviews. I\u2019m starting to learn that online reviews don\u2019t mean a whole lot.",

You can make this massager lighter by not pressing down with your arms in the arm hoops or deep tissue by pushing down harder. Only negative I see is the arm hoops could be a little longer. I'm tall and my arms are bent. Would be more comfortable if they were longer - but not a big deal in the grand scheme of things. Would highly recommend this product.",

It massages deeply without hurting and it's comfortable to use, unlike stick massagers where your whole arm is vibrating and you have to contort your body oddly to get all portions of your back. With this massager you can just turn it on, put it where you want it (works great on the back as well), tuck your hands into the very comfortable loops and just ... relax. I don't need it all the time, but every once in a while I really do and then it's a godsend.",
