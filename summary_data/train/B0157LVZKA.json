The tree is quite large now so the cover was very difficult to draw the drawstring at the bottom close to the trunk. I had hoped it would help keep the apple maggots and coddling moths from getting into my apples. With the bottom of the cover still fairly open, I doubt this will help. I won't know for sure until I harvest the apples but I'm not very confident that the fruit is protected.",
