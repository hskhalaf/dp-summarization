The toast is never uniform and is always darker on one side than on the other. But it hasnt ignited anything and the toast doesnt fly away, so I guess it is OK. When pushing down the lever it needs an extra push to lock in place, or it will just pop up. At first I thought it was broken till a friend pointed that out to me.",

Second, the spring is strong so seems to need extra force to start toasting and the catch is poor, so sometimes needs two attempts. Another poor design thing.",

When I use the pop-up lever, it doesn't lift the toasted item up high enough for me to pick up the toast without burning my fingers so I have to use toaster tongs. The toaster is OK, but not as good as I had hoped.",

      "text": "I am updating my original review of this toaster. Mainly because it has failed. Whenever you toast anything, the 'Bagel' light goes on and it will only toast one side. Pressing the light fails to turn that function off and canceling the toast cycle does not clear the Bagel setting either. Only persistent pressing the toast arm down, canceling, pushing the toast arm down, canceling, etc will allow normal toasting, sometimes requiring you to do this a dozen times. Unfortunately, with appliances of this type, this product now is destined for the landfill. After only one year of very average toasting. I cannot recommend.",

The warming function works well, as does the function to toast just a bit longer if it isn't quite brown enough. (Doneness/color can vary if the slice thickness varies). So far my toast has been perfect!",

      "text": "It is for daily personal use. This toaster replaces a 70 year old family toaster that was loved, repaired, and finally worn beyond repair. We shopped around for quite awhile before purchasing a new model. We are well pleased with the Cuisinart CPT-2400. My husband loves the feature of the clamping of the slice of bread to hold it in the center of the slot for more even toasting. This model was a little more expensive compared to some of the others we researched, but we wanted the four slice option and the larger (bagel like) option. Would recommend for any family use. This model will fulfill your needs.",

However, I bought this toaster to fit larger pieces of bread and if the bread gets too close to the edges of the slot, they burn. Kind defeats the point. I will say, though, that it is beautifully designed and easy to clean.",

Well, it burned it on a 3. I used it again and lower it to 2, still pretty dark. The issue is the temperature settings. It does not matter which setting because it is overheating and burning everything!. Do not buy this toaster, something is definitely wrong with the heating element.",
