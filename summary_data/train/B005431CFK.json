Now it can only be ran on low where it shuts down every 10 min or so. I suspect the wingdings are failing with every use as it heats up. I highly recommend another manufacture as I see another user is having the same effects. I went ahead and went back to the axial style from mounto and xpower...far superior.",

It is powerful and overall acceptably quiet for this level of power. Only small issue is a few times, less then 5%, I have gone out to the garage and found it has rotated. It is powerful and the floor is epoxy coated and a little wet so there is little doubt with that much force it torques a little. Not disappointed with the power, CFM, drying power on a wet garage floor or even the sound.",

The air they move remains in a pretty tight 'cone', at 15 feet it is still only about 5-6' in diameter. At 25', the velocity is much lower, but instead of a cone, it it a lighter 'wall' breeze. These fans (we have about 10 in use now) are really great to cool down the shop!",

We also used to dry out torn out wall to wall carpet. This will be used in the future to dry paint, future flood repairs and other projects with fast drying needs.
