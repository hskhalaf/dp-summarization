I thought I'd try one more time to find one that was comfortable, roomy enough for 3 days as a Spirit personal item, and had decent organization. I do wish it only had two compartments (the laptop pocket and a larger, main one) but this looks to be perfect for my purposes and seems decently made. It has a great TSA-compliant laptop pocket, and two extra handles for wrestling it into the overhead bin. I did spritz it with waterproofing spray just in case.",

Just a few small cons.. it's pretty narrow, so difficult to get anything too bulky in there. Perfect for travel though. The laptop compartment at the back is underneath the arm straps so that takes a bit of getting used to and can be awkward on a plane when you have a very small space to maneuver. Also the shoulder straps are really close together at the top and I am a small person so they sit right up against my neck and rubs there.",

It can stretch to quite significant volumes for a complete day+night out while still being very compact when only lightly loaded (through some miracle of design and sewing that keeps amazing me).

This is a bit cumbersome especially when loading and unloading. Still considering its other virtues, I'm very happy with this purchase.",

Pros: - A lot of space - Nice tech area - Nice back padding and breathability - Great organisation Cons: - Can't stand up on its own - Straps could be made a bit comfier Overall, I definitely recommend this bag for most purposes.

They dont catch, but when you pull the zip there is noticeable friction. And one small nitpick: why only one bottle side pouch? Could they not have given one on the other side? For this price i expect something a bit better, at the very least, excellent zips. Also the timbuk2 website shows sternum straps, but mine didn't come with any. It is a good bag, and i recommend it but i wouldn't make it my first choice. Check out moutainsmith for tsa friendly bags (if that is what you want).",

Sturdy handle on the top; I often grab the bag by the top handle, particularly through airline security or getting out of cab. Small, thin handles irritate me. Of particular use are the multitude of pockets inside, especially the two mesh ones in one of the large compartments. Perfect for holding a few connectors and my earbuds, with easy access. Thanks!",
