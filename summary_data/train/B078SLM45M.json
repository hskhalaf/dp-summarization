Anyway, I have a new friend, a five year old Chihuahua, who was somewhat recently gave birth, was then fixed, microchipped, dewormed, tested and given preventative for Heartworm, etc. She came from Kentucky after being found as a stray and not claimed and now has come to my home in Pennsylvania to her forever home. Yay! Anyway, this leash is AWESOME! It works perfectly and has plenty of line so she can explore the grass. It's a great product for sure! You will not be disappointed!",

      "text": "I like to let my dogs wander on their walks, but sometimes that means they try to drag me (60lb and 90lb dogs). I can handle it, but they about kill my wife. The way this leash locks down if they pull when you have the button down takes most of the pressure off the walker. It is also tough and can handle a 90lb dog charging one way while a 165lb man pulls the other way. The only thing I don't like is the mechanism for locking the leash at a shorter length. It's harder to engage than most. The anti-yank portion of the lock more than makes up for it. Great purchase, so I got a second.",

Also the longer leash was allowing him to get more of a running start when cats, rabbits, or squirrels would appear and i have been pulled to the ground several times. This leash is only 15' and my dog tends to always be at the full extension of the cord so doesn't have so much lead. Mechanism is very smooth and if I only have one complaint it would be the lock button if so easy to trip I have frequently triggered the lock surprising my dog. i use this leash almost always now.",

I use it at about 5 feet long in the locked position when he needs to stay close and it's way better than our regular leash.

The only problem is the retraction can stick and not work at times and you have to pull it in - I\u2019m guessing because of the thicker cord , besides that it is well-made with a choice to quickly stop your dog and also lock him/her from going any farther by flipping the switch up.

It really gives you the feel like you got a good control of the dog. 2. The leash is flat and thick but doesn't tangle up when retracting back into the holder. 3. I like the stopper because it allow you to temporary stop the drop without having to lock it into position 4. Overall it seem to be made of good material. Now.. the true test is?? Does it last for more then 6months? We will see",

I bought the medium size instead of small because the 15 pounder is young and always pulls and strains against the leash.

The locking noise is also pretty loud, which isn't a huge deal although it might startle/scare your pup if they are skittish. Only had it for a week or two and it's held up fine with minimal usage. Here's hoping it holds up when my puppy is old enough for real walks..",

      "title": "If you LOVE your pet do NOT BUY this leech!!",
      "text": "I purchased this item in April & received it on April 25th. I currently have a 5 mo old Labrador Retriever who at this point only weights 50 lbs. The leech I ordered above was for large dogs up to 110lbs. When not in use it\u2019s in a closet with her harness. Just started using within the last 30-45 days and we\u2019re out walking yesterday and the leech breaks. Luckily we were close to home and no cars were coming. If you love your pet stay away from this leech. Not trust worthy. Very disappointed!!!",
