When my hard drive failed after only 16 months I decided I would go with a SSD instead of a traditional hard drive. No regrets. The laptop boots and shuts down much faster and programs and large files open faster as well. If you plan to do a fresh install of Windows, rather than cloning, be sure to go to Microsoft\u2019s webpage and make a boot drive with a thumb drive before you begin the installation process, and also buy a small screwdriver kit.",
