It is cool to the touch and it does toast quickly, which I learned when my smoke alarm went off! I LOVE the red color. The only negative is that the \"mark\" for setting the level of toasting is not well defined, and is very hard to see or feel. I live alone so the setting is never changed, but it could be a problem for a family. I gave it 5 stars because it meets all my needs and expectations.",

You can have very light or very dark, or multiple levels in between. It's a simple toaster...goes down and up...makes bread into toast. If that's all you need, this could be the toaster for you. UPDATE: it seems that most of the \"browning\" is done from the coils along the outside of the toaster. Therefore, I sometimes run a piece through twice. But then, I like my toast very dark. My wife doesn't do that since she likes her toast very light.",

Not worth the time and effort on my part to send it back for a refund, since my time is more valuable to me. Guess you get what you pay for.

It will set the toast on fire. Literally. On fire.
