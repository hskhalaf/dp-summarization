And this is a very easy clock radio to manipulate with excellent sound and a fun bluetooth connection. That may or may not be worth $300 to you, but it was to us.",

Now for the not so good: This item does not have dual alarm, nor usb charging, the cherry is very dry and of poor quality, and the front and rear panel graphics are so faint that it is almost impossible to read even with bright lighting, much fainter than in the website photos. Very hard to read in a bedroom. Returning it today for a more functional, less expensive option.",

      "text": "I have very mixed feelings about this product. High marks for sound quality. Bluetooth capability is a nice add on. Beautifully designed. But, everything about the UI is terrible. Can't read the print on the face of the radio. Who ever dreamed up blue print on a black background? The clock loses time and needs to be adjusted on a daily basis. The alarm can't be set on AM, so you have to turn it off and turn it back on every day. Lots more complaints, but you get the gist.",

The PROBLEM is that there are 3 or 4 LED lights on the front of the unit and when you add the light on the clock, it lights up the bedroom like a Christmas tree. Not a good bedroom edition. It is an amazing radio however. I own two of the non clock models and love them.",

For the first time, I'm receiving a perfect FM signal from a station 40 mi. away and another from 100 mi. away (strong at certain times of the day). This radio is used out in the country. The quirks of clock and alarm are not too hard to live with - with my routine. It has me enjoying music, just before sleep and after the alarm, so I guess the upside outweighs the other factors - for me.",

No sound from extension speaker when connected and balance adjusted to equal on both channels. sound in extension speaker was achieved only after resorting back to the mono mode. Seller swears it worked for him. I seriously doubt it. This is the second one I bought from another seller that did the dame thing. Not a recommended purchase.",

The lights are not dimmable and it way to bright for the bedroom. The alarm is hard to set, and is old fashioned 12 hour, and to set the alarm earlier time you have to rotate it all the way around. The clock is hard to set and isn't 100% accurate. So it sits on my nightstand with my android tablet in front of it as a shield from the lights and is the alarm.",
