A great feature is the ability to plug two items (including one grounded) into the adapter at the same time. Also included is another 2 prong adapter with slightly thicker prongs, and the UK adapter with 3 prongs. Keep in mind, as the description says, these do NOT convert voltage, but will work fine with multi-voltage devices like phone and camera chargers. These are of excellent quality and are a great value.",

The prongs were too fat to fit into the holes. I'm guess it was an issue with whether or not some of the places had been recently remodeled. I would just say be careful of purchasing these if you think you will be staying in older homes... I was luckily my friend had an older style adapter because it would've been problematic had I been on my own.",

Also the names in the adapters are helpful so that you don't have to bring all of them with you.",
