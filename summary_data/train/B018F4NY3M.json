Up until today it was great but if an item only has less than a 60 working window & you can't return it, isn't that a scam?? Coffee makers should last longer than 55 days. Sad. Dissatisfied.

Programming works, and I love the light for when the programming is on - my anxious brain knows for sure that i set the program for the morning, and I can even use it as a night light!",
