The camera came with all the items, brand new and had the Nikon warranty and English manual and UK charge plug. I was able to register the camera on the Nikon website.

However, I had to return it because it did not include the Nikon European Warranty Card as advertised. The camera has a fantastic sensor of 24 megapixeles that would give you awesome picture definition, and it presents several updates from the D3300 model (I was considering that one at first). Among those I would stress: mobile screen with better resolution, AEB (you will need a tripod for the best results in this mode, specially at night), 39 AF points, etc. If it had included the EU warranty, I would have kept it without a doubt.",
