First I bought some Vionics sandals, and they were better for my feet than regular flip-flops, but my feet were still killing me. So I did some more research, and Brooks was recommended everywhere for plantar fasciitis. After the first weekend of working 12 hour shifts on my feet (I work in healthcare) in these shoes, my feet felt BETTER than when I had been home doing nothing. I can\u2019t say enough about these shoes. Worth EVERY PENNY. Now that I know they work, I would pay even more for them.",

I have heard nothing but good things about these shoes from her since she started wearing them. They needed no break-in period. She says tell everyone these shoes are more expensive then she wanted to pay, but they are worth every penny to have shoes that just \"feel great\".",

This isn't a knock on Brooks, it's a compliment that I've worn them enough to actually wear them OUT.",

I do find that with any running shoes I have to switch out for Greensoles inserts, but I think that is a product of my special feet that need even more support :). This is my second pair of Brooks Adrenaline and I\u2019ve been happily putting in 10-25 miles running weekly. They are quality, don\u2019t rub or give blisters. I like the slight elasticity in the shoe laces. Would recommend to a friend...but my best friend already swears by these as well!",
