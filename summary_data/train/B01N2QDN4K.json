Like the other reviewer, I like the smell of this mat and I feel much more comfortable practicing on it because it is free from chemical smells. At first, I thought the mat would cause my hands and feet to slip, however, with use and as the body heats up, the mat gets better as I start to perspire. I highly recommend it and it comes with a nice carrying bag.",

    "description": "Our WODfitters yoga mats are completely all natural and chemical free. Each plant-based mat is made from a cork and rubber blend and measures 72\u201d x 24\u201d. At only 4 mm thick, the sleek design makes it easy to carry around and lay out. It is PVC free, plastic free, and foam free. \n\nThe advantages of cork \n\nCork provides better traction than almost any other yoga mat choice available. It\u2019s a great way to jumpstart your practice at any level, letting you grip the surface of your mat more tightly as you work through your flow. Cork is also less likely to get too hot if you are practicing outside in the sun. \n\nEasy to clean \n\nMost foam yoga mats need to be constantly cleaned because they are prone to mold and bacteria build-up. This mat is naturally antimicrobial and won\u2019t develop the same level of buildup in the first place. Most of the time to clean it, all you need to do is lay it out and let it air dry. If you get dirt on your mat, you can simply wipe it off with a small amount of soap and water. \n\nWhy it\u2019s better for the environment \n\nHarvesting cork from trees actually improves their levels of carbon production. So when you choose our cork and rubber blend, you are choosing a mat that\u2019s both sustainable and plant-based. Synthetic, TPE mats may claim to be environmentally friendly, but if you genuinely want to go green, then this is the mat for you.",
