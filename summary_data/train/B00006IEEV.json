In fact I gave up coloring and started using watercolor paints instead but those can ruin coloring book pages. These are like a dream and blend so well! The best Christmas gift ever!!! I found a site and some local stores that sell individual colors. I am hooked!!! Also, no issues with lead breakage here and they sharpen well. I'm in artistic heaven!

The Verithins hold their point relatively nicely, and the Premiers nicely lay down color, which I use more on the edge than the point. I\u2019ve sharpened them a few times and each time I\u2019m aware that they sharpen without difficulty, meaning minimal waste. The Premiers blend with water, while the Verithins don\u2019t. They play nicely with wax crayon, water crayon, pastel and the occasional acrylic pen. Paper with a texture, in my opinion, has a more pleasing result than untextured. While the leads ar not all centered, that has not been a problem. The Prismacolor sharpener doesn\u2019t mind, so keeps the points nice even though they\u2019re not centered.",

For the price, and all of the positive reviews, I thought these were supposed to be the very best. Quite frankly, some of the cheaper ones I own seem to work better. The colors are nice however when the pencil is able to hold a point. The sharpening issue seems to more problematic with certain colors, especially the pink, which is my daughter's favorite, so it is getting pretty short because of the constant sharpening issue. I bought these on sale, so I wonder if there was a bad batch, hence the price reduction??",

It's difficult to keep them sharpened to a nice sharp point and with my frequent sharpening, i am going through the pencils at an alarming rate. A few of the leads were broken on arrival, and prismacolor was very good about replacing the broken ones--no questions asked. I'd highly recommend these for creating original artwork.

The quality is the best I've seen (again, newbie @ colored pencils). I'd definitely recommend them for someone who knows what they're doing. I will look to see if this company makes a harder \"lead\" set, and if they do I will purchase them again.",

      "text": "Wow, the best colored pencils I've ever used (I haven't used many but I am extremely picky about anything I purchase). They blend well, are soft, made well, vibrant and very elegant. I bought these to use with my adult coloring books (not the kind you're thinking!). I find it difficult to truly relax and these pencils and coloring give my otherwise active mind a welcome respite. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a new relaxing past time. Well worth the money. It elevates coloring to a new level.",

These Prismacolors are nothing like I remember colored pencils being way back in the 70s. They also sharpen quickly and no lead breakage or wood splintering. Coloring, and sharpening are a real joy. I find myself coloring way longer than I should and neglect my other duties. Prismacolors are very addictive. They should come with a warning label! I am truly in love with them.",

I have not had much sharpening experience with them, but they more smoothly and completely color the page.",

The lead of these pencils is much softer than any other color pencil I've used. The colors are very rich and the more you layer the color the more vibrant they become. They also blend like butter to create a seamless transition between colors. If you love coloring and want a nice smooth buttery pencil this is the pencil for you. I would totally buy this again at full price.",

The way they work is, color lightly for paler color, or color you wish to blend, and color lightly and repeatedly over an area for deeper color. Nice!
