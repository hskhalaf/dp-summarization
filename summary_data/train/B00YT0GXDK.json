Thankfully they were free both the incorrect one and the correct one. ALSO; be prepared to purchase olympic adaptors because the unit comes with standard pegs on the frame, and all the slides which was disappointing.",

My biggest frustration is that the hardware was not all included and when we tried to contact the seller, they did not respond. (Via email and phone.) I had to go to the hardware store and purchase another $30+ of missing bolts to be able to finish assembling. Also - some of the hardware was in poor condition. It also has some design flaws and the parts are pretty cheap. Disappointed. Eventually we will save up for a better system.",

I use them high up on my cage when doing dips and I never have any trouble hitting the top. If you position them on the outside front your head will never hit the top no matter what.
