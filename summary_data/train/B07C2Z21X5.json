It struggles to adjust to high contrast lighting and can be slow to adjust in general. It is super well made and can survive a beating- which I found out when a dog ran away with the strap in its mouth. *oops*. Happy with this purchase overall!",

It came back worse than when I sent it. They wanted me to send it to them again. HA! But, I had a ton of lenses for a Canon I cannot afford to replace, so I am stuck with one. This second one has what appears to be oil spots on the photos. I am returning it and lenses or no, I am going to purchase a Nikon.",

Canon and Amazon tech were unable to provide a solution to fire remote flashes except for optical trigger which doesn\u2019t work when the camera body is enclosed in a photo booth head and the build in flash cannot be used. Canon said this is a stripped down version and doesn\u2019t expect the user to require remote flash. Other than that this is a great low cost entry level DSLR camera.",
