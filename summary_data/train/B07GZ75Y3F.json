Crest whitening strips hurt more than when I had kidney stones, but this is something I was cringing about when I purchased them. I was so on edge about how sensitive my teeth would be........ literaly nothing. No pain. At all. My teeth are so much whiter and the sensitivity gel they give is incredible. <--not that you would even need it because the maximum strength gel doesn't hurt anyways! 100% recommend!",

      "DENTIST-QUALITY RESULTS:\u200b Nothing\u2019s a bigger confidence booster than bright, white teeth. But going to the dentist is expensive (goodbye $600) and teeth whitening strips don\u2019t actually whiten \u2014 but our kit does. \u200bOur proprietary advanced teeth whitening system uses award-winning LED activating technology to offer professional results for as little as $1.50 per treatment.",
      "JUST 9 MINUTES A DAY TO A WHITER SMILE:\u200b It\u2019s easy \u2014 just brush your teeth, apply the proprietary teeth whitening gel, and let the USB-powered mouthpiece work its magic, while you catch up on your shows, work, whatever. Rinse, and you\u2019re well on your way to a brighter smile.",
      "SAFE FOR SENSITIVE TEETH, BRACES, BRIDGES, CAPS, CROWNS & VENEERS:\u200b Whitening your teeth shouldn\u2019t hurt, and now it doesn\u2019t have to. Designed with sensitive teeth (and gums) in mind, our whitening kit helps brighten teeth and remove coffee and wine stains \u2014 without causing pain. The Snow at Home Teeth Whitening System is also safe for braces, bridges, crowns, caps, and veneers.",
      "NO \u201cSOLD SEPARATELY\u201d RUNAROUND:\u200b Our proprietary whitening system includes everything you need to get a whiter smile \u2014 faster. From the mouthpiece with patented LED teeth whitening light to the whitening progress tracker, we\u2019ve thought of everything. The best part: You can get about 75 whitening sessions out of one kit. It\u2019s worth every penny.",
      "5-YEAR WARRANTY THAT WORKS:\u200b We\u2019ve all been there \u2014 a product stops working. You contact the company, and it\u2019s \u201cconveniently\u201d not covered. That\u2019s not the case with us. If any piece in our home teeth whitening kit fails to do its job, we\u2019ll replace it for free, just reach out to our friendly customer support team."
