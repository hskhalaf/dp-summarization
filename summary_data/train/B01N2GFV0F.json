You have to drill at least one hole in the wheel well plastic liner for each installation. This requires a right angle drill and a short bit. To use a normal drill you have to remove each wheel from the truck. My truck has full length steps. The front mud flaps do touch the steps after installation but they do fit..",

My running boards made it a tight fit in front but I used a couple of rubber spacers under the bottom screw which bumped the bottom forward slightly. For third screw that goes into the wheel liner, I heated a nail with a propane torch and it melted a hole through the mud flap and liner like a hot knife through butter. Added the retaining clip to backside of liner and that third screw tightened down nicely. They seem to be very sturdy.",
