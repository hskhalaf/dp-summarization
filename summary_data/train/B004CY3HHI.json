The other thing that makes this a good choice is that it comes with the starter gloves, also nicely made. Would recommenced to anyone!

A roll of wrist tape was missing and the zipper top was broken, however the overall durability and size made it a perfect gift. When I noted the missing tape & broken zipper to the recipient, and offered to return it~ he adamantly assurred me that the value of the bag was not in its packing format and was just what he needed.",
