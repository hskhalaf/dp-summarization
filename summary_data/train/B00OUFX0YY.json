      "text": "Bought two of these mats a little over two years ago for the kitchen (in front of sink and stove). Had relied on the name \"Amazon\". Usually a good decision but not this time. The mats \"walk\" on hard floors which is not a deal breaker (I shuffle them back into place a few times a day). Unfortunately the top layer is peeling off from the base. Has gone on for the better part of a year now so we're at the point where we have to toss them out as they've become a tripping hazard for us and a possible health hazard for our dog who tends to eat stuff off the floor. My advice, don't buy these.",

The second looks and feels far cheaper than its relatively inexpensive price tag, even though I paid more for it than I did for the better one a year ago. I expect it to fall apart quickly, if I keep it. 5 stars a year ago, 1 star today.",

This mat is a single molded piece of rubber, others have a slick/smooth cover attached. 100% disclosure though, I don't think it makes any difference in the performance. If you're on the fence about this one let me put your fears to rest. I would buy this again.",

So, if you have a standing desk, or a kitchen, or anywhere else you stand in one place, get one of the these. Your feet and knees will thank you. You might get a rug to go over top -- these will wear over time (they are basically a thick vinyl cover on foam) and a rug will mitigate that.",

Rolled them up and taped them, stuck it in the sun for hours, nothing works. It will slowly go back to rolled up edges within the hour and I will be tripping on it within minutes of that. I have come close to throwing this thing out the door more than once because of this. Amazon, if your listening, please fix this issue and maybe replace the ones that people have complained about.",
