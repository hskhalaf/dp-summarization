I am very impressed with the quality of the fabric and the ropes. I have mine attached to a ceiling joist in my house using hammock hooks. Just find the stud! There's something about inversions that create this positive energy and put you in the best mood! I am a yoga instructor and I plan on using this during private lessons for people with lower back tension. Love my yoga swing!",

After having been used by. 70lb year old girl for less than 1 year the \u201csturdy steel\u201d hooks wore so thin that one snapped while she was on it and she fell to the ground. Thank God she was not upside down at the time otherwise there would be more than the current bump and bruise. The other hook looks like it would snap any second if it were used again. What kind of steel can\u2019t withstand a child\u2019s weight!? Supposedly holds 550lbs??? I am beyond furious and would not recommend buying this. My daughter loves yoga and is devastated.

      "text": "It is well made and fun to use. One problem: the swing is connected to the carabiner (which hooks into the support strap) by a sturdy rope, however, you have to tie it into the carabiner with a knot and if the knot is not well done, it may slide out, which is what happened when I used it the first time. Thankfully I only ended on my butt (and only my pride was hurt). Maybe I am especially in-dextrous and \"knot-stupid\"but I will try some redneck engineering to make that connection safer, especially if I use the swing with my head down LOL.",

I use this trapeze several times a day and can tell you that it has worked wonders for my lower back pain. I feel absolutely great being able to get such a deep stretch on the trapeze.

Might be good for yoga moves but not for what I bought it for. Also I wish the handles were attached so they don't roll. Hard to hang onto if you dont have He-Man hands.

So, first off want to say kudos to the customer service, that is my main concern with anything. I don't care if the product/food is awful, great costumer service always makes for a better experience. However, I do love the swing!! Can get my yoga/strength on without always being on the ground, getting licked by my dogs",

My only very *minor*complaint was the carabiners, my husband replaced the with roco climbing grade carabiners which are made so the rope won't fray and they wont open up. It's a very minor thing but he felt it was important.",
