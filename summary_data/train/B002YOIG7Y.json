The Voyager series is a good fit in the inner ear and hangs on around the ear without feeling it's going to fall off better than anything I've seen. This is my second Voyager as the last broke after 3-4 years of frequent use. I like the Voyager Pro UC with the USB that can connect either to my PC or Smartphone...although the sound coming from the PC is not match for a true two-ear-piece stereo headset.",

In fact, the Pro plus is less money from Amazon and Price Pros is selling the older version. BEWARE!!! Without the plus it doesn't stream from your phone even though the manual and Plantronics website claims it does. After calling Plantronics and talking with a helpful lady in India, I find that the $124 was a waste. Hope that helps you. I know have ordered the Pro Plus model from another seller.",
