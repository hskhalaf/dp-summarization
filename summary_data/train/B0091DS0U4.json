The scent is very slight and very light-- after washing and drying the scent is not left on any of the items. The detergent is 4X concentrated so a little goes a long way. It does well for pre-treating stains as well. It's also hypoallergenic and cruelty-free which makes me love this product even more. This detergent is a bit pricey so the Amazon Mom/subscribe & save is a real cost savings.",
