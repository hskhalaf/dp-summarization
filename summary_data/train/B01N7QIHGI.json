I don't know what their regulations are, who is doing the checking and how often etc to confirm true standards. I'm hesitant to trust the US standards especially on large organic operations. If you are good with buying organic food from Kenya then this is a good price as there is another shop on amazon selling one bottle for $25. Like the other reviewers stated no returns !!!",
