It seems like a no-brainer. Instead of having to but Google Homes or Google Minis to every single room in my house, its great to just pick it up and take it to the room I am going to. I use it every morning, moving it to the bathroom so i can have music or listen to the new while im showering/shaving. And then bring it back to my bedroom as i get dressed.",

When you're playing music and unplug it there is zero interference or skipping heard. It's seamless. I think the speaker sounds even better than it did with the original fabric cover the home came with. Bravo to this company. We love it!",

I've had it running on battery power for a whole 8 hour work shift at medium volume and it was still at 2 bars before i plugged it back in. By the next day, the unit back back to fully charged. One think I don't like is that my fat fingers have a difficult time unplugging the OEM charging cable from the battery base. I feel as if I will eventually damage the cable over time because disconnecting the cable from the base sometimes bends the cable end into a not normal position, because my fat fingers dont have enough room to grab ahold of it completely.",
