I followed the instructions to a T, and I bought the correct chocolate. The melted chocolate would not stay warm in the fountain, and quickly turned into a chunky, hard, mess. I got this for an event, so I was very disappointed when it would not work. I brought it home and tried a few more times to get it to work, but no luck. Very disappointed, and now I have to buy a new one. Would like my money back:(",

This was an awesome fountain..you don't need to spend alot of money to get a good machine. This was a wonderful find! I made the chocolate mixture myself and was really pretty easy. The clean up factor was a little challenging for me since I have limitations however, I was done in less than 15 minutes. I rinsed the pieces free from chocolate and then loaded them in the dishwasher and they came out great! I highly reccomend it!",

The longer it ran the better the white chocolate flowed. The outside of the base was warm but not so hot you had to worry about your counter or touching it. Dis-assembly and clean up were easy. We ran it about 10 hours and had no issues at all. Holds alot of chocolate. Would work well for a party.",
