      "text": "My first Thermalon lasted several years before developing a leak (an excellent tim period) sending microbeads all over the inside of the microwave and floor.The next one lasted 3 days before microbeads spilled all over. Returned to Amazon for replacement. The replacement Thermalon was fine for a little over a month (Amazon Return Period) before leak appeared. Leakage began when microwave was set for 1.6 minutes. I don't know what has changed in the manufacturing process but obviously that is a problem with quality control. Probably my last Thermalon as cleaning up leaked microbeads is a pain.",

It is easy to use, microwaves fast for moist heat, and lasts a decent amount of time. I use it for stomach aches or when I need heat for pain relief from sore muscles. The pad is adaptable and will mold around your leg or knee just as easily as it can be used flat for your back or abdomen. My last one (the neck wrap) lasted for over 2 years with regular use before I needed a new one. Highly recommend!",

      "text": "I've had numerous heat pads for my low back pain and these are Great! I read other reviews and sympathized with some of the problems other people have had but it helps to know what other issues they've had. As for me, I put the pad in the microwave for 30 seconds and found the bottom heats a little more than the top so I flipped it over and did another 30 seconds. This was nice and warm but I gave it another 30 seconds and that seemed enough to give me some good heat. I like the design of the bag and the little time it takes to heat up. I plan on getting 1 or 2 more.",

We now have two of these. UPDATE: These get a funky odor that is tough to tolerate.",

I'm thinking I could even use the pocket to warm up socks before I put them on in the morning. The fact that it heats in such a short time is the best feature.
