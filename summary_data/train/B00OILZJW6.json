Also, it seems that 90 pages plus clear cover and back was really the practical maximum load for the 5/8 inch comb.",

The instructions are easy to understand and the machine works perfectly. I'm using the Fellowes presentation covers (52124). and the 1/4 inch plastic combs (52366). I prefer the clear front covers. You shouldn't expect the machine to come with all supplies. The back and front covers are easy to punch individually. The machine uses up to 5/8 inch combs which will hold 120 pages. This makes a very professional looking product. I'm sure for a H.S. student and nursing student this machine will get a work-out for essays etc.",
