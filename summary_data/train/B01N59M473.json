The light weight results from using lightweight plastics the are likely prone to wear and tear. But for the weight, we're more than happy with this for travel, especially if not for constant daily use! If you're using over a long period, more than occasional periodic use, might not last as long? Still a great buy for $10-15!",

Even came with a nice little case. We ordered the adaptor in red so we wouldn't leave it plugged in somewhere and forget it, and it was super easy to spot in the walls and in our luggage! 10/10 would recommend this. I'm honestly tempted to use it at my house, it is so convenient and nice!",

Everything charges appallingly fast. I also like the orange glow, which is nice on the eyes in a dark room (making it great for travel).
