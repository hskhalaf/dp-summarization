When they arrived, I was a bit disappointed. These just feel like playing all generic shoes. My previous under armours felt like I was walking on clouds and we're great for walking. I would probably not by under armours again actually this pair which is a shame because I assumed I had found my most comfortable shoes ever as of this time last year.",
