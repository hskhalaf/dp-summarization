While others are satisfied with the overall performance of the shoe, there are still a few who are disappointed, especially those who have issues with the fit. Overall, the Altra Torin IQ is a must-try shoe for road running.",
      "pros": [
        "A few users were impressed by the shoe\u2019s midfoot and forefoot cushioning, emphasizing that the responsiveness was clearly felt",
        "Several purchasers admired the informative statistics and real-time coaching delivered by the Altra IQ technology",
        "Some of the satisfied users mentioned the notable 360\u00b0 Reflective Upper which is very useful for night running",
        "The Altra Torin IQ is a lightweight road shoe, said some runners",
        "The shoe has a good-looking design, said a user",
        "The width profiles of both the men and women\u2019s versions were considered to be adherent to expectations",
        "According to several users, the toe box was roomy enough for toe relaxation"

        "A few consumers felt that the outsole lacks durability",
        "it has no high-abrasion rubber to protect the cushioning",
        "The forefoot section of this running shoe apparently creased quickly when subjected to the ordinary bending of the toes during toe-off, some people noted",
        "Some purchasers claimed that the sole unit emitted a squeaking sound that caused some awkwardness during either a run or a leisurely stroll"

      "text": "I have it for about 4 months now. It worked well for some time. The clues to adjust your running form are weak, so it's difficult to correct your form unless you keep looking at your phone / app. Finally, the left shoe started just showing that I have been always landing on my toes, which is not true. Even when I intentionally land on the heels, it still shows toe landing. I contacted support, and they offered a replacement (within warranty), but they discontinued the Torin IQ model and have no other smart shoes. Therefore, it means they'd be sending you a much cheaper replacement. Do not buy it.",

I\u2019m 65, have Very high arches, supinate a lot, haven\u2019t had proper shoes (zero drop, neutral, cushioned). Consequently, my feet have gone through some things, and, I can only wear zero drop, neutral, cushioned shoes. Altra Torin IQ are unquestionably one of the most comfortable shoes I\u2019ve ever worn. In my case, Altras were on the order of life changing in terms of foot health and mobility. I hope for more wider footbed Altra zero drop, neutral shoes and boots with moderate to high cushioning.",
