With it kept a fixed distance from my mouth, there is no modulation compared to using a desk mic, for example, or a shotgun mic. The stereo separation adds a nice touch to my digital recordings and the stereo from this mic sounds better than using the spread mics built in to the digital recorder.",

Now I don't have to worry about battery life and the bulk anymore! My Panasonic GH3's internal mic's are very poor to the point of being unusable, so an external mic is always necessary. The Sony mic just blows them away and sounds as good as the Rode for just about every use. This may be one the biggest steals in the industry. That's how good I think this little mic is. Well done, Sony!",

It is sensitive enough to actually capture and project your voice when clipped on your lav outdoors. I tried the more expensive Sennheiser and a handful of other higher priced models, but this thing worked way better than the others. I coupled this with a WinBridge WB001 Rechargeable Ultralight Portable Voice Amplifier unit and they performed beautifully on a beach where I spoke to about 100 people. Added just enough to allow my voice to project- the people in the back said that they hear me.",

I'm going to keep it because it will be one of those things that someone I know down the road might be able to use or I'll find a use for it but for plugging directly into a camcorder that does not have a powered mic port, it will not work. When I had it plugged into my computer the sound quality is pretty good it's even a little too sensitive in my opinion which is why I docked a star.",

CONS2: wouldn't work with Canon FS100 or R600 camcorders - I believe the camcorders don't supply the phantom mic power and this ECMCS3 needs phantom power to power its mic.

Useable cable length is a bit on the short side (around 37.5\" or 98 cm) so expect to wire it up to a longer 3.5mm extension (even if wired into a belt pack) if you're moving about a lot, accounting for body motion and some cable slack.",
