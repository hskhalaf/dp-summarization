There is a 1/4\" gap around the edge with no padding. As a result, it always feels like you are stepping on something. The arch support is similar in that is more just uncomfortable rather than supporting. This is not normal for Sketchers, as I usually like their shoes. The outside looked fine, but I am not one to wear a terribly uncomfortable shoe just for looks.",

The very back of the shoe (right behind the heel) is straight and tough, kind of digs into your heel a bit and makes the shoe a bit of a tighter because of it. If the back wasn't so stiff, It would have fit a lot better and not as tight as it did. Once you stretch it out a bit though, It isn't as bad but the first few days you wear these shoes, It'll suck.",

I've tried several deodorizer, nothing works! Original: I tried these on in a store then found them here for $20 cheaper, so I didn't have to guess about fitting correctly. These are super comfy and very cushiony (if you're into that sort of thing).",
