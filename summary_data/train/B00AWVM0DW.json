I type up a cheat sheet for her with all the names I programmed in the phone. Also very rugged phone too.",

Everything about it is so much better than any flip phone that sprint carries in their stores before they want you to get a smart phone because the monthly bill is higher so if they put really crappy flip phones out it you feel almost coerced into going that way. If you want to stick with flip phones, get your but on amazon and buy a gently used, like-new condition model that is \"out dated\" by the actual date of production but a darn good product. I got my girlfriend this phone for like $25 after shipped with no contract at all and she's been happy as a clam with it for 9 months so far.",

When I came back and checked the phone, I realized that it has this old style keyboard where you you have to press the same button three times or less to select each letter. I contacted the seller after 30 days, so they did not have to return the phone.However, the seller's response was very negative. They did not offer to work with me at all. Therefore, if you value texting, DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE.",

      "text": "I bought this phone for my mother in law. She needed something inexpensive, simple, basic, and visible. When she received it I helped her via phone to activate it with Sprint. It took a while, but we accomplished the activation. She says the phone is very sturdy and easy to use. She seems to enjoy her new phone. So, that makes me happy. I would definitely recommend it to others..",
