Normally the flap opens to an ice rink or similar snow scene to build each day and create a little scene. The other ones we bought (Harry Potter and LEGO city and Star Wars) still did this. The child that received this one just covered the flap with white felt in her own. Hope LEGO goes back to regular scene design next year.",

I did eventually find the correct figure after pulling out the entire box, but many of the figures have similar colored bricks so what was supposed to be in #1 wasn't easy to find. It isn't clear at this point if all of the packages are there, or if we are missing some. This is a big disappointment since it really ruins the advent calendar experience. We have bought these in the past and they were great.",

I got my son the regular Advent (not the friends one), and I like it better because it has more recognizable Christmas figures/ scenes. Overall pleased though, and my kids love them.",
