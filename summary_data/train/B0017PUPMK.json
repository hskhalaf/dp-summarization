Its a nice looking brush, I haven't had a bristle brush in probably 40 yrs, so it feels pretty good, the boar bristles are pretty stiff, a bit short, this would not be for thick hair, it works great on my very long thin hair and feels good on the scalp. I did buy the paddle brush thinking I could use this with a hair dryer, this brush does not lift the hair up to dry sadly. My intended use was for with a hair dryer, still keeping the brush for every day use, however next time I will buy the smaller oval hair brush.",

I have another boar bristle brush brought from Germany and more expensive, and the bristles on both brushes appear and feel the same. They did not melt when I was using my hair dryer. The brush does not give me any statics. I don't have a reason to suspect it is not a real boar bristle; but even if it isn't -- I don't care =)! This is the best-feeling brush ever.",

It's very gentle on hair, much better than yanking at knots with a hard plastic brush. I only use this on dry hair. The bristles are stiff and feel good on the scalp, and boar bristles help distribute oils from the scalp to the ends of your hair to keep it healthy. I take a little time to brush my hair with this brush every day and it makes my hair soft and shiny. Over time, it has also helped my hair grow. I highly recommend it!",

This is the most common issue people do not understand about Boar brushes. Overall, this brush is excellent and well worth the money.",

But I use my boar bristle brush every night to brush my hair and make it super soft. GREAT BUY!",
