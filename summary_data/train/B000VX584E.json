HOWEVER, after just my fourth day of wearing these boots one of the riveted eyelets on the left boot broke and came out of the leather hole, so now I have to take it to shoe repair to get fixed (hopefully). If they can't fix it reasonably I'm sending them back. A shame because these are very comfortable boots. I should not have to pay for a repair because of shoddy craftsmanship. I'll revise the review as this issue progresses.",

They're incredibly comfortable. I broke them in with one week of light wear before the trip and I never had any discomfort, pain, or blisters. I have high arches, but so far I haven't needed any extra support. I'll definitely purchase another pair when these wear out.",

I had 6 different surgeries total on both feet and my feet get fatigued fast. I decided i would take a chance on these. I took them out of the box , laced them up and wore them every ware ( work, hiking, hunting, Shopping, Driving) for a month. I have never been so happy over foot ware in my life. There was no brake in time. I was so happy that I bought a 2nd after the 30 days to save until I ware these out. 5 stare product for sure.",
