The Nordicware pan cookies were cracked and I needed a spatula which still left part of the cookie behind. Both are new, so I can't speak to the wear, but these pans were nonstick and a breeze to clean.",

I notice that people have mentioned warping; if you soak these in water it can get in the seam (rim) as it is 2 thins sheets of metal stuck together. If you clean them without allowing water to get inside the sheets they don't usually warp. Also if you don't put foil on them when cooking items with oil the tins will stain after a while however I don't always use it as I like the way the tray gets nice and hot and this helps brown my vegetables. Definitely recommend them.",

I always coat not only the inside bottom of the pans but also the sides and the rim of the pans. In addition, I also use parchment paper during all cooks. This may be overkill but it has kept the pans looking good. Just something you may want to consider doing.",

It has not discolored (darkened) as so many past pans have! It also washes nicely. These pans look brand new after 8 months. That's why I ordered more for a Christmas gift for my daughter in law.
