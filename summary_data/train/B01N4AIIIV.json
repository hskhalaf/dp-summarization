The eye protection and power saving eco functions are also of great value to me and they work impeccably. Whilst it represents good value it remains an expensive item but having used it now everyday for many weeks, I feel that cost fully justified.",

Screen burn in is an annoyance that when the background of the display is changed to grey when editing you can see the previous image burned in temporarily. Its not obvious in most scenarios but the times you do occasionally see it can be annoying. This is really nitpicking but all around great monitor would recommend.",

Pixel density is very high so text is crystal clear, but you might have to magnify some documents to see smaller text. Used four months so far with no problems. Multiple video and USB connections (in and out) are useful, and up/down/tilt adjustability make it easy to find a good working position. Overall good value for this price point.",

I customised the buttons on the hotkey puck to help with this, but there are only 3 on there, 4 would have been better.

You have to switch the keyboard and mouse via multiple button presses (I counted 6) within the OSD. To me, this completely defeats the point. Apparently the next gen puck (on newer monitor models) features combined switching. Doh!",
