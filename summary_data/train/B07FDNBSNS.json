However, after less than a month of use, the glass in the carafe is already badly stained. It is washed daily, but (even with soaking) the coffee stains won't go away.

It takes longer to brew than the Cuisinart, but the carafe slides in and out more easily onto the warming plate. A couple of things we don't like: the oversized \"Ninja\" logo screaming on the front of the appliance. Biggest complaint: The carafe stains easily and it's hard to get the stain off.",

Ninja does not sell replacement pots through Amazon like every other supplier. You can only get it through Ninja\u2014at a high price plus shipping cost.

What surprised me most was how handily, regardless of brew mode, it consistently delivered a smoother and richer blend of coffee than I ever achieved with the Bonavita. Another nice touch is that the water reservoir is detachable for easy filling and being programmable is also a nice to have. And lastly, it has a very nice aesthetic appeal to it that adds to my kitchen counter.",

I usually come back to find a cold pot of coffee before I am finished. Unless I am constantly going back to the coffee maker and turning it on again. I wish there was a way to configure the time before it automatically turns off because the default is way too short for me. I think it's only like 2 hours. It would probably be fine for people who just drink a few cups in the morning though. Other than that it is a great coffee maker.",

Nice deep long brewed flavor. Components don't look or feel cheap. Water tank is removable so you can actually clean it? What a noval idea. Cover on the carafe has a funnel.that protrudes the brewed coffee to the bottom of the carafe which improves flavor.",

We\u2019ve owned a lot of coffee makers in 35 years, primarily the cheaper Mr. Coffee type, and our kids have owned a number of the newer types. This makes the best coffee of any of them, just using ordinary Maxwell House and the \u201cclassic\u201d setting. The reservoir empties completely, and we then remove the cover and it is completely dry in an hour or so. This unit has far exceeded our expectations.",
