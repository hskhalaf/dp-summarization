My 24 yr old daughter was able to work it as well given a bit of practice. It's adequate, packs small and is easy to transport, but requires a drill and bit to set it up each time you move it (assuming you don't take the base log with you). Used it to split about 2 cords of wood over several days of effort. Replaced it with the only slightly more expensive SunJoe LJ10M which works much easier / quicker.",

I would recommend getting a rubber hammer or something that you can us for the few times that the splitter gets stuck in the log (it mostly happens where there is a branch hole or something else in the wood that causes the fibers to run a different direction).",

In this part of Florida you can purchase pre-cut wood that burns readily on your fire place. recently I purchased some wood thatwas cut too big and I smoked out my living room. Much to the dismay of my wife. Enter the smart splitter. It looks like nothing much, but the efficent way it goes through the wood is almost unbelieveable! In minutes I had split at least 4 logs. Follow the directions carefully and you'll be set. Great tool. Economic too!",
