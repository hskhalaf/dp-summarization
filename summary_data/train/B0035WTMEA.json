For not having an underwire I get such nice perky lift! And who's complaining about having pokey pointy boobs?? That's PERK girls and frankly I like a little shape when I'm wearing a sports bra don't you? And for not having an underwire this little guy packs a punch.

The fabric is kinda scratchy on the straps and band. The fabric over the breasts is comfortable and not scratchy. It's pretty breathable. I'm hoping the the scratchy fabric softens with washes. I got a 44c cup fits great but I think I may be a 42 since kissing some weight. So I'm not 100% sure if the band was bigger than expected or if I'm smaller than I expected.",

I started with two, now have four and they are my go-to for all but dressing up.",

It doesn't pinch anywhere and the back strap is wide enough it doesn't create any unsightly bulging for me. I am 5'6 and weigh 135 and wear a 36C. It has good support inside the cups and they way it is sewn creates lift and definition so your clothes fit better. I no longer feel \"blobby\" on top nor do I feel like I'm going to fall out of these like others that don't give enough coverage. I highly recommend any style in this brand.",

When it rolls up, it puts extra pressure on the ribcage area, which can feel uncomfortable. Other than that, this is a great bra!! Many thanks to this brand for catering to women with large cup sizes!!! Large cup sizes do not only stop at DD. It is very rare to find cup sizes in G, H, I, and up. This bra bits extremely comfortably!! Very minimal bounce, and no spillage from the top or the sides! I will definitely be ordering more! Thank you!!!",

No matter how you adjust the straps, it doesn't help. The area to adjust the bra straps is rather short, not giving much ability to make the straps shorter and provide support.

      "text": "A bra that fits my tiny band size and giant sacks of fat? One that will hold me in during inversions at yoga, unlike the VS one that allowed a severe case of accidental nudity? One that doesn't poke me in odd places, require a zipper, and or cost a fortune (in comparison)? One with straps actually wide enough to hold the girls up without pinching? Sign me up! The minute I got home from my first yoga class in this bra, I came to Amazon to order another. I'm writing this first, because it's that awesome. I have new-ish bras from VS, Brooks, and Curvy Kate. None fit as well or provide as much real support as this one.",

Well constructed, light weight, true to size bra gives me a confidence, control and good shape. I usually wear 36F, but because of wide side support, ordered 38F. It fits good on the first raw of hooks, which doesn\u2019t leave me an option in case i loose some weight, so my next bra will be back to my 36. The best part is a front mesh and for F ladies like me, who do yoga is a MUST.",

I originally purchased this bra in the 40D, but exchanged it for the 42D (40D was a bit tight around my rib cage) and it's a much more comfortable fit without sacrificing support. The support that these bras provide are wonderful and there is hardly any bounce, yet very comfortable to breathe---I don't feel like my boobs are pressed against my chest super hard. Comfortable enough to wear all day. Hope this is helpful!",

I put this on and went to my physical conditioning class and my jiggly puffs remained on lock down! It was very comfortable. Fot great, and again, the main thing...kept the puppies on a leash! I\u2019m happy I came across these, now I can workout without coming out looking like I attended a boxing class!",

      "text": "I really like this sport bra. Being large chested I feel like my clevage is always hanging out so I liked how it has the extra coverage over that area. That's the main reason why I purchased it. The materal is soft, I like that it's not a razor back and doesn't hurt my shoulders. My ONLY complaint is that I wish it was a little more restrictive. It has good support for being wireless but the \"girls\" so move around a lot when jogging or doing jumping jacks etc..that some of my other sports bra are better at. I still like the coverage and fit on this one, the price is great and would buy more in the future.",

      "text": "My wife uses this bra for yoga, cycling, and running. For the price, this garment is surprisingly supportive. You wouldn't want to wear it all day long, but for a 30-60 minute workout, it's perfect. Hand washing is easy, and the material dries quickly enough to be worn and washed daily. Support garments geared towards women with larger breasts are hard to find in stores at a fair price, but this bra fits the bill.",
