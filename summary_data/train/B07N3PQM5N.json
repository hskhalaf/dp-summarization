The HDR Optimizer allows you to perfectly dial in spectral detail so you don\u2019t have over blown bright scenes or overly dark shadows. If you have a projector this is the only player you should consider buying. It is a waste if money to by any other player. The only difference between the UB820 and the UB9000 is the 9000 has a dedicated power supply for the audio stage, it has upgraded DAC for stereo audio listening (not movies), and it has a metal case. So if you are not doing high end stereo listening there is no need for the 9000.",

The UB820 totally delivers when it comes to HDR, Dolby Vision, and amazing 4K visuals. Where things fall WAY short in 2019 standards is the user interface that hasn't noticeably changed since the 2007 model. The UI has gotten faster but is laughably basic by 2020 standards. I have an old (but amazing) Denon AVR so I use the analog output which is one solid reason to choose an option like this at this relatively high price. Analog audio works great and the DTS sound tracks are breathtaking. Due to the outdated user interface, you probably should look at other options.",

It basically has the power of the high end model with a less of quality build quality also a plus for me is that the Netflix app supports dolby atmos unlike most of Netflix apps in a smart TV which is where I typically watch Netflix thru, so if you like Netflix originals which alot are in Dolby atmos you love the app in this player.",

The Panasonic is not worth double the cost of the Sony by any measure. If there is one thing that the Panasonic UB820 beats the Sony, and not by much, is the picture quality on 4k blu rays. The tone mapping feature is noticable, but again not worth the extra cost.",
