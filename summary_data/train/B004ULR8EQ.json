Haven't tried to cut anything yet as it's just too cold in the barn. NOT happy.",

They were making table saws before ANYONE. Handles like a shop saw, not a portable. Solid, fence is good, just push away from you when you slide, it will keep it at 90.",

The saw dust discharge dosen't work well there isn't enough pitch for the saw dust to slide into the saw dust bage. I would love to return it but I'm past my 30 days. DON'T WAST YOUR MONEY!!!",

The saw DOES cut through 4x4's, though just barely, and the saw packs up nice and small so it's still an alright saw if you want something that wont take up your whole garage.",

An integrated laser guide allows for consistent accuracy\u2014the laser automatically realigns if the blade angle is beveled and never needs fine-tuning. Use an extended leg as a pull handle to effortlessly transport the saw on its built-in wheels from one job site to the next.\n\nBIGGEST DEPTH OF CUT AND MOST RIP CUT CAPACITY IN ITS CLASS\nUnlike other portable 10-inch table saws, Rockwell\u2019s RK7241 can cut through a 4-by-4 piece of lumber in one fell swoop. Its maximum cutting depth is 3-9/16 inches at 90 degrees and 2-9/16 inches at 45 degrees. And its rip cut capacity is best in class thanks to the 30-inch table to the right of the blade (with 11 inches to the left) that allows you to efficiently cut a 4-by-8 sheet of plywood in half. With 15 amps of power and a rated no-load speed of 4,800 RPM, the RK7241S is ideal for tackling large projects proficiently.\n\nLASER CUT LINE INDICATOR IMPROVES PRECISION\nRockwell\u2019s LaserGuide technology improves accuracy and consistency of cuts by providing a true cutline indicator that displays exactly where the blade will cut the material at hand. It\u2019s extremely useful for lining up cuts without needing to refer to the blade itself. Plus, when the blade is skewed for bevel cuts, the laser line automatically adjusts to the updated blade arrangement. \n\nTROLLEY STAND MAKES FOR EASY TRANSPORT\nThanks to the integrated wheels and the ability to use an extended leg as a pull handle, the RK7241S is easy to roll from the workshop to the job site to the garage and back again. And the included accessories\u2014rip fence, miter gauge, push stick, riving knife, dust bag, and blade wrenches\u2014are all stored on board so everything travels together. The saw and the stand are fully assembled immediately from the box, and the stand folds down in mere seconds, making for the ultimate in convenience while on the job.\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX\nOne Rockwell RK7241S table saw with laser, one rip fence, one miter gauge, one push stick, one riving knife, one dust bag, and two blade wrenches.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n * Best-in-class cutting depth\n * One-of-a-kind laser indicator adjusts to blade tilt\n * Folding fence for extra wide cuts\n * Fully assembled trolley stand for easy transport\n * Backed by a two-year limited warranty\n\nThe RK7241S can cut through a 4-by-4 piece of lumber in one smooth cut (view larger). \n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe new Rockwell Jobsite Table Saw is a powerful, rugged ,and capable jobsite saw by itself. Add the available attachments and it can produce results to rival stationary saws three times the price, like those used by cabinet and furniture makers. Rockwell has found a way to increase the depth of cut to 3-9/16-Inch. This is more than other saws, and allows the user to cut through a 4 by 4 post with just one pass. The unique laser cut line indicator shows the exact place the blade will cut the material, so cuts are more precise. Other features include a class leading 30-Inch of cut capacity, and a quick-folding stand and wheels for easy transportation from place to place. The Attachment program for the Table Saw consists of a Sliding Extension Table and a Finisher. The Sliding Extension Table fits onto the left side of the saw, and expands the cutting capacity of the saw to a huge 36-3/4-Inch. Crosscutting, mitering, and taper cutting large sheets becomes a breeze. The Finisher is a unique accessory, using rapidly rotating blades to plane and smooth materials up to 3-1/8-Inch thick. Add these two accessories to turn this powerful jobsite saw into a portable precision woodworking saw and finisher.\n\nSee more",
