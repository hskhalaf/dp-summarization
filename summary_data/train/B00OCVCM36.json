But for the price and considering the amount of trouble it would be to repackage them I will keep them in till I find something I like better. The lampshades are lovely though,and I just may reuse them when I replace these lamps. All in all I think these are nice lamps for a guestroom, but they look inexpensive and not suited for my master bedroom. I would not have purchased them if I had been able to see them in person prior to purchasing.",

So if that bugs you, don\u2019t buy these lamps. They\u2019re so beautiful I decided to \u201cget over\u201d the plastic parts and enjoy the sheer beauty of their asthetics.",

They were packaged so well that I was very grateful nothing was wrong with them because I never would have been able to re-package them to send them back. Color was true to the picture depicted on the site. Overall, felt this was a great purchase and would recommend them.",

We ordered the grey glass color which was a bit lighter than I had imagined it being, almost ghostly to look through, but it fits in well in just about room do to the neutral coloration. The shades have a very soothing color as well and are well proportioned. I would definitely recommend these lamps.",

Returning seemed like too much of a hassle since they are larger and had a ton of packing styrofoam custom fit to the lamps. Also the shades were wrapped but both have creases that cannot be smoothed and bother me a little. Still I love the size, color, and style of these beautiful blue lamps. Overall happy with the purchase.",
