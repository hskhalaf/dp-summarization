The cage itself seems pretty well made and fairly escape-proof. The 3-level ramp design make it difficult to reach your hamster, especially in the corners or on the top level as the door is rather small. This might be more suitable for a dwarf hamster, but even then you would still have to replace the wheel because it is TINY. This cage does not include a water bottle or food dish, so those will also have to be purchased separately.",
