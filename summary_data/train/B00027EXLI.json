Sure enough, the top speed worked but was very noisy, and the bottom two speeds were completely defective, with the fan not even moving. I resent being sold recycled garbage. Wouldn't you?",

I've rated it four stars because in smaller rooms this fan can be slightly noisy on high speed. Medium and low speed are quite acceptable.

We're quiet people who don't watch tv or play music in our bedroom, so this sound became kind of annoying to us. If you have a noisier environment you won't notice it at all. It's very low.

      "text": "I would categorize this more of a \"personal cooler.\" Even on the lowest setting it's likely to clear your desktop of any papers you may have lying there. It's also noisy (IMO)--not just the kind of sound you typically associate with a fan: mechanical noises such as rattling and additional noise--annoying to me--when it oscillates. One additional annoyance is the limited number of buttons for operation means repeatedly pressing a button to turn on/off and set the fan speed each time of operation; some sore of dedicated control for speed (setting retained when powered off) would be nice.",

The ability to twist the tower to cover a wider area is great. My husband doesn't miss his full-sized fan at all. We leave the fan running all of the time, and so far it's lasted three years! I was so jealous of his new fan, I bought one for myself! Cooler, happier nights for both of us!",

Doesn't bother me at all. Power light is a little bright so just put a small piece of tape over most of it. On low or medium, air dissipates within a few feet so doesn't bother my wife. Overall a great little fan.",
