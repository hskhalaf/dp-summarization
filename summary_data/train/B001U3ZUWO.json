      "text": "This SONY camera is so nice. Getting a little aged now with technology always improving but the shots are still just great. Not sure I need to buy any other camera since this does 99 percent of what I need. Love the versatility of shooting pictures from stills to panorama and movies. Selectable pixel density allows you to take tons of pictures for a SD card or fewer as your need dictates. Color and 20X zoom are terrific. Only extra I wish it had is a remote shutter switch to take time lapse photos.",

Unbelievable photos and so easy to use. The panorama shot comes out beautifully and the video is very tight. There is no lag time from when you push to take the photo and get the shot, something that has bothered me w/ other digital cameras. I can't recommend this camera enough. Very versatile, amazing zoom, light weight, for what you get and amazing photos.",

This camera can do it all. The sweep mode allows great panorama shots that are automatically stitched together in the camera. There are many modes to shoot in and I am still learning them. The twilight mode works quite well in low light and produces some interesting photos. I have had some unexplained shutdowns, but haven't had time to read the whole manual yet to figure out what is going on. It may be operator error.",

Anyway we are not professionals to use this feature in its way. Panorama feature is mind blowing. Video quality is commendable. If you have a extra lighting indoor shooting will be interesting. Focusing time is very very short. Sony kept its word. Almost all features worked well. I am still experimenting on it. As of now after using the camera for 3 weeks and taking more than 800 photos I am really impressed with it. I just switched over from Panasonic Lumix FZ8. I am not at all disappointed.",

The image quality is very good, also in very law light conditions, easy to use, light weight, feels good in hand. Of course there're always things that the brand could improve: minimum ISO is 125, in Manual setting there's only one button to set ISO, speed and f., you have to go to the menu to set in telefoto, and little other things that are to improve. In summary, a very very good camera for amateurs. I heartily recommend it.",

The Amazon advertisment stated that if you purchase this camera a 4Gb. memory stick duo will be included at no extra charge. There was no memory stick either installed in the camera or included as a separate item. I wrote to Amazon 2 weeks ago about this oversight but have not had the courtesy of a reply.",

The camera works great, the two manuals that come with it are straight forward for the best results with every shot. So many modes, tons of self preferences to get real quality pictures. The video is alright, expected a little bit more from it, but with the proper editing they should come out great",

Firstly, I had trouble understanding how to get the free card, because the instructions are pretty unclear. Amazon was nice enough and rushed me a free memory card, but it does not fit the camera. The free memory card is an SDHC card, while the required card is a Memory Stick Pro Duo flash memory card. Without the card, the camera has only 11mb of memory, so it only holds a few pix. Despite the fact that I haven't taken any pictures, the camera itself is of high quality and I'm eager to use it.",
