Where are my #3 needle and #3 air tip!!?. Also, the picture shows glass jars... and they cheapened the set yet again, by giving me plastic jars.

I had to order a separate #1 nozzle and needle set, so I ended up paying the same amount I would have spent for a new airbrush, instead of saving money buying this one \"used in good condition.

The description say \"used\" but it's more like the box has a rip or a bit of damage, unless you save the box save yourself 10 bucks! Can't say enough!",

    "description": "Number of Items:1The airbrush features a chrome plated body for durability. Included with the airbrush are all three available spray heads, which allow the H airbrush to be used in a wide range of application. The H single action allows the user to achieve fine lines down to 1/16-inch and wider patterns of up to 1-1/2-inch. The H is simple and easy to use and requires very little practice compared to double action models. The best uses are those requiring more basic spraying like solid coats, uniform lines or stencil work. Clean up is as simple as spraying your paint cleaner though the airbrush. The H is used for many applications including hobby, craft, chip and ding repair, taxidermy, ceramics, cake decorating, tanning, tattoos, etc. The H airbrush is made in the US and includes the following: H#3 airbrush, size 1 and 5 spray heads, 1/4-ounce metal cup, 1-ounce bottle assembly, 1-ounce storage bottle, hanger, wrench, 6-foot braided hose, lessons booklet and manual.",
