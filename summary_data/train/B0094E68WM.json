A power driver will help, but as the manual says only use the low torque setting. Although the wood is mdf, it has plastic inserts that the screws are driven into. This seems to be a better system than just driving screws into the wood. The rods are hollow, but they seem sturdy enough to me. Once assembled it's quite big, getting around doors at top/bottom of stairs is tricky. You might want to leave the legs off until it is in the room you want!",

The instructions were easy to follow and it only took about half an hour to put together by one person. You'll need to flip it over once you put it together, so that would require a second set of hands. Other than that, it can be built by one person.
