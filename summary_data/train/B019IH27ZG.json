We then relit started it and the entire grill caught on fire. Melted the entire drum base. When we reached out to Traeger we were told that we should have called customer service and not restarted it. Directions never stated to check every 45 minutes. They did absolutely nothing to help us except to offer new parts under warranty. What a waste! Worst grill ever, still to kettle grill! Save the money! Thank goodness Amazon has excellent customer service and allowed us to refund this to them! Traeger stinks!",

But I've had all the pellets in the hopper catch on fire twice , I've followed everything by the book clean it every use and it still seams to jam and the pellets start burning in the hopper and I use the brand name pellets . And every once in a while it will jump to 500 degrees on smoke and burn my meat .",

It sucks going out to throw some mop sauce on your piece of meat just to find that the temp inside the grill is around 100\u00b0F... So, after that, I go out every 30 minutes to make sure it hasn't gone out again, which it did 5 more times. And let me tell you, the relight process is a pain, and if you don't do it correctly, expect even more issues... Honestly, I'd avoid this product and spend a little extra and get yourself a better one... Very dissatisfied...",
