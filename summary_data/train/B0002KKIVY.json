After a huge plume of white smoke dissipated, and it ran perfectly! Starts on 1st pull---no surging. Just like new. Saved my big $$$$--I thought I either had to replace, or take it in to get fixed.",

Took out spark plug and sprayed a bunch of this int the hole and waited, and then waited some more. Put the plug back on and in one pull, voila! The snow blower ran like a champ. Please note that if you do this I found that initially the engine will spit out a large purplish-black cloud of frowns, but then clears up. I surmised it was this fluid being burned up.",

Used as directed (followed the video on the manufacturer's web site) in both the spark plug hole and the air intake. Produced a lot of white smoke, and also caused some dark fluid to leak from the muffler. This eventually cleared up. But alas, the engine is still surging so it did not fix the problem. So I would say this may be worth a shot depending on your situation, just didn't work for me.",
