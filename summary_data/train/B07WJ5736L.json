I wear a size 10.5D and have worn a number of Nike shoes...their shoes are quite comfortable...especially for traveling...with this shoe, I found myself unlacing them frequently while traveling...the shoe tongue (I think that's what it is called) hurts the top of my feet...I tried loosing the strings...quick tie button on strings (nice touch)...still felt pressure....for the price...I expected a bit more...I've only worn them once...maybe I need to break them in....but it's gong to be a painful endeavor...",
