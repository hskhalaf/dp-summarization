The keyboard cover is also super nice in that it's texture isn't too sticky and it just feels super nice. I also like that the package came with a screen protector, although I already have one on my screen, so now I have a bonus, haha. Overall a GREAT product, I am so satisfied!",

It even came with a screen protector which none of my previous cases came with. It fits perfectly on my MacBook unlike previous cases. Overall I give this product 5 stars. I absolutely love it!",
