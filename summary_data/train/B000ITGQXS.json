But I think this one might have come with some kind of defect, because there is no brightness, clarity is way less than the one before, and it looks like it is dying... I have even tried two brand new different kinds of batteries but no luck. Unfortunately, when I went to use it for the first time it was too late to return. But again, I think it might be that it came with a defect.",

It feels a bit cheaply made- like something somebody ordered in bulk from China -and never checked for quality. However, it was cheap and it works - so I give it 3 stars- The switch is not a button - its a slide. In the past those have broken. This is too knew- so I can't say yet- but again it feels cheap and I bet it will break within the year.",

      "text": "To echo others, great little LED light, especially the bang for your buck part. The LED light has a plastic convex lens on it making the light fan out in a circular pattern. Clip works good on a lot of different surfaces, has a little rubber pad to grip onto things, opens a max of 1.5 inches maybe. The light neck bends to whatever I please and stays in place. 3 AAA batteries are needed and not included. Can't say how long the batteries last, but so far has gone 2 book worth. Everything is plastic except for the neck (which is some sort of metal) as far as I can tell.",

The light is a bit on the bright side, so I find I need to keep adjusting the neck to keep the light from being too bright and waking up my husband. With a hardback, it stays just fine. With a paperback, I have to use the back cover and a number of the pages to keep the light clipped on. Overall, it functions well and I'd recommend it.",

I find the button battery styles go dead more quickly and they are more expensive than the AAA sized batteries this takes, and the light lasts much longer with the LED used in it. It's base is slightly bigger (not much) and a little heavier but not too much, than button style battery models, but that's fine for how much less the batteries cost and the length of time the light lasts on the 3 AAA batteries.",

The light is bright enough for easy reading without being obnoxious. Easy to turn on and off and the goose-neck flexibility is easy to adjust and stays put.",

The light from this fulcrum light is harsh, but usually adequate. Sometimes it doesn't cover the entire page, so part of it is in shadow. It is a bit heavy, but workable. I am worried that it will start to \"blink\" as it ages, as some customers have complained about but so far--so good. I wish I had ordered the \"Mighty Bright\" instead and will do that next time, as this appears cheaply engineered.",

I said to myself: \"How could I have reading without this thing?\" It runs on 3 AAA batteries, and can clip very large amounts (or small) pages to hang on to the book. The flexible neck allows you to minutely adjust it to just about any angle without falling over - that is, it'll stay in place while you read, and yet will freely move without much effort.
