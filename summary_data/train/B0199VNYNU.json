I just wish he wouldn't meow at me so much whenever I eat these. I think he really likes that I am taking care of my teeth because he never leaves my side from the moment I open the container until I finish eating the last bite. Highly recommend.",

She has her neck back and her teeth look great. The treats are crunchy and she has to really crunch on them a couple of times before she done, so they really do work on the teeth. Don't overfeed.

Unfortunately sometimes my cats swallow these hole which defeats the purpose of giving them these treats for good oral hygiene. I've informed the cats that if they continue to do that that they will need to brush their own teeth, but they just look at me with a blank stare.",
