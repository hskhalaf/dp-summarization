Its sturdiness and smearing performance also receives outstanding remarks from buyers and professional reviewers alike.\u00a0On the other hand, the shoe\u2019s flexibility is seen as a detriment by those who have used it for edging. All in all, the Scarpa Crux still offers a set of advantages that users may find handy for trail adventures, scrambling, and easy climbs.",

    "description": "Scarpa Crux Approach Shoes The ideal approach shoe should be tough, well protected and provide enough support for easy climbing but comfy enough for the approach walk. The Crux takes technologies that have been developed in our trekking and climbing range and combines them together to give a hybrid that has all of the characteristics required to be a top approach shoe. Suede Upper Toughness and quality is in abundance with the suede upper. Your feet will remain protected courtesy of the rubber toe and heel rand which are particularly useful when walking or hiking on difficult terrain where debris, rocks, and obstacles may cause problems. Having a durable upper will allow for better performance and comfort for climbing. The suede is also 1.8mm water resistant. Microporous EVA Midsole Ensure maximum support and comfort with the Microporous EVA Midsole that helps to cradle your foot. The midfoot cradle system will fill you with confidence and provide support to areas when needed, especially on the arduous terrain associated with hiking and climbing. Vibram Vertical Approach Outsole The Vibram Vertical Approach Outsole simultaneously climbs more effectively and also provides better traction for descending loose terrain. This is important to climbing as it presents the wearer with a shoe they can rely on for optimal grip and traction on varying terrain.",
