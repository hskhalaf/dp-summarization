I try to get at least 15-30mins a day on my bag and I can tell these won\u2019t last long so if you\u2019re planning on doing serious training for a longer period of time do not buy these. They are poorly stitched I give them another month before they start falling apart I\u2019ve already started looking into other brands.

Anyway, they're great training gloves. Not too heavy, but weighty enough to get a great workout in and fatigue your arms. Aside from a loose thread here or there that was easily snipped off and doesn't impact the structural integrity of the gloves, they show no wear and tear.",

The only drawback is that they could use a bit more wrist support at the sides of the wrist. That\u2019s the only reason I knocked off 1 star.

The faux leather synthetic material is surprisingly tough and could probably be easily sanitized with a spray. These are extremely high quality and sewn well with appropiate materials.",

The mesh system allows for the gloves to dry more easily and quickly than non-mesh gloves.

My only other comment is that they could use a little tab or pull or something on the Velcro wrist flaps; once you have one glove on it's nigh impossible to grip the edge of the wrist flap to secure the other glove.

      "text": "I recently bought this product in an attempt to start a pro boxing career. It felt right when I put it on and tested it out on my little brother. I instantly KO'd him and have never felt that type of power before. One afternoon I was walking out of my Zumba Fitness class when I stumbled upon an in-progress robbery. I knew with great power comes great responsibility so once I tightened the Velcro strap that robber was in trouble. I got shot and the gloves were stripped from my possession. 5/5 Stars",

A wide wraparound Velcro strap is easy to adjust and provides a secure and comfortable fit.\n\n About Everlast\nThe name Everlast is synonymous with boxing. Renown internationally as a manufacturer of boxing equipment, Everlast started out as a swimwear manufacturer in 1910. Headquartered in the Bronx, NY, the company was founded by 17-year-old Jacob Golomb. The son of a tailor and an avid swimmer, Jacob Golomb was dissatisfied with the durability of swimsuits because they barely lasted a season, so he began making suits that he guaranteed would last for a full year. He proudly gave them the name, Everlast. Although the swimsuits did not last through the years, the name did.\n\n Over the next years, Golomb expanded his company into a small retail store that carried a full line of sports equipment. In 1917, a young fighter named Jack Dempsey introduced boxing to Golomb and Everlast. Dempsey asked Golomb to construct protective headgear that would last more than 15 rounds of intensive boxing training. Golomb specially designed the training gear for Dempsey. In 1919, Dempsey won the world\u2019s heavyweight championship wearing boxing gloves made for him by Golomb. Everlast became the headquarters for boxing equipment throughout the world. In 1925, Golomb designed elastic-waist trunks to replace the leather-belted trunks then worn by boxers. These trunks, now known as boxer trunks, immediately became famous. Jacob Golomb ran the business until he passed away in the early 1950\u2019s and his son, Dan, took over. In 1958, Ben Nadorf joined Everlast and purchased 50% of the company from the Golomb family. When Dan Golomb passed away in 1995, Nadorf purchased the family\u2019s remaining 50% interest. Nadorf remained the President and Principle Share Holder of Everlast until October 24, 2000.\n\n Everlast men\u2019s and women\u2019s apparel and accessories continue today to be tremendously successful both inside and outside the ring. In addition, Everlast boxing trunks and equipment remain the proud and undefeated champion of the boxing industry for more than 90 years. The history continues, as the name states. Everlast has a traditional past and a knockout future.\n\n What\u2019s in the Box?\nOne pair of training gloves\n\n Manufacturer Warranty\n1 year",
