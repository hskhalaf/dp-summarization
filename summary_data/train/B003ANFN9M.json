My fur kid loves his Pup-Peroni and will pretend to need to go out then run to his treat jar. It's difficult not to reward his little con act, but he usually wins, unless it's a .midnight snack. It must be really great and he would rate it excellent. These are thicker than those I usually purchase and it's great because I can break them up.",
