      "text": "I had the lever type binders but did not really like them. I purchased these and they work great. They do seem to be a little shorter than others I have seen, but the others were for bigger chain, so I don't know if that made a difference. I am using these with 5/16 inch chain and they work great. You can get your tension adjustments just like you want it with no effort. I will not go back to the lever type binders after using these. They are so much easier to get the exact tension.",

These were the smaller ones, I bought the larger ones first and then the smaller ones for smaller jobs. They make the job easier.",
