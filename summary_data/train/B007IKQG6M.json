The fulfillment center sent me a pair of comically cheap Prada sunglasses. These were obvious knock-offs. 2.) The second pair that arrived appeared to be Persol, but I'm highly skeptical of their authenticity. The frames feel flimsy and the retailer has no online presence. Please save yourself the time and hassle. Do not order these.",
