However, the size is a little weird. Too big to be just for your face, but not quite the right size or shape to comfortably be used for body in my opinion. The elastic on the back stretches way out if you put your hand in it, and slips right off. So you have to hold it very awkwardly so that it doesn\u2019t go flying.",
