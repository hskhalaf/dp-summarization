After that they start doing a crack and pop sound, you can reset them but after a while they eventually just stop working all together. SO MY ADVICE...LOOK ELSEWHERE!!! This is a known issue but Logitech will do NOTHING about it so just do NOT buy these UPDATE: Logitech will NOT warranty these ..period. Do not try to if you are having the reset loop issue. These speakers are LEMONS and Logitech knows it.",

Looking at the reviews, people are reporting multiple replacements that continue to fail, coupled with lengthy turn around time. At this point, I can only conclude that build quality is a systemic problem with Logitech. Whether they are cutting the corners in the design, or the manufacturer is using marginal parts, is immaterial at this point, as they've lost their reputation with me.",

Sub is an 8\" where the Z-5500 was a 10\" but the bass still fills my room quite nicely. Pretty happy with this purchase. For the quality of this system, it has no equal in it's price range.

I've spent much more and got much less. Very happy!",

I will add that we had to adjust some levels for the subwoofer, satellite and center speakers during the movie but once we found the right levels, it was a great ride! For those that asked in the questions, you can adjust volume levels for the center, subwoofer, and rear channels individually or as a group.",

(Using Optical Cables) When the song stops the system is perfectly quiet. So I can listen at very low volume levels without any distortion or noise. Full support for digital surround protocols, including Dolby and DTS The surround decoder does a really nice up-conversion from Stereo sources up to to 7.1 surround, so even basic stereo music sounds amazing.",

Aside from that it has plenty of power and sounds good, but very bass heavy, the subwoofer could use an independent volume control on the speaker itself. If you don't use the optical hookup you can adjust the subwoofer with the equalizer; there may be something I'm missing. I will update the review as I play with it... It's not my Klipsch system but fine for my office computer... It was an easy setup, could use more informative instructions.",
