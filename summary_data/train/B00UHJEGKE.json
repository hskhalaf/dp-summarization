I received two packages. Both have pieces so tiny that they look like the crumbs left over from the larger packages. AND YOU CANNOT RETURN THEM. What a disappointment in for us and our dog! Again, the original sized Plato Duck Treats are awesome - USA made product. Small Bites are ridiculously small - smaller than the dog food we feed him.",

As far as I can tell these are super healthy and very tasty to the pups. They are kind of like a meat floss so they tend to fall apart in my treat bag. But I just squeeze them back together with my finger tips. Also, when I toss them on the ground (as a reward or distraction) the dogs find them easily and they don't roll away like some other treats. Highly recommend all flavors.",

I usually just wait till the bag is empty and put the crumbs and dust on their dinner!",
