      "text": "This is the best MCT oil product I have used. It has no grit, no residue, no real flavor. It blends beautifully with coffee and tea. I love it, it can be blended hot or cold and doesn't require a blender or any thing but makes an awesome foam if you do that makes the beverage feel fancy. It also mixes great in cold beverages with no residue. It makes it look creamy but doesn't add much to it. It's also easy to digest.",

BUT the container was a little more than half full upon arrival. I understand about settling but this is a powder that shouldn't have this issue. It's such a waste of plastic - something we don't need. Put it in a smaller container or add more product, please! Great product, poor packaging!",

I can honestly say that this is the ABSOLUTE best MCT Oil Powder that I have tried. One scoop in my coffee gives it a lovely creamy look and taste. There is ABSOLUTELY no grit, not even at the bottom of the cup and not around the sides when my cup is empty. It dissolves completely. I have shoved my other brands to the top of the pantry to be used for cooking. I have 2 words for anyone on the fence - BUY IT !!",
