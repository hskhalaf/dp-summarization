Its supportive yet comfortable assembly did not fail to amaze consumers. The Shoc Pad technology surely performed as expected, too. However, others were disgruntled with the latest upgrade as they felt that the previous versions were much more efficient. All things considered, the Teva Terra Fi 4 is a hiking sandal still worth giving a shot bearing in mind its accomplishments in different aspects.",
      "pros": [
        "This multi-sport sandal was very comfortable, as testified by the majority",

        "The overall support was liked by a lot of wearers",
        "A significant number of Terra Fi 4 purchasers mentioned that it could be worn as their daily footgear",
        "The sandals were able to perform well in and overcome wet conditions, based on a couple of consumer reviews",
        "Its sturdiness won the hearts of many",
        "Numerous Teva stalwarts appreciated the arch support they got from the pair",
        "A high percentage of wearers liked how cushy the sandal was",

Unfortunately the strap on the back of the left sandal I bought recently here (Amazon) has come un stitched after a week just by me merely adjusting the velcro strap. Poor workmanship perhaps 'seconds' If you're not in a hurry for an upcoming holiday/trip then they're worth buying and sending back if u have issues but I just do not have the time to wait for returns process so will glue and hope for the best. Not the standard for Teva i had come to love. Be warned.",

Upon investigating further the stitching could be seen, but was not attached to its mating part. As we were going on holiday in a couple of days, the option on returning these sandals was not viable due to the replacement timescale and we reluctantly accepted the sandals and repaired them ourselves. A review of the quality control needs to be urgently looked at.",

      "text": "My experience of trekking sandals is that I need one size bigger than normal so I don't catch my toes on rocks, brambles etc. That's what I ordered and that's what I got, same as on my last pair of Teva which lasted many years. UPDATE June 2016 After wearing the sandals for just a couple of weeks, the neoprene padding on the ankle strap has torn and broken. It's actually a design fault as the plastic strap holder cuts into the neoprene. I now see other purchasers have had several replacements. However, the Amazon returns system sends me round in circles as this is now several months 'old', and there is no contacting the seller Millet Sports. Avoid!",

    "description": "A three-point strap adjustment and open toe box enable the wearer to slide into the Teva Terra FI 4 Walking Sandals with considerable ease; the aforementioned open toe element also prevents water from pooling toward the front of the sandal should it become exposed to wetter terrain. A nylon shank keeps the foot stable and well supported, whilst a rugged, Spider Original Rubber outsole yields a tremendous amount of grip, even in wetter environments. The sandal has been finished with a Microban zinc-based anti-microbial treatment that inhibits the spread of odour carrying bacteria.",
