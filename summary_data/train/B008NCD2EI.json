The center speaker is much larger than I anticipated. Also the bottom of the speaker is rounded and you are given to rubber stabilizing pads so it doesn't move. I wish they would have just made the bottom flat. The extra space from the pads is nearly too much to fit it where I needed to. Still love it!",

I didn\u2019t realize how big it was and kinda worried it won\u2019t fit my current set up logistically but I managed to make it work. Definitely check these out. Pairs nicely with my B&Ws.

With the pioneer, it was necessary to turn my center channel up to over 75% of power while the rest of the channels were at around 25%. With the polk t30 I had to turn it down quite a lot. I think between the two the polk has by far higher quality sound at about the same price point. With that said, for the money the Pioneer performs well enough.",

I was searching for a center channel speaker and began reading reviews on this budget speaker. Let me say this, I am not an audiophile but I enjoy great sound. I do think this speaker can stand up to its own against speakers that are double or even triple in price. I can't think of any downside to this speaker as it was less than $100 when ordered.",
