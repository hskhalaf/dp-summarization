I still continue to wear the comeni support sock regularly as my foot just needs the compression to prevent further irritation. I highly recommend giving these a try.

I ordered a medium (7-7.5 in womens) after referring to the size chart, but should've have gone with a small which would've better length for my foot. The compression may have been improved in a smaller sock as well! Treat My Feet is s far better product! Try ZATECH a slight compression and support for walking and running.",
