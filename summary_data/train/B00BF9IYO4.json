You do have to blow up the pillow separately, which requires 7-8 good blows. I ended up letting some of the air back out though because I don't like such a \"firm\" pillow. Leaving it slightly deflated makes for a \"softer\" pillow so to speak.",

I must say however, I love the pad and it supports my 205 lb body quite well. Please fix the valve!",
