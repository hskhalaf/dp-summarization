I previously bought chisels with western-sounding names, only to find they were made in China with very cheap wood handles and poor workmanship. I have since tossed them out. These Narex chisels represent old-world craftsmanship, and with proper care & wooden mallet, will allow you to cut mortises, dovetails and joints on larger pieces of wood nicely. They are suitable for professionals, serious DIYers and woodworkers. I would not hesitate to recommend them for anyone who works with wood.",

These chisels are so much better than what I\u2019d been using. They\u2019re light, which makes them easier to work with, and they are just the right size. They didn\u2019t arrive ready to use, but I easily had them sharp within a few minutes. I wish they stayed sharper longer, but keeping a strop at the bench has really helped limit the number of times I have to take these to an actual stone. Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with these chisels and am so glad I took the plunge.",

I used them to cut a 2 inch mortise all the way through a 3.5\" thick piece of douglas fir. This is pretty soft wood, so it was fairly easy. I also bought a piece of glass and some 1200 and 2000 grit sandpaper and sharpened these a little part way through that mortise. I could tell a difference after sharpening. They handles seem very strong and the steel is thick enough that it doesn't seem like it will bend. Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase.",

On all 4 chiscels the Blade is slightly concaved towards the centerline what makes flattening/sanding quicker when initializing. Sharpened at 25degrees angle and ready to go. Didn\u2019t serious work with them yet besides some testing. Steel according to specs is Rockwell C 59 which should do. Will find out how edge is hold up. Bottom line good chisels for the money.",

Make sure you get a water stone and learn how to keep them sharp. I sharpen them every time I use them.
