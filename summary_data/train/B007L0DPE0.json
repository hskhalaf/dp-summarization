I was going to buy the comparable Walmart product (which usually I am 100 percent happy with), but this is one of the rare cases where the store-brand products, though seemingly the same, don't have nearly the same strength of the nutrients. Normally I hate raspberry flavor, but whatever flavors these are is acceptable for me. It's my daily treat for myself.",

      "text": "I LOVE the flavor of these gummies! It's tempting not to eat a whole bunch of them! In regards to the vitamins and their absorbancy, I believe they do really help me and my health. Whenever I would get my blood checked while taking these vitamins, all my results came back good and my doctor would state that I'm getting the proper amount of vitamins and nutrients for my body. I eat 2 gummies every morning and they are great! Would really recommend these to others, especially those that dislike swallowing vitamin pills or any vitamins that have unpleasant tastes.",
