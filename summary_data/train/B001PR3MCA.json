I would have liked the back support to be better. And if your valves are not lined up with the hole in the fabric, the edge will put pressure on the valve and it will leak air. Have to mess with bladder alignment. I've used pontoons for years, I will be buying two more of these to replace my fleet of pontoons.",

It worked up to my expectations, easy in and out, comfortable and well set up. Looks to be well constructed and with care expect it to last for a long time.",

      "text": "I have an inner tube based float tube and just received the Cumberland. After using it on an area lake I am extremely happy with my purchase. The pontoon floats coupled with the floating seat kept me high and dry out of the water. The adjustable seat back kept my back supported and I had no aches after fishing for about 3 hours. WBA -- Would Buy Again!",

      "text": "I received my new float tube on time and as promised and have really enjoyed using since. Taken it on a couple camping / fishing trips in the last month. It's easy to inflate. ( I use a battery operated pump) Love the storage. I only wish it had a rod holder built in ( one to hold the rod while fishing) It does come with holders to carry your poles but not while fishing. It's easy to manuvere in the water and so far I am very happy with my purchase.",

After correctly aligning the threads it held air fine. It is alarming that this float could have came from the factory the way!",
