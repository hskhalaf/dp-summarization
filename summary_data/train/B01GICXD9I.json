I highly recommend this product and received NO discounts or anything free so this review is from the heart (and back and hip and shoulder and head :).

It also led me to believe that this item was actually used and my fears were solidified when unfolding it there was a gash in the topper. The gash is no longer visible being it has expanded. I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably 2\u201d. It doesn\u2019t actually keep us cool and my toddler sweats even more so when he sleeps on it. Comfortable enough but with the headaches of dealing with this order, I wouldn\u2019t buy had I known.",

Came in a surprisingly small, light-weight box, and I followed the included instructions upon opening. It fluffed up immediately, no odor at all. I let it sit out for a few hours, then used it that night. It is *wonderful*. It doesn't move out of place, but I also bought a breathable mattress cover thingy just in case. I sleep so much better that I wake myself up giggling instead of stiff & cranky.",

When I opened the box and unwrapped the topper it looked just like the picture on Amazon and seemed to be at full size. I laid it on the bed and left it for 24 hours to let it expand and air out. There was no noticeable odor! The topper feels great and makes even a firm mattress more comfortable. It helps to relieve pressure on hips and other sensitive body parts while providing support for my back and upper body. I can get a good nights sleep w/o the expense of a new mattress! I love it!",

It also didn't slip and slide over the mattress which was very nice when making up the bed. The 2\" thickness was perfect since it still allowed us access to our storage cupboards. It was also pretty easy to transport. Just rolled it up, tied it with a rope and not heavy to lift and transport.",

Just please be aware of the humidity factor. Other than that, it's a very comfy and comforting topper!",
