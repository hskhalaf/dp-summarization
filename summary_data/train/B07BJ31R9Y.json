The battery doesn't last as long as advertised (only avg of 17 miles) nor charge as fast (takes at least 8 hours). Their bike service does not service my area, so they aren't able to assist me in a major metro area where I live. This is something I was told I could use. When I contacted customer service, I had to contact them 3x before I heard anything back. The issues are still not addressed or solved.",

I had researched several e-bikes online, as well as test drove different models at local bike shops (ranging in price from $1500 to $4500) and after much deliberation decided on Elby. The ebikes I actually test drove were priced between $3500 and $4500 (YIKES). In comparison, Elby's in another league for overall quality, heavy-duty frame, high end, modern design and attention to detail. If Elby was a car, she'd be a Volvo.",

Used quite a bit of assistance at times, including the throttle. Still had 73% and 74% battery when we got home.
