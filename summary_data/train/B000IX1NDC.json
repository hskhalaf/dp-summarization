      "text": "I bought this before I realized that all 360 gamepads work with windows games. Yeah, I know. Anyway, this is my primary gamepad for use with a pc. It works great with any new or reasonably new game that supports gamepads. Older games, as with any 360 controller, may need remapping programs. I don't really use the cooling fan, but it has two settings and works great. Overall, has a good solid feel and is responsive. I've never had any problems with it.",

      "text": "I was skeptical at first when I bought this. Let's face it the fan is just a bonus but I didn't want it to ruin the controller it self. But both the fan and controller are great! the fan gives a nice cool flow of air and the controller itself works great. The buttons themselves are good. One of the buttons did get stuck temporarily when I was bashing it a lot (and i mean a LOT). But it was easily remedied when I just pressed it slow and nudged it. I recommend this product highly because it does the job it is supposed to and gives you a little more (the fan) for free!",
