I didn't find them exceptionally warm, I will still wear heavy socks with them. I went to No***troms first and tried them on before ordering on Amazon. My normal size is 8 1/2, the 9 fit comfortably. Good boots, they look like they will last a few seasons.",

      "text": "I tried on my standard size (6) in a different style and they were huge. So I ordered a full size down and the footbed fits perfect with a thinner pair of smartwool right out of the box. But I don\u2019t have a skinny foot and the rubber to leather seam is tight on one foot. I\u2019m counting on them to stretch, but ideally I\u2019d say order half of a size down if you have a smaller foot. If you want to wear chunky socks, order your real size, though these are lined. They are seriously so plush and cooshy. They will definitely keep my feet warm in our soggy, cold winters.",

They have a black pattern in the back along the calf which could have been any other color to look a bit more \"femmy\" - this is my only disappointment.",

It didn't but the seller should have been much more careful in packaging. I love the shoes and wear them a lot. I am in a job that requires me to be outdoors and hiking through mud and rain. These are perfect for that.",
