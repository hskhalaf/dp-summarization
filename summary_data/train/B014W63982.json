Pay the extra money for installing or have a plumber do it if not well ya might have to replace the flooring (I really should have had it installed but I learned the hard way lol make sure you by the universal kit as well for the hoses might not line up exactly BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY!!!",

That was this dishwasher. it was so self-evidently poorly made, and now, 85 days after we bought it-- it's broken because a piece cracked off of the housing, the door has come loose and other absolute nonsense. I can't wait to get this piece of crap out of our house. What a waste of money.",

I like that because kids can't even see where the buttons are when they visit. I almost always use the auto sensor to wash dishes. So far I have only pre washed things with larger pieces of food and I have not had to rewash anything yet. I would definitely buy this item again, but I would order the universal dishwasher install kit because we had to get a hose to reach the sink drain.",
