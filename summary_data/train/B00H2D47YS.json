      "text": "These are handy little strainers, and will be helpful in the kitchen. I would give them 5 stars, except they are shipped \"loose\" (or at least that's how they were shipped in my order). Somebody packed them in a carton with two 6-packs of 1-liter bottle water (heavy product), and no packing material. One of the handles broke off in shipping. It was easy to repair, however, with a mini torch. Despite the screens being crushed out of shape in transit, the rims were intact, and the screens were easy to push back into shape and appear unharmed. If you need/want small strainers, these are good ones.",
