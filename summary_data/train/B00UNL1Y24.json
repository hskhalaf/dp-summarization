I use this to speedrun Mario 64 through my Denon receiver. Gotta leave it on Auto. Pretty good device. Has a nice weight to it. Just hope it lives long.",

So i bought this splitter and connected my the output of my 3D Bluray player as input to this splitter and one of the output from the splitter connected to my 3D projector and the other output connected to receiver. I could able to view 3D movies and hear the perfect HD audio by using this device.(otherwise i need to buy a 3D compatible receiver in order to passthrough the 3D content to my projector rather this splitter did the job simply saving my money) Really i love it!!!",
