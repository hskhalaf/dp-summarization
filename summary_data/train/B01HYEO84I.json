I need them for practice and there\u2019s no gold available, so I bought these. The only issues, and the reason for 4 stars... They are good for young kids. I coach youth soccer (kg-1st grade) and the big kickers can be tough on them. The other thing, the string on the ground can trip up very young kids, but that\u2019s not very worrisome. All in all, I\u2019m happy with them and would recommend to a friend.",

They are easy to store once you get them set up. Set up can be tricky and likely requires 2 people!-this was my original review...' After having this set for less than a month, the pieces that hold the net together completely broke in half on both nets. This is obviously a cheap set and very cheaply made. Would recommend getting a better quality net instead of wasting money on this one.",
