Adding any counterweight will exceed the maximum payload. Zhiyun's customer service just told me, iPhone XS Max is not supported. Pity for me that I just learnt this after my return window :-(",

I'm disabled, walk in a brace and have a limp, so keep that in mind when you see the video. I tried to make it as bumpy and jerky as I could. My arms and hands shake and have tremors and this really does a great job at getting rid of that.",

Overall, not having the ability to film in 4k with the app is ridiculous. The company keeps saying they're working on a deal with Samsung to allow 4k on their app but it's been several months since the release and no progress towards an improved app.",

It's easy to use, for beginners like myself, because of the control panel. The handwheel (very helpful) on the side can be use with zoom or focus. I don't have any bad thing(s) to say about this gimbal. However, my biggest concern is the app itself, since I'm an android user (LG G4). I'm not sure if the android app works well for other android users but hopefully they can fix the bug(s).",

However, no one mentioned that after an update that happened a while ago, it stopped working. I can confirm that as of August 15th, 2020 it still isn't working :(",
