I had bought an egg cooker which I was not so happy with (it didn\u2019t even come with instructions) not until a friend introduced me to this particular one by EGGY YO egglettes cookers set. Now I don\u2019t have to think about the stress of peeling eggs, most importantly my eggs come out perfectly hard-boiled. I always use the brush that came with them to spread olive oil in the egg containers and then cracked the egg in it, once boiled my eggs comes out freely and easily with no breakage... I\u2019d recommend you try this silicone hard-boiled egg cooker and thank me later!",

Well, it does an ok job, but in all the times I've used it, the eggs do not just pop right out without leaving some of the white in the cup. I've super coated the cup in oil until the egg itself is oily, and still, they don't just pop out. I'll keep it cause I don't care what my eggs look like cause I just like eating hard boiled eggs, but I'm not super impressed.",

This set of egg cookers was the answer to my search. I discovered the instructions are fun and easy to follow. I was able to add my own veggies, meat and spices to these egg cookers that allowed me to create something that blows away those Starbucks souve eggs. When I was finished cooking my eggs, I threw these bad boys in the dishwasher and they cleaned up very well. They are simple to hand wash as well.",

Since the eggs you buy at the store are from chickens that are not fed enough of the right vitamin so the shells come off easier. (My sister raised chickens that is why I have this useless info. Her eggs peeled perfect & easily!) We experimented with the silicone brush and oil, not so good, we are going to try spray oil (similar to Pam Spray) and see if that works better.",
