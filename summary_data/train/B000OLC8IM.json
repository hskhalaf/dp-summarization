Amazon packed this screen carefully arrived safe and sound no dents not misshapen . PERFECT!!!!!. one other thing if this screen ever caught on fire could be grease was to hot grease got on the screen. Hot grease will catch anything on fire so be careful",

Would buy again and recommend it to every one.",
