Turns out we almost never use the printer... which has been annoyingly glitchy since we first set it up and tried it out. Recommend that owners of Kodaks stay with the plain vanilla dock included with their camera, and acquire one of the inexpensive, widely available multifunction photo-printers for their computer setup. One of those will print your documents as well as your photos, and at the moment they are dirt cheap too.",
