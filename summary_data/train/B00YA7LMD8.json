She still loves it so we will try a replacement. *Update: A replacement was delivered on 3/26/18. All the seams appear to be intact. Hopefully this one will last. I must say that getting a replacement was fast and easy! Amazon is excellent when it comes to keeping a customer satisfied.",

Cinder is the first of the Beanie Boo dragons, and a lot of the design choices here have since carried over to later variants. The colors pop, the sparkles are just right, and-- who am I kidding, I'm just a sucker for dragons.",
