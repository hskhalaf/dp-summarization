Unlike the foam earplugs (and/or randomly-grabbed bar napkins) we've used for years, these let in a balanced level of sound. Perhaps still not quite enough protection to stand directly in front of a 20' high wall of speakers side-stage, but certainly worked great front&center stage, as well as various other very-loud stages and amphitheaters. Comfortable for all-day use. We actually keep them in the little dental-floss-like containers between shows. Note: If you have waxy ears, clean your ears BEFORE the show, and clean the plugs each night AFTER the show. Otherwise you're just pushing dirt in there.",

I am able to hear the conversation clearly. It has a small chip inside and I think it sorts-out/minimizes sound wave length which hurts the ear entering the ear canal.

These worked much better than standard foam ear plugs I've used in the past - I had some with me just in case the Vibes didn't work, but I did not need to use them. Easy to carry, install and remove. Best of all, no ringing in my ears at all after the show!",

They did great in both conditions allowing me to hear the show but not feel the ringing in my ear afterwards. I hopefully will be able to use them again some day. My only complaint is that they didn't come with a keychain carrying case so you have to remember to put the smalled plastic case in your pocket before you get into the party favors.",
