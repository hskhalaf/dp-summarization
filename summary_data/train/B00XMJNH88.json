First, I didn't expect the mirror to start fogging in a matter of weeks. Second, it's pretty tough to shave with a wet mirror, so that solution is terrible. I realize I am committing a slight offense by posting a negative review, when I rarely write reviews, but I hope that I can save at least one person their money, and the trouble installing this terrible fogging mirror.",

At this very moment, I'm buying the only other no fog shower mirror that's rated slightly higher than this one, the one from ToiletTree that has an adhesive backing. I've had much better luck with shower accessories with adhesive backing than suction cups. Maybe Upper West Collection will update this model with an adhesive instead?",

I would like to return it but have thrown away all of the packaging. Lesson learned, read the reviews and go with your gut.",
