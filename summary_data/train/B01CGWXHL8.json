      "verdict": "The widely popular Under Armour Drift gets a slight twist in the Mineral version. It sports a fabric-like upper that really hugs the foot. The shoe has loads of comfort, very good arch support, and the looks to match many of the more expensive shoes in the market. With the kind of aesthetic value and performance this shoe brings, the already reasonable price tag should feel like a steal for runners who are looking for a lightweight shoe that can match speed mid-distance runs with ease.",
      "pros": [
        "Most of the customer reviews included comfort as a major asset of the Under Armour Drift Mineral",
        "The testers generally had positive remarks about its lightweight nature",

        "Some runners stated that it remained comfortable when used for casual walks or for gym workouts",
        "There are several color combinations available",
        "A few runners noted how well the shoe supported their arches",
        "More than a handful use it for all-day purposes",
        "According to a reviewer, the upper fabrics were stretchy enough to accommodate the natural form of the foot"
      ],
      "cons": [
        "The Drift Mineral from Under Armour runs small, according to more than a handful of reviewers",
        "It does not hold up to usual wear and tear, based on the observations of a few runners",
        "A small number of runners thought that it fell narrow in the forefoot",
        "There were a couple of users who experienced rubbing and blisters in their heels",
        "Some consumers thought that the actual shoe didn\u2019t look as appealing as it was on the pictures online"

The description is totally false, and I don\u2019t think they sell women\u2019s/men\u2019s sneakers. It\u2019s unfortunate. So just know, if you buy men\u2019s and get a girls, don\u2019t bother.
