The replacements are $15 and last less than a year. This means that these headphones will cost you hundreds of dollars to continually repair over their lifetime. real shame considering they sound great and feel so comfy. if i had a cnc id make the part and sell it myself",

I glued it together and it lasted me up until now. The product is extremely comfortable, with high quality sound. I would not recommend this product, as the gimbal broke and there are no really good options. As countless others have said, the gimbal arms crack and render the product unusable.",

The reviews let me know that I needed to amplify and equalize these headphones to my liking. Once I heeded the suggestions they sounded really good. Amplification caused the hollow sound to go away and using the equalizer brought out a wider sound. I now use the headphones while flying X-plane.",

I would not buy this product again.",

Maybe a set of the velour pads would help, but I'm not sure I'm willing to spend another $30. The sound is excellent, so if you have a smaller head, I say go for it.",

The sound is so much better than the cheapo cans I had, but I cannot truly compare them the the ath-40 or 558s I was also considering because I can't do a side by side.

I wear them to gym or by my desk and they are still going strong. Sound is great, i'm not really and audiophile, but Listening to some punk rock like Green Day, sound just great.

Ok for SQ, was kinda flat, but how sounding compared to my Sony Pulse hs, and Ultrasone hfi-780's.
