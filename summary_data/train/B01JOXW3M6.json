When running speed tests I am getting getting the speeds that I'm paying for. My service provider is Comcast/ Xfinity. Please note that when dealing with Comcast you may have to go to tier 2 tech support to get it connected because they hate when you use your own equipment as they lose the monthly equipment lease fee. They will claim that your modem is broken, do not listen to them demand to speak with tier 2 tech support.",

      "text": "Avoid this product like the plague. It houses the Intel Puma 6 Chipset, which Intel has already admitted there was a flaw with. Long story short, intermittent processes within the modem choke the CPU which causes packet loss. Thus leading to issues with online gaming and streaming. Don't believe any nonsense about a provider being able to \"fix\" the problem. Modem's operate with an SDK(systems development kit). The profile your ISP sends to it, communicates with the SDK, it doesn't change it. Stick with your old modem or buy one that doesn't have this chipset.",

Its hardly any bigger than the tiny DSL modem I replaced... and that's a good thing, because there's not room for most other cable modem/router devices I saw.

My experience was that while the device usually worked OK, from time to time connectivity would drop for up to a minute. Though the occurrence of this issue seemed to be clustered over time, typically several times in an hour and then not again for a day or more, I was not able to reproduce the issue. I did not have the issue after replacing with a 24x8 capable modem that uses the Broadcom chipset (Netgear CM600).",

      "text": "I bought this on a Lightening Deal last year, and I was waiting for a good deal on a router... Long story short, I forgot I had this modem until I stumbled on a Prime Day deal for a router. Needless to say, now that I have both set up and running I can see why the 30 latest reviews are 1 star. The modem reboots itself every 30 min, and I sometimes have to unplug it and manually reboot it. Wish I could return, but it\u2019s been too long since I purchased, even though I just opened. DO NOT BUY! Also, it\u2019s ridiculous that it\u2019s Amazon Prime\u2019s #1 recommendation for Modems!",

I don't know if the firm ware was out of date or not present but I only had an internet service for one day (the first) and two 5-min intervals on two separate days during the first three weeks. I spent at least fifteen hours on hold waiting to speak to tech representatives (with AtlanticBB) during that period. I had to wait for10 days to get a AtlanticBB tech out to my house, and when he came up on my front porch the internet connected and hasn't stopped.???????",
