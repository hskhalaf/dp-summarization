      "verdict": "Keds makes another chic and fashion-forward upgrade to its classic Champion by introducing the Keds Champion Floral sneakers. Like the original Champion silhouette, the modern rendition flaunts a low collar construction with four-eyelet lace closure and floral-printed twill upper.The floral upgrade receives mostly positive feedback from the market. Although far from the basic look of the Champion, the Champion Floral remains as versatile and as stylish as its predecessors. It could get a little stiff at the heel part, but the overall comfort overshadows this minor flaw.",
