I think if the baby is sitting for a long time, they will be marked on his skin. But the kids on the beach and the pool are very active, should not be a problem. My child is 1 and a half years old, for him they fit well. Update: we have used this swim diapers a several times - they are really good. My worries about the plastic buttons for now are unjustified.",

These are awesome because you can really adjust them to fit your baby due to there being a bunch of different snaps.

I was concerned for the many little clips hurting my sons body, however, they were not rough and of course I tried not to keep them on for longer than the necessary time. They run small because my baby is four months old and these will not fit more than a couple months. My son didn't poop on them so I don't know how good they'll be, but they're lovely and they worked for us.",
