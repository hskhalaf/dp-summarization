It adds a wonderful Minecraft element that makes this book feel fun instead of being just another workbook to trudge through. It is thorough and well planned out. I particularly love that at the end of each section it teaches kids about the different career paths for each branch of science. It allowed my children to understand how to relate the science they learned about to real life careers. I highly recommend this for anyone.",
