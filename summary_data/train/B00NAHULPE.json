The quality is wonderful, it's very sleek and smart looking, and extremely comfortable. The installation directions are excellent. I installed the seat myself. It took me 30 minutes - it would have taken me 15 minutes 30 years ago. I never thought I would wind up at my age writing a love letter to a toilet seat, but if any toilet seat deserves it - it's this one.",

This thing is tough as nails, I don't know if I will use the removable feature but the hinge connections are as tight as I have ever seen, and rather than running a single bolt through the hinge and having your butt wiggle and loosen it, it uses a separate connection system. The slow close feature is sweet and the pads on the bottom where it rest son the boar seem like they will last a lot longer than the crap from ( insert big box hardware store name here ). Thanks!",

First time removing the seat also took a little jiggling, but now it's easy peasy. Mostly just love the quiet close. No more slamming toilet wood seats. Nice to be able to remove for a deeper clean. Fits standard toilets well, seems durable and quality. Time will tell. Nice correspondence from sellers asking about our satisfaction and thanking for our purchases. Appreciate that.",

I'm sure it's a great design in theory, but in practice the bolts never screw in tight enough -- after a certain point they just keep spinning in place. And unless they are firmly in place the nuts will not hold the first time you try to lift or lower the seat, rendering the seat unusable. It's not worth the money until they come with a better plastic nut.",

If there were any criticism it would be that I'd prefer they were somewhat more rigid. The reasons for that are, heavier people may damage the seat and the seat has a tendency to compress the water line to the bidets.

      "text": "I have been using this since March and I thought it was the best toilet seat I have ever bought but now I can't wait to buy a replacement. It has a lot of good features and that is why I bought it in the first place but now it won't stay in one place. It keeps getting loose so constantly have to tighten the screws which doesn't help much because it just loosens again. I am glad I had bought it at the lower price but it is definitely not worth the $60 price tag.",

Was very easy to install and the push-button removal makes it very easy to clean underneath. The way the seat is designed is also different than other seats I have had and is very comfortable. The only thing I was surprised at was there is more back and forth movement than I was expecting from the seat when it is secured on the posts. It's not extreme, but if you shift your weight it's more of an occasional annoyance. I'm happy with my purchase.",

The slow close has worked flawlessly when I've had to slam on the brakes (CA driving is not for the faint of heart) closing without me even hearing it, versus my old seat would SLAM shut and of course broke. Make sure you watch the video on the install which is really nice addition to the also-good print instructions.",

Not only was the price cheaper by a couple dollars than the Kohler, installation is much better and product seems much better.

Plastic seat is intelligently shaped, and - Hooray! - comfortable. Found price to be very reasonable. Registered seat (it has a two year warranty) at company website on a Sunday afternoon, and had a confirmation later that same day - that\u2019s wonderful service. Likely to replace less quality seat in other bathroom based on this positive experience.",

I installed both myself (67-year old woman with some home maintenance abilities) and found it easy enough - although not a total walk in the park. One just needs to go slowly. I could do a third one no problem but the installation is not intuitive, so following directions is critical, including when one first puts the mounting screws on (first you push them on--never have done that before). Once everything was done, I marvelled at its ingenuity. I recommend this toilet seat and will probably buy another one for our cottage.",

IMPORTANT: BEFORE YOU ORDER, please measure your toilet bowl (see images) to determine if you need ROUND or ELONGATED size. NOTE: Bath Royal toilet seats are not compatible with bidets, grab bars or risers that install between the seat and bowl.",
      "EASY TO CLEAN \u2013 Helps keep your bathroom smelling fresh and clean. One touch QUICK RELEASE immediately detaches seat/cover from toilet, eliminating the nasty area between the hinges where urine, grime and odor-causing germs usually collect. NOTE: When cleaning, do not spray or saturate the mounting bases or hinges. Spray your cloth first, then wipe.",
      "NO LOUD SLAMMING \u2013 Slow Close prevents accidents including cracked toilets and pinched fingers. Simply tap forward and watch the seat and/or lid close silently and softly by themselves. Closing too slow? Push it closed. Unlike other brands, Bath Royale\u2019s soft close can be forced closed repeatedly without issue. Great for everyone, including people with lower back pain because user doesn\u2019t have to stoop or bend to lower the seat.",
      "MORE SANITARY & STAIN RESISTANT - Made of polypropylene, a light, relatively soft plastic that is non-absorbent, chemical and stain resistant. Bath Royale uses 100% pure (not recycled) polypropylene because it is stronger and produces a beautiful, high-gloss finish. The seat and cover will flex, but guaranteed not to crack, break or permanently deform. Our polypropylene will last for years with proper care and cleaning, but scratches relatively easily (so avoid abrasives and hard sharp objects).",
      "DURABLE & LONG LASTING - Tested to 400 pounds, all Bath Royale seats feature stainless steel mounting hardware that holds your seat firmly in place. 4 seat bumpers evenly distribute weight. Unlike painted wood or padded soft seats, Bath Royale seats are a solid color throughout and will not chip peel or fade. 2-YEAR WARRANTY is double most other brands."
