After about 15 emails with support over a course of 14 weeks and counting, they are blaming it on a software update to work with ios12 and it's been about 8 weeks since they've come to that conclusion with no update. In the middle of flu season with a 1 & 2 year old i'm embarrassed that I've spent $100 on a thermometer that hasn't worked in almost 4 months.",

Since this connects via WiFi, it is the perfect solution. It also allows me to monitor her temperature remotely when I\u2019m at work. The thermometer is also very accurate. I have no complaints at all regarding the device and highly recommend it.",
