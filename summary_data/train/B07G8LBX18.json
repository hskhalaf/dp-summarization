That saved a lot of time. And most important, the grandson loved it. One thing, the description says two 12 volt batteries. I\u2019m sure it does have two, but they are both contained in the battery pack. You don\u2019t get to use one up and replace it with the other while charging the first. Having said the, the battery pack lasts a long time.",
