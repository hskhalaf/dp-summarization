Per other reviewers, the factory warranty is useless because Amazon does not fill out the warranty card.",

I think it will take quite awhile for this one to give up the ghost. I did have to remove 2 links, but that's to be expected with this kind of band.

The only downside of this item is the day and date setting tends to stop if it's not been exposed to the light or direct sunlight for even a short period of time. Other than that, I have no complaint. The seller fulfilled their commitment to send it on time, and the watch came with a very nice box with instructions manual in it. The watch has a simple design, and I think it would work well for my job although, I kind a wish that Seiko also has that night light feature like Timex.",
