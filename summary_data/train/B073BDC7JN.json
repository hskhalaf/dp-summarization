My boys are 11 now (twins), so no need for a diaper bag - BUT if this had been around when they were babies it would have been amazing for that as well! For now, just a regular purse for me! \ud83d\ude1c",

The shoulder straps are cushioned for comfort but the stroller snaps get in the way so they dig into your back. Overall, it's a nice looking backpack with a lot of room to put your kid's stuff in but the durability is questionable.",

Upon examining it, it seems to be sturdy and well made. I can\u2019t wait to use it for baby boy who will be here in June. The only thing I would point out is that the inside lining is not black. It is the same pattern as the changing pad.",
