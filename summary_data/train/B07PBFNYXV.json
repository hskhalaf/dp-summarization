It\u2019s macronutrient composition is higher in carbohydrates than fats than traditional creamers, which gives you a rich and creamy drinking experience- without being oily in any sense. I\u2019ve attempted, and failed, many times to make my own (it always slimes within minutes) This oat milk isn\u2019t as thick or flavorful as others I\u2019ve tried, but it works wonderfully with coffee and foams, and stays, amazingly. I\u2019m so glad oat milk is gaining popularity, hopefully it\u2019ll be a staple in stores and coffee shops soon!",

When I use this milk, I add less sugar to my drinks because there is a hint of sweetness. Moreover, I notice that the milk cuts down on the bitterness of coffee due to its high fat content.

This foams up really well, the bubbles are a lot smaller than using regular or homemade oatmilk, and it stays thick, not watery at all. Also of course, the creaminess/thickness does not leave you congested like other milk or even sometimes coconut milk. I am ecstatic about this purchase and am very thankful to the creators, thank you. All in all, you need to try this!",

For those of you contemplating this brand, do not buy it if you plan on heating up the milk and frothing it by hand. In my opinion this should not be called Barista, that is somewhat misleading. I found many similar reviews after making the purchase. Not recommended.",

It\u2019s fine, but in prefer the \u201cpacific\u201d brand barista series almond milk, as it froths better. But...it was well-package and had far off expiration date! Thanks!",
