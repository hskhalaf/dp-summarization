This bag was small enough to fit on all the trains in those European countries and it was able to fly easily on all of the airlines I used. I find it to be very lightweight considering that it is hard sided luggage. The wheels have held up great to several miles of pulling it through the streets of Europe and here in the USA. The handle is sturdy. When you expand the luggage it gains a ton of extra space. The bag looks good too.",

Another problem is the instructions for the TSA combo lock. The instructions have no words, only images. And the images do not match the actual lock. With a little intuition, you can figure it out, but they ought to give you the correct instructions with some actual words in them.",
