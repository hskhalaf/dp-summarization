The price is right. Immediately they stopped the severe scratching. But I did take 1 star off for the smell, it smells like chemicals. I placed it loosely around their neck so it doesn't cause skin irritation, and taped the end without cutting it, the strap is super long. I remove it when I give them baths. I did stretch it to release the powder, I believe this releases the active ingredient. So far, so good.",

I like how easy it was to use. The scent was initially very strong, but after a few weeks the scent disappeared completely. Hands down the best collar I have ever purchased. It actually works! Remember to replace a few times a year! More often if you dog is super active and goes swimming as the powder in the collar wears out more quickly. For as affordable as it is, I do not mind one bit!",
