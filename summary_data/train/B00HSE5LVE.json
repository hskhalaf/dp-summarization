Kind of cheap quality but I mean, what do u expect when ur paying 20 bucks for almost 30 glasses. Also these aren't dishwasher safe and don't submerge them in water because it'll blow the circuit in them. They're super bright too and go through different color animating sequences. Very happy customer here. Video is of a cup straight out of the box without any use. Looks even cooler with liquid inside.",

A month later I was going to have a gathering and thought I would see if they still worked. I was very doubtful. I checked all 24 and only 5 didn't work. I thought that was great.",

I like the way that the light and battery pop off and on the bottom. This assured me that they would still work after I poured the Jell-O shot in it The plastic was strong enough for me to drill a small hole in the side to hang it from a Mardi Gras bead. They were a hit of the party.",
