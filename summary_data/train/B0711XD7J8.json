      "text": "I was very enthusiastic about the form factor of this device. The screen is quite nice, but the glitches and issues I've had with my unit have forced me to return it after only light usage. I've had issues in particular with the finger print reader, wifi stability (on multiple networks), and a weird black screen limbo when restarting and sometimes when powering on. Its hard to generalize if these issues are particular to my unit or this model in general, but do take this as a data point in making your purchase decision.",

But, again: if you are replacing those bulky laptops to carry something light, specially if you are buying it for a student which is already carrying a heavy backpack with books and is supposed to use the computer mostly in a indoor environment with wifi and AC outlets available around, I am pretty sure this is the best choice you can make with 500 dollars.",

The WORST: the flex in my keyboard is broken and I tried to contact Huawei many times and not a single one I got a response. Now I have a $630 paperweight.",

It's extremely lightweight, hardly noticeable in a backpack. However, I believe the processing speed is on the slower side and battery life should be improved; I average around 8 to 9 hrs on this device. Wish it had at least another USB-C port, though this lack a ports is partially compensated for including a USB-C to USB adapter.",

Detachable cover is cool. 6. Top end specs. Cons: 1. No adapter included (atleast for me) and also no stylus. 2. Battery life is average. Does the work though. 3. Keyboard and touchpad quality could be improved. Discoloration in white keyboard after half a year. Overall: Pros far outweigh the cons and would recommend this product to anyone looking for an affordable and portable 2-in-1 without compromising on processing power.",
