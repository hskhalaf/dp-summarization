      "text": "First time I've ever been able to make fool proof fluffy Basmati rice! But not by following the instructions in the booklet! Here's what you do: 1) rinse the rice in water to remove starch (I swoosh rice + water it in a pot, drain, repeat, until water runs clear. Takes a while but worth it!) 2) soak the rice for twenty minutes to one hour 3) drain soaking water and add rice plus an equal amount of fresh water to cooker, and set it to go. So for example, one REAL cup Basmati plus one REAL cup of water makes perfect rice every time. Cute little rice cooker that is the perfect size for my small family.",
