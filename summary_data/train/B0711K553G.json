      "text": "The local stores used to carry this style of rigid collapsible bag and for some reason locally they no longer do so I was required to buy them via Amazon. Think of these as more folding self-standing box than any bag, For me this is just what the pediatrician prescribed! Not only do these bags prevent \"garage surprises\" (breakthrough) they are just enormously handy.around the house. The only glitch may be that the dimensions are just a bit big on occasions for some self-checkout scales. When that happens to me I load my groceries in the plastic bags but then place the bags in these for safety and convenience. .",

That makes for easy unloading process, less trips back and forth from the car.

They fold up compact, are spacious, have a solid hard base that unfolds, and are solid construction. I love when I get home and only have these three bags to carry instead of 30 obnoxious plastic bags that are bag for the environment. This has possibly been my favorite amazon fund to date.

The long handles are so convenient for me since I just throw one over my shoulder while my hands are full. When not in use they stay folded up in my closet.",
