It\u2019s got gorgeous white pearled, traditional, sprinkles as well as gold and white sugar spheres and sprinkles. There are four topping options total and they are all stunning! The gold toppings have a metallic shimmer while the white toppings have a shiny pearled appearance. This set is the perfect addition to any bakers kitchen. The candles are slender, tall and last a little under an hour when burned all the way through, but you won\u2019t have them lit that long. My cupcakes will be classy and chic. I highly recommend this Wilton decoration set!",

When you hear their name, you immediately think of baking. \ud83d\ude01 I could try to describe the sprinkles and candy balls, but I believe a picture is worth 1,000 words, so I added some! The photos don\u2019t do these decorations justice. They look amazing in person - especially the white sprinkles - the light catches them and they sparkle! Oh, they taste good, too! That\u2019s always a plus! Get yours today - you\u2019ll love them! Happy Bakinf!",

We just sort of sprinkled the gold pearls across the table to add to the decor. It all turned out super cute and I think the price is very reasonable. I still had candles and sprinkles leftover afterwards too. This is the third set or product I've bought from Wilton and I've been extremely pleased with each and every one.",
