Upon reading about the 600CFM and seeing a YouTube video of a brick being blown across a smooth surface, I was sold on this particular Worx model. With a big yard, I do switch hands every now and then since my arms can get fatigued from handling the sheer power of this thing. Medium speed is plenty, but it's nice to have the higher setting for tougher jobs. Saving money with this PLUS a $20 Amazon Basics outdoor cable over the expensive cordless was the best decision ever made!",

This blower was much larger than anticipated. While it is ideal for a very large area, for a mid-sized backyard it is overkill. It is also heavier than I expected. But my one star review is primarily due to the fact I couldn't get it to power up, even though I tried 2 known-true power ports. I theorize that this is due to either 1) I got a lemon, or 2) it requires a special power cord. So I have returned it to my nearby Kohl's store (easy peasy)",

My prior blower had only 2 speeds, while this one is completely variable. I find the variable speed feature more useful that I would have expected.

If you were to throttle the end of this blower with a smaller diameter orifice... the MPH/Velocity would be through the roof! but there would be LESS airflow... = less work. The blower is balanced in the hand, and feels natural. There is a built-in molded recess so you can conveniently hang the blower from a wall mounted screw if you so desire. Hope that helps...

Takes awhi!e to learn how to move them, keeping the leaves together. I think they have me an extra year on warranty for registering, the serial number on the blower.

I am very impressed. As soon as i finished clearing up the front yard, i went into the back yard to try it on leaves on pea gravel...fantastic results.

      "text": "I bought this specifically to assist in drying my car after a good washing. It works wonders and saves me a lot of time on drying. This is a very powerful blower and I got some additional use out of it by blowing my garage and patio!! Keep in mind that when using this as a car dryer its not going to completely dry your car, only assist in the process, you will need to go over it with a nice microfiber towel to complete the job. If your looking for a blower to evaporate water, look at the Master Blaster Car Dryer, its $400 dollars and not sure its worth all that extra cheddar.",

This blower is considerably more effective for moving leaves than the Toro I had previously. The only reason I did not rate it a 5 was because it is relatively heavy and because of the design which pulls air in from the rear which gives it a strong tendency to suck your shirt, jacket, trousers, etc. over the intake. Wearing tight fitting clothing helps. It seems like a well built, sturdy blower which I hope serves me for several years.",

      "Turbine fan tech: Worx engineers figured out how to get a jet engine type motor inside of a leaf blower; Cool, huh, Super powerful, yet not so loud that you\u2019ll think it\u2019s getting ready for takeoff",
      "2 speeds for different jobs: It\u2019s actually better to go slow for pavement or tight corners; But on the open lawn, switch to speed 2, and its 110 mph, and let\u2019s see what the Turbine can do",
      "600 CFM: We named the turbine 600 after the 600 cubic feet per minute of high capacity air volume that shoots out of its wide mouth nozzle; That\u2019s a wide, strong path of air that allows you to clear large areas with fewer passes",
      "Hyperstream air nozzle: But we didn\u2019t just stop designing once we were finished with the TURBINE engine; We added an attachable nozzle, optimized to direct all that volume in a concentrated area for tougher jobs",
      "One-handed operation: With all that power, believe it or not, the turbine 600 is designed to be controlled with just one hand; It\u2019s only 6.4 pounds, and the ergonomic design funnels all that wind in a way that\u2019s easy to handle",
      "Extension cord retainer: The electrical cord comes with a retainer attached, so when using an extension cord, it won\u2019t disconnect, even when it gets snagged"
