He absolutely loves them. The mic is detachable which is nice. But the best part is that they can be used wirelessly or wired. The sound quality is what you would expect from a gaming headset in this price range. Overall, it's a great product and I would say the best wireless headset sub $100.",

Noise canceling is also good if that is something you want. He often leaves one ear uncovered when I\u2019m in the same room with him so that I\u2019m still able to get his attention.

The head set is comfortable to wear, no doubt an upgrade from buds. They dont cancel noise but may muffle distant sounds. The microphone sounds great according to my coworkers. Battery lasts all day for 10 hours or more. The bad? -- the wireless dongle and headset briefly lose connection. It happens randomly and results in a loss of audio for 1 to 2 seconds. Pairing the headset to the dongle was frustrating but magically worked after nearly 10 attempts. I'd still recommend it if you dont want to spend $300 on other wireless headsets.",

      "text": "The sound quality is very average, but I suspect your paying for all the other practical features. The plug in mic is great, so you can use it as headphones without that feature when desired. It has a cord so you can plug it into a phone or tablet when not using the USB fob, and battery life is good. Also very comfortable and light to wear. My teenage daughter is Minecrafting it up hard-core on these live and wireless! Worth every penny.",

Also it doesn\u2019t interfere with my glasses with soft ear cushions. What I like most is that it requires no drivers or installed programs. You can use the USB dongle by just inserting it (plug n play). Also you can just use the 3.5mm plug (inserts into headset slot when needed). Noise isolation is pretty good as well. And not to mention the excellent build quantity.",

Sure the buttons on this MPow headset are cheap and the headset as a whole is a little heavier on the head vs a HyperX but performance wise, they are almost identical. Plus they look basically the exactly same! Definitely a great sounding headset. Mic is good. Plus it's wired or wireless which are all bonuses. I won't use it for more than an hour a day (if that) but we'll see how long this bad boy lasts! Nice work MPow.",

I wanted a good headset with a microphone and my computer doesn't allow for Bluetooth headset with microphones or the USB dongle was my only choice.

Initial setup on ps4 required some fine tuning on the sound. And switching to PC meant I had to readjust them again. Second: there is no headphone disconnect option, you have to remove the bluetooth USB peice to disconnect the headset from whatever platform your using to get regular audio back, which runs the risk of losing it.

Unfortunately, the mic is a plug in type and after 2 months only works when it takes a notion. I purchased these at $59 and I\u2019d like to say it was money well spent but alas that is NOT the case. I contacted the seller regarding the return/refund policy and after an initial response requesting a copy of my invoice, they have gone radio silent. Looks like I\u2019ll have to go to the manufacturer.",

Easy setup. 1 work around sprung up involving the auto sound channel not switching between the receiver and headset. Press the ps button go to output option and turn on chat only to address. Overall, enjoying. Will update in a week or two. Recommend product.",

Directional sound is great for my gaming experiences, and the mic quality is that similar to a Hyper X Cloud series headset, which is top-notch in the headset market, in my opinion.

The headset has a nice solid feel to it. There are aluminum elements that really give it a high quality feel. The sound quality is so good! Better than any headset I\u2019d bought before.
