The top doesnt fit snuggly on the body and moves freely, while you try to filter the liquid. This causes the plunger to be uneven all the way down, which results in coffee grounds and particles to move passed the filter. I tried to mitigate this by also using a paper coffee filter on the plunger, but it doesnt fix the real problem. And the coffee is essentially ruined. Now I have a $70 piece on my counter taking up space, while I use a $30 french press from Target.",
