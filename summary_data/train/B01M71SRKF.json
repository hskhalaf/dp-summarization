The construction and operation of this seat is great. the hoses and fitting for install made the job a snap to retrofit my Kohler one piece Santa Rose toilet. I thought not having a remote might be missed, but the switch size and placement is perfect and the adjust-ability allows a wide range of personal settings. The drying blower is a nice assist and the air filter, something I thought was a gimmick really works. Not as comfortable as standard seat, but the cleaning function is so worth it. Read all the features, lighted, soft close lid etc it has it all.",

Very pleased with the purchase. The water pressure is a bit strong even on the lowest settings compared to a TOTO I used before, but some people may prefer stronger pressure.",

Would this seat fit my toilet?, and 2. Did I really need 13.25\" from the left hole in the toilet to the wall?(I only had 12.75\") The answer from the rep at Kohler was a resounding NO on #1 and a YES on #2. I took a chance and ordered the seat anyway and guess what, the seats fit perfectly and work fine. My wife loves her new seat!",
