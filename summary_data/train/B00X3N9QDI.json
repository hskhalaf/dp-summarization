Only \"issue\" is that the receptacle is supposed to 'click' into place but that can be a challenge from time to time (it could still be in place w/o the 'click', but I just don't trust it until I hear it)",

However an easy fix was found using one of those small heavy duty and thick rubber bands often found around the stems of broccoli! We just installed in around the knob and it's so much easier to turn, slip proof and now turns effortlessly!",

The Cuisinart CBM-18N had a stronger motor. It's loud, but works every time. So I'm returning this one as it's too weak to grind.",

For cleaning out the shoot we use a stiff but bendable piece of picture framing wire to work it into the discharge chute and loosen and grounds that may be accumulating. The brush cleaner provided works well for the burr grinder, just be sure to remove the part that comes out, wash it clean and fully dry it before putting it back.",

No this one. You just put the filter (paper for permanent) at the base of the grinder. You can throw out all of your brushes. Also great is that you specify the number of cups of coffee you intend to make and it automagically grinds the right amount so no more measuring. The airtight container and digital display are icing on the cake. I've had NO issues with this thing clogging and I make coffee every single day.",
