Something has changed with Asics - they're either designed different or being made somewhere different now. Too uncomfortable to even wear casually. After over a decade of commitment to only Asics I am now forced to go to a different company. What happened?????",

In other words, the length of the shoe is fine, but everything else is smaller.
