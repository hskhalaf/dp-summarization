It sits in my dining area in between the kitchen entrance and the door out to the backyard. When that door is open, I only had 16 inches to work with. This was perfect for the task. The wood is beautiful. My cousin was so impressed, she is going to get one. My UPS driver was delighted that the box had a handle. Well, simple things. Really though, packed well. Arrived in great shape. Extremely happy with this purchase! :)",

Lastly, there were a couple of wall brackets, so if you have little ones and don't want them trying to climb up the thing and have it fall on them. Overall, I was very satisfied.",
