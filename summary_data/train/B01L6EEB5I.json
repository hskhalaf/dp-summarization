The first thing I did wrong was attaching the handle..Once the handle is not correctly screwed on, the holes won't punch and the bind combs would not open. So before you get frustrated like I did, makesure you put on the handle the correct way. But the binder works good; looks a bit cheap but can do the job.",

Original GBC binder still going strong after 40 years, and I hope this one lasts a long time too",

The only thing you have to watch out for is bending the metal points on top, but the one I bent back bent into place again very easily. The handle is removable which makes storage much easier",
