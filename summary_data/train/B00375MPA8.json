The time is set automatically through the Internet. You can have 4 advanced alarms that let you pick the days of the week and the alarm.",

Simply put, it's buggy and flawed into being useless. It SHOULD be able to do internet radio as alarm, but it never works. Pandora alarm did work, but now my phone can do that, making this thing obsolete. the interface is super slow and just very badly designed, very inefficient and unintuitive. I haven't used it in so long they may have finally updated it and I would never know, but I doubt they'll ever really support these",

But it just won't. It goes to Application Mode and lights up your room like a Christmas tree. If they fixed that little programming glitch, I'd be happy and it would make a great bedside Internet clock radio. I can live without the battery, using my cellphone as a backup. THEY. NEED. TO. ADD.

The DASH is easily programmable for repeating alarms. You can also program it to go into night or power save mode at certain times on certain days, saving energy or going to lower light when sleeping. The Apps are sparse and don't seem updated very often. However, for things that you'll want on a wake up station (weather, news, facebook, twitter, etc.) it's easy to add and arrange to your liking. Overall a great premium alarm clock.",

Some of my favorite apps, like The Onion, were only able to display the headline and first few sentences of the article. The latest update allows me to click to go to the actual site and read the whole article. What a huge improvement. The broswer is kind of clunky, but especailly for the price it is now a really nice kitchen companion.",

And when you compare its feature set with other similar consumer electronics (smartphones, netbooks, tablets), it's a little pricey -- it needs to be closer to $100 to sell in volume. The big functional drawback is: No battery backup for the alarm clock (!). Sort of defeats the purpose of having an uber-alarm clock. The touch screen is resistive, not capacitive, so it requires a hard press, but that's not that big a deal. Setup was easy, and there's a nice range of chumby-supplied apps.",

Best bet is to set it up online via the website for the different channels and watch any videos for tips.",

A big fat red reset button next to the snooze button would've been nice so resetting it wouldn't be such a pain since the only way to reset it is to unplug it! I would not recommend paying over $50.00 for this.",

Also my 4 year old loves to watch kids shows on Netflix on the Dash. Get the first generation Sony Dash for full functionality. Yes it is not mobile and it is not a tablet, but for what I do with it it's great!",

A lot of the features are kinda slow and tedious, what do you expect for $100 though. The reason I bought this was to play my extensive music selection from my wd passport hard drive, and it does do that. Accessing some of the bands takes some time though, this machine is not a powerhouse by any means. It does its function, and as such, I am happy, especially considering what I paid, not too bad.",
