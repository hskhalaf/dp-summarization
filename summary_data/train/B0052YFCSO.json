Plus unlike nair where it takes a while for it to grow back, in two days it was like my beard growing back! Not smooth at all! I will be sticking with my shave butter and razor! What a waste of money!!",

Use the Calm Balm as well. I usually put the Calm balm on at least once a day.",

Highly recommend but for sure follow the instructions and watch the time. Also get the Ball Calmer they recommend to, it helps. Much easier and better than shaving or using a body groomer which I've done both. And no in-grown hairs this way, so no bumps and weird redness. Always a plus.",

I have a lot more hair on my chest and it seemed the cream had a tougher time here. Most of the hair was removed, but there were still quite a few that were not. So, I did round two a few days later. Same result. I ended up having to shave off the remaining hairs.",

Cons- The cream is too thick. It has almost like a sand consistency. A lighter version would work so much better. Doesn't remove all the hair. Granted, it will remove about 80% with one application but a second application is usually necessary to get the rest.",

      "text": "I have tried a few hair removal products, but nothing was as good as Ball Balm. I was initial skeptical at how good the reviews were and figured it was probably too good to be true, but I was wrong. I've been using it for a few months now, and it works every time. The smell is wonderful compared to other products, and it also works great so long as you follow the directions. If you're looking for a smooth look anywhere on your body this is the product for you.",

However, it works as promised!",
