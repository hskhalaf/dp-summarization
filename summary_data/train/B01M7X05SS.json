It may be a little old now but it still looks, feels and performs better than the newer, higher-spec Android that I got just a couple of months ago. This case is exactly what I'm looking for to keep my iPhone slim, light and well protected from scratches and smudges. It came in a darker shade of navy than in the picture which I actually prefer and it's just smooth enough to the touch to feel like there isn't anything over the phone itself and with no design or hole for the logo it just looks elegant and more expensive than what I paid for.",

I put the Apple case on, didn't like the feel, and its slippery, which makes no sense. The button covers don't have cut outs around them and are stiff. The Apple case cost $38 with taxes, while this one costs $13. I definitely recommend this one.",

Very narrow margin there though - It snaps into place and is secure - The button covers take slightly more effort to press. Not much though. - The case is a bit grippy but not too grippy.

I\u2019ve purchased other \u201cslim\u201d cases in the past that started splitting and falling apart after a few months, which chalked it up to buying inexpensive products. No such problems here.",

I simply emailed about the case, sent a photo of the small breakage and they sent me a brand new one right away free of charge, including shipping. The customer service experience was suburb.
