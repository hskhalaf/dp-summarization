It caught on fire about an hour after lighting (assuming during windy conditions) and burned the bamboo and the tank fell out. Luckily it went out when it fell but that could have turned real bad. Completely my fault. But I do not feel these are all that safe because they are pretty flimsy and made with thin bamboo.",

You have to tape these to the table in order to keep them from tipping over. They ended up burning the sides of the tiki torch and now I am unable to use them again. I would love to purchase some better quality ones to use in our outdoor patio at our brewery. I would not purchase these unless you perfectly pour the fuel into the tiki torch and watch them like a hawk.",
