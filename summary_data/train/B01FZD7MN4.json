I like that it goes on the dishwasher which is the only reason it gets that many stars. Not as cute in person either,it looked more rustic in the pictures, actual product is more pink with bigger white specs. Please click below up if my review helped you!",

The simple lid design is easy to clean, but the spout is also the air hole so it doesn't pour out smoothly. That's okay because you're sipping it anyways. Only real down size was the cork material on the inside of the handle came damaged and you get some random flicks of coffee when you pop the spout open and closed.",

The sliding mechanism is hard too. It snaps open and shut loudly and your liquid comes flying out. I don't use the lid very often and then the liquid grows cold faster.",

The last bit of turning positions and seals. For lefties, set cup with handle on left and position tab between 7 and 8. Cup sort of fits in my 2019 Subaru Outback.

Also, trying to sip with the lid off is difficult because of the slope of the top. The handle is easy to hold but when the lid is screwed closed, the handle is very close to the drink opening. Puzzled by all the very high reviews and I'll return this.",

No matter how well I washed it or how many cups of tea after, the coffee taste lingered. After a month and a half of use the seal gave out and it started leaking whenever it wasn\u2019t exactly upright, included while I was drinking from the mug.
