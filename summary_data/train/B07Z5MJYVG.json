Instructions was missing too so that\u2019s a negative. So I figured I\u2019ll send back to amazon and get a replacement, probably an one time fluke. The other one I got worked for a few hours before it started to randomly shut off without notice, uninstall everything I added and everything, still randomly shuts off. I don\u2019t recommend this PC at all, I was sent two defective units that don\u2019t work.",

His previous computer was a 9 year old computer that the graphics card finally went out on so I figured, heck, why not get him something more up to date and not break the bank. Unfortunately it won't run Fortnite above the low settings at 30 fps without being completely choppy with tearing and very pixelated. I would not recommend this computer to anyone whom games honestly, this is more like a work station computer than a gaming computer.",
