He's worn them in the cold and rain so far, so I can't comment how they would feel in warmer weather. Size-wise, he's a 30-32, so I ordered a Medium. These fit perfectly, though they are slightly long but still very wearable, just a little scrunched at ankle area (he's 5'7\"). He really likes them, including the fit, and even though it may be psychological, he said they make him feel faster. I would recommend purchasing, especially since they're so affordable.",

More often than not I put shorts over them, but that makes it hotter and makes the wicking less useful.
