There's a toggle switch on the side that allows you to limit loud things from blowing out the quality. But most of the time, you would want it set to record quieter things than concert speakers. Sometimes it picks up too much ambient noise instead of what you expect it to -- more omnidirectional rather than focused. Interesting piece of equipment, but cost me more than I expected. It does have a microphone input, too, so you can attach a lavalier or directional mic, I suppose.",

Just be sure to read the instruction book to get to know the device and you will catch on fast. I just recorded a full 2 hour concert from 30 rows back, it WILL accept a 4GB SDHC card and performed in 4 chanel stereo. The playback was exceptional quality. Great for classroom, music just about anything. Just get it, you won't be returning this baby unless it arrives broken.",

This consumes lotsa juice and I don't like to be changing batteries all the time. Also the screen display is very small. It does record really well but these two things really stand in my way. I have the Olympus Ls 11 and I'm very satisfied. This is just my opinion and I'm sure people are very happy with the Zoom H2. There's another model the Zoom H2n. I'm planning on getting it cause I do love the surround sound and the H2n has five mikes. When I get it I will write more on that.",

Mic gain controls boost volume BUT add some noise (like reviews state) but when used on low-gain, record quite well. Audio-IN records even better when used with good microphones and a mixer (I used a Behringer U-802) for AMAZINGLY clear recordings. Several types of SDHC cards work well and have NOT found a card that did NOT work with this device. Even NiMH (1.2V) batteries can power this, although alkaline (1.5V) last longer.

Their comments caused me to purchase it, even though I have previously spent thousands of dollars on recording equipment. Although the unit cannot fully compete with equipment costing $50,000 such as is used for producing mass-marketed CDs, it does an amazingly good job compared to items costing several hundreds. Its size makes it admirably flexible for use in locations infeasible for setting up more elaborate equipment. Interfacing it with computers for burning CDs of very high amateur quality is very simple--and saves bundles of time. It is truly a real bargain in cost, quality, and ease of application. Carl H.

Aside of that: Five Stars for sound, ease of operation, SPL overload protection, gentle compression when needed, and many other features which make the H2 an intuitive, affordable hifi recording tool.",

The SD card it comes with is rather small, so purchase a bigger one (at least 2 gb) so that you will have more hours of space should you need them. The bottom line: If you are looking for something portable, reliable, and records well give this a try. Highly recommended!",

      "text": "This is an amazing llittle recorder. Easy to use and set up. The Surround recording capability is awesome. I used it to record a few songs with my Tuesday night jam session with three other guitar players. We used three accoustic guitars and an electric bass guitar. We sat in a circle with the H2 in the middle. It picked up each instrument and the 2 voices beautifully. Actually, its hard for me to believe that something so small could do that. A great recorder for live recording the jam sessions. We won't be without it!!",

I've owned my H2 for over a year, and have been able to capture many high-quality recordings. The four microphones provide lots of flexibility, the controls are intuitive and easy, the drag-and-drop USB interface is painless, the results are great, and all from a surprisingly portable, pocket-sized device. I've used several H2 recordings in my Cubase creations. Love it.",

Runs on 2 AA batteries and has line in and out features with soft gain controls. I use this for mastering digitally after mixing down in the analog domain. SD card limit provides hours of recording and is solid for field sampling. Transfer is fast and drivers are easy to use. The only 2 drawbacks are the button/controls/layout of the settings, and the built-in compressor/limiter...this is useless for anything but spoken podcasts....sounds awful with music. Just pre-compress/limit it and you'll be okay. This is still great for the price.",

For those who say it's not great with external mics, I use a Giant Squid cardioid lavalier mic and it's just fine - just make sure Plug In Power is turned on or the mic will indeed not pick up much of anything.",

      "text": "I bought the H2 as a secondary recording device for use with my Panasonic GH2DSLR. To get better sound quality than the cameras onboard microphone allows, one can record dual sound with the Zoom H2 and synchronise this sound to the picture later. For this the H2 is perfectly capable, recording superlative sound and for the price it is an absolute steal. I have also used it to record off air radio and it works really well. For a super sonic device you really can't go wrong with the H2.",

That way I get separate MP3's for each song. I like that you can turn on front and back mics separately, and I replaced the 512M SD card that came with it with a 4G card for 59 hours of recording capacity at the MP3 quality level that I selected.
