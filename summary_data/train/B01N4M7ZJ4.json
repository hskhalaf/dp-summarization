Mine never once came loose after 3 hours of use. Highly recommended! I also bought the Corona RS 7265D Razor Tooth Folding Pruning Saw, 10-Inch Curved Blade  ANOTHER EXCELLENT SAW!",

Couple of things that could be better is the rope could be less flexible. That makes it difficult to gain leverage to cut small branches. The blade is also extremely flexible making it difficult to cut if you aren't straight. Making the blade thicker will also add weight so it's a win lose situation. It's a good product overall.",

      "text": "This seems well made and it's a beauty to use. The saw is great as long as you follow the instructions and only try to cut (w/pressure) on the way down. It's also much cheaper than hiring a crew every time you need to trim your trees! No tips I can think of, considering how easy it is to use, except for maybe don't stand directly under the limb you're cutting!",
