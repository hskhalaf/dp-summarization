There are multiple beard combs of this same style from multiple vendors. Next time I will choose a different one.",

Though I imagine it won't be long before I get tired of storing it in the case. It's not like leaving the comb in my shave kit is going to hurt it any.",

Doesn't snag or tangle. The combs colors are beautiful and the engraved emblem really adds a nice touch. One of the most important things to me in a comb is the spacing between the teeth - this one nailed it. Both spacing patterns are perfect.",

The other side is more narrowly spaced and is perfect for spreading around the beard oil and getting it deep down into your beard. This comb also smells amazing. 10/10 would buy again",
