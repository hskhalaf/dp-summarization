      "text": "We have a 2 bedroom apartment on our property separate from the main house and it's always had spotty wifi: looked at various options and decided to give eero a try based on the positive reviews. Set up a mesh with 2 Pros and 2 Beacons to cover both house and apartment and (after getting some excellent phone support from eero) had everything running in under an hour. Works flawlessly with negligible loss of bandwith from the router to the furthest Beacon. Outstanding Product!!",

I also had a legacy airport extreme with USB to a printer. I kept that and put the airport extreme on client mode (instructions are on Eero web site) and that worked well. Then I linked up all my other devices (TV, sonos etc) to the new network and everything worked. We have a three-story row house and found that one Pro with the one Beacon did the trick. I thought I might need two beacons but did not.",

After setting it up, the program went into a loop for setting the beacon up. Once the beacon is set, it's set..regardless what the program said. NO instructions in the box. Just a phone number and a website. Packaging was excellent and, aside from the above issues, has exceeded my expectations. I went from losing service going to the other end of the house to being able to get service at my neighbor's house!",
