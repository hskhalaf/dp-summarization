First, when attaching to a bar, you really have to push it into place, whereas before it was much easier to attach. Second, the plastic is much more rigid and stiff than in previous models. This places a strain on one's neck, which is part of what we are looking to avoid with this apparatus in the first place! I found very little difference between the new Manta Ray and just using the bar. I have returned to using a foam roller on the bar instead.",

I have been using this to teach people how to have good form while performing squats. This product makes it extremely easy to focus on keeping your back straight no matter how much weight you have on the bar because it\u2019s being stabilized for you. I love the Manta Ray!",

My son says my traps are too big and therefore it rocks around during the squatting movement and makes me feel a little uncomfortable and uneasy. It may grow on me as time goes on but initial impressions is that it may be size dependent. It is constructed really well, nice and solid. I think it will wear nicely over time.",

I absolutely love it! It makes squats so comfortable and allows me to use more weight than ever before.

Perhaps thats why the manufacturer won't make it with cushion like that cos it could wear off quickly and may get lots of complaint. Kudos to Manta Ray for making training more comfy.

I could never really concentrate on the lift and it always left ugly marks on my shoulders. With this, I can really concentrate on my form and I have seen a nice increase in my lifts over time. It is 100% essential and I could not/would not do squats without it again!",
