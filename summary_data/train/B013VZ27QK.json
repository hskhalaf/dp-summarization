The only \"bad\" thing I have to say is that sometimes if it's warm and I start to sweat they get a little itchy, but still stay on. You can't see them through the shirt or anything. Hopefully these will last for awhile, but after they wear I will definitely be repurchasing.",

HOWEVER, within twenty minutes of wear (after taking them out of the box for the very first time), they were already starting to fall off. I have very small, conically-shaped breasts with slightly-larger-than-average nipples. While the adhesives covered my whole nipple with room to spare, they started to peel away at all sides, and although they haven't fallen off yet, they seem like they're on the verge of doing so. I don't feel safe wearing them out of the house even once. I'm very disappointed in this purchase.",

They will NOT work for very sheer tops, you will be able to see the circles underneath your clothing. I've used them two or three times now and they're sticky enough that I'm not worried about them falling off. Not entirely sure how long these will last. Time will tell.",
