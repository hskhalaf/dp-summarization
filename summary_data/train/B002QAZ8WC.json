It is all good unless it flips on the side, which it will easily do if you break and the rear wheel of the bike slides on a downhill. The problem is not as much the flipping as the buckle system. The buckles are tied to a solid area like the frame. They are stitched to the seating fabric. In case of a tilt/flip they fail to secure the child enough to prevent sliding beyond the frame of the carriage! Also on a couple occasions the cheap plastic buckle has come undone for no apparent reason other than being very flimsy.",

We decided to use is again after 1.5 years of storage and we discovered all of the safety straps on the seat harness had disintegrated. I have attached photos of the shredded straps. These are obviously very low quality straps and are meant to keep your child in place. I can tear them with my bare hands as they are obviously defective and unsafe. I would not recommend this trailer since its is not durable and is unsafe.",

After we load the bicycle tool bag, diaper backpack, snacks-and-drinks bag, and picnic blanket, the child is really having his space encroached by the stuff behind him. If we add a picnic lunch bag, then things are really too full! On the bright side, the hitch system seems good and secure, the tires and wheels are good quality. It took a 10 year old 10 minutes to figure out how to mount the flag but then it was good. It folds up nicely when not in use.",

I have included a video of the wobbly wheel.

Secondly, my 2yr old has to crunch up her legs to sit inside due to the poor leg room space. In the future I would look for a more spacious trailer and one that has a seat support.

We bought replacement tubes but after installing the tubes, a rim of the wheel completely disconnected from the wheel assembly, rendering the wheel and trailer unusable, and the replacement tube popped. While it was comfortable for the initial rides, I would not recommend purchasing the trailer if the wheels fall apart with the first change of tubes.",

      "text": "I was looking for something spacious and practical for my 1.5 year old son. Putting it together was a breeze not to mention the adapter that attaches to the actual bike. The harness in the trailer seems a bit odd as it does need some readjusting. The tires are great as I\u2019ve taken it through some rough terrain and no stress was seen. Overall, it\u2019s expensive and the weight limit sucks (40lbs max). My son can ride it in for a couple more months. Until then, I\u2019ll enjoy it as it is not heavy whatsoever to pull and runs great.",

Update: don't leave it out in the sun for too many days(whoops), the scraps turned into dust in my hands after leaving it out in the heat for about 3 months. I purchased new covers from the supplier. I now pull the wheels off and collapse it and store it in the closet. I don't realize it was collapsible, great feature. I changed my rating to 5 stars",

The seat is pretty basic, the lack of suspension makes rides a little rough when you hit the bumps, but at this price range we love these. Sure like others point out, debris from the bike tire could kick up onto the trailer, but I'm not sure minus fully covering up the front how you avoid that on any trailer. Easy to pull behind a mountain bike, solid construction. Would purchase again.",

On some bumps the plywood may bounce a little so you may want to secure it to the frame...but to keep it fold-able I believe the plywood has to come out.
