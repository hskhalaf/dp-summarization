Works well with most \"micro-brewery\" bottles with thick lips under mouth of bottle, but wouldn't work most bottles from \"imports\" that are locally produced by contract brewers that have thinner lips under the mount of the bottle. It's pretty easy to tell what bottles will work and what won't once you know what to look for. I see some reviewers complaining about the \"dimple\" the capper leaves in the middle of the cap. IMHO this is an engineering feature that helps provide a tighter seal.",

It capped one bottle. The next bottle it would grip and slipped not being able to hold sufficiently well to allow the cap to be set. Maybe other will have better luck but for me I am going back to my old style capper.",
