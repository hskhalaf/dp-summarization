      "text": "BUYER BEWARE: I was surprised to discover that these shelves are covered with a THIN PLASTIC/VINYL LAMINATE. This thin laminate makes an otherwise solid sturdy folding bookshelf look cheap. The seller simply needs to include an actual DESCRIPTION of what the shelves are made of. OR use photos that allow buyer to actually SEE what the shelves look like online. Any bookshelf designed to be set up and taken down multiple times needs to be made of more durable material than this shelf material.",

      "text": "Very easy to assemble, from unpacking to assembly, took no more than 10 minutes. I like that it'll be easy to move due to the folding nature. Wish it was a tad bigger, it's definitely smaller in person than in picture, for that reason it's quite expensive at $89. No issues snapping in the shelves. The only negatives were that the metal frame was not level therefore making it wobbly. Had to use furniture pads to even it out. Also, the frame had scuff marks and the shelves weren't finished properly/ had damage on the edges.",

Once snapped into place, it isn't going to budge without some force. I'll eventually be getting more of these for my nano aquariums!",
