My big complaint, and I realize I should have written this month's ago, is that the right headlamp only worked for about 2 months before it went out. Obviously a defect that I should have immediately complained about. Because I didn't bring it to the attention of the seller sooner I can't comment on their integrity in this matter. Had the light not stopped working I would ha e considered it money well spent and given 5 stars. However because this is the only experience I have with this product I can only give 2.",

If you want cheap and constantly replacing them, get these. They're definitely brighter than halogen bulbs, but the LED lights do not last long enough.",

My lights worked fine without the stabilizer and you connect them normally, but I had to reverse the polarity on the stabilizer when I introduced it in the mix. This is not intuitive because the clip is only on one side of the connection i.e. if you invert it the clips no longer hold the connection in place. No big deal just letting you know. These things made a huge difference in my nighttime vision and I recommend them to everyone.",

She had no issue with the brightness , said they looked great and even when I \u201cbright lighted\u201d her while driving behind she said, \u201calthough they were VERY BRIGHT, it was not a blinding light\u201d. My thoughts are ...They make the lines in the road \u201cpop\u201d and road signs, are by far easier to see , and be seen at a further distance . I recommend them and will be getting more for our other vehicles soon!!",
