      "text": "Per my son, \"They fit great and looks surprisingly awesome!\". He has wide feet and always have had difficulty finding wide shoes in cleats etc that didn't have the basic and boring black design. After hours of online research, trying on available shoes at Dicks and Academy (which were boring plain black that were still too narrow despite going up 2 shoe sizes), and reading tons of reviews I came across the Adidas Pretereo III. One reviewer's son wore the same sz shoe as my son and wide feet. They ordered an 11, so we did too. Perfect Fit!! Grey and white shoes with a logo in gold. Hoping they hold up thru the season.",
