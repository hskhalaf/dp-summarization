Very impressed with the backup guidelines as shown in the pictures I backed into a parking spot using only the guidelines and I was perfectly centered in the spot. Only bad feature is that if you have this camera on constant power to view anytime from your head unit, there is no way to shut the lights off on the camera. I reached out to the erapta costumer support and explained this problem and they are sending me the third gen camera free of charge! Hands down best costumer service I have ever dealt with.",

I don't really want to pay someone $60 to install it because I know I can do it myself but I also don't want to mess up the wiring. This camera is super easy to wire up. About 6 different connections, most of them to the same wire and done. The only annoying thing is wire managent but hey that's all up to you",

After 2 months the screen looked like it did above however the company sent me a replacement even though I was outside of the return window. Wonderful customer service and the new camera works great. One of the reasons I chose this product was ease of replacement if I did have a problem. I don't need to rewire everything because the quick disconnects next to the license plate make the swap simple. New product works great. I added a little hot glue around the wire and case seam on the camera as I suspect the rain may have gotten inside.",

Even when it dries out the inside of the camera still contains little specs of water drops witch can be seen on the screen. Really wanted to love this but I'm disappointed overall.

If had a way to connect it to my reverse, I suppose it would be fine...but need a camera that's on whenever the key is on. It's a problem at night because the light is so bright I'd be afraid I'd get pulled over. I could see a value in the bright light if there was a way to control it independently of the camera sensor.",

Routing the wire is prob the toughest part and that\u2019s up to you. Also locating the reverse light power is tough. I added a small wire to reach up to the reverse light but you may be able to find it right by the license plate. Overall easy. Don\u2019t know about how durable yet as I just hooked it up.
