I appreciate that it's a two-piece like the character's outfit, but it's slightly re-designed to cover more skin than in the movie which 1) makes sense for the weather around Halloween and 2) makes sense for small children. ne bummer is that one of the plastic straps broke off literally immediately while we were taking it off the cardboard. I was able to sew it back on easily, but it wouldn't been nice for it to just be sturdier in the first place.",

Some of the activities were a little young for his level (mixing colors,) and some concepts were a little over his head (acid vs base.) Still, I think it's great to expose kids to science early and this is a fun way to do it in an organized way. The only down side was that we made an absolute mess, but I think that's part for the course :) Will be looking into buying some of their other kits for the future.",
