These are fine quality and look like what I was looking for, but just be super aware of how small they are. They would be difficult to use in a mixer or a pot. If you have small applications, these would be good. Or perhaps for kids? The product pictures don't really show anything to give a scale context, though the fine print in the description does.

If they would have an image showing proportion vs. normal hand, I would never have bought them. Why not just make the proper size and then charge a bit more rather than producing wasteful products?",
