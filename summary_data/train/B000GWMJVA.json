Even if it is a little outdated (no Bluetooth). The only thing wrong is the memory card reader, but I never even tried to use that until a year or so ago and it didn't work then, so... It's easy to use and I have never had it serviced by anyone, and this printer has been used heavily so it is a high quality, hearty little thing. Love it.",

The Photo printer prints better directly from the Cameras' memory cards than from the computer files sent as a print command via various photo software or applications (even HP's own)... 2.) Don't fall for the HP Photo Value Pack (Photo paper & six ink cartridges) the ink cartridges are half full (which allows them to sell it at that price...) I also hear a lot of people whining about buying this product expecting it to have fax capabilities, also. (Please Note. It says \"Printer, Scanner, Copier.\") It's a PSC. Not what some, now, consider a true \"All-in-One.\"",
