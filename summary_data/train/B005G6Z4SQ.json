ASSEMBLY..... all parts were marked correctly and they even included a small wrench and 2 different size Allen wrenches. The instruction sheet was well written and easy to follow.

Great chair, only complaint is after a while you can feel the bar going horizontally across the mid back, not a thick enough cushion to cover it. I bought a seat back cushion separately to act as additional padding. I weigh 180lbs and am 5'9, holds up fine. Overall 4 stars, cant beat the value.",

      "text": "A real bargain piece of furniture. Easy enough to put together, even comes with the wrenches necessary to assemble it. Takes about 15 minutes to assemble. Not a million parts like I anticipated, simply bases, arms and seat. Not a high quality piece but exactly what it should be for the price. It is fairly comfortable and not a gigantic back, so, if you are a woman, it fits, some are too big for women. Cleans up easily. If you are looking for a black Pleather chair that is good for an apartment, summer home, or a dorm, this is perfect for you!!",

The chair arrived in perfect condition, packaged flat, but easy enough to put together.",

Now that it is assembled I find I bought a chair of about average comfort at a price I was comfortable with. I wish the chair was a bit higher or was able to lift and descend. The shipping arrived a day early vs the estimated date thus making it true next day delivery.",

Not sure he can use the recliner part, or put his legs up on the ottoman, should have thought that through better. I also should have thought through the swivel when it comes time for him to get out of it. I wished it locked as well. He almost fell trying to get out of it.
