The product itself is messy and leaves your shower looking like you just dug your way out of being buried alive, but it leaves your body feeling and looking like a GODDESS. I can\u2019t believe they don\u2019t make this anymore, I honestly feel like I\u2019ve been betrayed in a manner similarly to that of a relationship gone poorly. I\u2019ll always look for this exact thing, but I might have to settle with a lesser version. It\u2019s 2020- what else would I expect??",

The scent smells good but is a little strong for me personally. It leaves you with a nice oil/moisturized feel. Very messy in the shower but to be expected with a coffee scrub. Not sure I\u2019ll be buying it again, but it really does make your skin feel great.",

Instead, it is literally just coffee beans in a jar. It makes a mess and doesn\u2019t blend well on the skin. It also clogs the drain so it is impractical. I wish it was more like a spread rather than just coffee beans by itself. I feel disappointed. I will try and find ways to repurpose this product.",

Oh, and cleaning up my shower after using this stuff is ridiculous - looks like a coffee bomb went off in there!!",
