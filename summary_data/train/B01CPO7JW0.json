Not only is it an amazing deal financially, with so much volume at such a small price, it also tops all other products I've used for odor control. The other feature that I am beyond thrilled with is the lack of fragrance. Our family is extremely sensitive to chemical orders, and all of the other products we've used, while saying they were fragrance free, always have an odor. This was the first type we tried where there truly was no chemical smell at all. This is officially the only kind I will now use.",

It stays fresher smelling between changes than aspen, without the overly strong smell of the scented paper litter. I do add a small handful of lavender scented Clean & Cozy to the main potty corners to keep everything even fresher. The guinea pigs seem to like it. They popcorn when let them back into their cages after a change-out. The price is great. This is the best bedding I've ever used.",

The paper is just flakes rather than little \"wads\" so I don't feel it is as absorbent as a thicker paper product but it gets the job done and the price is right for the volume of product per package, in comparison to other brands selling similar paper beddings. Give it a shot, one bale goes a long way for me!",

Open a hole in the top, and fluff out of the package. It will even stand on it's own. VERY competitively priced, Bulk packaging. Cons: None that we have come across, we are already a repeat buyer.",
