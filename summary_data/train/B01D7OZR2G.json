Get your hands on one of you can. My opinion is you cannot get a better 4k 27 inch monitor which even has height adjustment and screen rotation built into its own stand. The newer model is far more expensive and doesn't give any true advantage over this older model. Picture quality is amazing.",

The only downside is the flashing (not gently pulsing) standby light. It makes it impossible to sleep with so I need to switch the monitors off completely every night.",

I can play all those games apart from tomb raider on ultra 4k no problem at 60 fps tomb raider benchmarks at 45fps but still runs perfect. The colours are so vibrant and graphics like real life certainly takes my breath away. \ud83d\udc4c",

More importantly, the monitor uses RGB subpixel layout, so is compatible with macs, and produces very nice sharp text. There is no backlight bleed as reported by some other reviewers. The stand could be better, but at least it is stable and supports 90 degrees pivoting.",

However not everything is 4k, and if you want to keep watching 1080p do not buy this monitor because it is not adequate. Videos/games will end up being blurry and scaled because of the higher resolution and the insane amount of pixel, it wouldn't reproduce a lower resolution as i was expecting. But viceversa if you do play 4k content on 1080p it would play just fine. Returning this for now",

For me it was set to Wide when I got it, and when in \"Wide\" it limits to 30Hz. So change that then find out how to enable 60hz on your pc. The latency is very low for gaming and I find it perfect in every way. The monitor looks incredible and very modern. I couldn't rate it any higher.",
