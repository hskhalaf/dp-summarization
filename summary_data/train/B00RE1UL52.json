      "text": "I loved this watch at first. I bought it last December and in April it stopped working during a swimming workout. It shut down for 3 days even after being charged. It works a random times at best and turns off completely in the water. The sad part is I bought a 3 year warranty on the watch, I have emailed Garmin and the warranty people and no one will email me back. No one seems to want to help with this defective watch when all I would like is a replacement. Very disappointed.",

Also, the auto-pause pauses INSTANTLY and takes forever to resume. It'll stop when your riding up short technical sections on a mountain bike, and it won't resume until at least a fifty yards later. It drives me nuts. You can customize this or just manually pause, but it's a pain in the ass and never works right. Two stars because it works decently for road biking. Also, the max battery life with everything like Bluetooth disabled is only 5 hours, not 10 as advertised, you it won't work for all day rides.",

I have run about 15 runs outdoors to allow it to self-calibrate as the user manual instructed, sadly this is still absurdly inaccurate. I ran 3 miles last night on the treadmill and the watch had me at 1.8 miles. I've run for 20 years and so I know my pace wasn't off by this much.",

Absolutely love that it is water proof, I took it in the ocean without worries so a swimming pool is nothing.",

The sleep tracking is a bonus. I had to replace the original strap on both units, but none of the straps irritated my skin the way the FitBit did. Also, by adjusting the settings, I go two weeks between charges. Finally, I bought my newest unit used. The seller was accurate in the description and very prompt on the delivery. I couldn't be more pleased.",

    "description": "Color:Black| Style:Without Heart Rate Monitor\n\nGPS SMARTWATCH FOR THE ACTIVE LIFESTYLE\n * Ultra-thin GPS smartwatch with a sunlight-readable, high-resolution color touchscreen\n * Built-in sports apps, including GPS-enabled running, biking and golfing plus swimming and activity tracking, let you view your stats even when away from your phone\n * Pairs with your smartphone to gently vibrate and display alerts for incoming calls, texts, emails and calendar items plus notifications from social media and other mobile apps\n * Customize with free watch face designs, widgets and apps from our Connect IQ store\n * Battery charge lasts through all your activities with up to 3 weeks5 in watch/activity tracking mode or up to 10 hours using GPS\n\nFrom the company that has been developing robust, dedicated wearable technology to improve training metrics for athletes for more than a decade comes the GPS smartwatch for the active lifestyle. Introducing v\u00edvoactive \u2014 the ultra-thin, lightweight smartwatch with built-in Garmin sports apps that you can wear every day to help you keep a healthy balance between work and life.\n\nFROM WORK TO WORKOUT\nPlay harder, work smarter, live better with v\u00edvoactive. Built-in sports apps keep you active while smart notifications allow you to stay in contact with pressing work matters \u2014 all so you can keep your life in balance. The high-resolution, color touchscreen stays readable in direct sunlight, so you can view your stats when you step out of the office for a run. The ultra-thin profile \u2014 8 mm \u2014 is comfortable to wear all day and can easily transition from office to golf course. You won\u2019t have to worry about v\u00edvoactive keeping up with your active days. The rechargeable battery lasts through all your activities with up to 3 weeks5 in watch/activity-tracking mode or up to 10 hours using GPS.\n\nBUILT-IN SPORTS APPS\nv\u00edvoactive features built-in sports apps that track your stats \u2014 even when away from your phone. Simply tap to choose among GPS-enabled running, golfing and cycling apps plus swimming and activity tracking.\n\n\n\nHIT THE GROUND RUNNING\nWhether you\u2019re training for a 5K or just for life in general, the running app uses GPS to capture essential running data such as distance and pace. A built-in accelerometer and wrist-based speed and cadence trackers eliminate the need for a separate foot pod when running on an indoor track or treadmill and also when GPS is unavailable. You can set up vibration alerts for heart rate\u00b9, pace and run/walk intervals. Other training features include Auto Lap and Auto Pause. Automatic sync with Garmin Connect Mobile gives you a post-run summary, including calories burned and if you scored any personal records, such as your fastest or longest run to date.\n\n\n\nGET IN GEAR\n\n\nThe GPS-enabled cycling app measures time, distance, speed and calories. Compatible with sensors\u00b2 such as speed, cadence and heart rate monitors to measure your progress on training rides as well as daily commutes.\n\nTEE OFF\n\n\nPair with your smartphone\u00b3 to download course maps from our golf course database \u2014 with more than 38,000 courses worldwide \u2014 to play favorite and new courses. The golfing app keeps maps updated and tallies hole number and par. GPS measures layup and dogleg distances, as well as distances to the front, middle and back of the green, to improve usability over the entire hole. Individual stroke play scorecard lets you see if you\u2019re under or over par. Measure shot distance at the press of a button. Round timer counts up time on the course, while the built-in accelerometer tracks your steps.\n\nDIVE IN\nAuto Length accelerometer-based technology automatically gauges total and interval distance; laps; calories burned; session average, interval and length pace; and stroke count, including number of strokes per length and interval and session averages. Let the swimming app calculate your efficiency with swolf, which adds the time and the number of strokes it takes to swim a pool length. View your time and interval distance at a glance. Interval Count lets you seamlessly pause and then resume your workout.\n\nThe thin profile cuts through the water, and its 5 ATM water rating means you can swim, sweat and shower with it on, worry-free.\n\n\n\nSTEP IT UP\nv\u00edvoactive follows your progress even when you\u2019re not engaged in a specific activity. The activity tracking app tracks your steps to learn your current activity level, then assigns an attainable daily step count goal. As you meet your milestones, the device will adjust your goal for the next day. The red move bar appears on the display after 1 hour of inactivity and builds when you\u2019ve been sitting too long. Just walk for a couple of minutes to reset the move bar. Set the sleep mode when you go to bed and v\u00edvoactive will monitor your rest. It also tracks your calories burned.\n\n\n\nSTAY CONNECTED\nv\u00edvoactive gently vibrates to alert you to all the same notifications you receive on your compatible Bluetooth-enabled device4. Receive caller ID and missed call information for incoming calls. Text messages include sender information and message. Email messages come with sender and subject. v\u00edvoactive also displays notifications from Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms, as well as other mobile apps, including weather alerts and temperature. Simply touch and swipe the screen to read more, or clear the screen with the press of a button.\n\n\nADVANCED SMARTWATCH FEATURES\nv\u00edvoactive lets you control the tunes on your music player, locate your phone and let your friends and family track your activities in real time with Live Track. You can also remotely control your VIRB Elite action camera.\n\nCUSTOM APPS AND WATCH FACES\nPersonalize v\u00edvoactive with free downloads from our Connect IQ store. You can customize your watch face, add data fields and get apps and widgets that provide information at a glance.\n\n \n\nCHALLENGE YOURSELF\nStay up to date on your progress for each of the built-in activities with automatic syncs with Garmin Connect Mobile. You can earn virtual badges for extra motivation, join online challenges and connect, compete and compare with friends and family around the world. View your history and stats right on the smartwatch.\n\nSHOW YOUR TRUE COLORS\nv\u00edvoactive comes in basic black or bright white to coordinate with your philosophy of style. Swap out additional bands to show your true colors, or dress it up with a leather option in black or white.\n\nIn the Box\n\n * v\u00edvoactive\n * Charging/data clip\n * Manual\n\n\u00b9Heart rate monitor available with some versions; sold separately with others\n\u00b2Sold separately\n\u00b3Syncs when within 30 feet of your compatible smartphone\n4Compatible with iPhone 4S or later and select Bluetooth Smart-capable Android\u2122 devices.
