This would not be so bad except for the fact that the band is very tight and hard to remove and to reinstall. The holder comes with two bands, one of which is supposedly somewhat larger than the other, but I could not tell any difference between them.",

The metal part looks nice and is holding up well after two months. The band gets covered in lint/dust which doesn't bother me or really make it look bad. But it doesn't stay as clean looking as when you first use it. The only other issue is that it's pretty hard to get cards out that aren't on the top or bottom of the stack. Not impossible but just difficult and cumbersome.",

I put in for a return and it was accepted but I have to pay to ship it back and it's not worth it to ship to China. Already bought another wallet. This one isn't worth it.",
