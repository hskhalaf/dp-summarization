Crossing branches, dead branches, branches that were too low all trimmed. Very, very happy with this. One word of advice....watch the oil level. It uses more than one might expect.",

Be sure to have your jug of bar oil with you while you're trimming. The powerful 40V battery will outlast the bar oil in the oil reservoir.

If you keep oil in the reservoir, adjust the chain frequently and avoid torqueing the bar in the cut you are making, this saw is going to please you.",
