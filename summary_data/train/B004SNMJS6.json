There were also complaints about it not being sturdy. I think that the sturdiness depends on how well you put it together. Our 2-year-old son loves going into his toy box to get his toys. We love that it is safe (doesn't close fast/hard) and holds his toys. We've gotten lots of compliments, as it looks great in our family room. I'll probably add a cushion, but that's not a deal breaker for me.",
