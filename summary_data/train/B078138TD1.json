For $20, I was willing to give it a try. And man, am I impressed!! The pictures above are after rolling only TWICE over the span of 1 week. Left is before, right is after. My skin is brighter, tighter, and my scars are fading! I cant wait to see what another month of treatment will do!",

But now I see they have changed the item so I can't even go back and look at the item I bought. The worst part of this though is they did this so that the item they're selling now will show more reviews on it for more sales. THIS IS CHEATING! So, albeit, 1 star!!!!",

The serum has impressive ingredients and even though I didnt plan on using it because I already have a routine, I found that it goes on under makeup very nicely and I like how my skin feels after using it.

My skin the very next day looked so much better after using this that I honestly was shocked. I\u2019ve been using it once a week since and the improvement is so dramatic. I highly recommend this. Follow the instructions carefully! I honestly have not only seen marks and scars fading away, I haven\u2019t been getting new breakouts either.",

It's easy to use, she can feel it prickling her skin, and is the perfect size to allow her to get around her nose and eyebrows. I see her rolling it for about a minute before bedtime. I told her it's probably a good idea to change her pillowcase often so that her face stays clean at night after using this.",

It had a medium price range which I thought was worth it, not being super cheap like $6 but not getting into the $20\u2019s or higher. The feeling can be weird and uncomfortable but that was expected. I use it for my serums and toners to really sink into my skin. I also got a vitamin C serum off Amazon to help reduce my redness and noticed a difference after the first use! I would recommend.",

My face feels plump and smooth when I wake up in the mornings. I can definitely tell when I go a few days without using it! It does make your face itch/sting just a little right after using it, but it\u2019s not bad. It also does squeak, but that doesn\u2019t bother me. The bottle of serum it comes with is huge! Great product for the price! 5 stars!",

I use tea tree face masks and Vitamin C serums with this. I recommend the MEDIHEAL face masks the most, I have sensitive skin and those plus this don't irritate it at all (besides some redness that happens but it fades within 30 minutes due to the roller)",
