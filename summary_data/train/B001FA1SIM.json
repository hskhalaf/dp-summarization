Two, it is really lite wieght. Three, there is no blue light in the rear of the mouse like in the pictures. It does work great with or with out the cord hooked up. I do wish it was a little longer as I have large hands. As far as the dpi 500, 1000, and 4000, I wish it also had a 2000 setting. I have used it a month now and am getting use to it size for the most part.",

Being able to adjust the DPI on the fly is a feature I didn't really look forward to but I probably use it the most. Mainly when switching from regular tasks to games or using photoshop.

(update October 2011) I'm replacing this mouse with a Logitech G400. I'm sick of paying 50+ bucks for mice that dont work right for more than 6 months at a time. The wheel issue never got worse but now the left click is failing with nearly every other click not registering. Not the best thing for gaming as you could imagine.",

The ability to change your DPI setting on the fly is useful, the limitation of having to pick from pre-defined DPI settings instead of being able to set your own is not. The scroll wheel could definitely use some more traction for your finger. Scrolling is harder than it needs to be, but it's not a major issue. I would buy this mouse again, because I think its the best mouse currently out there, but they could have made it so much better.",

Wireless works great, so long as I don't set my phone down next to the mouse. Play and charge works perfect. I've run into 0 problems with this mouse so far.
