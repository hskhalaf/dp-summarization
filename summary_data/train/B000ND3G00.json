I have been super careful when using this pan (using wooden spatula etc. ) and have been taking extra care when cleaning but this pan still developed cracks and scratches within 5-6 months. Moreover, recently I have also seen carbon like material develop on the pan within the first 5 min of usage and hence I have thrown this out. I do own other utensils build using hard anodized material and have gad very different experience ( for good!). This pan definitely is not hard anodized as marketed.

I use my 10\" circle on the stove instead of the ususl 6\" to prevent warping in the middle and never, never go beyond medium as any pan this thin will warp. The non-stick surface seems okay, probably not as tough as my All Clad pans because even with a rubber spatula, it gets micro scratches from salt grains. The double-studded hand is very good. It stays cool to the touch and since it's double-studded, you don't suffer the loose-handle problem with cheap pans that use a single screw.",

Only negative is it does loose its non stick property over use of time ( after 7 months ) and we end up ordering it again. I do wish crepe pan would come in slightly bigger size than the one which is currently available. But definitely worth the buy for $25 !",

It makes a wonderful omelet and I also use it for scramble eggs, as long as I'm making five or less. The sides aren't very deep since it is an crepe pan so more than five scrambled eggs becomes a mess. I always thought I was horrible at making omelets until I discovered this pan.
