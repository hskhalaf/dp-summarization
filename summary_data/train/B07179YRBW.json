Mine didn\u2019t come with any instructions, but it was easy to figure out. If yours doesn\u2019t then I advise putting the top on very last, after the rest of it is assembled and the doors are in place. The assembly hardware was the best I\u2019ve seen in a product like this and it went together square and strong. The doors close on magnetic latches and it is a pleasure to open and close. I am so pleased with this and highly recommend it!",

It is also missing a piece, but fortunately it is a really small piece that doesn\u2019t play a huge factor in the construction of the item, so again, I am okay with this.
