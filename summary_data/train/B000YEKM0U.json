Small, portable, excellent battery life, and AMAZING sound. The speakers remind me of those small Bose radio systems people used to buy that packed a lot of sound. These do just the same, at a much smaller fraction of the price. I was confused why people had trouble turning it on. You just turn a circle! Even children can do this, that's why they make child-proof medication bottles! I really can't understand it, no muscle goes into turning it at all. You just turn the silver circle to 'on.' Great buy!",

      "text": "We've owned this speaker for about a year and a half. We've used it around the house, at barbecues, and on car trips. I even play it next to the pool sometimes when I do water aerobics. The speaker has held up well, considering it's been dropped, thrown around, and splashed. The metal over the speaker has rusted a little, but that's my fault. I don't have any problems turning it on and off (as some of the other reviews have said). My only complaint is that it's not very loud, but given how small (and cheap) it is, I've been very happy with it. I'm actually considering buying a second, now that the price has dropped so much.",

My guests and I use my patio quite a bit and this little speaker gives great background music while we are enjoying conversation and libation. It takes up little room on the table and there is no changing of cd's, adjusting volume, etc. I have bought a number of these as my guests are so impressed with this speaker, I regularly give my speaker to one of my guests. The cost is so minimal and the sound is so big. I don't think it would be enough for a dance party, but to have your own great music playing while visiting with your friends, it can't be beat.",

On and off is achieved by twisting the entire housing, and is most often difficult to do - also, the internal switch is cheap and provides a non-positive feel (you don't know when it's really off). 3. The whole housing is made of cheap Chinese plastic, and is both fragile and temperamental - specifically, the battery case comes loose when you least expect or want it. 4. The cord is a fixed length and non-removable one - if you want the speaker more than 6\" from the ipod, good luck.",

That said, turning the speaker off is still a little difficult. I haven't found any problems with battery life, but I bought some rechargeable AAA's, so I'm not too worried about it.

I had hoped that we could use the device to listen to audio books while traveling in a car. This turned out to be not possible. Most of the books we tried to listen were barely audible. Consequently, the speaker did not amplify enough to compensate for normal road sounds in a car traveling at highway speeds.",

Like others have mentioned, this thing offers great sound and portability; however it will hit static at very high volume (though not much of a problem considering how loud and clear it is on a standard high!). I'll admit the on/off switch issue is slightly difficult, but I actually found the battery cover to be more problematic. It's a challenge to close when you put the batteries in. Even so, I got this free with a credit, meaning for $29 or less there's little complaint for the cost!",

I didn't see any other reviewers with this problem... I don't think I did anything to it. I had to send them both back and ordered a completely different speaker.",

    "description": "AMAZON.COM\nThe ultra-portable iM207 Orbit by Altec Lansing lets you easily share your music with those around you. With a unique design that produces a full-bodied, 360-degree sound, you will hear the music loud and clear. And with a tiny footprint that easily fits in your purse or pocket, you can get the music started for an impromptu party at any time.\n\n \n\nThe Altec Lansing Orbit Speaker:  * projects sound in all directions; \n * can tilt on its edge for personal listening; \n * provides 24 hours of listening on three AAA batteries; and \n * has built-in cord management. \n\n\n\nThe unique round design offers a 360-degree sound. View larger. \n\nTipped on its edge, the speaker can be directed for personal listening. View larger. Unique, Round Design with 360-Degree Sound\nWith just a quick look at the Orbit, you know you're in for something special. Its round form uses a cone design integrated with a custom Altec Lansing speaker to project full, distortion-free sound in every direction. All your friends will hear the music and wonder where the great sound is coming from. If you would like a more personal listening experience, just put the Orbit on its edge for a more focused and directed sound.  At just 3.5 inches in diameter and 1.6 inches tall, the Orbit will go wherever you go. Throw it in your pocket or purse and pull it out wherever you are: on a park bench, on the street corner, waiting for the bus.

And don't worry about damaging the Orbit; it's built to handle even the most reckless travelers. \n\n A smartly designed integrated cable management lets you wrap the cable around the speaker and keeps the stereo mini-plug out of the way when not in use. \n\n Outstanding Battery Life\nYou don't have to worry about battery life with the Orbit; with three AAA batteries, the Orbit will play for up to 24 continuous hours, more than enough to keep the party going all night long. \n\n The Altec Lansing Orbit is backed by a one-year warranty. \n\n What's in the Box\nOrbit speaker (with 3.5-inch cable attached) and user's manual. \n\n\n\n\nGet the party started no matter where you are. \n\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe palm-sized, lightweight Orbit-MP3 speaker system is an ideal companion for your iPod or MP3 player when you want a break from headphones. Or slip it out of a pocket or purse for an attention-getting way to share your tunes anytime, anywhere. The full-bodied, 360-degree sound will make your friends wonder where the speakers are. And with its long battery life, the music keeps playing long into the night.\n\n What's in the Box\n\n iM207 Orbit-MP3 speaker and user's manual.",
