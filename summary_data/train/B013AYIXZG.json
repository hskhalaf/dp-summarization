      "text": "OK. So a co-worker was looking at these, and decided to go with a cheaper pair. I wasn't that impressed. But once his arrived, I loved the look, but wanted the specific Pink/Wood combination, and the company he went with didn't offer this pairing. Sooooooo, I ended up back on Tree Tribe's sellers page. I absolutely LOVE these glasses. They are bright, lightweight, beautifully textured. Just a really unique and separate way to stylize your look. Unfortunately it has been quite overcast the last week or so, but you know what....I am wearing my shades anyway because they look great on. Thanks for your hard work guys, and thanks for planting those trees too!",

The polarized lenses make for a strong protection against the sun and also has a great look to them. I also love bamboo products and it feels great that I'm contributing to a cause that's bettering our world. I got the pink shades, and they are the perfect pair to rock at the beach or by the pool.",
