I'm just kinda disappointed because i've had a Sony W130 and the new one doesn't add much up to the package. Except for a couple new Scene modes (food and underwater, features that usually most people won't EVER use), a Spot focus mode and the 12.1 MPxels, it's quite the same, and i'm sure you could get a W180 for almost [...] bucks less.",

The camera function switches are kind of confusing (I'm a guy we don't read instructions unless we have too) but if you play with it for a while everything starts to make sense. I have great hopes for this little camera and so far it seems as if it will fill the bill with ease.",

There was no question that I would rebuy a similar model from Sony. Key to a new product are easy to follow directions and a user-friendly apparatus which is exactly this. Admittedly, I'm still getting to know some mechanisms, but the more I learn the \"cooler\" I think it is. I have confidence in my digital prints and the 12 MP contributes to this.",

    "description": "The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W220 combines point-and-shoot ease-of-use with advanced features in a sophisticated, compact body. Smile Shutter technology allows you to capture a smile the moment it happens, and the Carl Zeiss 4x optical zoom lens, Optical SteadyShot image stabilization, and 12.1 megapixel resolution deliver crisp, clear images.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nFrom the Manufacturer \n\nThis one's got it all. The Cyber-shot DSC-W220 combines point-and-shoot ease-of-use with advanced features in a sophisticated, compact body. Smile Shutter technology allows you to capture a smile the moment it happens, and the Carl Zeiss 4x optical zoom lens, Optical SteadyShot image stabilization, and 12.1-megapixel resolution deliver crisp, clear images. \n\nSony Cyber-shot DSC-W220 Highlights \n\n12.1-megapixel Super HAD CCD Image Sensor\nA powerful 12.1 megapixel 1/2.3-inch Super HAD CCD image sensor helps you capture gorgeous images with superb contrast and clarity down to the finest detail. With 12.1 megapixels, you can create stunning, photo-quality prints up to A3 size, or crop your images and still come away with high resolution shots. \n\nCarl Zeiss Vario-Tessar Lens with 4x Optical Zoom\n4x optical zoom lens captures sharp images, even from a distance. \n\n2.7-inch Clear Photo LCD display (230k pixels)\nGenerous 2.7-inch (230K pixels) Clear Photo LCD display features sharp, natural color that makes it easy to compose shots, read menus, and view photos, even in bright sunlight. \n\nBIONZ image processor\nThe BIONZ image processor delivers the high resolution and fast performance you expect from a Sony digital camera. \n\n\n\nFace Detection technology\nFace Detection technology detects up to eight individual faces and controls flash, focus, exposure, and white balance to deliver accurate, natural skin tones with reduced red-eye for beautiful images of family and friends. Face Detection technology can even distinguish between children and adults, so you can prioritize the camera\u2019s focus on children in the scene for clear images of their memorable moments. \n\nSmile Shutter technology\nThe popular Smile Shutter technology automatically detects and captures a smiling face. Simply choose the Smiley Face feature and the camera will capture a smile the moment it happens. You can also select subject priority (Adult or Child Priority or touch subject on screen) and indicate the degree of Smile Detection Sensitivity to high (small smile), medium (laugh), or low (grin). \n\nDouble Anti-blur Solution\nThe combination of Optical SteadyShot image stabilization and High ISO sensitivity helps compensate for shaky hands, minimizes blur, and allows flash-free shooting to preserve the mood. \n\nSteadyShot image stabilization Optical SteadyShot image stabilization\nOptical SteadyShot image stabilization uses a built-in gyro sensor to detect camera shake and automatically shifts the lens to help prevent blur without sacrificing image quality. \n\nHigh Sensitivity Mode (ISO 3200)\nHigh ISO allows for faster shutter speed, so you can take photos indoors or in low light without the need for a flash. In addition to High Sensitivity Mode (ISO), you can select up to eight ISO settings (Auto, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200) when shooting in Program Auto Mode to adjust sensitivity to your shooting conditions. \n\nConvenient Photo Modes\nChoose from 14 convenient photo modes to quickly adjust for specific shooting conditions. Photo modes include Auto, Program Auto, Easy Shooting, Smile Shutter technology, High Sensitivity, Landscape, Soft Snap, Twilight Portrait and scene selections such as Twilight, Beach, Snow, Fireworks, Underwater and Gourmet Mode. Gourmet Mode lets you capture mouth-watering culinary creations with all the color and clarity of images you see in gourmet magazines. \n\nIntelligent Scene Recognition in action Intelligent Scene Recognition\nIntelligent Scene Recognition (iSCN) Mode automatically detects five different types of scenes and selects the appropriate camera settings: Backlight, Backlight Portrait, Twilight, Twilight Portrait, and Twilight using a Tripod. iSCN has 2 modes: Auto and Advanced. In Auto Mode, the camera takes a single shot using the optimal settings. In Advance Mode, the camera takes a photo with the standard automatic settings and only if necessary takes a second photo with optimized setting. \n\nDynamic Range Optimizer Standard and Plus\nDynamic Range Optimizer (DRO) Standard and Plus uses a sophisticated algorithm to determine the best exposure and contrast settings for almost any shooting environment. The result is more natural images with clearer details that more closely match what your naked eye sees. DRO is particularly effective when shooting backlit portraits or any scene with a dramatic contrast between background and foreground lighting. DRO Plus allows for even greater optimization by analyzing each region of an image and performing additional image processing. \n\nFunction Guide\nThis beginner-friendly optional function helps navigate through the various functions and settings displaying the description of chosen functions or settings on the LCD screen. \n\nEasy Shooting Mode\nWith Easy Shooting Mode, even beginners can take great photos. In Easy Shooting Mode, easy-to-understand basic instructions are displayed on the LCD screen and the camera switches to all automatic settings so you can just take the photo without worrying about settings. \n\nMPEG Movie VX Fine Mode\nCapture VX Fine (640x480) audio/video clips at a high frame rate (up to 30 frames per second). The maximum length of time you can shoot continuously is approximately 10 minutes. \n\n16:9 High Resolution Mode\nUsing the 16:9 High Resolution Mode, you can record high resolution images in the 16:9 aspect ratio favored by HDTVs. This setting is ideal if you plan to view your images on a compatible HDTV and invite friends and family members over for a slideshow. \n\nMemory Stick Duo Media Convenience\nThe Cyber-shot DSC-W220 camera accepts Memory Stick Duo media or Memory Stick PRO Duo media (both sold separately). \n\nStamina Battery Power\nProvides extended battery life and shooting capacity when using a fully-charged lithium-ion battery. The included battery supports up to 370 shots. \n\nIn-Camera Retouching Tools\nRetouch and enhance your photos on the go with in-camera Trimming and Red-Eye Correction functions. \n\nHDTV Compatibility\nView your photos in glorious high definition on a Sony BRAVIA or similar compatible HDTV using the included HD output adapter cable (VMC-MHC2, sold separately) \n\nPhotoTV HD\nBring your photos to life and enjoy highly detailed, Full HD 1920x1080 images with PhotoTV HD-capable Sony BRAVIA HDTVs (HDTV sold separately). PhotoTV HD fine tunes settings on your HDTV, such as sharpness, gradation, and color to display images that look more like actual printed photos. \n\nPHOTOMUSIC feature\nPHOTOMUSIC combines images with music to produce fun and entertaining slide shows. The five standard visual effects (Simple, Basic, Nostalgic, Active, and Stylish) are supplemented with three face priority effects: Face1 (Basic), Face2 (Nostalgic), and Face3 (Stylish). Select from eight pre-loaded tracks on camera or transfer your own from your compatible PC (sold separately). \n\nWide Zoom display\nTo use the entire image area of the compatible HDTV screen (sold separately), Wide Zoom display automatically expands standard 4:3 and 3:2 images to 16:9. \n\nMulti-purpose Resize function\nThe Multi-purpose Resize function lets you change the aspect ratio of an image right in the camera, so you can adjust images as necessary, whether you want to display them on a compatible HDTV, e-mail them, or upload them to a blog (compatible PC with internet connection required). \n\nPicture Motion Browser ver. 4.2\nSony PMB (Picture Motion Browser ) software7 provides a simple, easy-to-use way to transfer video and still images to your compatible PC, as well as sort, edit, and output to data disc and the Web. Finding your images with PMB is easy with Calendar view and Face Search. Face Search allows you to filter by faces (one or many) and also a specific person\u2019s face.
