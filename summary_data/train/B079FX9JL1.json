I either throw it in the sink while washing bottles or throw it in the washing machine with the baby's clothes. Either way, super easy and effective.",

Before this we threw them in the corner of the kitchen or bathroom so they could dry out before I put them in the hamper. I couldn\u2019t stand the sight of them after awhile, needed a better solution. This bag works wonders, holds almost 50 cleaning wipes and they dry out just fine in the bag so they don\u2019t smell before putting in the wash. It\u2019s hangs flat and flush in limited storage spaces and it\u2019s gosh darn cute too with the cactus print!",

For background, when leaving vacation, we usually need to check out of the room hours before our flight; so, we usually go swimming while we wait, which means we need to put a wet bathing suit in our suitcase. It was probably in the suitcase for about 5-6 hours, and it leaked through the bag. Not a lot, but enough to get surrounding items wet. So, if it's a few hours, you might be ok, but it isn't 100% waterproof. Otherwise, great idea!",

We wash the wet bags with the diapers, and my other bag from another brand is still going strong and conceals even poop odors. This bag though...it has started to delaminate. That means the waterproof lining inside is coming apart. The bag gets damp from the inside and, when stored inside the diaper bag with a pee diaper, will still leave the things it touches damp THROUGH the wet bag. Naturally, this is a problem. So we will be either tossing this bag and replacing eith the preferred brand, or will use this for something else.",

I will probably invest in a wet/dry bag later on to separate the wet vs dry (obviously). However, so far Im very happy with this product!",
