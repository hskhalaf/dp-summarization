The arm rest part doesn't stay put and the strap on the covers only secure the middle of the covers. There should be straps to secure the headrest area as well as the bottom so it stays in place.

But as soon as we washed it, the coating or whatever made it waterproof went away. The cover itself is good quality and easily washable in the washing machine. It's not too heavy so you can easily throw it on and take it off as well. Just don't expect any water or liquid resistance, it just soaks right through after washing it one time.",

It came with a strange elastic piece I still never figured out how to use. It didn't come with instructions. Style-wise, our work couch now looks pretty homey. Perhaps pillows will make it better.

I learned that there is 'another' zipper where I finally found the cord. So the instructions are incorrect, but I was able to get quick response from the company.",

This lasted a week before I tossed it into the trash.",
