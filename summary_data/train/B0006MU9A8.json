The small dogs' teeth were very dirty, with thick calculus on their upper molars. I decided to try this powder. I give each dog a small scoop each night right before bed. I also have started letting them chew bully sticks (the no odor ones) each evening. I can't believe the difference. It has taken about a month but the calculus has chipped off their molars and their breath is so much better. I didn't really believe this would work but it does. 5 stars!!!",

Having recently spent $2600.00 on cleaning and extracting teeth on 2 pugs, we have begun to be more pro-active in keeping their teeth healthy. Dogs with reduced snout length have very crowded teeth.
