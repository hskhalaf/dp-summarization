My skin just appears so much more healthier. I give it a month and my acne scars will be gone/faded.

There\u2019s a million other clay masks, so my recommendation is skip this one and buy a different product.",

Instructions say apply for 5-10 minutes\u2014lean toward 5, especially for sensitive skin. It is normal to have some redness for up to 30 minutes or so after use. This typically resolves.

I get a lot of dirt on my chin and around my nose. This mask not only got rid of all the blackheads on my nose, but it brought all the dirt and oil up to the surface of my skin. It also shrunk my pores. I even had to use a moisturizer on my face because it absorbed all the oil. This stuff is great. I would recommend that you give it a try",

You can really feel it pulsing on your skin, and even though it\u2019s a bit uncomfortable, if you wait 5 mins or so after the pulsing and wash it off, you\u2019ll visually see how it improved the blood circulation in the face. Aka, your face will be red. But, this quickly fades and by the next day or even that same evening you\u2019ll see a reduction in acne spots, that dark spots faded, and your skin will look really soft. It doesn\u2019t feel drying, literally just by bringing blood to the surface it regenerates and renews the skin and reduces imperfections. If you want a product that works, this is literally it.",

If it\u2019s too dry, add a little bit more liquid. Too wet and bubbly, add a little bit more clay. And when rinsing, wet your hands and pat it on your face and then massage it away.",
