No additional zoom. the built in flash isn't reaching the far left bottom corner. it's ruining all my indoor pictures that require flash. I'm not sure if this is a design flaw or just my camera. Now, i'm not sure i want to keep this camera as i do take a lot indoor photos. If anyone has a solution, please share! Outdoor photos turn out great! No shutter lag. Crisp photos. camera itself isn't too big nor too small. feels great in my hand.",

I've taken pictures of things I could only see in detail once I took the picture/ This is by far the best feature of the camera! Decent battery life- it'll get you through a full day of tourist photographing, etc, but when on a trip you will need to recharge each night if you're using it a lot. Filming is also good, though the audio isn't great and non techies seem confused about how to activate filming mode. Cons- Can be somewhat grainy.",

I have been using it to shoot interiors of homes with a tripod, no flash, and the camera's HDR feature with great success. Images come out well balanced with accurate colors and adequate sharpness. My only complaint is that the camera can be a bit slow at times. Sometimes it takes a few seconds to process an image before you can take another shot. While not that big of a deal, it can get annoying. I've even tried a faster class 10 SD card but it is the camera that is causing the bottle neck.",

      "text": "I bought this camera to replace my 2 year old Lumix ZS-15 which, after 2 years and about 2,000 photos, developed contamination on the light sensor and internal lens. I am not a careless user, having been an avid hobbyist for more than 30 years so I suspect a flaw in the design. This makes me suspicious of the ZS-20 but I gambled because the Leica lens makes very sharp images. I am disappointed at Panasonic's total lack of response to my queries about suggestions on how to avoid this contamination. I have now made about 200 pictures with the ZS020 and it has performed well so far.",

Want to set your own shutter speed and lens opening? Easy, just select another mode. The ease of a point-and-shoot with the power to experiment. Even the menu system makes sense (unlike cameras from some other manufacturers). Small, fits in your pocket, takes very good pictures even in low light. The zoom is amazing too.",

Put those together and you have a very attractive package. Also to be noted is the GPS, which I find useful. It's a fairly easy camera to use, and the picture quality and performance are certainly comparable to other cameras in the same price range. Recommended, especially since the price has dropped to well under $200.",

But the photo quality is great and taking videos is much easier thanks to the record button on the top (no need to switch modes anymore). This one has a real \"on/off\" switch, which was the reason I chose it. (I hear newer models have replaced with a button that can be accidentally triggered too easily).",

It's quick, it's got a wide angle, it takes great action shots (in good light), and the zoom is fantastic. For me, this camera is the perfect travel companion and all-rounder.

I was able to shoot decent videos in low light. Tu sum-up, this is a great camera to keep on me at all times, in particular when I do not want to carry around my large SLR. It is NOT an SLR replacement for me but complements it quite nicely.",
