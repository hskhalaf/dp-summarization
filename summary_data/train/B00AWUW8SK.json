But that is easy to deal with. Updated 5-30-2016 - I loved this duck until it stopped working after 5 months. I replaced the batteries and it worked for one bath. Now I have a duck that doesn't even squeak :(",

Based on the reviews this product truly is hit or miss for longevity and mine was a miss. I would purchase a different/ more reliable product unless you really want a crocodile and are willing to gamble with it's longevity.",

After our 10 min bath it stays on taking the temp of the room. Don't really need that as we have central heat and air so I already know what the temp of my house is. This could be improved with an off button or to only turn on when in water.",
