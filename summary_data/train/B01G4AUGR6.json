One thing I would say is the speakers built in are absolute garbage, You can't use them for anything. Get yourself a set of separate speakers. I bought a set of Bose Companion 50 speakers and all is good. Didn't take a star off because monitors are all about the picture, not sound. Also remember. THE SCREWS FOR THE ARM ARE TAPED TO THE WRAPPING FOR THE BASE. Everyone seems to miss them.",

Ignore peoples comments when they say they don't like the color, within the menu (which is simple to use with the separate controller) you can tweak a lot of settings from color to brightness. If I was nit picking, the menu is little out dated and (without controller) is little difficult to use but you only go in there once and never again. Over all, well recommended!",
