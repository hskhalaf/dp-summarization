The arch support initially felt a bit out of position on one side (due to my asymmetrical feet) , but the shoe seemed to adapt to that pretty quickly. The color in reality is not as light / bright as the picture. This does not concern me, but the picture is inaccurate in that respect. Otherwise, all is as I expected. I'm ordering another pair in black.",

My feet don't overheat in these shoes as they do in some other similar hiking shoes I've had, but they don't seem to get cold in cold weather either. I love them! When they wear out, I'll be looking to replace them with a new set that are the exact same brand and style.",

The other pair's right shoe had (I guess) extra material sewn in in of the stitches, so it rubbed painfully against my foot.

Just a pair of thinner socks will make a big difference this summer and I would recommend ordering a bigger size than you normally wear and happy walking.",

Great shoe since I purchased them based on the company reputation for excellent shoes.",

They feel broken in after a day or two of use and feel very sturdy and well built. I highly recommend them.",
