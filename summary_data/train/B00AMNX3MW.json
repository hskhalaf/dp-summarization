We lit it on top of our coffee table and were so impressed that while the fireplace gives off heat, none of it effects the surface that the fireplace is sitting on. It made the place so cozy. Additionally, it came with an instruction manual which I know a lot of people are saying that theirs didn't. Mine also came with a funnel, and a sparker to safely light the fire. I wasn't expecting all of this, but was extremely excited that it was all included because it makes the product so much easier to use.",

The fire has a nice soothing, dancing flame that is pleasant to watch. It actually gives off some heat which we really enjoy. It works great indoors and eventually we will try it outdoors when the weather permits. Easy to assemble and easy to use. So far we are very happy with the purchase.",

The answer I received was that this product used to be sold with the wick, a 5\"x8\" white wick that is placed in the fuel container, then the fuel added and the wick absorbs most of it. He said many customers would call after about 2 years asking to buy a new wick. Now, they are selling the product without the wick, and I just happened to receive one with a wick. I was told the fireplace can be used with or without a wick.",

Not much heat with the smaller flame but still very nice ambiance. It does seem to need almost a third of a liter (standard bottle the fuel sells in) to light up so even though it will last a while it will require you to burn a good bit of fuel.",

      "text": "This is an awesome ambiance piece and it takes the dampness out of the air on these cold nights. I wish it came with a funnel to fill it though. I did set my end table on fire one night because I filled it too full and apparently when it gets hot it bubbles up a bit and dripped onto the end table. Scary for a few moments but I was able to put it out with minimal damage. Otherwise it is awesome :0)",
