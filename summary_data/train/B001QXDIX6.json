      "text": "Let me start by saying I love Little Tikes, and their kitchens in particular. This one is not one of them. I am not sure what happened here but this is a drastic departure from their normal quality standard. Most of the parts fit together badly if they fit at all. It looks mostly ok when you get it totally put together but there is no way it will last 3 months of continuous play. So very disappointed. Bonus they included every language instruction but English. At least that was not the worst bit for those of us who have done this before. \ud83d\ude31",

The \"oven\" door didn't open or close properly, and there was a portion of the counter that had been damaged in such a way that it left a very sharp edge of plastic on one side that would definitely have been dangerous for a little child. It seemed pretty clear to me that the product was damaged before it was sent because the box did not show any signs of having been dropped or hit. The return procedure was followed and I received a refund, but it was a huge waste of time.",

This purchase was made for my grandchildren to play with at my house. Unfortunately, companies change. It would have been so easy for Little Tikes to drill holes to make the door attachment easier.

Good for people with limited space. Thankfully after reading other reviews and seeing so many missing pieces we did not have that problem. However all the reviews about the door not working are true. Its not trimmed enough so the door scrapes the kitchen. To make it work you need to file the plastic so that the door can open more than a few inches. Other than that for a kids kitchen it's fairly underwhelming but not a bad choice.",

I was a little leery of the assembly process after reading other reviews, but it was not a problem at all. My husband had it together in about half an hour, and it would've been quicker than that without our daughters \"helping him\".",

Their solution to lazy manufacturing was to us to use soap/lubricant to slide the feet on, but they were so weak/hollow that we were still crushing them trying to get them on. Other than all the assembly frustrations, it is a great little compact kitchen.",

My only complaint is that the oven and fridge parts are extremely narrow, the pan the set comes with barely fits in it, and other pieces from other cooking play sets definitely won't fit in there. Other than that, amazing, and my daughter truly loves it.",

Since it is made of molded plastic you have no adjustment area to make sure pieces fix exactly the way they are supposed to, the white cabinet door is made a bit smaller than the opening so the door doesn't stay closed. Plus be very careful with the stickers they have no error or realignment glue applied, so you have no room for mistakes.",
