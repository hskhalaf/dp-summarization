He actually swiped one of my USB pads so I have to get a replacement. He\u2019s going to be replacing his travel charger with this one. It\u2019s so easy to just set it down and let it charge than trying to keep track of wires. I also just plugged it directly into the wall, since most complaints were about it not charging if the PlayStation is off. I love it so much.",

Whats the point in that? Were AC plugs so expensive it would have broke the bank using that type of power source? This is almost completely worthless as a charging port. Instead of turning your PS4 on to play games, you have to turn it on to charge your controllers. I'm looking for a different one already.",

I was skeptical at first as the charging yellow light atop the controller did not pulsate as it normally should but I then realized the controller was already fully charged, at which point the front of the product will elicit a steady blue light from the front of the unit. After using the controller for a while then placing it back on its mount on the unit I found the blue light to be red, indicating the controller is being charged. But my favorite thing about this charger is its striking resemblance to my PS4 console; it's very aesthetically pleasing.",
