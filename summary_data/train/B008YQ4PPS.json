I added some remote control candles and it looks good in my Tiffany &Co inspired bathroom. Overall, it is not very big. It's more of an off white/cream color than it is pure white. *last photo (in front of window) is how it looked out of the box.",

I got the remote control battery candles for it, and they\u2019re perfect! I wrapped the ends in tissue to make them fit tightly. I also ordered the acrylic crystal bead strands to give it some more flair. The strands were so easy to work with. Each bead is attached by a ring like a keychain, so it\u2019s sinple to attach wherever you want more strands. Super cute!",

I took another person's idea and embellished it with more crystals. Too bad one prong was badly bend and others were repairable.",
