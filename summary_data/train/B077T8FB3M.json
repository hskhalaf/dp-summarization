Listening to music is such a pleasure whether using headphones or plugging the phone into my home preamp. It is my opinion that all premium phones should emulate the great DAC found in the LG v30.",

Of course there are some LG apps but not to bad and I also recommend a case due to the glass back for better grip and a screen protector.",
