It comes only with a power cord, no cables to connect. This is the 2nd Oki ML320 we've purchased in 2 years. Periodic maintenance (compressed air to blow out paper) is about the only thing you need to do. I love this model but pray for the day we no longer need a dot-matrix.",

This 9-pin printer is now engineered even tougher for dedicated printing in the most demanding point-of-sale, automation and utility applications. It can easily run twice as long as most printers in its class! And it's economical enough to put wherever you need data on the spot.\n\n The ML320/321 Turbo puts the \"work\" in workstations for financial departments, wholesale or retail sales counters, even for harsh or warehouse or manufacturing environments. Its relentless performance comes from the rugged printhead design\u2014the lighter, stronger, more efficient motor; the long-lasting rack-and-pinion drive system; a protective, impact-resistant chassis; and a high performance that goes the distance.\n\n The printer can accommodate multi-part forms and stock that are up to twice as thick as those that fit our nearest competitor. The printhead delivers a stronger punch\u2014right to the last page of a six-part form! A patented optical sensor accurately positions the printhead for the precise output, and the auto-tear feature accurately positions your continuous forms for a clean tear right at the perforation\u2014eliminating wasted forms.\n\n The ML320/321 Turbo can meet your needs today and in the future. It's exactly the same size as the legendary ML320/321 and it's compatible with virtually all custom and off-the-shelf software, making it the perfect replacement. This machine has all the Tank-Tough reliability and high performance you need.\n\n What's in the Box\nML 320 Turbo Printer, power cable, CD-ROM, user guide, warranty information; printer cable not included",
