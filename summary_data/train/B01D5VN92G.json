I don't recommend trying to use these pouches to pour by-load detergent measurements, but after I purchased a couple 100oz bottles from the store I can use these pouches to refill them. The pour spout is well designed; take off the cap, tip it over the bottle and it drains completely. No squeezing, gurgling or trying to suck air; just completely drains into the bottle and when it stops the pouch is empty to be thrown away.",

Definitely NOT the original scent Tide this time around. So disappointed; one of the biggest reasons I use Tide is because of the scent - it reminds me of growing up.",

I have switched from pods to liquids as pods do not always fully dissolve in cold water and sometimes the outer layer sticks on clothes making you re-wash. Liquid > Pods!
