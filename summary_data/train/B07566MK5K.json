I have zero experience in animal cages but I have to say, I was and am not disappointed by this cage. Had it assembled in about 10 minutes while following the simple directions. The balcony is the perfect place for food and under is the perfect hiding space for the piggies. I also like the deep plastic base. I don't think the piggies will be throwing out the bedding at all which is nice. They have taken to the cage very well. So far we love it.",

I measured it out and everything so I should have known, but I was still scared it was going to be to small bc of how miniature it looks in the pictures. But I was surprised when it came, and my husband even thought the box was half styrofoam bc of how big it was. My ferret loves it and honestly so do I. She has a great amount of space for how little I payed, and the top level gives it even more space. The only negative is that the ramp came broken, so I had to throw it out since it was unuseable.",

I dont need the food trays either or the waterer for the chicks. THis is plenty big enough for bantam chicks and young chicks when starting out. Keeps the heat lamp at a good height too. Love it.",

It's even bigger than I had expected, and came with lots of extras!! The \"upstairs\" shelf is great for the food dish (included) to prevent tipping! The high plastic bottom keeps the litter/bedding inside, where it belongs, and the hay chute keeps the Timothy hay out of the litter!!! And all for about half what you'd pay at a pet store!!! Very pleased with this purchase!!",

The only measurement that was correct was the height, and that's the least of my concerns for a baby guinea pig that's going to need space to grow before being introduced to the big girl cage after her quarantine period is done. I don't know what the actual measurements are for the bigger sizes of cages offered, but for this size I could have gotten almost the same measurements, same build and sturdiness for about $15 cheaper with another brand, even right here on Amazon.",

About a month ago my rats learned they could chew through the plastic base - after patching 2 holes it soon became a daily problem. Eventually ordered a Critter Nation.
