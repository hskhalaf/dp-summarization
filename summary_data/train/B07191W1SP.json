      "text": "I gave 3 stars because it does produce a picture but this projector is very week and it is inadequate for home theater use. It might be great for color diagram presentation but the contrast ratio is so small it renders low light scenes indistinguishable. Settings are minimal. When projector is oriented lower or higher than the optimal perpendicular projection line an optical screen tilt allows for aligning the edges but it also makes the top or bottom part of the screen blurry. Colors are all over the place so much that it renders a vivid Disney movie painful to watch so I wouldn\u2019t punish any children with it.",

The internal speaker stopped working and the sound output jack also has no signal. headphones, stereo, speakers...no sound. Tried multiple discs, including some that previously worked, different DVD players and different cables and couldn't get sound. Contacted BlueSky and spent a couple weeks answering questions and doing some troubleshooting before they told me their engineers say there are no failure modes that can cause the sound to go out. They asked if I wanted to return it and then never heard from them again.",
