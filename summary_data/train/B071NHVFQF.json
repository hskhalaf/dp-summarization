      "text": "Finally someone has put major thought into perfecting the outdoor TV cover. Great 360 degree protection for my TCL 65\" TV without taking off the cover. Besides zipping shut on both sides, the cover has Velcro to seal the bottom and back to seal the wall mount and cable entry. Also, has a pocket to seal the remote. The cover has enough room in the rear to extend protection when pulled from the wall (as seen in picture). My TV cable box was able to fit under the cover and zip tie to the wall mount hanger. Very pleased with the A1Cover outdoor TV cover. DaveM, Friendswood TX.",

      "text": "I am extremely impressed with this TV cover. I purchased a relatively inexpensive TV (TCL 43\" ROKU TV, under $250) since I was a bit skeptical that this cover would really keep my TV dry. I installed the TV outside last week with the A1 cover. We received unusually heavy rains last week in NJ (over 6\"). The TV remained perfectly dry. I can't think of a better test for this short of dropping the TV in the pool :). I really appreciate the zippers and velcro strap on the front flap so you don't have to take the cover off each time you watch. I highly reccomend this product!",

It's a little baggy but still looks good. Very functional and easy to use. Wrapped the flatscreen, velcroed up the back in about 5 minutes. Really nice the way the front rolls up, almost completely out of the way for viewing. Seems really well made. And between zippers and velcro closures, I'd be surprised if the Toshiba ever gets dusty.

I have had a TV outside for years using a traditional cover that you had to take off when you wanted to watch. What makes this so great is you just have to unzip it to watch the TV, we tend to watch TV a few hours at night (usually a game) and this has served that purpose quite well. My TV is set up with hanging plants in the vicinity so the sprinklers do hit the TV cover and so far no issues with any moisture build up.",

The two downfalls that I docked one star off of my rating is because I thought the sides had zippers and Velcro and they don\u2019t. Just the bottom has Velcro. Secondly it\u2019s pretty dang hard to get the thing unzipped and the front part flipped over to uncover it when the top of my tv is 6.5 feet off the ground. This isn\u2019t really the manufacturers fault but I\u2019m not sure what could be changed about the design to help make the easier (pulley string of sorts?).
