Also, rocks get stuck in the groves of these shoes more than any other shoe I have owned, about 8 per shoe for a 1 mile run on dirt with rocks. Me: I use to run a lot and fast, now at 53 years of age and 136 pounds, I run 2 or 3 times each week 2.2 miles each time, and am 5'10\" tall.",

While these are certainly comfortable, they don't fit quite the same as pairs that I've purchased in the past. I would still recommend them, but you might want to see if you can try some on before you buy them.",
