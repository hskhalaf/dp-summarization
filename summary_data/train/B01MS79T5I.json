Car seats for littles recommended this seat because the shoulder straps go to 3 inches higher than the other seats on the market. Mine was an open box with a visible \u2018defect\u2019 that I honestly can not find. The seat feels so safe and was SOOO easy to install. I\u2019m SUPER impressed.",

We still use harness in main car because I feel it is safer in traffic. My kids love the cup holders. They are large so I don't know if you could fit 3 across a bench seat.",
