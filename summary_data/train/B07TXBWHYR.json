The Glocalme app kept showing a crash error (\"android app stopped\") but it kept working when you select 'close\". But the major issue is that almost everywhere around the world that I have seen to activate a sim you do it via text messaging or calling the local provider. This device does not provide that capability therefore you have to borrow someones phone or find another way to activate the sim which is a huge burden and bothersome so I returned it.",

My only minor complaint is that if you rename the wifi and turn it off, it loses the name, so you have to rename it net time. There may be a way to save it, but I haven't found it yet. You can just leave the factory name and password, and it works fine.",

Some initial lag when loading apps(Maps, TripAdvisor) 2.) Touchscreen isn't as responsive as a smartphone 3.) Does not come with an adapter (only usb cable) All-in-all, it serves it's main purpose as a useful & effective 4G Global data hotspot. If aesthetics are important to you I would recommend this upgrade. If function is important to you then there is no need to upgrade from a G3 Terminal as it seems to be just as effective as it's predecessor in serving up 4G data. These hotspots have been useful when traveling or emergency situations",

The device is intuitive to use and easy to set up. Plans are inexpensive and easy to purchase. This device allowed us to travel off the beaten path and still use GPS for reliable directions.",
