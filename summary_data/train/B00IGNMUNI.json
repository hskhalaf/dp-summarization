The paint is peeling off at the edges which makes it dangerous to cook with as I don't want any leaching into food.",

After washing them in the top rack of the dishwasher, and using them later, I could taste detergent on the chicken nuggets that i heated up that were placed on one of these mats. On another mat that I washed washed with hot water wiped down, I could still smell the baked zucchini and carrots I had made a few days prior. Would NOT recommend!!!",

Also glad to have the small size. I also like the fact that the company contacted me to make sure I liked the product and that everything was ok. Can't go wrong with these mats. Use these to make cookies and it will save you a lot of works.",

Usually the biscuits get very dark on the bottom before they completely cook, but the bottoms were perfect. I cannot wait to cook cookies on these.",
