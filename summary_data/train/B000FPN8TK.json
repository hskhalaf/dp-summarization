However, after few weeks of using it, I noticed it is leaking from the bottom and making a big mess and leaving Tea stains all over my desk. Is there is way to fix this? Why this is happening over time? I would give a 5-stare if it did not leak but now it is making a huge mess everywhere and everytime that I make tea. I hope I can fix this. I also wish there was a way to clean inside the lock-in mechanism since it get dirty/black over time. Thanks, Kamran",

I don't have any issues with the water in it before I dispense the tea, only after. I'm not sure if it's pooling up somewhere or actually leaking -- but it does make a good mess if I don't put it on a napkin. Easily a 5 star if it didn't make a mess on my desk without a napkin.",

I heat water in a drinking cup, pour it in this device w/some green tea leaves and empty the tea back into the original cup. This tea maker rinses spotless in 2 seconds. The lid is a bit tricky, but it does come off for the occasional run through the dishwasher.",

I put 3 founded scoops of dark roast coffee (I love the Trader Joe's Bay Blend), pour hot water heated to 212o F over the ground, stir a few seconds, let it sit a minute or so, and then put it on top of my mug. Coffee is hot, strong, and tasty. Really easy to use and easy to clean\u2014just lift off the lid (easily to remove and replace and doesn't feel like it's going to break), rinse, and dry. Very happy with this device.",

To be perfectly honest, I did wash this in the dishwasher, top rack, about once a month (rinsed it clean every day after use). I also soaked it in vinegar once (1 hour) to try and get the mineral deposits off with no luck. The plastic on this just got very soft after daily use for 7 months. I was going to get a replacement but see now that there are many more options so I'm shopping around and won't buy this one again.",

Two things - a little awkward to clean and I burned myself by picking it up and accidentally bumping the bottom ring and dispensing very hot tea on my hand. So, don't be clumsy and thoughtless with this product! I would recommend it and buy it again.",

I started drinking loose leaf tea for the first time, and this works very well. I had one leak incident, but that was because I didn't push the filter back in all the way, have not had a problem since.

    "description": "Size:16-ounceIngenuiTEA is a brilliant - arguably the simplest - device for preparing loose tea. Unlike the 'French Press' teapots which crush and bruise the leaves, our teapot's ingenious design uses gravity, not force, to strain the leaves. The result is great taste with less effort. To filter, simply place the ingenuiTEA atop your cup. A valve at the bottom will open, allowing crystal-clear tea to flow, while a mesh filter retains the leaves and sediment. The clean-up is equally as easy as the teapot is dishwasher safe. Made in Taiwan using food-grade plastic. Available in 16 oz. as well as 32 oz. size that's ideal for brewing a pitcher of iced tea. Perfect for foodservice, restaurant and other professional industrial uses. Bulk pricing available through Adagio Wholesale.",
