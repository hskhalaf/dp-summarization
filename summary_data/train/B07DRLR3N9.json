      "verdict": "The designers of KEEN gave hikers a new choice when it comes to exploring the outdoors. The Axis Evo Mid wears a sneaker-like facade, yet it also carries the support of a hiking boot. These attributes are packed in a lightweight build. Add to that is its provision of immediate comfort and grippy ride. However, its fit seems to be amiss.Overall, the pros of the KEEN Axis Evo Mid appeal more to narrow-footed wearers. They must be willing to size down though.",

His only complaint is the new trend of eliminating the tongue which makes them harder to get on but still a good purchase. He doesn\u2019t hike and wears them daily.",
