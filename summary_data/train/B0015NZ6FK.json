The one from late 2017 was a waste of money. The manufacturer changed the product so use newer & less breathable materials. It completely ruins any appeal that this product once had and Sleep Master is coasting by on the once high reviews of this product. Amazon should tear this product listing down and force Sleep Master to start again with 0 reviews. That would be fair to consumers, but as stands now, I've been swindled out of my money for an subpar product.",

Previously it was made of heavy silk that was comfortable and cool. It is now made of cheap synthetic fabric that is hot and makes noises (like a squeak) when you move. Unacceptable. It actually keeps you up! It is also substantially smaller providing less coverage and poor fit. The former king of sleep masks is now worse than the trash it sits upon in my garbage can.

It also has Velcro, which always gets stuck in my hair and rips it out. It\u2019s satin textured, which makes it easily slip off my face and hair. Why all sleep masks aren\u2019t black is beyond me. And the price was definitely not right... I could see paying maybe $8-9 for this fairly, not 26. Skip this one folks!",

The problem, for me anyway, is heat retention. The mask is big. Encompassing. A full wraparound. It keeps light out and it muffles sound. But to do so, it covers so much real estate without ventilation that it becomes uncomfortably warm. If you get cold easily, this mask might be for you. But it's not for me. It works on my big face and head, which most masks do not, but I just can't wear it.",

      "text": "I bought 5 different sleeping masks to find the best one and his was second to last. Believe the reviews about your eyes touching the fabric, it does not promote REM sleep and is uncomfortable. The \"over the ear\" design is great, in theory, but just put a T-shirt over your ear and see if that blocks sound = doesn't really do anything. If you're serious about finding one, get one that has room for you eyes to move while you sleep and something around the bridge of your nose so no light gets in.",

The material also absorbs a lot of oil from your face. Expect to wash it frequently, like once every 7-10 days minimum. Not completely garbage, but not revolutionary either.",

    "description": "LOOK NO FURTHER! You've found the BEST sleep mask on the market. Hundreds of thousands sold with a more than 99.99% customer approval rating! CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED! The Revolutionary Product: After extensive research, the inventor of SLEEP MASTER(an insomnia sufferer) couldn't find a sleep mask that combined the conditions necessary for deep sleep: light elimination and sound reduction. Traditional sleep masks didn't fit or last. They all had thin elastic straps that shift uncomfortably during sleep, fray apart quickly or simply snap off after only a few uses, never mind the disastrous results from washing them! Thus was born SLEEP MASTER utilizing a soft, cool satin fabric, that is comfortable, LIGHT WEIGHT AND BREATHABLE, FLEXIBLE, DURABLE, wide and easily connected in the back by Velcro. The ear area is padded for sound muffling. It stretches or constricts for the fit you desire. SLEEP MASTER is a simple, all-in-one, one-size-fits-all product, which ELIMINATES LIGHT and REDUCES SOUND, giving you a deep, refreshing sleep by shutting out the world in an immediate, intimate way. ~~Normal use MUFFLES SOUND significantly, providing a sense of separation from ambient activity and noise, but not complete isolation. For total sound elimination, you may choose to insert the top quality ear plugs (provided with the mask) before placing SLEEP MASTER around your head, which will block out sound completely & hold the ear plugs securely in place. CPAP users report that SLEEP MASTER fits comfortably when used with a CPAP! Superior quality materials and construction, along with washability, make SLEEP MASTER a far superior value than other masks: It is much more hygienic & lasts many times longer than other masks on the market. If for any reason you are not satisfied with SLEEP MASTER.",
