      "text": "Immediately upon unpacking the cutter I noticed that the upper blade had a visible burr across the cutting edge and when I adjusted the blades they would not pass each other. It was obvious that somebody at the factory forced this down and rolled the edge. After honing the upper blade and reassembling they still would not pass I found that the machine surface that the lower blade sets into was not flat there was a raised area in the center that I had to work down with a mill file to get the blade to sit flat. Not what I expected to have to do for $200. Quality control anymore is out the window.",

The throw on the handle does not come down as far on the new china built model here. So all you can do with this one is cut VCT. I guess that is what it supposed to be for anyway. Kinda sucks, I wouldn't have dropped the cash on this one if I knew that. I don't install that much VCT.",

      "text": "Unfortunately I did not use this product for a couple of months after I received it. It does not cut an exact right angle which means I get gaps between tiles as they taper. There is NO adjustment built into this Chinese machine. I contacted the seller who told me she'd check into this. Heard nothing. Checked repeatedly with emails and never got another response. If you want to do embarrassing tile jobs that you will be making excuses forever, purchase away! If your machine is crooked like mine, you'll remember my words!",
