I did not get the white glove delivery. save the $300.00 if you live in a one story house. The setup is easy. but you will need two people to move this beast of a chair. and too install the bar at the foot of chair. overall for the price of this kind of chair If it holds up a couple of years it will be a FANTATIC BUY!!",

You can turn the foot massage part off while the rest of the body gets treatment. That\u2019s what I do. I love the auto function #4 where it stretches you. This chair is the real deal. It has GREAT power to give you that deep massage you are needing. My bride LOVES this chair. Highly recommend for price, comfort, aesthetics and overall value.",

The heat function is a bit intense as is the high setting on the compression feature, but it has 3 settings so there is one to suit everyone. The stretch feature was new to me but I quite like it. It is rather large for a chair and makes quite a statement in a living room. If you are house proud you may want to place it in a bedroom or other location. I'm very happy with it.",

The quality of the chair is excellent, and stays in good shape if it\u2019s used with a cover. The leather has not deteriorated at all, which is surprising. The mechanicals are also quiet. The only complaint I have would be that this chair is not made for small physiques, less than 5\u2019 tall people. In particular, the arm compression massagers just don\u2019t reach the arms fully of smaller physique people.",

It was relativity easy to get up two sets of steps into our living room with my son via working in unison and grabbing the sides correctly. It is quite and responsive and even made a believer out of my initially pessimistic wife who now loves it and thinks it was an excellent purchase too.

We use the relaxinchair to relieve tension and sore achy lower back. The foot/ankle massage was a bit intense at first, so we put hand towels under the soles of both feet or keep on our shoes. The relaxonchair is like having a massage whenever you like.",

      "text": "Easy to set up. We need to buy a carpet based on their recommendation not to set it on a wood floor. The foot rest needs to be connected and the back pad zipped into place but that is about it for set-up. It is quiet and seem powerful. It uses 270 watts so that is pretty efficient for any motorized device. I can't feel any appreciable heat with my back but I can feel warmth with my hand when the heat is on. Overall, I would say this is a great addition to the rec room.",

It doesn't adequately explain all the settings or what i can do to concentrate onone specific area. The instructions appear to have been written in a different language and then translated. Translations Might lead to misinterpretations or incomplete explanations. I wish i knew more about the different phases and how to make it do more. I have to play with the controls to figure it out. Also no information on warranty.",

It is heavy and large so we needed to remove the bedroom door from the hinge to fit it thru. The massage and intensity are amazing! I would have loved more cushion on the arms and the feet however for A chair costing less then $2000 it's got all the features of a $7000 chair. So far I'm extremely happy. This was a Christmas gift from my husband.",
