The hardest part was installing the mobo, only because I wasn't used to the way it's setup, and the case was lacking instructions on where to put the screws. I was forced to eye ball it. Not the worst thing in the world, but not something you want to do if you can avoid it. All in all, a really good case. I've built at least 8 PC's through the years, and this case is among my favorites.",

There instructions are worse than Ikea instructions and due to the shape there is not a lot of room or visibility while building, so I would not recommend it for beginner builders.

I was pleasantly surprised that it can fit a 240mm liquid cooling radiator on either the front or top of the case, and still have room for a full-sized graphics card.",

    "description": "Size:Micro ATX Case| Color:RG 2 Midnight Garnet RedYou won't find many cases with special two-tone paintwork like this! We got Iron Man Red, Midnight Garnet Red, Championship White, Alpine White, Green Hulk, etc. Once they are gone, they are gone. RexGear 2 is an extra wide cube case with plenty of space for cable management, bulky expansion cards, improved airflow, and advanced liquid cooling solutions. This chassis fits full length standard ATX power supply, two large CPU/GPU liquid coolers up to 240/280 mm, and long graphics card length up to 345 mm (with front 20 cm fan removed). Completely removable ODD rack allows easy access to your water cooling solutions. The motherboard plate is removable for easy installation of core components such as CPU, RAM and Motherboard and works great as a computer test bench using AMD Ryzen or as a gaming case.
