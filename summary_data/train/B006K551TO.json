Zoom is awesome (800mm) and of course with 18.2 MP, great resolution. Weight is OK.. and is very user friendly.. with an in camera help guide... ISO can go from 100 to 12600 (even though, everything above 8000 wouldnt look good). Definetely recommend.. Shame it doesnt give the option of choosing different lens, even though i have found here on amazon some lens for it.. maybe worth a try after...",

This camera is much better, The manual options are very nice and the user interface is great, so glad they did not go with a touch screen, my fingers are too fat, I much prefer the buttons. The pictures are very very good IMO. The 1080P 60 frame video is also very very good. IMO The best bang for the buck. The Nikon 510 was nice but felt cheaper and smaller. Very happy with my purchase",

The LCD allows a manual experience, but who wants to look at a tiny screen for instructions, except perhaps in an emergency? As for the photos it produces, you will only find outstanding performance that would require much, much more money in a traditional 35mm changeable lens camera. It is a big hit with me.",

I am looking forward to learning more about photography as I research how to use these options. I am very satisfied with this purchase.",

Active 3-Way stabilization adds digital rolling control for steadier videos even at long focal lengths. \nProduct description and full feature list Explore the full range of features and options below. \n18.2 Megapixel Back-illuminated Exmor\u00ae R CMOS Image Sensor\nThe 18.2MP Exmor\u00ae R CMOS sensor captures ultra-high definition images that take full advantage of the camera's sharp Carl Zeiss\u00ae Vario-Tessar\u00ae lens. The sensor enables advanced processing that reduces noise levels resulting in stunning low light images with incredible details.\n\nHigh speed AF\nTo improve focusing speed and sensitivity, the Exmor\u00ae R CMOS sensor uses its rapid throughput to deliver high-quality image signals to the camera's BIONZ\u00ae processor. The result is fast, DSLR-like focusing speeds, even in low light.\n\nOptical zoom plus Clear Image zoom\nMost digital zooms use electronic cropping to get closer to the subject, resulting in unsharp images. With Clear Image Zoom the powerful processor compares patterns found in adjacent pixels and creates new pixels to match selected patterns, resulting in more realistic, higher-quality images. Clear Image Zoom doubles optical zoom for closer photos. \n\nFull HD 1080/60p\nRecord crystal clear movies at the highest resolution available with capabilities for 60p in 1080.1 This provides stunning, fast motion video with less distortion for playback on your HD TV.2 With dual record of stills and movies, you can shoot both at the same time.\n\nOptical SteadyShot\u2122 image stabilization with 3-way Active Mode\nOptical SteadyShot\u2122 image stabilization reduces shake and blur by countering camera movements in both horizontal and vertical directions. Active 3-Way stabilization adds digital rolling control that counters clockwise and anti-clockwise rotation, resulting in more stable videos even at long focal lengths. \n\nGPS and Compass\nGPS and compass record location data and camera direction as you shoot movies and photos. GPS Log lets users track a photographic journey and later view the path and images on a map. Map View in PlayMemories Home\u2122 software, allows users to view images on a map showing where they were taken. The logged path and images can also be displayed on Google Earth.4\n\nCapture the decisive moment\nwith up to 10fps\nCapture full 18.2 megapixel resolution images at up to 10 frames per second, helping to ensure that the decisive moment is captured such as the soccer ball flying into the goal. In addition, a mechanical shutter helps reduce distortion when continuously shooting moving subjects.\n\n\nPicture Effect for\nmore expressive photos\nPicture Effect adds a new level of expression to photos, making ordinary landscapes and portraits come to life by heightening mood and emphasizing certain attributes. Select camera models have up to nine different effects.\n\nPhoto Creativity \nPhoto Creativity allows you to fine-tune your exposure settings, such as brightness, color, and vividness, and quickly choose the right enhancement for your subject. Now you can view Picture Effects and Photo Creativity effects in real time on the camera's monitor or in the viewfinder before shooting.\n\nBackground Defocus\nDSLR photographs are often beautiful because they blur the background, putting the emphasis on the subject. Now our point-and-shoot cameras can deliver this signature DSLR benefit. The system takes two shots, identifies the background and applies a defocused background keeping the subject crisp and clear. \n\nIntelligent Sweep Panorama\u2122 \nHR mode\nWith Intelligent Sweep Panorama\u2122 HR mode just press the shutter, pan the landscape and let the camera do the rest. It automatically links together each frame to produce a high resolution panoramic image providing the ability to zoom in on small details. This model even detects faces and moving subjects to stitch intelligently different widths to help avoid subject distortion.\n\nSuperior Auto mode\nGet cleaner, more dynamic pictures and fewer missed shots. The camera automatically recognizes the correct scene mode, then quickly shoots and combines up to six shots to produce images with greater clarity, optimum dynamic range using backlight correction HDR technology and lower image noise using 6 shots layering technology. Superior Auto intelligently detects 33 scenes for still images and movies, making it easy to get the best shot. \n\nFace Detection technology\nFace Detection technology detects up to eight individual faces and adjusts focus, exposure, and white balance to help deliver crisp, properly lit images of family and friends. \n\nSmile Shutter\u2122 technology\nSmile Shutter\u2122 technology captures a smile the moment it happens. Simply press the Smile Shutter\u2122 button and the camera does the rest. You can also select adult and child priority and indicate the degree of Smile Detection sensitivity. Intelligent Scene Recognition can now be used together with Smile Shutter\u2122 mode when the Intelligent Auto mode is on.\n\n3D still image and 3D Sweep \nPanorama\u2122 mode\nProduce awe-inspiring images with 3D still image and 3D Sweep Panorama\u2122 capabilities.3 Photos will take on a new dimension of creative capabilities for viewing the world in a whole new way.\n\nAnti-blink Function\nIt's frustrating to capture the perfect shot, only to review it later and discover subjects blinked during the photo. The Anti-blink function works to help counter blinking and squinting. When the camera is set to Soft Snap, the Anti-blink function captures two images, recording only the photo with less squinting. If a blink is detected in other shooting modes, a warning will be displayed after you take the shot. \n\nSoft Skin mode\nPortrait subjects will love the results. Soft Skin mode recognizes skin tones and reduces the appearance of blemishes and wrinkles without affecting the rest of the shot. \n\nIntelligent Scene Recognition mode\nIntelligent Scene Recognition (iSCN) Mode automatically detects 33 different types of scenes and selects the appropriate camera settings. In Auto Mode, the camera takes a single shot using the optimal settings. In Advanced Mode, the camera takes a photo with the optimal settings and, if in difficult lighting (low light or back light) immediately takes a second photo with another optimized setting so you can choose which to keep.\n\n\n\nWhat's in the box: Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX200V Digital Camera, NP-FH50 H-Series Info-Lithium Battery Pack, AC-L200 AC Adapter, Micro USB Cable, AC Cable, Shoulder Strap, Lens Cap, Lens Cap Strap, Instruction Manual and 1-Year Limited Warranty. \n\n\n1.
