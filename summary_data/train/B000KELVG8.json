      "text": "This tunnel was absolutely perfect for our Springer Spaniel! I love that this tunnel stays upright, no support needed; our dog & cat both love running, walk and laying in this tunnel. It's perfect for playtime! Right now, we have it in the house and the 9' length works great but it will be easy to take it outside as well. It's light weight plus it's easy to put away due to a small strip of velcro that holds it closed. We all love the tunnel, it's definitely our dog's favorite purchase of 2017! :)",

Tunnel is very good construction and held up fine despite the following story: I have three dogs, one dog is new to Play so I have to intervene while she's learning to play Nice. The other Two dogs know these tunnels and it was Game on. The problem was New dog got tangled with another dog going in opposite directions in Tunnel. I had to break up a scrap of 120lbs worth of dogs inside the tunnel. Note to self: Never allow children and dogs to play in Tunnel at same time.",
