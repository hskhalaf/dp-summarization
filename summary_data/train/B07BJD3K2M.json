Now she can safely continue to practice her gymnastic skills at home on a floor that bounces like her competitive floor! It arrived this week and she had it out of the box and inflated in a few minutes! There are quite a few mats out there to pick from but we are VERY PLEASED with the quality and the bounce this mat provides!
