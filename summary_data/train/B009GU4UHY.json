Monitor when you set up and pray it is fine for the rest of the time you're using the mixer, because you can't listen to both.",

But when the mixer arrived I soon found out that the 18 volt phantom power that this mixer is supposed to be providing was not enough to power a large diaphragm condenser microphone adequately. So if you're planning to use this mixer with a large diaphragm condenser microphone that requires closer 48 volts of phantom power. Though this mixer did work sufficiently with a smaller dynamic lapel microphone. My larger condenser microphone could barely be heard unless the gain was turned to full and you had so much hiss it made the mixer useless for recording.",
