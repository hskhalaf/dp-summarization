Love that I can fit other things besides pumping accessories which makes it a perfect work bag. I just carry this and a lunchbox instead of three different bag every day. I do wish the zipper completely sealed the bag instead of having openings on either side but that's my only complaint.",

After shopping around and seeing the more expensive options, i'm glad I went with this tote. It's not too big, lightweight, material is easy to clean, so many pockets, has dividers inside for pump and cooler bag and includes so many extras! I love the wet bag, the cooler bag, the mesh bag and the cleaning cloth. Everything I needed was included for half the price of other bags. Just add pump & handsfree bra!",

Before, I was using 2 separate bags to carry all my pumping stuff, along with taking my purse, and another work bag (I'm a teacher and tend to carry a ton of stuff). Now I can use just this one for all my pumping things. It fits my pump, parts, and cooler nicely, and I still have room to carry snacks, water bottle and/or lunch. It has various pockets which are very handy as well. The cooler is very well insulated to keep the milk cool all day long (7+) hours (with the use of an ice pack or two).",

However, I ended up returning it because the Charlie G New Yorker bag was much bigger, allowing me to carry my laptop AND lunch tote in the same bag. I debated between the two because the Charlie G bag was more expensive AND it did not include any of the extras, such as the cooler or wet/dry bag. Ultimately, I preferred to carry only 1 bag to work as opposed to multiple, even though I had to buy a separate cooler and wet/dry bag.",
