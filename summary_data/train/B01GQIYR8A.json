I don't exactly 'run' , but I do walk faster than most people can jog and these shoes put some extra pep in my step. Like they propel you with you with each step. Very satisfied, and I love the light/dark grey contrast with a smig of purple, these shoes look sharp!!!",

There are differences in the materials of the body of the shoe. The specks are in the front are just painted on rubber....the ones in the store were not just painted rubber... it was black fabric with pink fabric showing thru the slit design. Pretty not impressed. The heels are really rigid on these fakes too, not all fabric like the real ones.",
