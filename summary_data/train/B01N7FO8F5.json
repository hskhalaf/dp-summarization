Also got 4 emails requesting this review. Rather annoying.",

I contacted BBQ Dragon and was dismissed to deal with my issues (I purchased the fan, too, and it stopped working after three uses) with the sellers, with no concern at all expressed over their faulty products. In light of their clearly shoddy materials and even shoddier attitude towards customers, I will be sure that all of my BBQ buddies are made aware to stay clear of BBQ Dragon.",

This kept my temps at a constant level and really made long cooks easier. Highly recommended by myself for backyard bbquer's and anyone who uses charcoal chimneys.",

The cubes you can put in the middle of the tray, add charcoal and with the utility lighter it is easy to start then put the BBQ Dragon fan in and just wait a few mins. If you don't have the cubes you can use a paper towel with vegetable oil on it and then the charcoals.",

The weber handle never has gotten hot enough to have to wear gloves..... Trying to pick up the bbqdragon will leave you with 2nd degree burns like myself. Weber is by far the better product and can be baught almost everywhere for lease.",
