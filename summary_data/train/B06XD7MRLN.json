The guitar pick that came with it didn't work, so I tried a coin, a toothpick, a gift card, and the back of a knife. The knife is the only thing that actually took the stuff off, but it tore the map underneath. And everything I tried left indents in the map, so even if I could actually clear a state I wouldn't want to display the map because it'd be covered in indentations! This was a serious waste of my money.",

I ended up scratching off lines of the \"drive through\" states and they look very good! Now when we actually stay in them I'll scratch off the rest of the lines. Great product.",
