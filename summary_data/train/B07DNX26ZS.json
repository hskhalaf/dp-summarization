I know people like stuff compact, but after losing 2 not me. I like that I can actually see the drive with the naked eye! It transfers files very fast both to and from my computer and iPhone, and the Y-Disk app for the iPhone worked right off with no problems. I would definitely recommend this product to my friends for sure. I also will purchase another one soon for my daughter and wife.",

So far there are no \"cons\" to this drive. For the price you cannot go wrong. Order one and try it for yourself. 128 GB is a lot of storage and the App makes the files seem like they're in the iPad's memory. The Amazon add says you can return it for free if not satisfied. Seems like a no lose deal to me. Give it a try.",

Remove the case from your phone if you have one, plug it in and it automagically prompts you to download and install the app. From there you create a folder and select what photos you want copied. I like this better than plugging into iTunes and having to mess with it all. Once I have created a movie with my DJI app, it's easy to transfer to the computer for further editing or emailing/uploading. 5/5 stars!",

The outer materials compare to other flash drives on the market. I highly recommend this product. You won't be disappointed!",
