      "text": "We have two other cameras purchased in 2016 same model. Our monitor broke and we needed a new one. Only after we purchased it and attempted to pair to existing cameras did we learn that it is not compatible with older camera models. So we would either have to find an old monitor on eBay, or we would have to drop $300+ to get all our cameras working. We returned it and will be going with a different company that actually uses common sense when upgrading their products to be compatible over time.",

The micro usb insert on the monitor overtime seems to wear out which is more than likely why it never stays charged.",
