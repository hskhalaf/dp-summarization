After checking the assembly and set-up instructions, there was no warning to check the blade for security. However, checking further in the manual on page 11 section 4, Blade Care, Step 8 , refers to the proper torque for the blade bolt. After retightening the bolt, I have had no further problem. It is suggested that a note be placed in the Set-up instructions so that a proper check, as recommended, be performed before use.",

      "text": "I have had many lawnmowers over my 81 years and this is the least user friendly serviceable one I have ever had. I have not figured out yet how to change the oil without it running all over the cover. The spark plug cover is hard to remove. The manual is of little help. I could go on but this give the general dissatisfaction I have with this machine.",

      "text": "Only used it twice so far, no major issues, but for some reason the mowing height adjustment does not work as described in the manual. The lowest position is actually in the middle holes (and is not sufficiently low for spring scalping of bermuda grass). As you move the lever to either side away from the middle, the height increases.",

      "text": "I was happy with this mower at first. It was fall and I used the mower about 2x, however after sitting about 6 weeks it didn't start. Or even try to start. The owners manual was no help at all. My guess is that the Powermore engine is a delicate piece of garbage. The model with the Briggs is likely better. Now I have to deal with Yard Machines to try and find a solution. DO NOT BUY.",

      "text": "Okay, so the machine itself is fine, once we got all the oil off. This machine came in a box that had been dropped and crushed. Multiple layers of plastic shrink-wrap and tape were applied to the outside to try and hide the damage. Oil-soaked box, oil soaked everything since the fluid container was crushed and applied itself liberally to the inside and soaked through to the outside as well. Owners manual unreadable. \"Spare\" parts everywhere, what else can be said? Very disappointed, would appreciate a new manual, new fluid, and an apology, none of which I know I'll ever get. Shame on whoever does this and gets away with it. Zero recommendation will ever come from this experience.",
