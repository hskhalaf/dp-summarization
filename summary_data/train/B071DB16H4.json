Im 6'4\" with 37\" inseams and this material can easily reach the length of my leg and can comfortably stretch into my shoes if needed. No highwaters. Tons of room available, which for a tall rider is heavenly. Also hides your junk extremely well. You can only see the crest of your um...helmet. Everything else is completely hidden, no matter how hard you ride, if you get my drift.",

I am a teen (19) and I workout everyday except for 1 during the week. I play soccer, ride bike and I am doing leg day every other day at the gym so because of that yeah, I do have BIG legs... A size LARGE fit perfect for me. I'm 6'2. Will be purchasing more styles!",
