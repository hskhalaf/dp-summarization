The advanced setup features are quite helpful in managing water usage, while allowing the green space to provide both curb and staycation appeal. (Yeah, thanks to the pandemic, I won\u2019t be putting on my walk-about shoes anytime soon). The attached photos provide some details of the controller. The feature that I like best is that it works seamlessly with Apple HomeKit. I will provide further updates once it is connected and controlling the sprinklers.",

The cost of parts and shipping. they do not charge for labor. I also learned that one circuit can handle 1/2 amp for heavier loads such as a fountain pump or low voltage lighting. Tuning into the weather service NOAA has saved me thousands of gallons of water and dollars in reduced water needs. Important in central California.",

Each station you turn on is queued so you don't need to wait for one to finish before queueing the next. Almost forgot to mention.... An AC power adapter was included with the machine.

Terrible wiring design made this product useless and it never even powered up after it was wired correctly. Pure JUNK!",
