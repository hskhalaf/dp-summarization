Be sure you don't over tighten the screw to hold the lid in place or you may break the bowl. It held 4 bags of M&Ms and had a little more room. Overall a great find for the price.",

In addition, there is a unique anti-spill cover which will keep your candy/gum in the tray and not on the floor. The machine also operates as a bank and has proven to be an effective tool for teaching kids how to save money.

Cast metal gumball machine base, lid, and coin mechanism, Accepts any coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies), Includes instructions for \"free spin\" to work without coins, Works as a gumball bank - retrieve coins when full, Anti-spill gumball dispenser with door cover, Dispenses small gumballs (.62\" or smaller), candy, or nuts, Gumball capacity: 2 lbs. of .62\" gumballs, Dispenses Gumballs, Peanuts, Jellybeans & More, Choking Hazard - Not for children under 3 years, Color: Classic red finish, Weight: 2.5 lbs., Machine Only Dimensions: 11\"H x 5\"W, Full 1 Year Warranty!",
