I actually saw these in a store and tried them on in person before finding them here on Amazon for cheaper. They fit remarkably well (normal shoe size) without any uncomfortable rubbing or pinching that seems commonplace for me in roller blades. No blisters or sores after our first skate. These are great. Much looser wheels than I had anticipated, so if you haven't been in a while take it easy your first time again! ;)",

The 2 straps are perfect but the flaw is where the laces are. being that its literally a sock connected to the plastic base no matter how tight you pull the laces it's not solid enough for the best balance. It's hard to explain but I recommend getting blades that have a full plastic shoe and a sock that pulls out the laces should connect to the outer shoe. It's hard to explain people just trust me your foot will be wobbly in these blades and will make for an uncomfortable ride if you plan to use them for over an hour.",
