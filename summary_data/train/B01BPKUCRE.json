But almost better than the product are the people behind the scenes. I made a stupid decision and accidentally melted the water reservoir - when I emailed the company not only did they respond within a couple of hours, they replaces the part for free! I recommend 10000%",

Another great feature is the duration it lasts for - about 30 minutes straight and the overall form factor is quite compact. I highly recommend this!",

I steam my face and when I am done, then I use a blackhead extractor to get all of the dirt out of my pores, apply a good mask, then serum, then a moisturizer or oil. I know it sounds like a lot to do but it is worth it! My skin tone looks brighter and is very soft. I highly recommend this product!!",

I try to steam 2-3x a week, followed by cupping therapy and the two work hand in hand so well to make my face look super plump and healthy! Once I figure out how to extract blackheads safely with the tools provided with this steamer, I'll be golden and never need to go to an esthetician's office.",

I should have just bought a cheap humidifier from the drugstore.",

But 1 year ago I started to see clear/brownish gungy residues falling out after I dump my remaining water out from the machine (not the water holder but the base itself). It was somewhat alarming but I continued to use it since it still steams great. Until recently, it looks like there were more and more residues!!!! EWWW, and it smells like plastic too. I'm too scared it might affect my health since I'm breathing that in when I'm using it. Does anyone have this problem too?",
