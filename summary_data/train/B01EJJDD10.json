The angle arms are stiff enough to hold the lamp in any position but easy enough to move. It is a good weight so no fear of falling over in any position.

So I got this!! It\u2019s AMAZING! No glare on my computer or nursing book pages, the ability to rotate the part with the light as well as the arm is WELL WORTH THE UPGRADE from the other lamp. I got this cheaper because the box was damaged but that was it! Perfect condition!!! It\u2019s amazing and looks so good on my desk!!",

The light is totally adjustable with the arm able to be positioned in two different ways and the light itself twisted to any angle you want. Has a nightlight function, too. Plus, it's a handsome accessory to your desk or wherever. The light supposedly lasts a lifetime, so no more unscrewing and screwing in light bulbs of any kind. Very happy with this onetime purchase that will last a lifetime.",
