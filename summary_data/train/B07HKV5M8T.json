They are very comfortable... BUT unfortunately after only wearing them 4 times, the bottom is already starting to come undone. I\u2019ve worn these on a few walks, that\u2019s it. For them to be falling apart already is ridiculous. The system will not let me contact the seller because it has been over a month, which now means I wasted money and Amazon won\u2019t do anything about it. I didn\u2019t pay for shoes to fall apart after wearing them 4 times. Very upset.",

They are comfortable if you get the right size. You should definitely go up a full size from your dress shoe. The cushion is firm but is comfortable. The traction on these shoes are great and provide for a lot of grip on the trail or loose stuff. Overall, I would recommend these running shoes if you like trail running. **Disclosure: I received a sample product from the Amazon Vine program for an honest and unbiased review.",
