Very well made reminds me of when I was little and it's actually a good size un like these other tiny ones I was finding for close to the same price",

Ours likes it as much on it's side as upright as the beads fall differently, so you can get extra use out of it by rotating it rather than always having it on it's base.",

      "text": "Looks like a great toy, my daughter likes it. But after just a week, one of the color circles on the wooden base splintered. I figured it was a fluke, so I had Amazon send a replacement. Two weeks later the second unit did the same thing. The problem is that the splinter could easily harm a small child and present a choking hazard. These units should be recalled. I sent my replacement back. I've also posted a picture for other parents to see. My advice, buy a different bead maze.",

The wires seem a little close together and you have to physically move one of the wire tracks to get some of the beads by on a different track.
