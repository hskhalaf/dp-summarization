As you can see I have no arms so I need a tripod that is lightweight but full on perks...this tripod is EVERYTHING I hoped for & then some!!!! It is VERY easy to operate from manipulating the height to changing the swivel points for various angles. The knobs are nice & big making screwing/unscrewing very easy & effortless. I got this for my Makayama iPad case & it works seamlessly with it. Great product! Great pricing!! Thanks Amazon!!!! [...]",

I do mostly nature, street, and portait shots, but I do occasionally do events and sports. This tripod is great for all of that! It allows me to get a slow enough ShutterSpeed, whether I'm in a lower lighting situation such as a party & don't want to crank up my ISO, or I am doing a landscape shot, and want very creamy, soft, movement. The tripod is very inexpensive- who wants to pay + for brands??? Very lightweight. Easy to transport (comes with a bag). It has so many features! Definitely recomend. I will let you guys know if my opinion on the tripod changes.",

So if you have something in the weight range of an old VHS Brick-camcorder I would not trust in this to support it. As for the top clamp not holding the load and swiveling on it's own, get some paper and shove it in between the clamping surfaces. That will add more friction to the clamp and keep it from drooping when tightened.",

I was not certain the base of the Logitech 920 would be compatible with this tripod, but it is 100%. The base of the webcam accepts the bolt on the tripod mounting plate perfectly. And there is a quick release feature on the tripod to ensure the webcam won't tip off when you move the unit around. Perhaps the less expensive tripod Amazon sells would also have worked, but I did not try that one - just went for this one because of the high reviews.",

It has a carrying handle, adjustments for lateral rotation, vertical rotation, elevation, and a mount that attaches to the base of the camera or lens and allows for a quick connect/disconnect. There are three telescoping segments to each of the three legs that lock securely.",

There were no instructions included, at least in my package, so it took a little bit to discover some adjustments. Overall, I believe, you wont be disappointed in this purchase and will fit any camera with a mounting screw or gopro.",

I love that it has a removable platform to allow you to easily remove and replace your camera on the tripod. It easily rotates with 360 degree turns. It is lightweight and when I add it to my camera bag it is not uncomfortable to travel with. The middle hook allows for a sandbag to be place to prevent wobbling. I would recommend this for anyone looking for an affordable tripod that can do what the more expensive ones are capable of doing.",

If you use you camera with multiple lenses (that use a mount), go ahead save yourself the headache and order extra quick release plates to use on each of these items.",
