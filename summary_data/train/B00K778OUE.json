So the gaping holes looked like hell, and the advertised size (23lb) was a joke, I bought a 20lb turkey for thanksgiving, and the day before discivered it was WAY to small to fit this smaller than advertised so I had to scramble, finding the right size roaster, also advertised as 23ld size at a local hardware store in enameled steel. It was MUCH LARGER!!! On the shelf next to it was a 15lb roaster the same size as the cook pro \"23lb\" roaster. TOTAL false advertising!!!",

The metal isn't super thick, but it's durable if you aren't slamming it around trying to tenderize meat with it like a cave person. It washes up very nicely in the dishwasher, which is a must for me. It holds a nice sized roast plus vegetables and looks good enough to serve from with company. I can't really think of any complaints. It fits in perfectly with my more expensive stainless cookware.",
