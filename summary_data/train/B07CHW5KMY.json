It would work great for 3 calls maybe after which, once again calls would start going direct to voicemail! I even did a factory reset a couple of times, but that didn't help.

The G6 seemed like a reasonably priced phone so I decided to go that way. After about two weeks of use, I am well pleased, and would recommend this phone to anyone like me who doesn't need the absolute latest and greatest (for 6 or 7 times the price).",
