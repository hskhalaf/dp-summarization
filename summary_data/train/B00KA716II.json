Now if you're starting with a pair of shoes already tainted with your foot fragrance, it is still a dramatic improvement. However, once I got new shoes add started fresh, holy moly amazing. I'm just got my 2nd bottle. 1st one more than 90 days, so for the price versus the life of the product, deserves another holy moly! I am so happy I pulled the trigger and tried this product.

What DID last though... was for 2 days, if my boots got wet (which happens daily) my feet would get that peppermint burn and it was so uncomfortable.",

Everyday I spray once in both shoes and once inside her socks, no smell when she gets home Even if I forget to spray one day, still no smell when she gets home. Because her shoes still has a fresh scent. Works very well!!",

I've been using this product at the beginning of the day (with an anti-persperant,) and at the end of the day mostly for my own enjoyment and because it keeps my feet feeling cool. I have noticed a reduction in smell when I take off my shoes. I don't know if it's improving the feel of my feet yet, but as I said it feels good to put on and I don't have to worry about using it too much. The smell is a very pleasing peppermint.",
