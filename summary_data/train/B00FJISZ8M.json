      "text": "I've used Sony headphones in the past, and at least 1 of them was a disappointment, so when I shopped for a new one I was a bit leery of the Sony brand when it comes to headphones. Reviewers, however, were praising this line of headphones, and so I bet on them. I ended buying a refurbished pair, and they are awesome. The bass is indeed a little of an overkill (muddled), so I have to use an equalizer, at least on the PC side.",

The battery life is very long my my use typically 3-4 days without charging . If they do did and you still want to listen you can just use the AUX cord. Only problem is that there is no indication for how much battery is left and no warning when they die, it will just shut off.",

He told me he felt like he was in a recording studio with the band and once he placed them on my ears I knew exactly what he meant. The sound is beyond clear, and those sitting around you cannot hear a thing from the headphones, even at high volume. An excellent pair of headphones for a music lover.",
