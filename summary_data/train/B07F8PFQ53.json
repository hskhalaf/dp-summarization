However, twice now I have boiled water for my lunch with it.....and both times I had water boiling within about 4 minutes....from when I lit the stove! As with any of these stick stoves, having dry fuel is the key. Bigger stoves can dry the fuel as it burns, with this small of a stove it won't be good at that. I bought this pot set to put the stove in...it just fits in the smaller one, fits nicely in the bigger one with room for other small goodies....",

Haven't actually used it yet, but it is sturdy and great build quality. Nests into a small 5x5x5\" box and hardly weighs a thing. Just big enough for a small 8\" skillet or 8 cup pasta pot.",

It IS lighter weight than the others but it is because the metal it is made from is thinner. It is also unpolished leaving sharper edges. This can be a problem if you cut yourself during an emergency situation which is what I had planned to use it for. It is also smaller in diameter than the others I have purchased. Also the carry bag isn't stretchy and more difficult to take out and replace the stove. I wouldn't purchase this one again as the others were better made and at the same price point.",

Wish the metal was thicker to make it sturdier especially dealing with fire and cooking with it. The two pieces of metal that act as a stand definately need to be thicker. It's too thin in my opinion. It also slightly wobbles once placed correctly. Overall it's usable and a great idea for emergency usage.",

I will always bring one on a camping trip as a backup. Another use for it is to help get things going in damp conditions. We were at a campsite, where it had rained, and all the wood was damp or wet. While we cooked on standard portable camp stove, we wanted to get a camp fire going. By concentrating the heat, and having proper ventilation, the Vinida was able to pretty quickly begin a hot fire that gave us enough coals for us to get a larger camp fire going.",
