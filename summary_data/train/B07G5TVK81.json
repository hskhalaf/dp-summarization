      "text": "Beautiful is an I understatement! Was so excited to see an amazon version, affordable and even better than the pricier line I have at home. After this piece, I was hooked and even got the decorative box for my bathroom, and the mirrored jewelery box. Every decor piece from this line comes with a thousand compliments!!! A must have for small and big apartments and homes. I can tell the designer is not typical Jonathan Adler decor, but I have to say I\u2019m even more pleased with some of the pottery in now house than his more expensive line- which I own a lot of!",

It's a little too small to be a focal piece. It looks good on a shelf. I sat in in several spots in my house, and it just looked small. I finally ended up placing it on our entertainment center (with other similar/smaller sized items) and it looks nice there.",

The entire vase measures 4.75\" x 5.75\", so it will only hold one or two cut flowers. I display my vase on the entrance landing of our stairway, and although I showcase a few other artifacts on the landing, this vase stands out the most. It also makes a unique gift for that special person on your list.",
