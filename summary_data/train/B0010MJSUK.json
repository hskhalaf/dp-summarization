      "text": "I believe my model was a refurb. The display can be difficult to navigate through. The large buttons seem \"squishy\" and don't provide enough tactile response when diving to be useful. I really struggled using this watch on my last dive. It broke up my one dive into three dives. It shut off around 50 ft of depth. The problem is that I really like the price and the giant screen, but I need something more solid and reliable. Returning ASAP and back on the market for a beginner dive watch.",

The speaker is larger and it is easy to hear underwater when it beeps. Numbers/letters are clear, as this is a larger unit. If you keep it illuminated it's still easy to make out when its darker. I've been using this for years and the quality is good. For the price this has been a good, reliable Nitrox computer.",

Battery life is not phenomenonal, but being user replaceable, it's not a biggie. Just add a spare battery to your save-a-dive kit. I also got the USB cable to download dives.
