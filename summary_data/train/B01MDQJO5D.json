I felt a couple of weeks ago like a blessed idiot for leaving the mower out all winter and discovering that, with a little TLC, it still worked. . .But my heart bled for it, poor neglected soul, and after fine-tuning it a little more I decided to look for something to protect it. The Himal cover is exactly as described--a perfect fit, covering everything. It will assure that my mower finally gets the protection it deserves.",

I think this is about as good as can be expected for any kind of synthetic material cover with that kind of UV cover. The mower still looks brand new so the cover did it's job. This new one looks like it has a little better reflective material coating on the inside so we'll see if it lasts any longer than the last one.",

The color faded somewhat at the exposed surface but there's no sign of any chafing or cracks and the cover is still pliable and waterproof.
