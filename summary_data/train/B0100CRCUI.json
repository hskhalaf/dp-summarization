It has stopped the amount of dirt and dust that enters my house under ge door very well. nly observation is that when the door is opened or closed the product slides slightly out so in order to close the dooor you have to push the thing in place with your foot. Otherwise, I recommend this product, it is sturdy, and gets the job done.",

      "text": "Yes, it's ugly, but it beats having a towel down on the floor that you have to reposition all the time. Although it does a good job stopping drafts, it does have a drawback of shifting slightly here, so that the draft stopper will hit the jam, and you need to nudge it back into position with your foot. This doesn't happen too often. Considering the cost (cheap) and the fact that it performs well most of the time, I rate it pretty highly. I did have to cut this to fit the door, and could see the sewing was going to let go very fast at the seams, so I applied duct tape and it's working well.",

The seam split on one side and we tried rubbing a little soap on the foam to help it slide in easily but that didn't work. Since it split at the seam we decided to just open it up halfway, put the foam in & tape it up.",

However for those of us who actually use our doors, this piece of junk slides with every swing of the door so be prepared to have to push it back into place every time you use your door.

It works for keeping little pests out. One tried hard going through by chewing the hell out of it but it didn't work! It's surprisingly durable. Then my electric zapper did the rest of the job and I don't have a pest problem anymore. It's a hell of a lot cheaper than those metal door covers advertised for pest control and it's easier to install because all you need are scissors and possibly tape.",

The stitching like many others mentioned was uneven and getting the foam into them took a big of effort that I feel could have been easily avoided with a straight stitch. I also am not sure why if this is set to fit a standard size door (which mine is) that I would have to cut it to fit. If you cut it you are left with an unsightly edge vs. the sewn edge it comes with.",
