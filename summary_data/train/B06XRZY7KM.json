With a regular thermometer, I was waking up, turning on my IPhone flashlight, waking up my husband, and then opening other various apps to record my results. With this device, I could literally fall asleep with it in my mouth and then enter my temperature into other apps later. I didn\u2019t like the added features on the app aside from the LH recording, but I would still recommend it to anyone looking for an effective way to monitor basal temps. I\u2019m now pregnant! :)",

Super messed up :/ I gave the device 2 stars because the device itself isnt bad (except it does take way too long to take your temp and the device will say you need to replace your battery but it will last a good month after that).",

Instead, it must transmit the temperature to the separate hand-held monitor via Bluetooth (hence requiring pairing each time it is used). I am sure it is a great tool for those wishing to become pregnant (or avoid pregnancy), but it has no redeeming merit for simply taking one's temperature.....even if it is the last thermometer on the market. Now that thermometers are reappearing on shelves, I will be able to find a simple, old-fashioned one.",

Well designed easy to use, clean, store and transfer the data. customer service is really fast and almost real time. the reason for a 4.5 instead of 5 star is that I found the basal temperature I measured on a daily basis sometimes go up and sometimes go down, but this probably is due to me waking up usually at different time in the morning or my cycle is kind of unstable.",

This is my third month using the Femometer and it successfully predicted my period to the day this time, with the other predictions being within a couple days.
