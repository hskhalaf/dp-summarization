I was under the impression that these were completely stainless steel, but it seems like there is some kind of lining on the inside that has started to come off. I can't believe that I have been ingesting whatever this stuff is... hopefully not something toxic. I'm not even going to bother with the lifetime warranty, I have no interest in getting another one of these.",

The old lids were hard to clean, no matter how much you soaked/scrubbed them, put in the dishwasher ...chunks of black stuff would keep coming out. It was really gross. NOW the plastic part under the lid, flips up, so you can easily clean it. Great idea. Thank you Contigo.",

Because it has a \"redundant\" lid, the Zojirushi lid _seems_ more secure against spills, although its pop-over lid is less elegant than the Contigo's lack of a floppy lid.

But the small sip opening doesn't allow you to feel/sample the temperature of the liquid before it's in your mouth. This can cause you to burn your mouth if the liquid is too hot. SO BE CAREFUL! (I've been unscrewing the cap and checking the temp first before drinking especially if it's not that long since filling) Also, plastic taste seems to be still there. Make sure u take the top.cap mechanism apart (it snaps up and out of the way) for occasional cleaning with a small brush or yucky \"stuff\" can grow there.",
