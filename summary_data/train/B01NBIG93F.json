      "text": "This is an absolutely cute little car and my little one loves it. The only issue I have is that for the parent, it can be a tough pushing it because the bar is so low (top of the car). I'm 5' 5\" and the top of the car is almost too short for me to push. The first time I took my little one out I ended up with a bruise on my hand just from the odd angle that I had to push from. I would not recommend this if you are tall and will be pushing your toddler. Otherwise, it is a great car.",

The box states that all you need to assemble this coupe is a hammer, screwdriver and socket wrench. There is no way to place any of the screws without an electric drill. Half the openings for parts to fit into holes do not fit. The coupe also came with multiple scratches on the body. It took a very mechanically oriented individual 3 hours to assemble this. I would not recommend it for someone without building skills.",
