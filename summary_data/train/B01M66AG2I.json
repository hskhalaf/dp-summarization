      "text": "This mat is really, really nice for old knees and backs. I love the idea it can be folded flat or stacked. The mat portions are solid enough to protect knees from rocks and hard soil, yet have enough \"give\" to be comfortable. The complaint I have is the plastic webbing between the mat portions; we've used this for less than a month, and the webbing is starting to wear badly. Duct tape will fix it, and it's still too useful to throw away.",
