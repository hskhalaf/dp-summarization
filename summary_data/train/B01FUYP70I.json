Much easier than an ordinary billfold. One of my hands is numb with age, and I normally have trouble removing bills from my wallet. Since it is my left hand that has the problem I carry it in the front left side pocket. I no longer have a problem removing my wallet. I found the leather to be high quality. ID is visible without removing the card, and the few other cards I carry are easily removed.",

I keep 3 credit cards on the pull tab, one card in each of the two inner slots, and 2 hard ID cards along with a paper ID in the clear slot and usually about 5 paper bills in the clip along with 4 business card on the outside and this combination makes for ease of access along with a comfortable wallet to sit on.",

Wish the pull-out was on the inside as I can see it possibly getting torn/damaged on its current location. Good value for it's cost, but would've gone with my old Bellroy were it still available.",

Currently I have 6 cards in the pull-tab pocket, CPR card in the window pocket, a card in each of the 2 inside and quick use outer pockets. All that puts it at 2 cm or .625\" thick.
