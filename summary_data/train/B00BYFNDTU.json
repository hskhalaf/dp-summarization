This replaces my heavy 14.4v Milwaukee drill and I can't believe the increase in power and run time. I still need the old one for the 4\" hole saw but for 99% of my tasks this is the drill. The 1/2\" chuck is sweet and there is no visible run out. I sleep with it under my pillow and it's so compact I hardly know it's there. Pull the trigger, this is it!",

When that finally died I decided to try something smaller. I do not miss that extra size, weight or power I had with the Dewalt. This drill is perfect for everything I need it for. If I were using the drill everyday all day I would have purchased another 18v but don't let this drill fool you it has plenty of power and so far the battery life has been great.",

If you need to use a drill for many hours, I recommend less-expensive, non-hammer mode type which is lighter than this model.",
