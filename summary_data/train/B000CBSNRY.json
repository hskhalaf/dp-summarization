At about 3 years they start building in 3 dimension (boxes piramids and others) and increasing the level of complexity year by year. I bought 4 boxes (400 piece) and its the best investment I ever done in toys.",

      "text": "Lot's of joy. Expensive, but good quality. I read reviews of the alternate brands and the problem with them is that they don't have those metal rivets that hold the plastic plates together. those rivets prevent the magnets from falling out (remember kids throw those around...). If your kid swallows 2 of the magnets (they are very strong!) they may stick int the intestines and your kid dies. So having these rivets really is important to prevent magnets from falling out.",
