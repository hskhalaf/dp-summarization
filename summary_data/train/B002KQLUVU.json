To this date, I'm very happy with the phone, I realize that there are very few functions this blackberry hasn't that are being offered on the most expensive and advanced models. Nevertheless, my use of the phone is very demanding (as well as our corporate standards) and it is usual to have to wait for the phone to stop showing th clock to start using it, which is the main reason to not rate it as a 5 star product.",

Also, if you don't have a data plan but would like to use WIFI you can upgrade your OS to 5.0.0.2. Just Google for upgrades and find it. After the upgrade all the extra functions were available and the WIFI works great. So far so good. The transaction was handled well and the delivery was prompt.",

At first i thought it was because of the battery not charged all the way but then after the battery was charged fully it still kept on with this problem noted i got a used one. But ive had this phone before and its a great phone. i suggest getting a new one not a used one never know what ur goin to get.",
