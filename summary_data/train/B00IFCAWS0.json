It applies easily in a matte finish, not at all oily and makes my skin look great without any breakouts. And it has an awesome natural fragrance that is very masculine, so you feel like it's tailor made for a men's needs and skin. Even a drop goes pretty far, so one bottle lasts me a long time. For the price of drug store products filled with all sorts of chemicals and preservatives, this far exceeds in quality and value. I can't recommend Thrive enough--their shave oil, facial scrub and facial wash are also fantastic and have become my go-to products.",

The cream is not overly thick and oily. I would recommend this to any guy out there that wants to try out new skin scare products. I rarely buy things twice since I want to try out a bit of everything but Thrive products did grab my attention to give it a second try. Good job guys!",
