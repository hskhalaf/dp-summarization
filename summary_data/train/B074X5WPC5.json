      "text": "Before buyers start slamming this GoPro, they should really make sure they have the latest software and a compatible memory card (of which there is only ONE that GoPro recommend). I sold my Hero 5 to get this, and I am not disappointed. The improved stabalisation is that good that you can get away without losing a gimbal and you'd barely notice, and the fact that you can now shoot 4k in 60fps is excellent when filming from a fixed position. Granted it's not cheap, but if you're going to complain about the cost and then slate the thing, go buy something half the price and try and compare it - as I personally don't think you'll stand a chance.",

Our studio bought 5 of these, and none of them are able to stay connected to any device long enough to update the firmware. They turn off in the middle of recording, they stop recording unexpectedly and they disconnect from the hardware remote constantly. I have never used a less reliable recording device in my life. Run away.",

I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t purchase a generic action camera (usually sold as a fraction of the cost), and jumped straight to this one! The cellphone app makes even easier reviewing, downloading and editing your files (cheap action cameras don\u2019t have that!). What a like the most is the voice control... it is just awesome turning on, off, changing modes, start shooting videos or photo without having to touch the camera!",

The only downside is battery life, if you just figure 1 battery for every hour of video you will be safe. I purchased 4 extra battery's (after market. Worked great.) besides the one it came with and wish I would have purchased at least 6 with all the snorkeling we did. At 5 battery's we would snorkel for 3 or 4 hours and go for a hike and the battery's were done by lunch. only down side.",

Easy to use touch screen with zoom. I took one star off of battery life because the battery doesn't very long. but given the small size what else could I expect. I don't know how GoPro could possibly make a better product, but if they ever did I would buy it without hesitation.",

It held up amazingly in the Great Barrier Reef (with a waterproof case) and was great with our time lapse videos. We did buy an extra battery because we were gone for three weeks (along with an extra memory chip). It does take some getting used to, especially when taking out the memory chip or battery, we have to use a spoon to pry it open. Otherwise, I am now a GoPro fan!",

Also great that the whole body is waterproof now, that's a major boon for reducing the bulk of your mounting solutions. Also, footage looks great :-)",
