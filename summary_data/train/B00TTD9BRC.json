I really though I had some autoimmune condition, and tried a course of steroids. I tried this cream, and did wonders for me (FYI, I don't own stocks in the company and do not benefit in any way from writing this review!).",

I used CeraVe afterwards and my skin was soooo moist! Exfoliating is key, at least for immediate results. Your skin may feel the same, but only after some time with consistent use. The label says it delivers moisture over time, but I had great results after exfoliating. Try it that way.",

This cream has been magical in keeping them younger looking and less dried out. I\u2019m also sensitive to smell and have never noticed an odor to this. I should mention that I stick with the CREAM form and not the lotion as lotions tend to have alcohol added to them which are drying.",

Also, after two weeks of daily use, my slightly dry skin actually got drier. Passed this on to my sister in the hopes that she might like it, and switched back to my good old Aderma lotion.",
