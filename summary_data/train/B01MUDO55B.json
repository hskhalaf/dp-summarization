Of course, like any sensible person, I don't have 50- or 100-foot 2-prong extension cords lying around, and the ones I do have have a 3-receptacle tap which also won't fit. So, I have to make a trip to the hardware store, or perhaps more sensibly remove enough material that my regular outdoor extension cord fits. 1 star for wasting my time, reasonless.",

Checked the cord, works fine. I assume the motor died. Just past the return period, so my investment in the trimmer and all the extra trimmer string are down the drain. Will try to deal with B&D support, but I'm not optimistic.",
