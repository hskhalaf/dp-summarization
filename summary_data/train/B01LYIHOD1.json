Haven't been able to test how wet these get or how long it takes to dry, however down between 40 and 60 degrees these are good. The biggest improvement I would suggest is a way to provide most, or all the warmth to the fingers. Very rarely are your palms colder than your figures. If there was a way to by default include 2X the warming wires in the fingers, or provide 80% of the power here, they would be perfect. As it stands now, any colder than 40ish and I have them on high, baking my palm and back of hand, but barely warming the fingers",

On two occasions I have bumped the button and shut a glove off but other than that, I LOVE THESE THINGS! They keep my hands and fingers warm. These are a ski-gloves that you will have to take off to do anything with precision. They are water resistant, not water proof. The battery life has been as rated.",

They have worked as advertised and significantly improve my ability to actually feel and use my fingers when I get off the bike. However, the material on the fingers of the palm side of the glove is rather thick, which can make it hard to work the throttle and clutch precisely. It is possible, certainly, but I find myself opting for thinner gloves and more discomfort when the weather is >35 degrees for safety (my bike has a twitchy throttle). They aren't any thicker than normal ski gloves, but ideally (for motorcycling) they would be thin and warm enough rather than thick and super warm.",

I would recommend these for outdoor treks, maybe trail snowshoeing or skiing. Battery life was low when set on highest setting, around 3 hours, enough for most outdoor but not snowmobiling. Batteries last quite a bit longer on the lowest setting that complimented other hand protection. Perfect for normal outdoor activities should be adequate.",

That part is disappointing because of the cost and all of the other parts of this glove which is of higher quality.
