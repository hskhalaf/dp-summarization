Let it soak for a short while, rinse and, voila\u0300, you're ready to go for the next round, next time.",

Only order this is you have a LARGE microwave.",

With some bacon you cannot lay the slices out from end to end without curling them up, it is not wide enough. The angle on the cooker should also be a little steeper so more of the grease drips down. Sometimes a lot remains on the upper portion. I have had to modify it so it is steeper.",
