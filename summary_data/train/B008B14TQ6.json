It's less sharp at the corners, and there is some distortion at the corners of pictures (the centre of the picture bows), when the focal length is under 35mm. This can be dealt with in programmes like Lightroom though. In life, you get what you pay for, and this is a cheep lens for FX cameras. This said it's a good lens for the price.",

Moving to this lens just showed that although it is an older lens and lacks VR (it would be bigger and heavier with it, I guess) the larger aperture definitely allows better view of what you are photographing, and the quality of the glass is simply excellent. It is not a lens you can use so easily as your only travel lens, but it does give the best quality as long as you can hold your camera steady.",

For this reason it's not quite a dusk to dawn lens, but everything in between. The front of the barrel doesn't rotate which is good when using a polarising filter, even though such filters lose another couple of stops of light. For my camera bag a fast standard 50mm, a super wide angle zoom, this lens and a zoom going out to 300mm is lens heaven.",

    "description": "Optical formula optimized for use with Nikon FX-format digital SLRs, provides sharp and high contrast images and HD video from infinity to close up. 36 -127.5mm focal length equivalent when mounted on DX-format D-SLR.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\nAdvanced and versatile FX-format standard zoom with VR II image stabilization. \nCovering a versatile wide angle to medium telephoto zoom range, the new AF-S NIKKOR 24\u201385mm f/3.5-4.5G ED VR delivers noticeably sharper photos and HD videos thanks to Nikon's second-generation Vibration Reduction technology (VR II). Shoot at shutter speeds up to 4-times slower than would otherwise be possible for greater low-light capability, and enjoy the benefits of Vibration Reduction during HD video recording\u2014even when using a tripod. \n\n\nSAMPLE PHOTOGRAPHY\nA range of possibilities View larger Razor-sharp, high contrast results View larger Unwavering performance View larger \nFEATURES:\nVibration Reduction \nA Nikon in-lens technology that improves image stability by automatically compensating for camera shake. Lenses that offer VR will feature the abbreviation VR on the lens barrel.\n\nNikon Silent Wave Motor\nA significant innovation in AF lens technology, Nikon's Silent Wave Motor uses ultrasonic (inaudible) vibrations\u2014rather than a gear system\u2014to focus the lens, providing incredibly smooth, silent and precise autofocus operation.\n\nM/A Focus Mode Switch\nWhen fine manual focusing is needed, simply rotate the lens focus ring\u2014M/A mode allows you to seamlessly override the AF system with virtually no time lag.\n\nAS\nAS stands for Aspherical lens elements. This type of lens utilizes non-spherical surfaces on either one or both sides of the glass in order to eliminate certain types of lens aberration. \n\nSuper Integrated Coating\nNikon's Super Integrated Coating enhances light transmission efficiency and offers superior color consistency and reduced lens flare.\n\nED (Extra-Low Dispersion Glass)\nAn optical glass developed by Nikon that is used with normal optical glass in telephoto lenses to obtain optimum correction of chromatic aberrations.\n\nIF Lens\nA NIKKOR lens in which only the internal lens group shifts during focusing. These lenses will be designated with the abbreviation IF on the lens barrel.\n\n\nHow to read the MTF curve chart Lens Construction",
