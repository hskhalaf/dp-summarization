All have been very similar in light amplification and image quality. All have had a fairly narrow field of view, You need to focus the front lens first then the rear and if you use an external IP flashlight you can extend the range greatly. None of the gen 1 night vision is going to give you a perfect picture but you can definitely spot a deer, coyotes, people, etc with them. The field I typically spot in is 600 feet deep and these work great.",

It does amplify light. The IR light works. The field of vision is smaller than I expected, but useable, especially from a tripod. The instructions are vague.
