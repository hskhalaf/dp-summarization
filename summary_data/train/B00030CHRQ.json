Adjust the earbuds so they fit comfortably in your ear canal, blocking out outside sounds, and you will be amazed. The bass response is incredible! The high frequencies are crisp and clear. The earbuds can be turned up to concert volume levels. The only downside to these headphones is that they must be in your ear canal to sound good. This means you have to keep your ears very clean. Not a problem? Great. These are AWESOME headphones. Buy them. Really.",

Much better sounding than any other bud type headphones for your money.
