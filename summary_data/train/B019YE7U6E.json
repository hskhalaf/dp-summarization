AFTER WEARING EVERY 3RD DAY, THESE HAVE ALREADY FALLEN APART TO BEING UNWEARABLE AND NEEDING REPLACEMENT. Think of it this way. $30 shoe lasts 75 wears=$0.40 per wear and cannot be resoled so needs replacement. $100 shoes last 300 wears=$0.33 per wear but not worth resoling as it would cost the same as a new shoe. $300 shoes last 2000 wears but cost $100 to resole every 1000 wears=$0.25 per wear and simply look better and more refined and are more comfortable.",

These are not designed for that. These are strictly for casual looking clothing. Even when I put on my heal savers, I noticed that the soles are all rubber when hammering the small nails in to connect the heal savers. While wearing them, it reminds me of an orthopedic shoe. Something nurses would wear or people who work in an environment where they are standing all day long. Does the job.",
