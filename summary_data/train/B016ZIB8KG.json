Also very had to clean, most grills allow stuff to fall through, this you have to scrape off and out. Kinda nasty.",

On 8/23/2017 (less than 2 months old), I noticed that the cooking grates were heavily rusted and the porcelain coating on them has chipped off. I have never cooked on 1 of the grates (no food has ever touched it)! The grill stays covered with the Char-Broil cover all of the time, except when cooking. I'd love to receive 3 replacement grates, but have no idea how to get in touch with the seller (they appear to have gone out of business). Guess I'll be buying a different grill next season... :(",

It details an issue in the diagram (how to secure the gas line to the ignition switch) which is unclear in the installation manual. I didn't take the time to look at the yellow sheet until after I had wasted about 20 minutes trying (with no luck) to figure out that step via the instruction manual.

I am not sure what is causing the grates to rust so quickly. I use the cold nylon brushes specifically so as not to cause scratching or nicks on the porcelain but somehow rust has shown up significantly on the grates.",

The regulator valve that screws into the propane tank apparently had a leak. Thankfully I was able to close the tank and then had to put the fire out. Never leave grill unattended!!!",

MAJOR ISSUE: Right burner knob melted and fell off on 2nd use and no longer reliable! Clearly there are heating and insulation problems because above that knob the metal is all discolored from the heat dissipating and heating the metal casing in that area. This results in the metal housing above the knobs to be extremely UNSAFE and anyone can very easily burn themselves. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY A BETTER BRAND! I will never recommend a Char-Broil to anyone ever again. Poor customer service as well!",
