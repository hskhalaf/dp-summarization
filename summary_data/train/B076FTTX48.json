The machine did not come with instructions. I had a difficult time switching the plate to allow for 1 inch gumballs and reassembling. The machine looks nice but did not function correctly. When full it only gives a gumball for every 4 or 5 quarters put in. Overall my kids are disappointed as it does not always give them gumballs. UPDATE: Seller was very kind and resolved all issues and I am satisfied.",
