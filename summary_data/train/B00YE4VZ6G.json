I ended up buying 3 in total, and will likely buy another in the future. I recommend these to anyone wanting to get a handle on a messy bra drawer.",

The hanger that comes with the organizer is a nice weight and is not having any problems holding all of my metal finials (14 in all). Love this already!",
