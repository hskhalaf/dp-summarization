With that done, we cleaned up bedding areas and treated both cats with Advantage II. No more fleas, and that was about a month and a half ago. Advantage II works as well as the much more expensive prescription product our veterinarian used to provide for a previous cat, but costs so much less and does not require a prescription.",

      "text": "We live in north-central Florida, where the fleas seem almost super-invincible. We have never found ANY product that works 100 percent, or for an entire month, but Advantage II comes the closest. Our indoor-only cats only occasionally battle a few fleas in the fourth week after treatment, but for the first three weeks each month, we usually never see more than one or two fleas among the three cats combined. This is by far the best result we've achieved with any flea product. (The Seresto collar for our dog worked MIRACLES, but we cannot put collars on the cats. If they cannot chew on their own, they chew on each other's...or lose them entirely.)",
