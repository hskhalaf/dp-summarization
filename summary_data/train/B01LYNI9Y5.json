And for those of you wondering if the back cover can be put back on . Yes it can . It does also fit the Xbox One S Controller",

They are also easier to put in and get out of the charger than the single rechargeable batteries made by Duracell/Energizer. You just need a USB wall plug to hook the cord up to and your good to go.

When one battery is in use the controller randomly shuts itself off and turns itself back on. Also you wont get a low battery message until the battery is a few seconds from dying. They work but I wish i spent the extra money for a higher quality product.",

      "text": "I got these back in August and I have to say I am very pleased. I have actually only charged them 2 times so far since they last so long. I don't spent hours gaming on my controllers since I only use them for driving games and flying sims. They also include a wall charger for your batteries which is super convenient as well! You won't be disappointed in these, trust me!",

      "text": "Extremely reliable battery life. The length of the battery life is dependent on whether you use only the controller or a headset that isn't wireless. We found that with just the controller it lasts for a few days per battery. With the headset connected to the controller though it does roughly a days worth of gaming. Really like how the charger shuts off to prevent over charging.",

Out of the ones I was looking at online, this is the one I went with, especially reading stories of occasional melting with the controller stands. They do take a bit to charge, but it shpuldn't be a problem if it's for just one controller. Also, while it does have the USB cable to charge, it does not have the plug for the wall. It wasn't a problem for me, but for some it might be. Overall, I'd definitely recommend these. They have good controller compatibility, and they have a decent lifespan when playing.",
