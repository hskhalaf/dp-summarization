He loves these headphones. They stay put when he wears them, and they have fantastic sound just like his other Bose products. These are well worth the investment. (Bose products are expensive, but SO good; my husband is a musician, and he values exceptional sound quality). In addition, they came with a handy little case, which he uses diligently to protect them between uses. I would recommend this product.",

Once you start sweating, any ear bud begins to slip and becomes a nuisance thereafter. With Bose's earpieces, they stay put. The soft plastic part that makes contact with your ear fits very snug once you find the right size (they come with three sizes). The sound quality is also the best I've found in an earbud. I've tried beats, skull candy, the cheap iphone ones, and many others, but these are the best. Also, I've run them through the washer and drier and they still work perfectly.",
