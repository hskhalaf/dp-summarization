I've been given 2 sets of Teflon pans in the last 5 years and by the year mark they are scratched and no longer non-stick despite using proper utensils. With stainless steel, I can use any utensil and don't worry about how my kids, 2 with learning disabilities, are handling or cleaning them because they can't damage them.",
