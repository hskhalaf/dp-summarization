This heater really makes the room warmer without having to turn up the furnace. It's not like I can turn down the furnace now, but it does make the room warmer. It is very quiet and I really like the oscillating feature. It's not obtrusive and it looks good. I have since bought another for my son's bedroom which tends to be too cool in the winter.",

The radiant heater used a lot of electricity, the thermostat was not reliable and its metal case could get very hot.

It can be set to shut off from 1 to 8 hours. Its also pretty quiet except the beeps when you push a button on the heater or remote.",

The buttons when pressed make loud noises and at night can be a problem but other than that its a very nice product.",
