Then I bought them for my parents who have also experienced a reduction of pain in their wrists and fingers since wearing them. They are nice looking bracelets that go with everything and just look like jewelry. Came with tool to easily remove chains to fit your wrist. Love this product and highly recommend. I actually just bought 2 for my sisters bc they've heard so much positive feedback from the rest of my family.",

It's a little time consuming putting it on and taking it off due to the clasp, but having said that, I'd rather have that than have a cheap clasp. The clasp really \"clicks shut\" nicely.

The item comes with a \"tool\" to take out the pins and push them back in. The pins are extremely small and one needs very, very small fingers in order to line up the tool to the pin. Also, the tool itself if cumbersome and not very user friendly to use and the end that actually removes and reinserts the pin bends very easily, We finally did get is sized but not without a lot of angry and frustrating moments. If you buy this product, I would suggest taking it to jeweler to have it sized.",
