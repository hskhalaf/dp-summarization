Even without kids hopping in and out constantly - finding the right place for your accessories in the car is never an easy task.\n\nThe problem with standard automobile storage space is that it\u2019s tailor made for big items and is spread over the entire vehicle in a way that makes easy access almost impossible.\n\nWith Tidify\u2019s front seat multi-pocket organizer you can access everything you need in one, organized place and avoid having to repeatedly search for missing items on the floor, center console, or in the gloves compartment.\n\nTidify car organizer is larger than most other organizers on the market and provides all the storage space you\u2019ll ever need:\n\n* A deep, padded compartment with velcro lock for securing and storing even the largest laptop or tablet.\n\n* An additional cushioned compartment for storing large 3 ring binders and files\n\n* Internal mesh pocket for small items that need extra protection\n\n* 2 0.5L bottle holders\n\n* 2 zipper pockets and 2 open pockets - great for small documents and envelopes.\n\n* A 4-pens pouch that was designed to be close to the driver for easy access.\n\n* Phone sized drawstring pocket and additional velcro pocket\n\nTo make carrying the organizer outside the car easier - we\u2019ve added an extra padded sleeve that wraps the headrest strap and makes carrying the organizer comfortable even when fully loaded.\n\nWe've also added additional side straps that allow you to easily secure the organizer when hanging it on the backseat so the bag remains attached to the seat and doesn't hinder passengers on their way in or out.\n\nPerfect for law enforcement officers, police patrols, truck, semi-truck, van and cab drivers, real estate agents and appraisers, nurses, social workers, and really - anyone who cares about keeping her or his car organized and mess free.\n\nClick ADD TO CART to get yours now",
