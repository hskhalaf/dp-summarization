      "text": "This is a great entry level BD player. Great price for all the features. Plug-and-play setup. My only complaint is its insistence on using a Sony wireless adapter - I plugged in several name-brand ones and they were all rejected as incompatible. The Sony wireless adapter is almost half the price of the player itself - a travesty when every other wireless USB adapter out there is $20. Ultimately I ran a cat-5 ethernet cable to it and it worked fabulously. The menu's user interface is a little goofy and takes a minute to get used to, but the content is rich.",

I then attached a wireless adapter to it, got the netflix code, registered it via my computer and was online watching a netflix movie. I believe that the total time was about 30 minutes start to finish. Most of that time was on the computer gettig set up on Netflix. I couldn't believe how easy it was. The movie video & sound quality is just as if I were in a theater. It is living up to my expectations as a SONY product.",

The error messages said either my player or TV were not 3D capable. Tried contacting Sony. Couldn't get thru to support (normal for Sony). Finally the support from Vizio was able to tell me that most DVD players are shipped with this configuration so that people without HDTV can use them with the supplied composite cables (red/yellow/white).",

The only drawback I'd say is that it needs an additional device to connect wirelessly and that I haven't been able to configure the screen aspect ratio to fully fit my SONY TV when playing DVDs but I guess that is my TV's fault for not having better video re-size features.",

It's very convenient for situations where I'm listening to music or watching a show from the kitchen and don't have line-of-site access for the remote control. Definitely worth the money.",

      "text": "Hello, all. This is a 9 min video review for the Sony BDP-S470. I made it because I thought most people looking for speed and performance in there players would be impressed by this one. Because amazon limits the size and length of the videos, the quality in this one isn't all that great. Also if you want to see the Netflix connectivity in use I posted that video on Youtube. Needless to say, I'm very impressed with the build quality and performance of this product, and I think you will be too. Hope this review is helpful.",

If you don't plan to connect the player to the internet and are a Mac user, like me, tough luck. No 3D. And if that'w why you bought the player, you have been had.",
