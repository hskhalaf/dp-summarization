Tip: if you really want to buy it make sure to get proper warranty as from the comments on other posts I can see there is no warranty if you buy it not from Braven retail. Just as a note: also have Braven BRV-1, died in 10 months, luckily had proper warranty and got new one, new one still works fine. Braven do something with this products so they do not get broken so easily!!",

She danced around like crazy and we had them paired for surround sound, so we clipped one to each side of the tent! It was really awesome. My wife accidentally dropped one down our steep \"stairs of doom.\" It bounced around but it still pairs, plays perfect, and doesn't seem to have any issues. These were definitely worth the $130 each!",

For a bluetooth speaker to boast about how amazing it is, having such a small bluetooth range seems absurd. Kind of defeats the purpose of it being bluetooth if you're chained to having your phone so close to the speaker at all times. We plan on contacting Braven about this in the hopes that our speaker has something specifically wrong with it and that we can get one without this issue. Otherwise, if this is normal I would not recommend this speaker to anyone.",

I used the speakerphone the other day and have never had such an easy time trying to communicate with someone while others of my family were trying to listen in and making comments. I haven't really tried to test the durability of the speaker, but have had no worries when putting it next to a very splashy sink.

So much better than an earpiece as I do not get blown out now when I turn the volume up for someone who whispers on calls and then someone booming starts speaking. Pairing is easy, occasionally a pain to switch between our phones, but I think that is the nature of multiplicity and bluetooth and easily taken care of by turning off Bluetooth on the other device when re-pairing.",

The Braven sounds best at mid level volume where the Bose wins at all levels. The Braven reaches a higher volume overall but loundness is not my preference as we normally have it setting close on the back deck enjoying a glass of wine. Just my personal opinion mind you.",

Once familiar with them, the controls are easy to use. Overall a good product, and if the water and shock resistance are important to you, then I highly recommend this speaker.",

It's very loud in outdoor mode with low bass, it has more bass in indoor mode but not as loud. I use it for BBQs and when friends are hanging out in the house. Battery life is good . Durability is awesome. I suggest getting it over Dre , bose, ect... because of durability is definitely a plus",
