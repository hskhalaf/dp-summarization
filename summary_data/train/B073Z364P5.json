I was a bit skeptical of this at first but when I received it , this has been the only chapstick I've been using. Far better than EOS, Chapstick brand, soft lips, carmex, and any other brand I've ever used. Nice subtle smell of the flavor & lasts a long time with just one application. I'd recommend this to anyone. Plus it's 100% natural so that's an added bonus! I will definitely be buying again when I run out.",

It ends up feeling more like a \"layer\" of chapstick on my lips, instead of it absorbing into my lips. I find myself having to apply this more often than BBs as well. I appreciate the ingredients in the product, but it wont be enough to make me purchase them again.",

One of my favorite chapsticks is the Vit E and Peppermint Burt's Bees and Naturstick is surprisingly comparable - in texture, scent and feel. It has all the goods of Burt's Bees without the price. This chapstick actually moisturizes your lips instead of annoyingly just sitting on top. There is a peppermint scent and it leaves that fun minty tingle as well. Would definitely recommend and plan to repurchase!!",

It's confusing, because the ingredients are all the right things for a great lip balm, they just somehow completely missed the mark. There are some really amazing low cost lip balms out there, but in this case the low cost is low quality.",

When using other products I found that my lips were still chapped no matter how much I used them. With this chapstick, my lips feel smooth and moisturized. I was a little leery about purchasing chapstick online, but I am so incredibly happy I did! I highly recommend this product for anyone, the scent is light and the product goes on smoothly leaving lips feeling refreshed.",
