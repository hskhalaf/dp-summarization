The Title needs to be changed to include the word bag, or replacement bag or \"Does not include Hopper Frame\". Bag Quality is okay ... although without the frame, it is no different than a zippered reusable grocery bag. Side wall material is very thin, base material is okay and includes a piece of square support to make it a bit more sturdy..",
