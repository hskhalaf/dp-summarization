If you push the ring open by pressing along the diameter of the rings the free edge is easy to thread into the main suspension ring. I couldn't have installed the chandelier on the roof with out my husband's help but that doesn't mean much as my skills with tools are far from adequate. It did take him couple of hours to figure everything out since the instructions are about 5 sentences long. Once all done, it is breathtaking! Great piece for the price!",

The instructions were very minimal but I had no trouble putting the light together using logo and common sense. The issue for me was trying to get the chandelier to sit straight. Since I was putting it in the closet vs over a table, the chain was too long and I had to cut most of it away. I had to finagle some stuff together so that it could attach to the ceiling box. I wish it came with a downrod for shorter ceilings.",

The instructions requires a magnifying glass to see all the parts and directions... or the lack of instructions made it a bit challenging for first lighting install. Key things I've learned, the legs (chandeliers) with wires do not stay connected with when you screw the middle piece on. This was 4 disassembles before we found that if you unscrew the bottom where the ball hangs, you can screw it on easier. Moral, every piece that is screwed on needs to be disassembled to reassemble. Did require a call for help to get the wires to stay. Good luck!",
