Nest Aware (Data storage) subscription is expensive as they charge for each camera, although the second camera is less expensive. Expensive to purchase 1, but the 2 camera package is more reasonably priced.",

The subscription for recording history seems to be helpful when using it remotely. The cost for multiple google devices had recently become more economical. For me the downside is the camera 15V power cord will not extend beyond 20 feet. However, Coolgear POE (Power Over Ethernet) adapter allows you to power your camera over 300\u201d via cat5 cable. It does require a 48 V POB power injector and a usbc male-male cable, that\u2019s not included. You may also need a special adapter plate for wall/ceiling mounting the camera.",

It says the camera was offline (but the internet was on since all my other wifi connected devices are working during the same time periods). Very unreliable -- even with the monthly paid subscription. I might go back to Logitech in the coming year.",
