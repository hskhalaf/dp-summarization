So I guess duct tape is in order. Practically the whole thing is plastic. The design is very good and its comfortable to use and quite small. I wish it were sturdier and made of quality materials.

So you can\u2019t just replace one attachment for the other without using a different connector. Not too mention you can\u2019t store all the connectors and attachments on the vacuum.
