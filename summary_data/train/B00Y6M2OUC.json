My unit worked excellent when I installed it in the summer, the AC could be controlled wirelessly/remotely with my iPhone using the app. I setup schedules using the app, it would maintain temperatures and operate according to the schedule. It was flawless. However once winter came, the heat would continue to cycle until I shut it off from the breaker box and would restart the moment I turned it back on. We woke up 3 times with the house in the mid-high 80s. I have since installed a Nest and it works perfectly heating and cooling.",

(He is very capable of home projects, I'm not sure what the experience would be for someone less \"handy\"). They operate perfectly as far as we can tell, which has been about 1 month now. Extra features that we use/appreciate include the backlit screen when in use, and the ability to adjust the thermostat by using a phone app. We are very happy with this product.",

Furnace was cycling way to often. I can`t imagine what the A/C woud do. This was unacceptable so I sent it back. The app was great, and very user friendly. I bought the Emerson Sensi Smart and it allows you to adjust the cycle rate to slow, med, fast. I don`t like the app and wifi set up I found a little confusing but it works.",
