This is a chunky glittery lip gloss with a chemical smell that burned my lips. I'm pissed that I missed my return window. I don't know why Amazon allows brands to sell an item under a brand name, when it's clearly not that brand. THIS IS NOT COVERGIRL. The applicators on this gloss are also cheap, hard plastic; not the traditional doe foot. COMPLETE JUNK!!!!",

The reason why it's only 4 stars is because it is a litte but gritty and it's because there are fine-milled specks of glitter in it to really make is sparkly in the sun. I like my lips extra smooth. I still use this often. Good lip gloss otherwise.",
