I've been keto for three years and do most of my cooking and baking at home and I am yet to find a snack/breakfast recipe that tastes as flavorful as the Stoka bars. Texture is great too, not crumbly yet they are crunchy. Good portion size, too. They are pricey, though, so a suggestion for the manufacturers: maybe offer a discount for bulk purchases, monthly subscription, or something along these lines to reward loyal customers who will keep coming back for more (i.e. me!).",

I contacted Stoka to let them know I received a bad batch, and they informed me that they had reformulated their bars and, in turn, made them inedible.

I was thinking it was going to be more crunchy but its actually not crunchy like a granola bar..more like, you can just taste that there are almonds in it. Its soft when I bite into it and a bit gritty as I chew it. I will not be buying again.",

These taste great and are fantastic for a busy lifestyle. Highly recommended! They are a bit expensive, but I use these as a meal replacement (breakfast) most of the time.

I tried both the vanilla and chocolate versions but didn't really think the chocolate was much different in flavor from vanilla. It's got a very slight sweetness with mostly a roasted almond taste. This is one of the first bars that I found myself liking that didn't have some form of hidden sugar and wasn't the typical chewy/chalky type protein bar. They are mild in flavor but they really satisfied my need for something a crunchy quick snack. Not sure why some people think it tastes like a partial board, I didn't find that the case at all.",
