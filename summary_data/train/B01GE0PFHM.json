You might get a good set and you might not. But even on the set I recieved, I can tell the quality is far from good. The tips are not perfectly lined up and they actually appear to be tapered in diameter. So, I guess you get what you pay for.",

For less money for the kit of four tools in a neatly designed and well made carry case than the one previous tool. I still can't believe it. Get your set before something changes!!",

The pliers also have a very large opening range on the jaws: Straight pliers open 4 cm; bent pliers open 3 cm (because tips are bent, making them shorter). I highly recommend these pliers.",
