I have seen some strange reviews with people saying this is cut with corn syrup, sugar, or something else because the honey didn't ferment in a mead, or was crystalized. Honey crystallizes, it's normal, and for meads not fermenting or tasting bad its probably the way you made your mead. Making a mead that is 20% is bound to taste aweful. Bottom line the honey tastes nice, I've used it, I like it!",

Not bad, just different. Overall I'm not at all disappointed but also don't think I'll buy it on repeat. YMMV...",
