I wanted to have the table look as lovely as possible, so, with three days to go, I ordered some lovely ceramic items from Amazon. The sugar and creamer set were from Jusalpha. The arrived intact and beautiful, and on time. As I cleared the table, I noticed a problem with the application of the floral design. I requested a replacement and received it two days later. I used the original box and returned it through Kohl\u2019s the next day. I am so happy to have this set for future tea times.",

I am some what disappointed it doesn't have a descriptive label at the bottom regarding it's composition. I had to carry out the so called \"bone fine china test\" and by that it appears legitimate. Call me OCD, but the creamer tip seems to have missed the mark ...... I do love the choice of pastels. My plan is to mix and match with other finds from Royal Albert and some from Antique shops.",
