I tightened it and, after a few times of just spinning the collar, it was already loose again. Inevitably the bolt will start to shear with use and it will never get tight again. I went through 4 of these types of bars when I started lifting because mine had a warranty. Should have learned my lesson then. I bought a Texas Power Bar- a few hundred dollars more but I'll never need another.",

The packaging left a little to be desired, though I can't say I have a better idea of how to ship one of these things. Arrived with a few minor dings and had some small areas that were left unpainted. Just cosmetic stuff though. I can see this bar easily lasting me 5+ years assuming I still have skin on my hands.",

I do have some complaints, the first, of course, being that it's underweight for a standard Olympic Bar. It's 44lbs, not 45lbs. I know that hardly matters, but it matters to me. Also, when I received my second bar, the bar was dirty. I don't know how or why, but the bar had mud on it, even though it was packaged properly and the plastic wrap had not been breached. Overall, I do recommend it.",

The knurling is not very aggressive at all and is pretty shallow, but that does not affect my ability to use the bar. The collars are held on with socket cap bolts like all cheap barbells are, so keep a hex key nearby to keep them tight and you'll be set. Overall the bar was worth the money for a starter garage bar to go with my starter cast plates. This is a great buy if you are looking to start a home gym on a budget",

But it's very durable, and contrasting to other reviews I feel the knurling is smoother than the bars I use at the gym (which usually scrape my chest a bit on cleans, while this bar doesn't).

      "text": "The bar arrived very quickly \u2013 within a few days of ordering - faster then estimated delivery. The most important part for me was that there was no grooved pattern on the sleeves. The sleeves (the area where you load the plates) are smooth, so getting plates on and off is easy and the plates don\u2019t get scratched. Although there was no visible machine oil on the bar I could smell it. I wiped the bar with paper towels just in case. I use it with barbell lock (quick snatch) collars and it works great for the price.",

Unfortunately, that's also the reason for -1 star, despite being brand new and coated in oil, there were a couple small rust spots. Given I know I won't be meticulous about regularly maintaining it with oil myself, I know I'll develop small rust marks here and there. Not ideal, but overall satisfied for the price tag given higher quality bars are 2-3x the price.",
