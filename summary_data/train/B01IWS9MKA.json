It held my Topside Dual w/ my Profile atty with a custom drip tip, a 30 ml bottle of my fav vaping juice along with 4 18650 batteries inside the main compartment. The outside pocket held my mini screwdriver, A small pair of scissors, a pair of tweezers, pure cotton (of course) an extra set of mesh coils and the forming tool for the coils. This case held it all. It covered every need I had bought it for. Don't hesitate. Buy it! You won't regret it!!",

I never knew before how convenient and easy it was to have something that could carry my large vape and vape oil. I can fit that old Aspire NX75 and Smok Qbox with a bottle of vape oil. That NX75 with its tank can be pretty tall and this case fit it easily. FINALLY! A quality case, great zippers that glide well, and a convenient strap that disconnects, and traveling with some of my vape gear is exactly what I needed! Yay!",
