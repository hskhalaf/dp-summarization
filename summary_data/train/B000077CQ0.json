I just had to keep trying until I got it and I really feel the written instructions could have been much clearer. It was very frustating for me as a non mechanical persin. Once I finally did get it together I was really happy with how it's going to work. It's the right size, folds and opens easily, and is a great price.

You have to hammer in a roll pin at one point and the parts being hammered on won't be well supported while you apply a few stout blows to the pin. It's OK. Hammering can be cathartic. Overall a great value if these meet your requirements.",
