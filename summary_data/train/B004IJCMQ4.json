The phone is new as described by the seller OEM Battery Depot. The phone does look new. Only problem is the battery.",

I would snap them back in place but they still fell off. I got home and had to super glue them into place. This happened only 2 hours after getting the phone. The battery charger connection is pretty flimsy too. I sure it will break way too soon. Rather disappointed in the whole package. Thought from the picture I was getting the GZ phone that had durable rubber casing that can hold up to normal use. Did like the price though, but should have remembered, \"you get what you pay for\"",

      "text": "A vast improvement over the regular phones that Verizon carries, but the battery life is weak. Let me use this opportunity to just jab at Verizon for one moment. I notice that in their effort to push everyone into the expensive smart phone universe, Verizon is carrying only a couple of models of regular phones in their store -- all crappy garbage. This phone is way better than what they carry in their stores and the compass is cool as well.",

I didn't have any trouble with the ordering process or the time it took to get the phone; but when the phone came the charge port did NOT work. We could not charge the phone with the wall charger or the car charger that I ordered seperately. I am returning this product.",

Turns out the connector inside the phone is only *glued* in. It's a separation waiting to happen. I had to buy a cradle charger to keep the phone charged. And forget about USB connectivity. Apart from the lousy glued-in connector that's guaranteed to fall out, this is an OK phone, I suppose. I wouldn't recommend it, however.",
