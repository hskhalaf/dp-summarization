The oil is not heavy at all light weight you can't even tell if you spray oil on your hair except for the smell. The smell is to die for, people will want to stay next to you to smell your hair this is how good it is, and it's not a strong smell either i'm sensitive to smell due to my sinus and allergy this one is perfect. This is my to go oil spray..",

Only giving 4 stars because a lof it leaked out during shipping, but i still do have most of the bottle left regardless. My daughter has curly hair and I used it on her as a leave in conditioner and her curls looked so defined and bouncy. I love how this really does work without making hair feel heavy and greasy.",
