      "text": "I ordered this because I wasn't sure if PSP accepted normal USB cables. This thing doesn't work, and it's definitely not user error at work here, given the fact that I used a regular mini-USB cable from a camera I own with my PSP immediately afterwards, having no problems getting my PC to detect my PSP. I still couldn't do the transfer, because the Media Go software (which has no effect on this review, FYI) is freaking terrible. I'd only suggest using a cable if you're going to manually transfer content through your PC operating system's file browser. Even then, don't purchase this cable. Just use a regular mini-USB cable. You probably already have one lying around.",

For the first time in months, I've actually fully charged my PSP. The charging cable is a lifesaver when you can't turn the PSP on to enable USB charging. TIP FOR THOSE EXPERIENCING DRIVER ERRORS WITH WINDOWS ON A DESKTOP: Try plugging the cord into the back of the computer rather than one of the front/top USB ports. Worked like a charm for me.",

This is a little annoying as there's one extra cord just useless and dangling when you're using this. As it is however, I purchased this over others due to research of how other customers have had issues with cheaper ebay or amazon alternatives and this came recommended by many sources. Have had no trouble so far and thankfully, I also purchasedso charging has been reduced to only once or twice a week.",
