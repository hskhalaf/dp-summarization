I cut out one side of a cardboard box to catch any wood chips, bark etc. And set the log in the center. I use the recommended 4lb Stanley Fatmax Hammer which I purchased as a combo with the cracker. Any lighter hammer would make splitting more difficult in my opinion. (See the photo) I would also recommend using eye protection during use.",

I am able to split wood effortlessly with just my 3# hammer, down to 1/4\" thickness. I do wish it could accommodate wood that's a little larger than 6' diameter.",

Larger pieces do not split easily, it is truly for smaller pieces to make into kindling. Think scrap lumber or limbs.",

Very little effort is needed and you can easily split the kindling into finer and finer pieces, as needed. The ring is large enough to accommodate fairly big pieces and does a good job of holding the piece in place as you hammer it down. I cut a large 'thump stump' to set it on to save my back from excessive bending and it works beautifully. It is well built and will last for years.......i've had this one for 4 now..",
