        "The slim, lightweight Toshiba Kirabook still feels very premium, and it deserves credit for being one of the first Windows laptops to feature a better-than-HD display",

      "text": "My ONLY complaint is working with two monitors in Windows 8.1. Fitting such a high res display in a 13\" screen was a bit too much for Windows 8.1. Due to high res features being limited in Windows 8.1, to make appropriate font/display adjustments (bigger font-size feature, etc) requires a log out and log in again. That means when you hook up your Kirabook to an external monitor, you'll have to reduce the font, display sizes, log out and back in for the external monitor to not show super big text/windows. I hear MSFT is working on fixing this nuisance, but that's all it is, a nuisance. The laptop is pricey but amazing.",

I always have to reboot to continue, and it doesn't matter which browser I use--Chrome, Firefox, or Explorer. Wish I'd have bought a different computer.",

It's less than a year old and I still have problems - shuts down when unplugged, won't charge whilst plugged in. Trued updating the Bios but that didn't work. I'd love to return it but I use it to run my business and I travel constantly. When am I going to get the chance to get it fixed? Never again, Toshiba!",

I'm not really impressed with touch on a laptop, seems pointless and really annoying when pointing out something to someone since I invariably touch the screen and wreck was I was trying to show. Touch on a laptop does not enhance productivity since a mouse is more efficient. Windows 8.1: It is nearly impossible to get the panel on the right side of the screen to display. Some kind of weird dance is needed with the mouse to have it pop-out. I love the features of the laptop. Hate Windows 8.1 which degrades the experience with the computer.",

I need to call support again because the wifi connectivity to other devices is not working . I can only give this product a three star for now.",

But for this price, I should be getting a 'best of class' which this laptop is certainly not. Bottom line: struggled with it for 2 weeks and ended up sending it back.",
