      "text": "I have been looking for a small crib for my house for the grand babies. I really like the color ( gender neutral) durability and the easy storage . My husband put it together and I was not there so I do not know anything about the assembly . I bought a mattress to use in it because of the other reviews and I am happy I did. The \u201cmattress\u201d that comes with it is so thin, I realize so you can store everything together but seriously folks buy a different one and just store beside the bed. Overall though I would definitely recommend and would buy again. Great product and price!",

There was a strange smell the first day but gone now. 2 days later, I ordered one more for my inlaws house and also, the mattress is fine. I did keep the other one I got just because it sleeps him a bit higher and easier for me to pick up the baby (I am kind of short).",

Only downfall I've found in the few days of use so far, is that the little wheels on it are super weak. One of them snapped right off as the crib was being rolled into place, with about as much force as it takes to snap a tooth pick. Otherwise great buy!!",

Hooded caster wheels allow it to be moved easily from one room to another and because it's compact it fits easily through any doorway. When not in use the crib folds up to a mere 6 inches wide in minutes and can be stored away easily in a closet or under a bed. It's lightweight, very sturdy and built of solid hardwoods featuring a gorgeous (non-toxic) finish. This crib meets or exceeds all JPMA and ASTM safety standards and contains no lead.
