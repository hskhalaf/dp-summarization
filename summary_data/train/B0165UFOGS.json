This seat does everything as advertised. In addition, it was easy to install (it took me less than 20 minutes!). There is a plastic plate to install where you slide your toilet assembly so make sure the surface where you install the plate can lie flat. The plate has to lay flat on the toilet (around 1 1/4 inch from edge of toilet/water). In addition, you don't want the bowl that holds the water to encroach to the toilet seat. See how the back of the toilet seat is flat.",

As bidets go, this the only one of which I'm aware that both lets you use warm water and doesn't need to connect to the hot water line to your sink, which wouldn't work for us. It definitely looks a little clunky/clinical, but it's very convenient to use. Overall, highly recommended.",

I weigh 150 pounds, and if it\u2019s too small for me I can imagine how a 200 pounder would feel about it. The opening obviously was designed for Japanese behinds.",

My major concern was that my American Standard Cadet fully skirted toilet (with top mounted seat) would not accommodate the Washlet. Well, it easily does. The Washlet actually comes with a top mount kit and fits perfectly. I'm very happy with this purchase.",

You will also use way less toilet paper, which is a tradeoff for a higher energy bill...but who cares. Only knock is the way the seat slants downward, which is not uncomfortable but takes a little getting used to.",

    "description": "Size:Elongated\n\nThe TOTO WASHLET A100 Elongated Electric Bidet Toilet Seat delivers ecology-minded luxury with a streamlined design. Unlike traditional toilet paper that can often be rough and ineffective, the WASHLET quickly provides comfortable warm water cleansing at the touch of a button.A once mundane trip to the bathroom can become a spa-like experience with a WASHLET.\n\nThe WASHLET A100 is fully automated, featuring a soft rear spray, rear cleanse, and front cleanse with the option of an oscillating stream. The controls are located on a convenient arm control panel. The wand is self-cleaning, automatically cleaning itself before and after every use. The WASHLET features a heated SoftClose seat with three temperature settings. The temperature and pressure of the water are adjustable with three temperature settings and five pressure settings.\n\nUsing a WASHLET reduces the need for toilet paper, saving trees and water used to manufacture each roll. As we get older, our mobility can deteriorate and make it increasingly hard to clean ourselves after toileting. Medical conditions and debilitating illnesses can make using the bathroom without assistance almost impossible, but with a WASHLET, you can increase your independence and feel cleaner with just one touch of a button. Includes mounting and connection hardware.\n\n\nDo not use a loose or faulty electrical outlet",
