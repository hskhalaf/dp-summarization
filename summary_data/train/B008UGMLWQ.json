It is a bit heavier than your average lens, however, I no longer have to lug around my 3 lenses because this 18-135mm sort of gets all the jobs done.

      "text": "This is a perfect \"do everything\" lens. Wide enough to get the big group shots, long enough to get distant subjects or tight close-ups. On my 7D, autofocus is very quick. I photographed a helicopter flying overhead, and the autofocus nailed 9/10 shots. Sharpness is also very good. This competes very well with the EF-S 15-85 (actually matches overall according to DxOMark), and also the EF-S 17-55 (only one point less according to DxOMark). The plus is that you get much more range! Of course, inside with low light is not this lens' friend, but for most situations, this is going to stay on your camera more often.",

In order to focus from the most deep to the most shallow depth of field, you have to turn it forever, making quick focus adjustments a bit of a hard task. Also, this is a 67mm lens, which is different from the standard lens that probably came with your Canon.I was aware of this, and it's not a bad thing, just keep in mind that the filters and lens attachments won't necessarily fit.",

There are better portrait lenses out there, but if you could only take one lens and had to shoot both stills and video, this would be the lens to take, provided that your camera is APS-C format. Full frame cameras will not support this or any other EF-S lens.",

The lens focuses quickly and properly. It is very quite, not quite silent, but very close. The IS properties of the lens are outstanding (as the are in other Canon lenses I own). Cost is nominal compared to the excellent properties of this lens. PS. Do not be afraid to order white box items through Amazon.",

I've own a Tamron, 3 Canon lens, and a Tokina lens before purchasing this to my photo kit, and am amazed at the absolute build quality and overall workman ship of it. It will be my walk-around lens and paired perfected with my 12-25mm Tokina wide-angle lens. For the average/above average APC SLR photographer, that's really all you need!! 5 STARs",

    "description": "The EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM is ideal for video and still images alike, featuring refined Image Stabilization system that delivers up to four equivalent stops of shake correction throughout the zoom range; and offers a maximum magnification of 0.28x at the telephoto end.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\n\n\nCANNON EF-S 18-135MM F/3.5-5.6 IS STM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesigned to exceed expectations and ideal for video and still images alike, the new EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM marks a new standard for EF-S lenses. It features a refined Image Stabilization system that delivers up to four equivalent stops of shake correction throughout the zoom range; and offers a maximum magnification of 0.28x at the telephoto end, while remaining even more compact in size. This EF-S lens supports the Canon EOS Rebel T4i DSLR's Movie Servo AF feature for smooth and quiet continuous AF during movie shooting by utilizing a new six-group zoom system and the adoption of a stepping motor and focus mechanism. High-speed autofocus is achieved thanks to an Inner focusing system, high-speed CPU, and optimized AF algorithm. Appearing for the first time in a Canon lens is Dynamic IS (Movie Shooting Mode only) that uses a wide image stabilization correction range to help ensure steady video while shooting when walking.\n\n\nWhether shooting movies or stills, image quality is phenomenal, with one UD and one PMo aspheric lens providing high resolution and high contrast images with reduced chromatic aberration throughout the zoom range. A 7 blade, circular aperture ensures beautiful, soft backgrounds and optimized lens coatings ensure excellent color with minimized ghosting and flare. A zoom ring lock even prevents the lens from accidently extending.\n\nSpecifications \nFocal Length & Maximum Aperture: Focus Adjustment: Zoom System: Max.
