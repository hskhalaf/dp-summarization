It ripped in 3 places from the result of the storm and one of the tabs broke at the bottom of the tent. It tore at the bottom of the entry door and a very large tear at the seam in the middle of the tent. We ended up not being able to stay in it this year.. I was really hoping it would last a few yrs.",

Haven't used during heavy rain, but it works great at keeping out rain and morning dew. Watch the video of how to roll it up, because it is possible to get the tent rolled up and put back into the original bag. Very quick set up and take down time with two people.",

It did leak a bit (before rolling away) where the door zippers meet. Tent blew away with only base stakes in. Not the included ropes.

Love the sun room area. 2 or 3 adults/teens recommended for set up, but I could probably manage alone if necessary.",

That said, laid the tent out, watched a YouTube video or someone reviewing the tent and figured out how to get the poles started and it went up very fast after that! The tent is HUGE and has 2 rooms. Its a great tent, very sturdy feeling. It has loads of windows for airflow. There is only 1 port for an extension cord. But the way the tent is designed you could easily fit another cord through the hole, or even in the door and just zip the door shut up to the cord.",

The only thing negative I could say is that it definitely couldn\u2019t sleep 16 people unless they were laying on lithe floor side by side with no room for movement. My family of 5 were more than comfortable. My 3 kids were on one side and my husband and I were on the other. All in all I\u2019m very satisfied with my purchase.",

Enough space inside for two full size mattresses, two large dog crates, two people plus all our stuff. My favourite out of several different tents I own. Great quality been through some pretty rough weather and stayed cozy and dry",

Has a nice hole to stick your orange extension cord through so you can charge all of your devices and use the plug-in air pump for your mattresses.",

Despite tears and scratches from its pool plunge we stayed dry on two heavy rain nights @ 7500 ft. Stayed warm by zipping closed half of tent and sleeping all on one side......wish I'd thought of that first night. Loved the tent worked out great for us. It is pretty big.",

It goes up in about 30 minutes & down in about the same. Just match up the colors on the poles for easy assembly. The directions aren't that great, but I had watched YouTube reviews so we just did what the videos suggested. Highly recommended!",

Used it over a weekend in South Dakota with over 20MPH winds. We left the rain fly off during the day and it held up great with no rips, holes, collapsing, or poolees snapping. I will say, it is a little confusing setting up the first time, but we had it up in about 10 minutes with 4 dudes helping.",

I have never been so disappointed. The only advantage to this tent is that I won't have to worry about packing it back up... Right in the trash. Please heed this warning and take your $280 and put it through a paper shredder. Save your self the time and disappointment",
