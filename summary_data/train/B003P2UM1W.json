I gave this product only 3 stars, because there's some well-known glitch that regularly won't allow me to print photos until resetting the printer completely, sometimes more than once or twice. It also does not print the correct size of image when my husband prints from his PC (I use a Mac) - the images come out way too small. The photos come out a little dark, but I imagine I can tweak that somehow with my photo app and/or printer settings. HP's support is very good. I would definitely recommend this All-In-One model for home use.",

However, a week later, the printer stopped functioning. This time, a quick call to HP solved the problem - the printer needed to be removed from the printer list and put back. Apparently, this is a common issue, and easily solved. Now it's up and running, and we can print from computers or smart phones anywhere (at home or away) there is an internet signal - a cool function.",

It eats ink like a SUV eats gas in rush hour traffic, scans a 25 page b/w text document only to create a file larger than 10 MB, and sends multiple annoying messages to to your computer screen the second it senses you are less than half full on one of its extremely low capacity overpriced cartridges. I hate this HP cash cow.",

In my opinion, this software is plain ol' lame.",

Today, I've tried to print jewel case inserts using the iTunes \"print\" function only to find out that the printer is not compatible to this iTunes function. I've spent time online looking for solutions and apparently, this is an issue and people are not happy about it. I'm not happy about it. I like to create my own cd's and print out playlists and case inserts. If I had known about this prior to buying my new printer, I most likely would not have bought this.",
