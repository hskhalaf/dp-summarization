Another point, which in general should not be a concern, you cannot purchase parts for it. So if something breaks or wears out you have to purchase a new one.

My cat is super fat and usually hates inclosed cat boxes but since this is the easiest one to clean, it gets cleaned out more often than his other boxes, he has come to favor this cat box. It's super easy to filter the liter. I don't feel super gross after having sifted cat litter like normal. It obviously still needs to be overhaul cleaned out but it's not anymore difficult than any other enclosed cat box. I definitely recommend this cat box and will probably slowly replace the other cat boxes in my house with this style. I super recommend this.",

You need about 4-5 feet of open space to roll this box effectively and as intended. I decided that it was easier to scoop then to go through the hassle of rolling this large unit. Perhaps if someone has many cats, they may find it easier then scooping the old fashioned way. I purchased the litter genie plus on another site as well, and I absolutely love it! 5 stars for that for sure. It makes scooping the old fashioned way so much easier.",

Being all plastic, the top and bottom sections do not FIT together tightly, and the cheap plastic latches don't close easy meaning sooner or later they will break defeating their purpose and the purpose of rolling the box to the right or left without litter leaking out from box which is a big mess, so don't recommend buying this item",

She said it was too difficult, so she just unlatched the top and did it the usual way with a scoop. So I suppose it depends on personal preference.",

I have four of these boxes and they all perform flawlessly, and it takes literal seconds to empty all of them. The set up is extremely easy as is the use. They're really large and litter doesn't stick to the bottom.",

Plus, it's just awkward rotating your litter box around.

This box in the video is the LARGE, perfect size for my 6lb and 9lb cats. Remember when ordering that about 1/3 of the base is reserved for the litter cleaning, so if you have multiple or large cats, go with the large. For petite cats or cats that don't mind smaller spaces, the reg should be fine. Thanks for looking.",
