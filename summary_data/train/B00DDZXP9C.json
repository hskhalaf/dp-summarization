Also it will not wake up from sleep mode when I airprint half the time and I have to physically walk over and push buttons to wake it up. The display is very hard to read and I sometimes use my phone flash light to read it. When it runs out of paper, you cannot just add paper. You have to add paper and open the top assembly and shut it again before it will recognize the paper.",

Small gripe: the buttons at upper right are not labeled, and the raised icons on them are the same matte black as the buttons themselves, so you must press the Start button to bet illumination to tell which button is which.",

Even then I have never been able to make even one envelope print straight. Fortunately, we have a second laser printer in the house with an appropriate bypass for envelopes. If I could choose again, I would definitely not buy this one, but would keep looking and probably pay more.",

Unfortunately, this printer has serious problems. It goes into sleep mode every night and the only way to wake it up is to remove the power cord from the rear, wait several seconds, then reattach the power cord. This is hardly convenient. In fact, it is a pain. Imagine having to unplug your printer every day before using it. It is just a headache, especially if one is on another floor and needs to print. Enough said. Save your money, save yourself another headache, and do not buy this Dell product.",

As other reviewers have commented recently, it doesn't seem to have true cloud print functionality, but rather appears to be limited to what is known as 'classic' cloud print functionality. Unfortunately, Dell does not include any instructions with the printer or on their website on setting the printer up for cloud print use. Calling customer service did not result in any solutions, but rather just long hold times and being transferred to other extensions......and even longer hold times.",

Two major downsides of this printer is the poor visibility of the LCD screen that is very dim and hard to read and the relatively higher cost of the toner cartridges vs. the Brother cartridges that last forever. I do like the wireless connectivity of the printer but you do need a good signal from your router or it does lose the connection when I first had it upstairs.",

You have to power-cycle the printer to get it to wake up. I tried everything Dell tech support suggested. Dell finally exchanged the printer for a different one, but the second one has the exact same problem. This appears to be a basic flaw in the printer. Do not buy this printer, unless you are OK with power cycling it every time you want to use it.",
