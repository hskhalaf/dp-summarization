Edit on Dec. 29, 2018: After some trying and testing, I found that the lens is indeed very sharp but tends to create a fair amount of flaring and ghosting, probably because it is so short and doesn't have a lens hood. So, it is good for landscape and similar stuff as long as you're not photographing against the sun or other sources of light. Therefore, I downgraded it from five to four stars.",

    "description": "Ultra slim and compact, the new EF-M 22mm f/2 STM is the EOS M Digital Camera\u2019s moderate wide-angle lens that\u2019s small and light enough to carry everywhere. Its bright f/2.0 lens aperture works well with the EOS M Digital Camera\u2019s large sensor to provide exceptional low-light performance, as well as create beautiful background blur in portraits. An aspheric lens element delivers high resolution and high contrast. For moviemakers, the EF-M 22mm f/2 STM utilizes a built-in stepping motor to provide smooth and quiet continuous autofocus when shooting video with the Canon EOS M Digital Camera. A circular aperture (7 blades) delivers soft-focus backgrounds and a short minimum focusing distance of only 5.9 inches (0.15 meters) allows you to get closer to your subjects.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifications EF-M 22mm f/2 STM\n\nFocal Length & Maximum Aperture\n22mm, 1:2\nLens Construction\n7 elements in 6 groups\nDiagonal Angle of View\n63\u00b030'\nFocus Adjustment\nInner Focusing System\nClosest Focusing Distance\n0.49 ft. / 0.15m \nFilter Size\n43mm\nMax.
