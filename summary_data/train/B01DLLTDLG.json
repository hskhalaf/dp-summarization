I feel like these look like expensive night lights, starting off dim and getting brighter as it gets darker out. I have no complaints. They are slim to the wall so my 1 1/2 year old doesn't notice there is something to pull out and they stay securely in the wall (I had no issues with them in my US outlet) these are honestly one of my best Amazon finds and I've recommended them to many friends. If my review was helpful to you please let me know! Thanks!",

We use them in the hallway to the guest bathroom, in the kitchen, & in the children's room.

I tried them out in the garage, kitchen and hallway and they worked out perfect. I wouldn't use these in a bedroom as the light might be too bright and keep you up.

Daylight brightness used in many lights is well known to be brighter as well as more \"electrifying\" so it will actually wake you up a little bit if you are walking around at night. If you want an example... if you're phone has a \"night mode\" or \"blue light filter\" try using that at night. You will see your phone go from a clear white to a warm white. This is easier on your eyes. Very happy with the warm light version of these.",

If you want to light a hallway at night, they are certainly efficient, but with such a small light output, they are not satisfactory. I would love these if they came in a higher wattage for brighter light.",

      "text": "All of these units are still functioning after 2-1/2 years. I use them for nighttime navigating, and they work well. I don't need to turn on any lights in my small bathroom during a late-night visit; one of these units provides enough light all by itself. I can't definitively say they're energy efficient, but they are LEDs and they only run when it's dark, so the logical assumption is that they're efficient. Very satisfied with this purchase.",
