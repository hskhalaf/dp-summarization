It is physically larger than the 20-50mm, but it's well worth it. Not a whole lot else needs to be said, this guy is excellent. Attached are a couple unedited photos I snapped in the Dominican Republic using this lens.",

      "text": "Replacing the 20-50mm kit lens that came with the NX2000 with this amazing 18-55mm zoom lens. Although this lens was also a kit lens but the size is bigger and feel more solid than the smaller 20-50mm. This lens is sharper and focus faster than the 20-50mm lens, and it won't move when autofocus. The image quality is better. I also update its firmware for the NX1 ready. If you don't care about the bigger size, I suggest this lens for every NX camera.",

      "text": "This is the primary lens on my NX20. The 18-55's very quick auto focus alone makes it well worth the price. It rarely hunts. The OIS is a good thing, especially with macro photos. Solidly built, proper metal bayonet, good shade. If I start shooting serious videos I'll wish the very quiet autofocus was dead silent (should give this 4.5 stars for that reason). Maybe an external mic would solve that. The 20-55 that came with my now-rarely-used NX1000 was excellently optically (I make big prints) but was no good for portraits because it hunts far too much...so it's also rarely used. Lesson: you get what you pay for with kit lenses.",
