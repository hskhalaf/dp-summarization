After a few months the metal clasps that are on the strap just snapped off and rendered the unit useless. On closer inspection it is apparent that the load bearing is on these clasps as this is where the unit clips together. These metal clasps do not handle the necessary stress that is applied to them. I have tried getting help from Wahoo on this as well as a faulty cadence sensor but they just do not reply. I would therefore not recommend buying this as the value for money is hopeless",

Battery replaced and the Bluetooth signal was kaput. I contacted Wahoo customer service and offered to pay for shipping back and forth to the company as I suspected a defect. I specifically asked that they make the product better so that this doesn't become landfill. They told me to buy a new strap and did not care to look at it, or show it to engineers. They just told me to buy a new strap. No thanks!",

I find placing the sensor on my skin for 30 seconds prior to actually putting it on has made it sync right away. It seems to be accurate during my entire workout which is nice also unlike my Fitbit I used to wear that constantly stopped reading my heart rate or tell me it was in the 40's mid workout.

With the free app, you can download and share data with nearly all popular fitness apps.
