This one was bought to replace one bought several years ago that was damaged. The seller \"Best Buy\" was extremely helpful when a shipping problem developed. I highly recommend this camera and the seller.",

It has some important auto-overrides, such as exposure +/- compensation, color/contrast adjustments, flash control, etc., that are usually missing on a point-and-shoot auto camera like these. Great feature is the AA battery rather than proprietary rechargable. On remote shoots where recharging is not possible, it is a great feature no longer available on most cameras. Controls are not as user-friendly as on my Canon 5D, but with use they are easier to master. A great little camera for vacations and situations where you need a large file size in a compact camera.

Would be better if it had more zoom, but I've been spoiled. I love that it takes AA batteries though-hate it when I miss out on opportunities because my batteries died and I can't find/afford the specialized batteries (or have to wait til they charge up again).",

    "title": "Canon PowerShot A1100IS 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.5-inch LCD (Silver) (OLD MODEL)",
    "description": "Color:SilverFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nThere\u2019s nothing more satisfying than taking great pictures! And with the Canon PowerShot A1100 IS it\u2019s so effortless. The 12.1-megapixel resolution and 4x optical zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer ensure radiant, detailed images. Plus, you\u2019ve got an advanced DIGIC 4 Image Processor with evolved Face Detection Technology and the Face Detection Self-Timer for extraordinary control and performance. Smart AUTO lets you handle challenging conditions with ease. \n\nPowerShot A1100 IS Highlights \n\n\n\n12.1-megapixel resolution, 4x optical zoom and Optical Image Stabilizer\nWith the PowerShot A1100 IS, dramatic, personal pictures have never been easier to shoot and share. This 12.1-megapixel digital camera lets you create impressive large photos of family and friends you\u2019ll be proud to display. The high-resolution images taken by the PowerShot A1100 IS can be enlarged up to 13 x 19 inches. \n\nThe PowerShot A1100 IS has a 4x optical zoom lens that makes it easy to get the inspiring, emotive close-ups that will make your images lasting keepsakes. This magnificent lens gives you the power to shoot distant subjects with razor-sharp precision and stunning lifelike color. So you can brilliantly capture a closer shot of a landscape, or a child\u2019s big smile. \n\nThe PowerShot A1100 IS is equipped with Canon\u2019s acclaimed Optical Image Stabilizer Technology that automatically detects and corrects camera shake--one of the leading causes of fuzzy or blurred shots. Even when zoomed in, you can get the steady, crisp, brilliant images you\u2019ll be proud to shoot and share. And Canon\u2019s Optical Image Stabilizer Technology is so convenient to use. It functions perfectly with or without a flash. \n\nA World of Advantages with Canon\u2019s Technology \n\nThe DIGIC 4 Image Processor has evolved Face Detection Technology that tracks the faces of moving subjects and lets the shooter enter the frame seamlessly with the Face Detection Self-Timer. \n\nDIGIC 4 Image Processor\nCanon\u2019s most advanced image processor, DIGIC 4, delivers evolved Face Detection Technology that keeps every face in every photo looking its very best. The technology finds and tracks the faces of moving subjects until you\u2019re ready to shoot, then delivers perfect focus. In addition, exposure, flash and white balance are compensated, so that faces exhibit natural skin tones and backgrounds are properly exposed. \n\niSAPS Technology is an entirely original scene-recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos, iSAPS works with the advanced DIGIC 4 Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy, as well as exposure and white balance. \n\nA Face Detection Self-Timer automatically detects an increase in the number of faces and makes the appropriate adjustments. For instance, to include the photographer\u2019s face in a group shot, there\u2019s no need to rush in. Just put the camera on a stand or tripod, specify Face Detection Self-Timer, and the camera will wait for the photographer\u2019s face to get on-camera before it takes the shot. Motion Detection tracks moving subjects in a much larger range--allowing you to wait for the perfect shot without refocusing. \n\nIntelligent Contrast Correction\nDIGIC 4 also makes possible the i-Contrast (Intelligent Contrast Correction) system, which controls the compensation level in pixel units to brighten dark areas while leaving bright areas unchanged for better images where the main subject is dark, and more natural transition. The PowerShot A1100 IS can even use i-Contrast in playback mode to adjust images that were shot without the setting activated. \n\nRed-eye Correction provides three options for removing red-eye from subjects in flash pictures. 1) Red-eye Correction during shooting actually identifies and corrects red-eye in human subjects as pictures are taken. 2) The PowerShot A1100 IS can be set to automatically detect and correct red-eye during image playback. 3) You can manually locate any red eyes in a scene during image playback on the LCD screen, and command the camera to remove them. \n\nLife doesn\u2019t give you second chances to capture special times. That\u2019s why the PowerShot A1100 IS features an ISO 1600 setting that reduces the effects of camera shake and sharpens subjects in low-light situations, giving you greater shooting flexibility. ISO can be expanded to 3200 when you select ISO 3200 Special Scene mode. \n\nSmart AUTO intelligently selects the proper settings\nJust set the Canon PowerShot A1100 IS to Smart AUTO and you\u2019re ready for maximum enjoyment from your picture taking every time. It\u2019s a relaxing and satisfying way to shoot because you can completely concentrate on your subject knowing that the camera has the technical details covered. Advanced Canon technology intelligently analyzes your situation and shooting conditions. Then it automatically selects an appropriate setting from 18 specially defined settings. So whether you\u2019re photographing flowers, a captivating sunset, or your friends at the park, you can be confident that you\u2019re getting dramatic, memorable images. \n\nShooting Modes\nAdvanced presets for the best possible photos under certain conditions. With 18 Shooting Modes including 9 Special Scene Modes, you\u2019re ready for whatever shot comes your way \n\nLarge, high-quality 2.5-inch LCD\nThe PowerShot A1100 IS\u2019s 2.5-inch LCD screen gives you the big picture, whether you\u2019re shooting, reviewing or showing off your images. This high-resolution screen offers a crisp, clear and bright picture. It also features Night Display for easy viewing in low light. \n\nUses 2 AA-size batteries\nConveniently, you don\u2019t need to worry about running out or recharging of batteries. Since AA-size batteries can be purchased at any store, simply get new ones locally. \n\nThe Complete Print Solution \n\nPrint/Share Button for easy direct printing and downloading, plus ID Photo Print and Movie Print with select PIXMA Inkjet Photo Printers and SELPHY Compact Photo Printers. \n\nThe PowerShot A1100 IS\u2019s Print/Share button makes direct printing easier than ever. Simply connect the PowerShot A1100 IS to a Canon PIXMA Inkjet Photo Printer or SELPHY Compact Photo Printer or any PictBridge compatible photo printer, press the lighted Print/Share button and print! Also use the Print/Share button to transfer images to a computer (Windows and Macintosh). \n\nPrint your own ID photos in up to 28 different sizes or use the Movie Print function to output multiple stills from a recorded movie on a single sheet with a Canon SELPHY Compact Photo Printer. \n\nWhat's in the Box\n\n * PowerShot A1100 IS body \n * AA-size alkaline battery (x2) \n * 128 MB SD memory card (SDC-128MB) \n * Wrist strap (WS-800) \n * Digital Camera Solution CD-ROM \n * USB interface cable (IFC-400PCU) \n * AV cable (AVC-DC400)",
