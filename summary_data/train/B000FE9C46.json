The bun on the right side of the unit won't hold air for even five minutes and only got to use it for a couple of hours. I don't make it to the lake that often so the 30-day return window closed on me before I ever got to use it. At this point I'll try going back to the manufacturer for a replacement, but overall this was not a good experience for me and I doubt I'll be buying anymore lake toys from Amazon. A 90-day return policy for something like this would be far more reasonable.",

This tube pulls behind our fish and ski like a dream. It never dips down in front at take off and skims over wakes like it is hovering. Much better than a lay flat tube for our family. My daughter and her friend laughed and laughed while riding, falling and getting back on. A great, safe tube for any family with a boat to enjoy.",
