The rolling pin is .5 inch shorter than the width of the frame, so you'll never have a perfect outcome..it leaves a line imprint. Very dumb. Another reason is the photo gives the idea that when you go the impression, you can flip the frame around to show a raised imprint. (If that makes sense) but it doesn't. And finally it doesn't come with a glass to cover the 2 molds! It's just open.",

Not terribly hard but extra steps I wasn't expecting. As a perfectionist it drove me crazy that I couldn't get the surface perfectly smooth and crackless. I finally gave up after re-kneading the clay 4 times. The clay is a little harder than I expected too even after adding a few drops of water so I had to work on the imprints to make them look more defined. It settled and hardened in about 48 hours. I was satisfied with the final product but wouldn't buy again.",

Also would prefer the orientation of the picture to be turned 90 degrees - nowadays, you don't take many digital pictures with your camera sideways.",

      "text": "I did this for my 4 year old daughter. I was lucky to still be able to take impression of her foot since it did say ages 0-3. she wears size 9 in shoes. And since she is a girly girl i bought the white frame so i can paint it pink. and on her impression material i added a few drops of red food coloring to make it a pink clay and few drops of water to make it manageable. she loved how it was pink. After the impressions it had already showed some cracking so i just kept my fingers wet while gently smoothing out the cracks. I'm doing the boys tomorrow and ill use blue food coloring",

I had to immediately throw it out and then air out my kitchen. The fit and finish of the product was fine, but getting a bad unit, just three days before Mother's Day, ruins my gift idea. Back to the drawing board, I guess. UPDATE: the seller's customer service was very responsive and they have shipped me a replacement. If it makes it here before Mother's Day, I'll be all set.",

    "description": "This kit includes soft, pliable air-drying clay. The non-toxic clay is safe and easy to use to capture those precious little hands and feet. After you make the impressions, the clay dries into a stone-like material in a couple of days. Features: No mixing of materials and no baking. Just knead, flatten and create the impression! Kit includes: Two bags of air-drying clay, Black smooth finish wood photo wall mount frame that holds one 5\" x 7\" picture, Writing tool, Wooden rolling pin & Easy-to-follow instructions. Frame dimensions are 16 \" long x 8 \" high; acrylic cover over center photo opening only. The clay display areas are 4.6 x 6.5 inches. [[Clay Tips: To ensure a smooth dried finish, be sure the clay is rolled out evenly (not thinner on the edges, etc) and is as smooth on the surface as possible before making the print. Then, cover the clay with a slightly damp light-weight cloth for 24 hours, or until the clay surface becomes leathery hard. Also, the clay is held into the frame by being pressed into the edges of the wooden openings.]]",
