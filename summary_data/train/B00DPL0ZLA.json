Can grip up further on the handle or back at end for larger hands. Very sturdy and not too heavy. Love this mallet. Will be used primarily to seal tops on food buckets so I do not crack them.",

Handle's thicker than comfortable and, as a concerning sign of the manufacturer's lack of care, there's a length of rough bare wood under the head of the mallet. The hit lands nicely, doesn't bounce, but I'm going to be looking for another, better mallet.",

Also, I\u2019m not a bruiser or UFC fighter and probably don\u2019t have the swinging power to break a solid tool like this. It happened within a month or purchase after using on five or six signs. Maybe I just got the bad egg of the bunch...",
