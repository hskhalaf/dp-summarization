As other users reported mine also started vibrating by itself. I discovered that if the phone is pressed with two fingers (index on screen and thumb near the bottom left corner of the camera plate) the vibration motor would start vibrating. It seems there's a faulty short there. When the phone is in the pocket, a slight bend (e.g. when you flex your leg) causes the phone to start vibrating. I'm returning it unfortunately.",

The leather finish on the back felt great and the phone looked good, but the bezels for a 2017 phone flagship leave a lot to be desired. The phone ended up getting purple burn in the top after a week or two so i sent it back. As a Asus fanboy I will look to their flagship next year hopefully we will see a winner but i would pass on this one, it just doesn't hit the mark. 8GB in a smartphone felt awesome though.",

My girlfriend and me bought the same phone, her phone fell once (even with the screen protector on) and the display went off. My 1st pf the two I bought got hit by a falling EMPTY can, on one side, the display died, and yes, it had the screen protector on too. Features: AWESOME! Mat. Quality: Not too good.

Its amazing some of the things you can do with Tango - would strongly recommend the phone. I did replace the ZenUI launcher with the stock Android launcher though - don't know why there is a need for a custom skin over stock android - just gets in the way.",
