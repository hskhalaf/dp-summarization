This was the most expensive of the three I ordered and quit working within the first 30 minutes. Komelon and Rolatape worked much better and were easier to use and pack. IMPORTANT: Once you insert the main bottom handle of the Keson RR3M you CANNOT remove it. IT IS PERMANENT! I'm sending this back for a refund.",

After receiving the new wheel I only used it a couple of times before storing for off season. Got it out recently and have problems with it on my jobs, seven times out of ten the counter will not count after a reset. Not certain if wheel even measures accurately with these counter issues. The quality of this measuring wheel is sub standard compared to other measuring wheels I have owned and used.",

I also like how you can make it compact by shrinking down the handle.",

What nobody tells you is that the stand is spring load and easily folds up when measuring. With the stand up, there is absolutely no problem measuring. When you need to stop, simply use your foot or hand and pop the stand back down. Its not made to use while the stand is down....that's why its spring loaded to easily move up and down. You have to wonder about some people. This is a great tool for a great price. I definitely recommend it.",

The whell is excellent for all but the thick brush use. The stand is most handy allowing me to stop and note my map or survey, was even able to use it on a hilly lot the other day and the stand still worked well. Also of note is the handle which is collapsable for storage and height adjustable (I'm 5'10 maybe 6ft in boots and it was comfortable). All and all an excellent whell and a steal thru Amazon at around $50.",
