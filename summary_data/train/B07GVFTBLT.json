      "text": "Perfect alarm clock to wake up naturally. When not using as an alarm clock you can use it as a regular lamp. You can adjust the colors and brightness it can get surprisingly bright. Can display a variety of colors but not sure what you would use it for. I just use the whites - sunset colors. Does have a usb port to charge your phone. The alarm sounds are not blaring they start of soft and get increasingly louder. Very pleasant 100% recommend.",

      "text": "I liked the idea of waking up with an artificial sunrise, however, that's not what actually happens. The light comes on at about 40% and jumps to 75%within 5 mins and then 100% (if you can call it that as it isn't very bright) within the next 5 mins. There is only one musical sound and the clock runs fast. So instead of peacefully waking up, I'm jolted by the light a half hour before I wanted to be and have used it less and less since I bought it. Shame because it is a really good idea, exactly what I had been looking for. I guess nothing replaces the real thing.",

I have to set the times if it's off when my roommate is not in the room because otherwise, it would just go \"beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep.\" like thirty times. But it's nice. I'm not sure if I'm waking up better but I like the light. To wake up better, you just gotta sleep earlier.",

Very pleasantly surprised! Instructions are pretty straightforward. Color-changing \"mood\" light is pretty cool. I also like the wake-up light and bedtime (fading off) light. The temperature and humidity features seem to work accurately and the sound on the radio is decent. The buttons all work as they should and overall am very happy with the product and would highly recommend! Great unit for the price!",
