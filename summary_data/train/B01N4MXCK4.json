No, I do not recommend.",

I would say that this version is good for people that aren't as avid players. The lack of box for the cards is frustrating too...especially if you are used to having it.",

Honestly, its hard to find games for teens to stay engaged - this classic edition is still a keeper after all these years - esp since updated and relevant to this generation.",

I grew very frustrated with the science category. \"How many colors were in the original apple logo?\" was one science questions that will go down in history with the family. It definitely belongs in the game just not in that category. Didn't return, kind of wishing I had. It will be a while before I wind up attempting it again.",

Sport and leisure has very little from American football, baseball, basketball or hockey. I have several versions of trivial pursuit and this edition is the only one where i keep shaking my head wondering why questions aren't in a different category.

Some questions are multiple choice, which the original didn't have. My oldest says that makes those questions too easy, but still nearly all questions are not multiple choice. Another difference is the amount of question cards. The original set has 1000 or so. This set has a few hundred, so it's easier to remember the repeats.",
