      "text": "I LOVED this pajama set, its adorable, comfortable and it fit perfectly true to size. I wore this set one time, hand washed per instructions and the next time I went to wear it, the elastic band in the waist got folded down awkwardly and the pants leg had seams that are already coming undone. I don't know how to sew but imagine for someone who does it isn't a hard fix. Now I have pants sitting in the drawer that need to be repaired after one wash, which, let's face it, I will probably never do. Not worth the money. Very disappointed with this product.",

I have 5pr of M, I am 5'3'' 118lbs and was 132lbs an the M also fit nicely. Comfy cotton, washes well on cold an dry no more than 20 min on Low if only items. Keep eye on, can shrink if you don't. They have summer sweats and heavier without t-shirts. I like the knit cotton summery material in winter as well, that come with the t-shirts. Read description below item, you will know if cotton knit or thicker cotton. Both so nice!! T-shirt cotton.",

They're almost perfect. Ladies, you may want to go up one size because I'm 5'6\", about 100 lbs. (at the most) and I have almost no hips...just very long & skinny legs.
