The padding is just covering the back of a person's arm, but they can be rotated if needed. There are 3 openings for fingers. 2 sets for the main 4 fingers and a large hole for the thumb. Also, I didn't realize that this was a pair of forearm guards in one package. I accidentally ordered 2 packages because I didn't believe a high quality product like this, would come in at such a great price for a pair of guards. I was happily mistaken.",

I want to pair with a hand can go all the way through and I don\u2019t have to worry about threads digging into fingers or awkward thumb holes that are hard to fit on smaller Hands. Which is why I ordered this pair. And yet they sent me the same pair that has threads that go between the fingers, and are not very sturdy I might add, and has a large very low said thumb hole that I cannot get to fit on my hand comfortably. Do not buy from this listing if you want was actually pictured.",

Due to my multiple myeloma, my skin is like tissue paper. These are perfect and will protect my skin from bruising and scrapes. So thankful to find something that provides protection and will keep me from going to the doctor so often....and I can continue doing the outside work that gives me such satisfaction. They are also not real tight to cause pressure on any existing bandaged area. Kudos for such a great product!!!",
