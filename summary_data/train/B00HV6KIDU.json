I specifically chose this camera as I needed it to capture pictures of kids quickly. It is very easy to use and perfect for someone who wants to take nice pictures but does not want to get caught up with technical stuff. There are lots of modes to use and can connect it online to send pics through wifi. Very good for moms of little ones who want something quick. I am very happy with this purchase.",

It works fine at concerts/clubs but for video at home at night, not so much. Other than that, it is a really great camera. Takes really nice pictures and is very easy to use. I love that I can put apps on it to edit my pictures and videos and then upload them to Facebook and Instagram right from the camera itself without having to connect it to my computer. If it could take and make calls, I'd leave my phone at home! ;)",

REALLY wanted to love this one, but as it comes with an international version of the OS that will not reach the Play Store and you cannot get the OS to work in English instead of Chinese, It is simply NOT worth the hassle! You lose all the nice features of the earlier camera. Oh - and Amazon Tech Support is totally useless on this! They walk you through troubleshooting steps you have already taken three times before you called and when they do not work, they make you try three more times before they give up and say it is a defective product!",

Now there is one problem. If you try to use it to capture moments from sport events, such as wrestling and football, the moving images will be blurred. Unfortunately, this is our purpose. Having said that, we used it only once and didn't spend much time to figure out if there is an option for speed adjustment. We couldn't find it. Google search said something about an app to solve this. If I find a solution to this, I'm happy to modify my review and add one more star.",

Took more than 1000 pictures with it on vacation last month and they're spectacular! Camera is a great size to carry around and takes pictures on par with a much bigger bulkier camera.",

      "text": "The main problem with cameras like this that only have the LCD Screen to rely on for shooting photos and in bright sunlight, hard to tell if you are getting the photo you want. They do have this multi-shoot to then pick the best, but the same problem, you cannot see the sample photos well enough in outdoor shooting to even pick the best one. I did find an anti-glare screen protector, but have not put it on the camera yet. Hopefully it will aid in the viewing",

I'm very pleased with the automatic mode and the few scenes available without an app. With a photo app, the choices are endless. This has become my favorite camera. I carry it in my purse at all times. I rarely even pull out my Nikon with the higher zoom because it's so big compared to this one. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a very good everyday camera.",
