It's way too thick and too gloopy for a fresh Butter London nail polish. Butter London polishes are famous for being thin and easy to layer. Layering the second coat on top of the first one isn't an easy task for the polish I've got. Very disappointed I can't send it back. Had to order a new one directly from the brand.
