When we got home there was three weeks worth of debris in the bottom of the pool, Inclung acorns. It picked up everything, incuding the acorns. It doesn't climb the pool steps very well. but a quick brush of with my broom gets it done. I give it 4 stars because the instuctions are not very well written. I would definitly buy another one in the future.",

It worked for only about 6 weeks. Online store wouldn't help us since longer than 30 days from purchase date. Hayward warranty is good, but inconvenient for a product that is almost new and hardly used. Would buy one again, but only from a local store that would stand behind their products that should last years instead of weeks.",
