It cooks everything evenly and is easy to clean. If anything sticks I put a layer of white vinegar and a couple pumps of dish soap and let it soak 5-10 min and everything comes cleanly out of the pan with no effort.",

I don't know how to clean the middle part either so now I bought their official cleaning product to see if that would help to clean it.

All I have had to do is let them soak with water for a little bit. No problems.",

The pan's flat base allows for more than braising, including techniques like poaching, searing, roasting, stir-frying and browning. The signature collection braiser also features a low profile that makes it a convenient serving solution for crowded tables and buffet-style settings. From rich risottos and spicy curry to Jasmine rice for stir-fry, every Le creuset braiser is well-suited for preparing a wide range of main courses and side dishes that require careful moisture control.",
