As a result the product because almost unusable because you can not use the zippers and the grommets once rusted. The windows can't be opened and the canvas grommets tear once the metal eye and reused. Could plastic zippers and grommets cost that much more? It does what its supposed to do in terms of easy setup, sun protection and the like but with the metal weaknesses mentioned above the product almost because a disposable product. What a waist and what a shame.",

It eliminates your peripheral view of other beachgoers and it is very effective at blocking the sun. Used a basic plastic sand anchor and a couple metal stakes for stability and it stayed in the sand with no issues. I can do it pretty well by myself ( two people makes it very quick and easy) We have used this umbrella in the backyard with a quilt underneath for an easy sun shelter for babies. It really is easy enough to use that you can break it out every weekend.",

The stakes aren't always necessary but work well and have a small bag to keep everything together. Sturdy, well made, and great color! When sitting on its side like in the picture, you can fit a chair under it and sit comfortably. It's saved us from soggy soccer bags, and bad sunburn more times than I can count. I love this thing!",

I was very impressed for the price point but it's good for picnics, outdoor activities, beach time, and indoor forts on rainy days! So much easier than a shelter you have to put up and better for windy days. It's very big too, we fit our whole little family under it no problem.",

The only thing it doesn't have that I wish it did is some sort of built in/roll out floor.
