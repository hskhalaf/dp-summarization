Can\u2019t complain about the power, the dust trap, or all of the accessories that come with it. For cleaning out cars and picking up cat hair, it does a good job. Having real vacuum attachments,especially the pet hair power brush, is also a plus. Only thing that I dislike and wanted to bring up is the fit/finish off it. The dust trap is held together only by friction- no latches. As a consequence, Everything is hard to pull apart and put back in. It works, but worry about the long term durability.",
