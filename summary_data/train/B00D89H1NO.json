Hard to figure why Bose would release the Mini 2 and not at the very least maintain the amazing sound quality of the Mini 1. The difference is so disappointingly noticeable.",

I just hope that it's a problem that can be rectified by the seller. I just need help contacting the correct party. How do you do this since there wasn't a receipt.
