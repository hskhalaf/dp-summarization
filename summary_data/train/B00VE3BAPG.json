I have rheumatoid arthritis in my hands and one of reasons I chose this particular masher was the handle. It has proven to be every bit as easy to hold on to as I had hoped. Just the right diameter and cushioned to improve grip and comfort.",

After daily use, my interior is as shiny as when I first bought it.  One thing though, I use bottled water.  I find that I don't get like scale on my pots, this kettle, my clothes iron or my drip coffeemaker.  I'm thinking that the reported white flecks in poured water could be that scale flaking off the inside surface. Distilled white vinegar can help eliminate limescale buildup.  As for residue on the outside, I remove my kettle from the stove before frying/sauteeing to avoid free radicals from settling on my kettle. Just a thought. ",
