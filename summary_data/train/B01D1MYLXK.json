I wasn't able to find it. I was very upset. 9 days later (yes I said 9 DAYS LATER) someone so graciously found my phone in the North fork river of the Ozarks. She took it out of the case and charged it. It was completely dry! And it turned on and worked like new. I am definitely recommending this for anyone's phone. Thank God all my pics and videos were saved.",

Kept our stuff dry and we didn't need to leave anything on the beach. The trick to keeping water out is rolling it correctly and then twist the ends once more to tighten the seal before clipping together. The picture is not great but we were in the water so that was the best one we could take. The pink color really stands out as well.",

Once rolled 3 times and secured, you're left with about 18\"-19\" of storage space. This bag is a little narrower than I was expecting but works for my needs and I actually prefer it. I included a photo with a standard wine bottle for size comparison. Hope this helps.",

Say, if your camera is at the bottom, you have to pretty much unload all the stuff above it to reach to the camera. Furthermore, it is dark deep inside and you need a flashlight to see where things are in the bag. When you close the lid per instruction by folding the top part of the bag a couple of times, the capacity of the bag reduces proportionally.",

It was easy and quick to attach to my luggage rack and go down the road and yes coming back I was riding in rain, first night I kept lots of items in the bag strapped to bike and it set out in a very heavy downpour everything inside remained completely dry. I will be ordering more it's a great product.",

I was curious about the \"plastic\" latches if they would last wearing it like a backpack for that rough of event. Even dragging it through the barbwire crawl. The seams all held so we'll see how long they last. Brandon",
