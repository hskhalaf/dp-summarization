The two-ounce canister has printed on it: \"Made in China\" / \"Manufactured for Worldwise Inc., Dept SK...Novato, CA\". So product seems to come from China, while the company itself is in CA. That's how I read it. My previous SmartyKat container (a smaller package) had these words: \"grown and packed in USA\". Those words are noticeably missing from the 2 oz product. Scary. And yes, it's filled with sticks and twigs.",

None of the fun and games he had with other catnip products. For us, unfortunately, ordering this was a waste of money. Cant even donate it to a cat rescue, as the package is now opened. Who knows - maybe your cat will have a different reaction. Good luck!",
