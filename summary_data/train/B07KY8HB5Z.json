      "text": "I've really started liking these magnetic car mounts. They provide you with several magnets both circular and rectangular shapes to put on the back of our phone. I have a silicon case on my phone so I just slip it in without needing to stick it on with the adhesive and it still works well. This is a nice high quality mount. It telescopes and tilts easily. The suction cup holds tight! Time will tell how it holds up in hot weather but I have high expectations for this car mount!",

The car phone mount is very sturdy and allows for positioning in a multitude of angles. After some adjustment, it's exactly where I want it, and there's no fall down or issues with the stand shifting position. I use it in my truck and the suction cup is very sticky and has been moved twice in my truck over the last few months without issue.Overall it\u2019s perfect for my use case and I recommend it!",

My only concern is that the product itself is not made all quality material. The design is great but I think the manufacturer should upgrade the quality of the materials. Without that I don\u2019t think it will last and therefore not a good value.",
