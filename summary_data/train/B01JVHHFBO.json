So far the only suggestion is that they need to offer more finishes in the hardware.we are doing black and white and are planning on pairing them. This tub is by far more attractive than many I have looked at (which is many) and for such a good price! Pure white clean finish. The shape is exactly what I wanted! Stay tuned!",

Once open, it is impossible to close without holding it down. So I end up taking a bath with my foot or hand keeping the drain closed. There is no rim to the tub, so I have ordered the bamboo caddy, but the drain issue has ruined this tub for me.",

I sort of miss having the spot to hook my neck and float without any effort in my ancient, old claw foot. I have popped the drain in the middle accidentally a few times. Getting in and out requires a bit more care because the top is not uniform in height, but I love the esthetics. Question: Where do you find a hair-catching drain cover to go over the monstrously large pop-up drain? It is almost four inches wide, not standard. With waist-length hair, this is a serious question.
