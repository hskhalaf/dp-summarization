      "text": "I recently needed to replace my old D80. I'd had it for the better part of a decade and after thousands of pictures, it was showing its age. The D3200 is slightly smaller and has more than twice the megapixels. The images are sharp and crisp outside. Inside, spend a little and buy a speed light to ensure crisp, sharp photos. There's even a guide setting on the camera that allows the user to use presets for different conditions. This is a great entry level camera for someone getting started and for someone like me, who uses it constantly (and plays with all the bells, whistles, and filters) it's still a fabulous buy. It's a fantastic camera.",

Also the first night I got it I got the dreaded shutter error, and it just kept shutting down on me. After scouring the internet, I realized the mirror was stuck up. After I fixed that with a q-tip it has worked great ever since. I bought my own lens for this, so I can't comment on the kit lens. In all, this is a great camera so far. Excellent entry level dslr.",
