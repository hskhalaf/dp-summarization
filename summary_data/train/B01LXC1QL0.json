This makes it more difficult to drag the mouse and the sticker peels off more and more when you do. You can't remove the stick entirely because then the bottom of it will be sticky and not smooth.

While still a comfortable mouse, it's not the most comfortable to use, but is fine for hours. The LED's are nice, and I like the additional texture added to the scroll wheel. Additional buttons all work well. The only issues I've had with any Death Adder is that the scroll wheel click will sometimes give out entirely, and the left click will also become worn, and not register holding down. But with intense use, this is probably expected, and doesn't occur usually within the first year.",

The deathadder, while the grip and ergonomics are superb, is no exception to their reputation of using poor materials and poorer quality control.

Though, after swapping/troubleshooting, it was certain that the side buttons were unresponsive after a year of use...which is the typical lifespan of Razer's product line.
