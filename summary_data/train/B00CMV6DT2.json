Their grease gun tubes however, it's some real harbor freight stuff. I had new tube charging or priming issues, I had minimal feed. The pressure was great but the volume reduced this effect on its work. My tube blew up lol. Plunger , clip and washer all flew out. Spring went out and it was a garage sale of tube parts. I had a hand pump Lincoln tube. And that alone solved my problems. Instant prime, more volume and tubes are more completely empty. I'd still buy another since any $19 Lincoln grease tube will fit.",

It went through a rock crusher a pile of stone and ended up stuck to the magnet of another crusher. After it was retrieved I took it apart cleaned the stone dust out of the motor and it still works. As far as the guns not taking a prime I just figured out how to fix that by pushing the plunger while holding the trigger I hope this helps everyone else make their reviews five star reviews .",

It still beats the Lincoln hands down. I think we went through five of those. We don't use the guns every day. We do septic installations and grease the machines as needed.
