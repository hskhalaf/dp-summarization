The foot bed was very comfortable, and I wish I could keep them but there's no hope of them ever being comfortable for someone with wide feet.",

I want to buy these in every color. I especially like the perforations on the top. Ventilation is good. Only one con for me is That it runs big. I\u2019ll buy a half-size or one size smaller next time. But it\u2019s not a deal breaker for me. I wear them all the time.",
