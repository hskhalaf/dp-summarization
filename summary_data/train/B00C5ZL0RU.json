The click was very audible and easy to feel. The wrench itself is made out of sturdy metal and is easy to operate. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS AND VERIFY UNITS! The instructions provide guidance about using newton meters as well as gives great directions on use and how to dial in the correct setting. To maintain accuracy the wrench must be stored AT 10 FT-LB.",

I can hear/feel it snagging at times. 2- It doesn't have enough range of motion. It doesn't do small movements. So in tight spaces, it is sub-optimal. It could use a higher tooth count. As an occasional home-wrencher I'm happy with it. If I were going to be using it a lot, I would get a different wrench.",

What a shock. I was re-installing the mounting bracket on a disc brake on my mountain bike. Luckily it was the bolt on the mount and not the bolt on the frame that sheared off, so all I needed to do was replace the mount rather than have to drill out the bolt on the frame. I returned this for a CDI torque wrench. Pricey, but I am hoping it is worth the upgrade.",

This is a very long torque wrench. I have used many torque wrenches, this one is the longest by far. That's great if you want/need more leverage. It is bad if space is a problem. It does ratchet in both directions. It only torque's in one direction. (It will not work on left hand threaded fasteners.)",

    "description": "Style:1/2 Inch Drive (10-150 ft.-lb.)\n\nCalibrated to an accuracy of +/ 4%, the TEKTON 1/2 in. Drive Click Torque Wrench lets you work with confidence, eliminating guessing and the common tendency to overtighten fasteners. Correctly tightening fasteners to a vehicle or equipment manufacturer's torque specifications ensures parts are properly secured without being damaged. Simple and easy to use, this wrench has a reversible ratcheting head that drives fasteners in both directions and measures torque in the clockwise direction. To measure torque, set the desired value on the handle scale (foot pounds or Newton meters) and begin tightening the fastener. When the preset torque value is reached, a reliable mechanical operation inside the handle produces a click you can hear and feel, alerting you to stop applying force. Built for consistent performance and years of dependable service, the mechanical design doesn't need batteries, and the allsteel construction has no plastic parts to break or wear out.\n\nIMPORTANT: This wrench is shipped precalibrated and ready to use. To help maintain calibration, store at its lowest setting of 10 ft.lb./13.6 Nm when not in use. Be sure to read and understand the operator's manual, including all safety information, before first use.\n\nSpecifications:\n\n * Range - ft.-lb.: 10-150 ft.-lb.\n * Range - Nm: 13.6-203.5 Nm\n * Increment: 1 ft.-lb. (1.36 Nm)\n * Accuracy: \u00b1 4 percent\n * Length: 18-3/8 inch\n * Ratchet: 24 tooth\n * Country of Origin: Taiwan\n\n\n\nIncludes:\n\n * (1) 1/2 in. drive torque wrench\n * (1) Storage case\n * (1) Operator's manual with torque conversion chart",
