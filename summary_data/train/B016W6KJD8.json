The snare and sticks are perfect but for some reason the stand was way too short, maybe appropriate for a 4-8 year old kid, only 28 inches? my husband had to modify it and then we ordered just a stand that much taller and could telescope for perfect height. The snar is just perfect for school and home practice but know that the stand is one height and is very short.",

Music teacher suggested getting different sticks as these were \"too light\". Makes a great sound without being overwhelming. Very please as it would have cost me $30 a month to rent one. Much more economical to just purchase one.",
