Very disappointed in Ariat for that. They\u2019re also much darker in color than the picture leads you to believe. Over all I\u2019m pretty disappointed and I am sending them back and buying a similar pair from Twisted X. I recommend you do the same.",

They did seem a bit cheap, like they wont last long, I normally love Ariat and my son has all the same size 11 in Ariat boots, these are just not accurate. I do know that the Twisted brand was more sturdy, quality material, cost more but in my opinion will last longer.",

If someone doesn\u2019t state their weight/ height discard their shoe review. Large people wear shoes out differently. If they do not state what the shoe is used for also, discard their review. Construction and farming wear shoes out differently. If there is a problem with shipping, etc., that has nothing to do with the product, review the product not your current emotion. I recommend this shoe. I Have received several unsolicited compliments on the shoes. Order a half size smaller as others state. I\u2019m buying a second pair for work, true 5 stars granted- ON THE SHOE.",
