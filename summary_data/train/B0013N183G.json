I have a Pug who is around 25-30 pounds, so I purchased the LARGE for her, and her head barely fits through the neck hole. There is still a little breathing room, so I will keep it, I just wanted to reiterate what others were cautioning about. I think it would be useful if people put their dog types/sizes in the reviews so people could cross-reference with their dogs.",

If you're ordering for your cat, you probably want at least a size Small for a small to medium sized cat. I'm VERY satisfied with my customer service experience, though. I started a return for it, and Amazon/Puppia Int'l Inc. is refunding me AND letting me keep the harness. I'll probably donate it to an animal shelter, or to a friend with a cat. They went above and beyond and I really appreciate it.",

This harness is perfect to make sure his bandages stay in place. My only complaint is that the strap that goes around the belly is very loose through the strap the the leash attaches to. Because of this, when I take him for a walk in the harness, he often pulls it pretty far to one side, which is pretty annoying. Other than that, it's soft, and he seems to enjoy wearing it!",

So, be careful with the sizing. Other than that, I think that this is a very nice harness. It's got a fairly easy on/off, and it seems to be pretty comfortable, especially for running around. He wears this harness to the dog park and runs with the other dogs. He's been wearing his harness almost daily now for about 2 months, and it is holding up nicely.",

We've had dogs of every size, and each has worn them. We've experienced a size issue a couple times with our largest dogs, and our fault entirely that we didn't try them and return in time. Be sure to check for good fit as soon as you receive. Otherwise, best option we've found. Our German Shepherd loves to swim, and harness holds up really well.",

Now he automatically stops at the road crossing to the park instead of pulling and choking when i used a collar.",

Every now and then, I throw them in a pillow case and wash them in the machine at low temp, and they come out like new. The cheaper nylon harnesses are just not as well made, and it's often easier for the dog to slip out, or when too tight they can leave rashes.
