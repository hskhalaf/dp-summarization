Only reason for 4 stars is the sticks are still not completely smooth and the bumpers are a little clicky but still work like they should. The overall plastic body of the controller does not feel cheap but the bumpers feel a little thin. It has good weight to it.",

The direction pad often inputs diagonal inputs rather than straight ones because it is too touchy. It also sometimes inputs random button presses when only using the D-pad, mainly the Y button for me. The turbo button often turns on without warning or reason as well and will spam button presses until you hold \"BACK\" and press the turbo button. Weirdly enough, when I actually try to turn on turbo myself it does not activate. Overall it's too unreliable for competitive use and I am very disappointed. -C. Denver (not account owner)",

If you move the right stick right, as you move the left stick around, the RIGHT stick will start randomly moving left and up or down on it's own, even if the stick itself is remaining stationary. 1B.) Sometimes the right stick will just randomly move in a direction all on it's own, regardless of deadzone settings, so it's not a simple sticky stick issue. It's sensor malfunction. 2.) DPad will randomly input A or B presses on it's own. Even the occasional X or Y. Overall just a fault, awful product sadly.",

Spend a couple extra bucks and get something else. I folded and bought another Xbox One controller and that works great.",

However, I think it's missing some precision in the sticks that an Xbox One controller would have. I play a simulation game, and precise steering a vehicle is really difficult. My Xbox One controller was better, but it had issues with the buttons after less than a month of use. Overall this controller is a good buy at under $20.",

The only issue I have is that when I use my R trigger slowly, it only releases to around 10% pressed instead of 0. If this happens to you, it is easily fixable in the settings of any recent game, or the deadzone settings of whichever emulator you use.",

For most PC games it works excellently, I haven't had any major issues with it thus far and it is holding up nicely to say. My main complaint is that the blue LED light in the center of the controller is fairly bright in dark settings (specifically in your room in darkness). But is can be adapted to.",

      "text": "The ergonomics are fine, but for being barely used (maybe three or four times a month) it broke surprisingly quickly. I bought it in September and it broke before the new year. It wasn't dropped or abused, it's just a very low-quality product. The defect on mine is that it doesn't register pressing up on the joystick at a specific point. I might try to pull it apart and fix it eventually, but a product that can't survive light use isn't really worth the time investment of repairing it before something else inevitably breaks. It's not worth dropping twenty bucks on, maybe ten.",

It's a comfortable controller to hold, I had no issues with it for a year, but just recently the left joystick has been uncontrollably drifting/turning the camera in games I play. I haven't had this issue with a controller before and it was pretty upsetting to find this controller became unusable within a year of purchase. It doesn't seem to me that this kind of hardware should have such a short lifespan, and you shouldn't need to buy a two-year protection plan, even for $2 or however little for this kind of hardware that really shouldn't be failing that quickly.",

But it's made it.... not even quite a year, and suddenly it's not functioning. :/ I'm going to fuddle with it a bit longer, but...
