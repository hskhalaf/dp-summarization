However, after I received it, it has flimsy power adapter, the number of white noises is super limited, and my baby disliked it. To my surprise, the item is NOT eligible for return\u2014I don't know why. There's really no reason for me to keep an expensive white noise maker that doesn't work. I'm super disappointed and wish I was notified of the return policy before I checked out!",

It quite relaxing and it rounds out some external noises. All you hear is the fan and since it\u2019s a constant noise your not anticipating the next drop of water or wave etc.",

Amazing. I like different fan, and white noises.Many choices.
