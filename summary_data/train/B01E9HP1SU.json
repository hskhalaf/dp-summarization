As a notorious hoarder of mostly blank journals, I can honestly say, this will be the one that breaks your habit. It's not some prissy little book too expensive and gorgeous to write in. It damn near begs you to scar it with your chicken scratch, and it doesn't fall apart when you get pissed off at the universe and chuck it at the wall. All jokes aside, stop scrolling through reviews, add one (or ten) of these to your shopping cart, and enjoy knowing you will never regret that you did.",

It fits easily in my handbag, I carry a large tote. It lays open fairly flat also considering it is new. I am sure it will grow more supple and flexible with age.

The patina is beautiful and ages well; the binding is sturdy, and there\u2019s a heaviness about it that gives it that quality feel. I know I\u2019ll treasure this journal and the memories it holds for the rest of my life. I\u2019m getting close to the end of the pages so I will definitely be ordering another one very soon.",

Mix this with writing using a Fountain pen and boy do you have a winner. Paper is amazing, leather is durable, and the strap is long enough to string things up. 10/10, I'm buying another one! (Mobile picture uploads are weird so if they are sideways I'm sorry.)",

So then one side but then back good for some paste up once dry.",

Over all, I highly recommend.",

The others are very stiff and dont stay open unless you add pressure on the front. The pages are too stiff and you have to bend them to stay open but these pages are thick but pliable. The leather is soft and the construction is good and sturdy. I will be buying more of these as I gave all the other ones away as gifts. This one cost a bit more but totally worth every penny.",

There are people that regardless of what you say blame driver's and companies with things that they are unaware of, instead of having him deliver it as is.",

The first is that you cannot erase on this paper. This is my music writing journal so, as you can imagine, I need to cross out or erase a lot. The second more pressing concern is one of the leather straps on the binding is extremely thin, and I\u2019m afraid it will break soon without significant wear. I\u2019ve included a phot to see the thin strap. It is on the bottom in the middle. Other than those two things, great journal!",
