But the price tag absolutely does not justify the sound. My personal choice would be Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 (cca. \u00a3200) over these cans at any time but than again, it's a matter of personal preference.

They fix the one thing I didn\u2019t like about the P7s - a hard edge to the midrange that gets a bit fatiguing at high volumes. That\u2019s totally gone. The sound is just slightly bass rich which can make the P9s sound a bit less detailed at first, but then you realize that they\u2019re pulling out detail you haven\u2019t noticed before.
