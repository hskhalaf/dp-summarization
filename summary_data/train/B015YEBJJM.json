The camera provides excellent video quality, easy-to-use features, and of course, the pan and tilt option. It gives me a peace of mind that when I am at work I cycle through my 2 cameras and view every angle of the room. I would highly recommend this camera if you need one that is less expensive and great quality. The only reason I gave this review 5 stars is because the app is a bit confusing.",

Overall it\u2019s a decent system for the price. One major problem I ran into is that the live view does not work with MacOS Safari 12. From what I\u2019ve read, there are no solutions to resolve this issue. The mobile app works fine on the latest version of iOS.",
