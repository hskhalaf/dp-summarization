I suggest to mommies with younger toddlers to glue the toys so when u open it its already set up, easier to stow & toys doesn\u2019t go missing.",

Perfect gift for her age; she's even sleeping with the figures. Good toy for imaginative play. 4 stars because I'm undecided if the price is a little steep; it does include a fair amount but it is a small house. Regardless, I would definitely buy again.",
