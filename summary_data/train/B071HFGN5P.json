I will say that I loved the look and style of the ant farm. However, after 24 hours all but 1 ant was dead. The ants did not do any tunneling. I am not sure how tunneling in sand is even possible. Every time they would try to tunnel the hole would fill up immediately with more sand. It was especially disappointing since this was for my 4 year olds bday present. Stick with the blue gel ant farm!",

I wish the plastic windows were clearer, but maybe that's not possible. I wish I had bought a magnifying glass to go with it, that would be a nice addition.
