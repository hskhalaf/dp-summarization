      "text": "The leather is good quality. It is a little stuff, but nothing that wont loosen up with time. However, the noseband is huge, and not adjustable, allowing the whole halter to fall backwards down the poll. I'm afraid a cob size would be too short and wouldn't fit correctly either. For reference- I had horse size on a 16.3 hh thoroughbred and the noseband was massive. Either size down or the same price you can find a leather halter with an adjustable noseband.",

The leather and workmanship is very nice.",

The fit is a little large, I have a ~1200 lb Appaloosa mare that I ordered a horse size for. Both sides are all the way up and it still hangs a little on her. She needs a turnout halter and because this one does fit big, it rubs. Not a ton, but it has left a couple small sores on her. I'm going to punch more holes to see if that fixes the size issue, but buyer beware, you may want to order a size down.",

      "text": "This is a lovely halter, but it was larger than expected. I purchased the \"horse\" size for my daughter's 17.2 hand OTTB, who generally takes a large halter; and this was much too big in the nose. It would probably be okay for a warmblood or quarter horse. I should've purchased the adjustable nose band, but I like the clean look of the non-adjustable. Unfortunately it was a Christmas present purchased in early October, and I cannot return it due to it being outside of the return window.",
