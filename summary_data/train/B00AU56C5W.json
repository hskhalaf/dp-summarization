At an average of 50 cents a per piece, they're a decent bargain, although ALL the reputable magnetic blocks/tiles/etc. are overpriced (I'm looking RIGHT at you Magformer, though you're the best and you know it and it's CERTAINLY reflected in the price). I shot a quick video comparing the magnetic pull, and ease of play between Picasso Tiles and Magformer and the results are surprising and disappointing. Hope this was helpful!",

Also the largest squares don't have magnets running inside the square, only the edges, which is different from Magnatiles. These are fine, but my son is building parking garages with stalls and was using the center magnets on the large squares, so, I'll be sending these back.",

My kids get so creative with them, and we store in a plastic storage bin so we can bring them on trips. My kids are currently 4,7&10, and they all love playing with them.

Definitely one of the biggest hits toys-wise for our 4 year old grandson. I think I will add to the set as time goes on since he enjoys these building tiles so much. Very happy with my purchase! In fact, his parents bought him a set after seeing how fun and creative these are. Highly recommend!",

Picasso Tiles are high quality and you can buy a lot of them for MUCH CHEAPER than Magna-tiles.

Having 10 grandchildren, I do not recommend these tiles for babies or toddlers as they tend to chew on things. These have magnets embedded in the hard plastic that perhaps can loosen out. Also these tiles have sharp corners and can hurt the babies or toddlers mouth if chewed on or even fallen on. This is my personal recommendation and opinion. \u263a",
