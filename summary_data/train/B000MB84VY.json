It fits into the bed of my pickup. It does weigh 100 pounds, but I can take it out of my truck by myself. We take our 2 small dogs with us too. The storage is handy and we have no complaints. We are enjoying our paddleboat several times per week. Great investment.",

The shipper was great even helped us carry it downstairs.",
