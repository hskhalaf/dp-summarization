I'm going to try it anyway as I already washed it and don't think I can return it. When I typed in \"rectangular bassinet sheets\" this came up. It is soft, but also super thin.",

We have tried other sheets from big box stores that were cheaper AND more expensive. Nothing makes the baby feel more cozy! The quality is good, the fit is perfect for a bassinet. It doesn't curl the mattress and the ends stay tucked securely. I would recommend this product to anyone.",

Fabric isn\u2019t top of the line, a little thin, but it worked good enough to cover the mattress pad. So glad I came across a review that lead me to this product because the brand name covers cost a lot more than these!",
