Not a replacement as it obviously feels very different. But, it's a lot of fun. My setup includes hanging the bag from a door frame mount pull up bar, and a weight bag to hold it down. Works well and easy to move out of the way. At some point I will attempt to hook it up to the ceiling. That way I could probably get kicks in as well.",

The ability to train head-body combos on this bag is essential, although the larger size of the bag prevents it from being as mobile (ie hard to hit) as a single double end bag. One problem I've had with other bags is that they gradually lose air over a few rounds and you need to pump them up every 20 minutes or so. Not so with this bag! This bag is well-worth the money.",
