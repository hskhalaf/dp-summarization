If you're looking at cheaper hangers you're rolling the dice. The rod isn't super slick but it's not exactly non-slip, either. Pants hang fine but you'll need to balance the weight with the hip higher than the legs. No big deal. Some have asked about coats. These hangers will hold most coats except heavy winter coats. Modern winter coats made with new, lighter insulating tech will probably be fine. For heavier coats and suit jackets with a structured shoulder, I suggest the J.S. Hanger Extra Wide Rounded Shoulders hangers, which are also good.",

Its nice to be able to have all our clothes look neat and orderly. Pants do not slip on the hanger due to the grip on the dowel across the bottom of the hanger. These seem like they will last a long time. We just order more for our guest closet as well.",

The only issue I've run into with maybe 2 hangers out of the 80 or so that I have is that the hook actually detached from the hanger. I was able to repair this fairly easily, but just something worth noting if you are thinking about using them for very heavy clothing. Other than that, they definitely level up your closet aesthetic and for about $1.50 a piece, I think it's worth every penny as opposed to flimsy plastic hangers.",

The rod that stretches across the bottom is coated with a thin plastic to keep from snagging your clothing. Overall, for those of us that prefer a nicer, more organized looking closet, these hangers do the job and look nice while doing it.",

Maybe there is a trick to it, but his was not the main reason for purchase and no big deal for us. The size of the hangers is also a plus for us as it hangs our clothes well.
