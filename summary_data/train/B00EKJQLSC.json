From the great highs and mids what impressed me the most was how much bass these speakers were giving out. Enough that I actually had to turn off my main subwoofer (klipsch)as it was good enough for me. The dimensions are just perfect for my needs not too tall not too wide. Would HIGHLY recommend these speakers!!",

Definitely worth the money. I was considering buying older speakers, but after some research I found that those would likely need to be 're foamed'. Last thing I need is another project, so I turned to these. Very powerful & I hear things in songs I never heard before.",

The treble sounds are crisp and clear, but not overly piercing like some brands, the mid range is good, and the base is acceptable considering the cone size. I have them paired with a subwoofer to supplement the base. As a comparison with my last Cerwin Vega, the mid-range and treble are far better to my ears and the base doesn't overpower. Right now I am awaiting my center speakers to round out my system. I am very happy with my purchase.",

Overall they sound great but the highs are weak, I ended up pairing them with a set of bookshelf speakers on top to open them up a bit but I would guess at this price they may not have an actual crossover. You can definitely get better but probably not without spending a lot more money.",

No matter how much you ratchet them up - and don't think they are wimps by any means - they never sound overly loud. And they still deliver the goods at low volumes. I love 'em!",
