Tearing the Velcro off for removal is a challenge, but worth knowing that they would otherwise stay on. These cushions are rather firm and allow me to cinch down my board with a more even pressure across its width. Otherwise the curve of our crossbars would make contact only in the middle of the board. Though my board is wider than the cushions, it really doesn't matter because they create a good inch of clearance when cinched down.",
