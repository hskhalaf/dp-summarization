The silicone gloves where equally impressive. Why haven't I owned a pair of these gloves for grilling before!? They made moving big briskets that were piping hot very easy. Awesome products. Thanks so much for great products at great prices and awesome customer service. I know what Dad is getting for father's day!",

The brush is a cheap 25 cent brush. I will not recommend this unless you are a cheapo charlie yourself and you like low quality products. Returning to Amazon as soon as I can figure it out.",

They are good for some quick use, but anything prolonged and the glove will heat up and the heat transfer to the inside of the glove is pretty quick. These will not be my go-to-glove for cooking, but more for food prep. But then there is another annoying part is these gloves are stiff and while they bend - it takes a fair amount of unnatural force to attempt to use them naturally. I think I want something more pliable. The baster in this set - meh, its whatever it will do a job. The claws are pretty nice, exactly what the picture shows - they are just fine.",
