However , she has only worn it 4 times , indoors, and it seems that one of the seams ripped and unraveled on the sweater . I ordered a bigger size for my dog , she is a medium but I ordered a large to be safe , and it fit her baggy and she still loved it. I would buy another one because she loved it so much but not if they are easily coming apart .",
