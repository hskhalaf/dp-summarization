I owned another reel mower years ago, I believe it was a Black & Decker, and it worked great. This one, however, leaves about 15% of the grass untouched, and multiple passes (which one shouldn't have to do) don't return much better results. Per the manual, I checked the cutting blade adjustment using paper, and made a minor adjustment, but there was no improvement. Something about how the grass is introduced into the mower isn't right, it seems. Mind you, this was on a relatively sparse lawn that wasn't high at all, in three different attempts.",

I do recommend that you pay CLOSE attention to how the items go together via the instructions, AND, don't tighten the handle pieces down all the way before you get the blade in.

When you reach the cut size you want, you must give it several passes to achieve the desired cut. The advantage of this machine compared to gasoline powered mowers is how quiet they are, also having rollers that control the size of the cut guarantee that the cut is uniform throughout the cutting area, this is a great advantage when you compare it with the string lawnmowers which you can loose control of cut size specially if you are not an expert.",

Anyway once we got the second put together it's worked so great. I love that I can push it around the yard even when my kids are playing and I get a good little workout. Keep the wheels and axles oiled and you're good to go! (Don't leave it out in the rain or cut the grass when it's wet)",
