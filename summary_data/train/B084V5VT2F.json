And it kind of is at first, because it uses air pressure to massage. But, it doesn't just tighten and release the whole cuff. It actually works top to bottom and back up, etc. It has settings for how much pressure you're comfortable with, and two different modes. I like it because, working from home and not getting out much lately, my legs are not getting any exercise and my muscles hurt. This actually helps me.",
