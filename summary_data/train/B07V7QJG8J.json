      "text": "I originally purchased this heater over a year ago and was saddened when it was recalled due to wiring melting in the switch potentially causing a fire (mine had started having this issue). This one I just purchased is the exact same brand and design. Really pushes the heat out (on high the air temperature exiting the heater registers 244 degrees) and oscillation is nice and quiet. It warms a 15' x 15' room with ease. Assuming the manufacturer resolved the safety issue this will be used by me for a many years.",

About the only negative thing I can sat is that the on/off rocker switch looks like it turns the heater on/off, but it turns oscillation on/off, which confuses guests. You have to turn a dial to turn the heater on, which is more complicated and it therefore can\u2019t remember the mode you had it in before. I\u2019d much prefer a regular on/off switch for the heater.",
