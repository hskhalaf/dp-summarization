      "verdict": "Salomon developers seem to have done something quite spectacular in the Evasion 2 LTR. They managed to create a remarkably comfortable hiking shoe with outstanding sturdiness and a kind of fit that hugs the foot just right. The one thing that makes this gear a bit of a tough sell, however, is its subpar surface traction. All in all, the Evasion 2 LTR is yet another solid Salomon offering, especially for those who mostly hike on dry ground.",

        "Its overall tough construction amazed a handful of wearers",

My old Merrells are 8, & packed out with extra leather inserts as they are quite wide but plenty long. Salomans are a 9.5 & are toe pinchers,even with medium thick tennis socks, so they're going back for a 10, fingers crossed that these fit as no 10.5s seem to be in stock. These are impressive walking shoes but 2 sizes (at least) out of whack.",
