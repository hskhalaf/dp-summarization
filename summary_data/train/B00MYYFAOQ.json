I have used and abused these headphones from +40*C to -20*C (I have a strange job) and they have stubbornly performed to their upmost. Despite never having heard of plantronics before I bought them, I am now sold on this brands ability to produce high quality audioware. Yes my headphones are dead but holy cr*p, the way I treated them they should have lasted me 4 months at best. RIP my beautiful Backbeat pros, you sing for the angels now.",

The only thing is I had to replace the ear soft padding with some generic pads found on the internet and that significantly reduced the noise cancellation, but as they were, they were magnificent. The sound is brilliant, the bass is awesome and the treble crisp, if only slightly less balanced and round than for example Beats Pro. Add into the mix that I bought these for some 89 quid as a flash sale and I realise this must've been one of my best purchases.",

Also, if you want to use the feature of having 2 devices connected at the same time, make sure both of them are really close to you. When, for instance, you are listening to something on your iPad on your bedroom and your iPhone is on your living room, the song will intermittently \"fail\" (stop for a second). Not a big deal but annoyed me until I realise when the \"failing\" was coming from so I just keep both devices close to me or disconnect the one Im not listening to.",

Gives a verbal update of battery levels every time you turn it on and put on the headset Pauses video and music when you take of headset. (Can be turned off with the Headset Updater) Gets updates. Very clear sound. Bluetooth Calls are a breeze and a must with this. Cons It tooks soooo beautiful that I'm scared it will be stolen Will be testing out the Noise cancellation soon. Both on train and flight. Will update review then :)",

I then tried the Bose bluetooth, but, although the sound was amazing, they too let in too much noise. These are cheaper than both, but have far more features. They also block out a lot of sound, even without noise cancelling on. I was afraid they would be heavy, but they are actually quite comfortable. I was umming and ahhhing between these and the Beats, but these won on price and the fact that you can use them with a cord if the power runs out. You can't do this with the Beats. Happy!!",

They are easy to use and download the Plantronics software to receive software updates and change the settings to suit your needs. Overall the best Bluetooth headphones I have had for quite some time, not reference headphones but what do you expect for just over a hundred quid.",

I used these to listen to a film I had previously watched and the difference in audio quality through these was incredible. The sound separation, distinction and levels are all excellent. These headphones are well made and well designed I particularly like the rotary volume control mounted where it should be, on the earpiece no more fumbling around for rocker switches hidden under the earpiece. Without doubt the best headphones I have ever tried.",

      "text": "I agree with the large number of fans of this product. However I listen mostly to classical music and my wife happened to have delivered at the same time a pair of Beats Solo2. Using a bluetooth transmitter, as my hi-fi is not enabled, I was able to compare the two. The Beats won by their greater detail and presence. Maybe the price difference has something to do with it too but a user with a different music preference may well get a different result. As an aside, to achieve the comparison I had to disable the sensors on the Plantronics or they dropped the connection to the transmitter when removed.",

Works a treat with my Apple TV4 as well so it's great for late night/early morning viewing or just walking around the house with music. Battery life is terrific and reports in to my iPhone on remaining percentage. ANC isn't bad but is only really useful for planes. I flew recently and it made the flight ultimately more bearable. Only negative is the weight of the headphones after sustained usage. Not an issue for me.",

A downside is they are heavy. However I had two sets and they both suffered from the same fault which is vibration when noise cancelling is activated. The vibration is so bad that the headphones are totally unusable. I strongly recommend that anyone buying these headphones conducts extensive testing of the noise cancelling feature before the allowed return date. Maybe I was unlucky but two faulty sets say I wasn't!",

But if you try to use the Backbeat Pro for your laptop mic and smartphone mic, connected at the same time, it will not work. Not sure if this is a compatibility issue with Skype, as I haven't done enough testing. But my view coincides with most forums on the issue. Still best headphones I've owned with this one major issue.",

I don't care if I look ridonkulous, but after about an hour of constantly wearing them in work, they do start to hurt where they drag your head down with their weight. Definitely on the heavy side.

      "text": "Functionalities and battery life are great! Sound is very good for that price bluetooth headphones. The biggest cons are that the cans are quite thick(as seen on the photos) and quite heavy. Overall I recommend these, as it seems that they are the best bluetooth headphones in that price category. The only people who I don't recommend it to are the ones that are more after slim style and don't care about sound and battery life that much.",

The rings on left and right earcup (volume and next/previous) are somewhat wobbly. Not a lot, but it takes away from the premium feel of the headphones. Also, the OpenMic feature could sound better. Otherwise, it is an excellent headset for a great price.",
