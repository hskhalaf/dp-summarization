      "text": "I just returned from a 4-day fishing trip in Alaska and must say that these shoe covers held up very well. In my opinion, these are absolutely great to go over some sport shoes, if you don't want to spend $100, or more, on true rain shoes/boots. Be mindful - the waterproof material is very thin, so don't expect a boot-like performance for extended period of use. I bought them with intent to throw them away after this trip, as I did not want to spend any time washing away fish slime and grime. I was wearing size 9.5 work boots and XL fit me just fine with some jiggle room. They served me well, and I would recommend them.",

Update: after 8-10 total hours of use over several days, a seam failed (separated) near the toe. That makes them useless, since they now collect water. For price vs durability, these are overpriced by a lot. Downgraded to one star. Disappointed, and beyond me how anyone rates these highly.",

Rode through a heavy thunderstorm on a sportster last week and my feet were dry as a bone when I got home. Paired with a Viking two piece rain suit, it was just another ride in the saddle. The only complaint I have is that the bottom texture is not aggressive at all, and I do worry about putting my foot down on anything even slightly slick. Maybe they\u2019d be fine, but it just feels a little too smooth for my liking. As far as fit and finish though, 10/10.",

      "text": "I used these in Iceland when photographing glaciers on Diamond Beach, where the surf often comes up quickly without much notice (sneaker waves I guess they are called). I had these on and never had a problem with the water getting in. Others had on waders on and I'm sure those are best if you need protection up the waist. But these worked great for water that came up mid shin, almost to the knee, multiple times. For the price I was highly impressed, and will purchase them again when the time comes (I had to leave them to Iceland, no more room in my bag).",

We ordered these because we liked that they were able to easily go over our shoes, they were light weight (we were flying and were taking them in our suit case), and inexpensive. They were great for all of those reasons, but they were super flimsy and there's a strap that goes over the top of the foot that kept coming off. We got a few great uses out of them on our trip, and for the cost we felt they were worth it.",
