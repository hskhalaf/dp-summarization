They looked slightly different to my older converse when i took them out the box but i didn't think much of it, I now realise they're likely fakes judging by the terrible quality. My old converse I'd had for 3 years and they were in better nick than these after just 5 weeks of light wear. DO NOT BUY THESE. Get a real pair from schuh or office for the same price.",

Material is a lot stiffer at the back of heel, so will probably need some gel cushions for my hypersensitive and annoying feet! Having said that, they do look great and feel really cushioned under foot. And at a bargain price, I would definitely recommend!!!",
