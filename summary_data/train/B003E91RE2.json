We previously had the same unit, with the same devices, that lasted well over a year before exhibiting the same issue. We purchased it again, hoping it would not exhibit the same problem, even though multiple reviews reported the switching to radio source issue. We will not purchase another.",

This occurred with the FM and the iPhone option. I spoke with Sony the next day and they said to send it back. Amazon provided exceptional customer service in doing the exchange. The second unit has been functioning very well for the past 3 weeks. Great sound quality especially with the iPhone and while they say you need to use the adapter (included) and thus take the cover off your iPhone, it is not necessary. Amazon by far offered the best deal on this unit at least when I was looking.",

The bad news: The rechargeable battery only lasted for about 6 months before it stopped accepting a charge. Now, the only way to use the speakers is plugged in. Sort of defeats the purpose of a \"rechargeable speaker system\". I called Sony to seek support and they told me that the battery was not covered under warranty and a replacement battery is over $100. No thanks. Needless to say, I'll be looking for a new rechargeable speaker system. I'm sure it won't be another Sony though!",

Connect this device with Airport Express and now you can stream music from your PC directly into this device WIRELESSLY!!! all with QUALITY along with PORTABILITY. No product is perfect so here are some little nuissances. If you are using the battery, the bass is not as powerfuly as when connected, the little remote control does not have a MUTE button, your finger prints can get all over it. I still recommend this great product due to quality and price.",

This leaves the iPod \"flopping\" around whenever you touch it. I also had concerns about the \"error\" that several reviewers reported experiencing. I decided to return it and purchase a lower model Sony unit (RDP-XF30IP) for less than half the price. It looks virtually identical but has a fixed dock with a support behind it that keeps it firmly in place but doesn't have a radio. I didn't compare the sound side-by-side, but the lesser model sounded about the same to me.",

The Sony is handily portable and compact, which I like. At louder volumes, the mid-range and bass get a little mushy. For best results, put the unit in a corner. It will fill up the room nicely and can be heard over small gatherings.",

I planned to use this as a nice set of speakers to wake up to my phone alarm and it is completely useless for that purpose as it powers itself off. I attempted to use the Sony iPhone software, which is equally useless, and also called support who confirmed that there is no way to do this. Speakers are nice but as a docking station this silly feature sort of ruins it. Dan",
