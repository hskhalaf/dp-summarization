It looks really cool sitting with my Xbox One. As for the negatives. 1. The controller sits on the base to charge with three contact points on the bottom of the controller. Because of how it's designed you sometimes have to give it a little wiggle to encourage it to connect and charge. No big deal. I might add. I didn't get rid of the first one I had. Kids adopted it.

Our One S controllers seemed to eat batteries much faster than the 360 controllers did. Replacing batteries once a week compared to once a month on the 360. These rechargeables last us about a week before needing a recharge and that is with 2 to 3 hours of daily play. The battery indicator on the screen is a nice reminder when they need to be placed on the charger.",

If you get a red flashing light reseat the controller on the charger. In rare instances with the red flashing light, make sure the battery is properly placed within the controller itself then try again. I recommend this product.",

It takes a little bit of elbow grease to insert the new battery packs, but it's not overly complicated. They do not take a ton of time to charge, and the battery life on this thing is crazy long. I would recommend fully charging the batteries before use, just in case. I've had this for two years at this point and it still works fantastic. If you play a lot, it will pay for itself and produces no waste, unlike batteries. Highly recommend.",

In the down position, the charger makes contact to charge the battery. Buuuuuuut....it\u2019s sometimes a pain to get the controller centered correctly on the charging contacts....it just feels unintuitive and the controller is kinda wobbly and insecure in its charging cradle. It\u2019s very easy to partially dislodge the controller. It does the job, but I would not purchase it again.",

Again, green light says \"it's charged,\" and it's nice that I can just \"pop\" the stand and it stops charging but lets me keep the controller in the cradle so I don't lose it.",

      "text": "Great product great battery life, and reasonably priced. would have given 5 stars however sometime the charging pad requires you to re center the controllers to catch the weight of the controller and maintain the charging. Having lights on the product to let you know when the controller is charging is a huge help with my previous statement. Works great with my Elite controller as well. overall a great product would recommend as the some of the competitions products can be far worse with battery's not maintaining a charge after 3 months.",

      "text": "Pretty awesome charger - no major complaints. The only thing I noticed that is a potential draw back is that sometimes you have to click in hard and make sure the controller(s) are properly placed in to start charging... So essentially, if you pushed down, make sure you see that the light is \"red\" or green to let you know that the controller is connected properly and charging. Not a big deal as it's fine for the value - but something I observed.",

My only complaint is that sometimes it requires tedious careful placement for the charging prongs to get in contact. other than that, this thing makes your controllers very accessible to use and looking great as it sits on it on standby.",
