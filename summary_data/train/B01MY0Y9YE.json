All in all I was quite pleased by the weight, the quality, the size, and even the fun carrying case they came with!",

They are \"noisy\" meaning when in use they sound like they are about to fall apart. The locks work fine, but I do question the durability. I returned them because the grips are kind of large in diameter and they were for my wife. She didn't like the size, and said her hands were sweating because of the grip material. They aren't the worse ones out there, but there are definitely better for around the same price point.",

I wanted to be compact, lightweight and store easy. Check, check and check! Something I didn't realize I would enjoy was the fact that they have measurements on the side so every time I can get them to exact length that feels comfortable without having to guess and check each time. Overall, very satisfied with my purchase.",

She used them the entire time we were out. They seem pretty sturdy, and are pretty easy to lock at the height they needed to be at . Think I might need to get myself a pair now so we can match!",

What an incredible difference trekking poles make especially on the descent! Grays Peak is terribly rocky and loose rock at that. These poles were perfect. Caught me many times as I am not graceful or sure-footed in the least! Easy to adjust between ascent (shorter) and descent (longer). For the price, I highly recommend! My fiance used a pair from REI that cost 3 times as much with no difference in functionality that I could see.",

I haven't noticed them being any louder than my other poles as other users have reviewed.",
