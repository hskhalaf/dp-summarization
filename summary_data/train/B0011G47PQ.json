Jimmy is an excellent communicator, kept me advised as to the status of shipping, and included many more ink cartridges than advertised. He sent very helpful instructions re unpacking and setup, and the printer is working perfectly. I would not hesitate to buy used equipment from this source again!",

      "text": "As a recent photo school grad I have made hundreds of prints on various professional printers... I have to say that the prints from my new R1900 are the best I have ever made. The colors, gradations and fine details in the prints are rendered perfectly. The gloss optimizer coat gives rich glossy prints that look like traditional photo lab prints. The printer features automatic matte black ink switching which means I can make quality prints on any kinda of media...even CD's! And It's fast. Basically if you want to make exquisite glossy prints as large as 13x19 inches you will be thrilled with this printer.",

      "text": "The printer seems to get head clogs any time I transport it. This is something that my 2 year old r1800 has no problem with. When running the nozzle cleaning cycles it eats through a bunch of ink, and usually takes several tries. I will be getting rid of this printer as soon as I get through some of the extra ink I bought for it. Epson has tried to help with phone support, but a brand new printer shouldn't have problems like this.",

TOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE 4.0 out of 5 stars takes a bit of work, calibration wise... most important: USE GOOD PAPERReviewed in the United States on July 24, 2012Verified Purchase I purchased this printer so I could make larger-format prints of my watercolor paintings, which are pretty detailed and vibrant.\n\nI'll skip the technical details and get right to the stuff that always vexes me as far as printers: color calibration.\n\nIt's taken me about two years to finally figure out how to calibrate this thing so that the colors weren't \"muddy\" and muted on my prints. There were two keys: one was to create a new \"layer\" in Photoshop with my watercolor painting and to set it at 80-90% transparency.\n\nThe second, and most important, is USE GOOD PAPER. I spent months trying to calibrate my printer using office supply store cardstock because I didn't want to waste \"good\" paper while I tried to figure out the color calibration. Then, on a lark, I threw in a piece of good watercolor paper and the colors came out crisp and beautiful. The cheapy cardstock and uncoated paper sucks up these particular inks like nobody's business, so go right to the good paper when you are printing out test prints. You might lost a few sheets in the process, but I promise you that it will save you tons of time in the long run.\n\nIt does seem to go through ink a little quickly, but I'm printing full color prints with HUGE pools of color and it's doing okay.\n\nThis printer is an investment, but if you need a product like this, it will serve you well. Just use the good paper and set your images lighter than you want them to print and you will be off to a good start!Read more 9 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Mike5.0 out of 5 stars THE best pigment printer on the marketReviewed in the United States on December 21, 2010Verified Purchase I'm admittedly biased to Epson printers as their hardware and software (drivers) offer the best quality on the market, but they've taken the R1800 and made it even better with the R1900. The R1900 is the ONLY pigment printer currently on the market that can create believable glossy prints. I'm not sure why Epson hasn't gone the gloss optimizer route on their more expensive models like the 3880, 4800, 9800, etc. but this R1900 would be my choice over ALL models even if price and size/footprint is not a factor. I work in the digital photography business and have a half dozen high end photographic printers, both pigment and dye, from Epson, Canon, and HP, and this printer rates 5 stars for me whereas the next closest pigment printer would be lucky to get 3 stars. If you want archival, quality prints, with a pigment printer that can print true glossy prints, you have no choice but to buy this printer! There are simply no others in the running.Read more 10 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Mia Johnson4.0 out of 5 stars Good Quality Photo PrinterReviewed in the United States on February 8, 2010Verified Purchase I send most of my work out to be printed but needed to upgrade my in house printer to something better then the 6 year old Epson I was using. I was primarily using my local printer for proofs. I was also looking for something with a good enough quality that I could just process smaller jobs in house for equal or less price then having to send them out.\n\nThe first couple of photos that I printed were disappointing as they looked dark and did not seem to have much of a range between the highlights and shadows. They were also what I would call semi-gloss rather than glossy. I was using a non Epson premium glossy paper that had worked for me before in my old Epson. I went out and bought some Epson premium photo paper and it made all the difference in the world. The prints match my calibrated monitor and the range is much greater than with the non Epson paper. I would recommend using Epson paper or at least a paper that advertised that they were Epson equivalent. Of course the ink cartridges could be larger and a little less expensive but that is true for almost any photo printer. I may look at getting a CIS system if I can find one that has quality inks.Read more One person found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse C. Bradley5.0 out of 5 stars Study how to set your preferences and it works superReviewed in the United States on October 27, 2011Verified Purchase There's a terrific review sight at magiclightvideo.com He thoroughly analyzes each printer. He also walks you through step-by-step how to adjust the various Advance tab settings to get the quality of photo you desire--such as whether or not it includes text and how you can adjust the various colors to your preference.\nAfter taking time to study the negative reviews posted on amazon, I concluded that most of those folks simply don't realize what caliber of performance to expect from various price ranges of equipment, how much ink color photos use, and how to customize preferences so you get the look you desire in each photo. Once you take the time to learn this, which one really needs to do with any piece of equipment regardless of the brand or model, Epson's can't be beat.\nI've used several brands over the course of what's now become decades of my semi-professional work and I 100% recommend Epson.Read more 4 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Mark T.4.0 out of 5 stars Works as AdvertisedReviewed in the United States on June 20, 2012Verified Purchase I use this primarily for disc printing with occasional needs for larger than norm sheets. I don't pay attention to ink usage because I print high quality graphics. On the right stock it is as close to photograph quality as I've seen without spending $1000 or more for a printer. It repeats print location on a disc almost perfectly. If it runs an ink cartridge empty in the middle of a job it just stops so you can change it and you will be hard pressed to tell where it stopped and restarted. The only thing I don't like about it is how it handles the clear overcoat on discs. It covers a solid square/rectangle the size of the graphic. For a disc it means it puts the clear on the entire disc and part of the disc tray. It drys on the discs surfaces without the inkjet receiver OK but it must be washed off the tray. Warm water does the job so it is not a killer problem. But it is annoying. One would think Epson could write the driver so it only cleared the printable part of the disc.Read more Helpful Comment Report abuse See all reviews from the United States \n\n\nWHAT OTHER ITEMS DO CUSTOMERS BUY AFTER VIEWING THIS ITEM?\nPage 1 of 1 Start overPage 1 of 1 This shopping feature will continue to load items when the Enter key is pressed.
