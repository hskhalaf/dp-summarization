This table is the perfect size, and takes up even less space because of its shape. Assembly was easy, it took me about 20 min to put together. The color is rich and beautiful, and the construction is solid. Although the table is smaller, there is still a lot of surface area for things. Overall great table.",

Right off the bat I had company sit a glass/cup on it and it without using the multitude of coasters in the room, and it left a ring. Good place to set a decorative bowl. ): Although a water ring is not the fault of the table, I have rescued glasses off other tables and inserted a coaster, and not ended up with damage. This was quickly damaged and I don't know why. It is overall a very nice table, it has been sturdy. If I have to refinish it someday, so be it.",

WOW was I surprised to find that these tables are made of real wood (I mean it might be veneer) with pretty hefty craftsmanship (I can stand on it no problems) and a pretty durable finish. This is in our \"man cave\" and has had everything from bourbon to hot sauce spilled on it. After over a year, the stain and varnish are still in great shape and clean up like new. As others have said, this is pretty Red for an 'espresso' finish, but I really didn't mind.",
