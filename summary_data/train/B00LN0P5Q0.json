Otherwise, it worked as advertised. I transferred some business files so I'd have another copy of them, and that worked. I just got the drive today, haven't dropped it, haven't had water soak it, just transferred some sensitive files, so I can't give you any long term usage results. Will come back & comment should anything exceptional or disastrous happen, otherwise it's a good functioning hard drive. .",

Does great as you can easily run games off the external hard drive without any hiccups in game play. Can also transfer between the XboxOne hard drive and this one quickly. This hard drive comes with a USB cable that can also be attached to 2 rubber clamps that are attached to the hard drive itself for easy transportation. Since the 4 years I\u2019ve owned this have lost one of the little plastic clamps that keeps the USB attached for easy traveling but not a big deal",

They said it is dead (I knew that!) and would cost about $1900 to retrieve the files but they would have no titles and no folders - just retrieved numbers. If you want to lose everything, if you want something unreliable, if you want a brick to keep your door open, this is for you. Good luck!",

      "text": "Good little flash storage. So far this thing has lived up to its description, depending on the computer I've had write speeds go from the drive to my desktop (which as SS USB 3.0 ports) as high as 110mb/s as burst speeds then it goes down to 43-60mb/s transfers. Writing TO the drive is a bit slower ranging from 33-44mb/s also varying on different computers. Will update this review when/if it dies as to give an example of it's lifespan if its too short.",
