Anyways, HUGE upgrade in stabilization from my Hero 6, also audio is much better, this is the best GoPro in terms of stabilization. If you need gimbal performance without an actual gimbal I think this is the way to go plus it fits in my pocket so I take it everywhere and make videos anywhere I want. Low light performance is not that great, better than Hero 6 but I don't expect to use this for low light too much, it's really action camera for daylight.",

Not sure if that's what I expected from an almost $400 camera.
