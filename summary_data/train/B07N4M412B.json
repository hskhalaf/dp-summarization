And just a few days ago (September 2020), it started randomly turning off. Now it won't stay on very long before it shuts off, and is totally unusable like this. I've restarted, updated, done a complete factory reset, and nothing has fixed this issue. So the phone works beautifully, until it doesn't. It only lasted me just under 9 months.",

I'm certainly biased towards pure-Android phones, and this iteration isn't that bad of a compromise in terms of how much Samsung has plastered on to it, considering how easy it is to disable the bloatware and install a different home manager.",

According to AT+T it has no plans in the future to allow any unlocked phones to use WiFi calling, HD calling, VoLTE, or call protect. IT WILL NOT WORK. If you do not care about these features it is a great phone. I was forced to return it for the above reasons.",

The camera is better, the battery life is better and like the fact that it comes with screen protector already installed from factory. Though, I compared the physical size of the S10 with that of the S8 and it turns out that it is identical with the only exceptions of button layout, front screen layout and rear camera layout. The proximity sensor was great in previous models, not sure why they decided to eliminate it on this S10. Overall it's a good phone, though I must say it looks like the phone manufacturers are reaching their max with what they can come up with to produce newer phones.",
