      "text": "I ordered this just in time for use during Hurricane Dorian! CHARGE THE BATTERY WITH ELECTRICITY VIA PHONE CHARGER UPON RECEIPT FOR 8 HOURS- MAKING SURE TO SELECT lI iON as power source. It doesn't come precharged and a few hours of solar and/or batteries doesn't cut it. I learned this the hard way, but in time for the storm. Then you will be sure it doesn't cut off after a few seconds of use. Having done that, you will be pleased with all this little, stout radio offers! Appreciate the weather/marine radio and the light sources (flashlight and reading light).",
