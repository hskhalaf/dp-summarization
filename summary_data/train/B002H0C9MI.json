This DIY project was much more cost effective than the professional framing estimates and looks great! I just placed an order for a second frame. Thanks!",

The case was packaged very well to protect the \"wood\" and \"glass.\" It holds my jersey perfectly in place and displays the signature without any special maneuvering. Overall, I would have no problems buying this product again and would recommend this to all my friends.",
