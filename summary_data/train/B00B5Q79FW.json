You are maxed out to 16TB. They already offer 5TB drives, but choose to not even update the firmware for these drive. They quoted back EOL(End of Life). Hmm. I understand EOL, but 1. Not when you are still selling it. 2. It's is under warranty still. This is about pushing any customer to buy their newer product. That is all it is. No customer loyalty at all. I have 7 Seagate NAS, and now must look to WD. Very disappointed that 1 One version removed hardware gets nothing from them already.",

I had to interpret the available documentation to finally figure out how to enable Time Machine support on this NAS. After that, things were smooth and simple. I have all of my systems smoothly backing up to this NAS. The NAS itself is fairly quiet with some fan noises but not bad.",
