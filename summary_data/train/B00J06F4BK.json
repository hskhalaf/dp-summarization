I did hours of research, read through many reviews and finally made the order. The quality is amazing. I needed something powerful so I can run both business, school, and games on the go. This has met all my needs and is so light that I'm impressed. I've owned the blade for a few months now and really feel that it's going to last me a long time. Plus it looks so sleek and feels so soft that I couldn't imagine switching it out.",

Searching online, the motherboard dying is a common issue and I find it ridiculous they would charge that much for a known issue with their product. For that amount of money I can purchase a similarly spec'ed laptop from a different company that's 2 years newer. I thought I was paying more for quality and reliability but apparently not. I don't think I will be purchasing a Razer again.",

And the reason is because it almost always has a problem such as \" working on features ;100% complete; Don turn off your computer. \" this is the second time it's happened. It never got out of that blue screen. I had to recover system settings for this. I tried calling system support but they're not available 24/7. Another problem is caps lock continues not to work even though it had worked for a time. Then there are times when the left mouse button doesn't work. I mean come on, for a computer I spent 2800 dollars on, these most basic problems should not occur.",
