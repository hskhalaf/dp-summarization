Also, I had a few questions and their customer service was excellent! They replied to my emails quickly and answered my questions thoroughly. It has been a pleasure working with them. The picture is great and the LED lights really let me see what's behind me at night.",

I went with a wireless option as I didn't want to have to run a video cable the full length of my car. The picture on the camera is clear and I was able to attach the trailer for the first time by myself. My only complaint is that the 3M tape that holds the monitor to the dash didn't want to adhere to my dash, after a couple of attempts I was able to get it attached and it stayed put.",
