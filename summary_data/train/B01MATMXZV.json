There is no serial number attached to the actual tablet. ASUS states the serial number is only on the original box, or the original warranty card. After several months of ownership, I do not have access to those items. ASUS will allow the purchaser to send in the unit for examination charging a $60.000 nonrefundable fee.

I can't compare it to any other tablet as this is the only one I use ... but it's fast, responsive, bright, colorful and does EVERYTHING I need it to do. I don't share the same 'battery' opinions as most people on here. Yes, the battery life isn't 2,458 hours long ... but I never use it for more than 2 hours at a time anyhow. It lasts an entire flight from coast to coast (USA), with power to spare, so that's a win in my book. For the price, this was a steal.",

The screen is just beautiful. Really sharp and great for watching videos or reading books or magazines. Now that ASUS has officially sent out the new Android Nougut as an over the air update the user experience and interface are so much cleaner. Really happy with the purchase. Obviously the camera isn't great on this tablet, but if you're doing for this tablet, chances are you probably have a decent phone that takes better pictures right in your pocket. I definitely don't regret this purchase.",

It takes a good 5 minutes, and usually requires a restart, to get the connection back. And it's clearly the tablet. All the lights on the router are green, and my other household tablets, phones, laptops all work fine. I know it's inexpensive, but I'd never buy it again.",

Concluded bad antenna in the unit. Sent it back to Amazon for refund and bought Samsung tab A 10.5, which I love and recommend. Judging from the number of 1-star reviews, buying this tablet is quite risky. Don't buy the Asus 3s 10.",

      "text": "This review is a very late one - I've owned this tablet for 1.5 years (since release). This is one of the best performing Android devices I've owned, and it sees routine use for video, web surfing, email and reddit. I've been expecting it to slow down or the battery life to get worse, but it just keeps on running like a top. I haven't even reset it once in the time I've used it. It is simply a well made, well designed device that holds up great for a long time!",

When I called yesterday, the service representative knew what he was doing. He worked with me over the phone to prove that the SD card must be of high quality, which he confirmed is what I had. Then he guided me to transfer music and video to it. Which worked. He was patient and dedicated and made me respect the service from Asus. So far I found inserting the SD card needed a little fiddling.",

Very disappointing, as my first one was dropped and resulted in a broken screen (Not purchased from Amazon) and i could find anyone who would repair it for less than $185.00. Seriously, I believe the Asus tablet from Amazon was just a \"lemon\".",
