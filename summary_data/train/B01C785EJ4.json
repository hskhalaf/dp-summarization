However, they do not work as designed; 1. It leans too far forward, due to the different sized pads underneath. 2. The mouse pad area needs some type of raised bumper or border, as the mouse is constantly sliding off the desk and falling every time I move. 3. The phone holder is not deep enough, so the phone is constantly falling out or over, and not wide enough to put your phone in sideways.",

The material that the laptop rests on is textured, but not enough to grip the laptop. Mine has a small edge piece at the bottom, which keeps the laptop from flying off the edge, but not enough to mitigate the slipping about of both the mouse and the laptop.",
