All of the furniture, with the exception of the tub and toilet, is wooden. I would have given it five stars but the one of the arms of the couch was completely detached when we opened up the package. We used craft glue to fix it.",

The furniture that came with the dollhouse were of excellent quality including the upholstered couch which I thought provided an above and beyond accent to the decor. Barbie dolls or similar sized dolls compliment this dollhouse very well. I bought this gift for my niece as a Christmas present; and it did not disappoint. Her reaction was priceless and I would recommend this as a gift for any little girl.",

For the price, it was a good purchase. My grandkids love it and play with it all the time. Ages 5 (twins) I recommend this item completely. The house is pretty big.",

The only problem we had was the composite floor for the second story was not quite wide enough and when a small hand pressed down on it, it gave way and sagged at one end. We used glue to keep the flooring (after taking the house almost completely apart) in the groove but that may not be a permanent fix. This is the only complaint, otherwise, this is a great toy for playing house or displaying your dolls--Barbies are the perfect size.",

It's managed to stand the test of time and children so far! It's great for their imaginations! They can sit for hours decorating the house and playing with their dolls. I am definitely pleased with this purchase & would recommend it to anyone!!",

So far, it has held together through a relocation and is still holding the dolls and the doll furniture without problem. I would absolutely recommend this doll house for any little girl.

I think we are going to start using it for storage of her barbies or car or other accessories that she isn't using at the time. It is super cute. She loves the stairs.

It keeps coming down on the one side. I may use super glue or something else to hold it - that is my only annoyance :)",

It is very tall, for a 3 year old, but it only means that she will play with it longer. There are very many cute details about it. It is good enough for Barbies, but some of the furniture looks out of place in it. Still my daughter LOVES it and so do I!!!",

I am 5'4 and when I saw the dollhouse I had to do a height check. The description does not give the size of the house justice. Took my husband 2 1/2 hours to put it together and yes you do need a drill. I recommend this product. Happy New Year!!!!",
