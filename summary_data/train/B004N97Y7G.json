Clean up was fairly easy, remember to put the flat tray on the bottom and wipe the top down real well after. It is a larger oven so it takes a little longer for the toast.",

We even bought a tiny chicken this time thinking the other was too big for the rotisserie. Not the case it just doesn't work well for rotisserie Keep the box for the photos because there are no instructions. The toaster oven part works well its nice to have around",

I used an oven thermometer to figure out what the actual temp is at each setting: 450=525, 325=450, 300=400, 275=375, 250=335, 225=300 degrees. The manual is not helpful.

The toast option is nice, but due to the distance between the heating elements, the toast tends to dry out all the way through, creating more of a Biscotti bisquit that may break your teeth, vs the brown toasted exterior with soft center that a regular toaster. Other than that last feature flaw, I use this thing DAILY ( for everything but actual toast) I would rename it: Mini Countertop Oven and Rotisserie and leave out the \u201ctoast\u201d lol",

There was quite a lot of grease splattered along the walls from roasting a whole chicken and the oven had to be completely cleaned. It does do a good job cooking various types of food.",

The Ronco had the spit with dual rods that just held stuff in place. This cooker has 2 little forks. These little forks do 'OK' but tuff to keep a chicken nicely centered.

      "text": "I specifically wanted a BLACK toaster oven and the description said that's what this was. In the product picture the top may look greyish because I thought it was a reflection. It is not: only the FACE is black. The description is misleading. I am keeping it because it is better than nothing. I put a 12X12 black tile on top to offset the GREY. Others said there are no instructions: just plug it in or do an internet search about the rotisserie. It is an ok size for small dishes. IT'S NOT BLACK!!!!! :)",

I normally use it for baking such as chicken wings, chicken tender and salmons. Most convenient and super easy to clean. I wrap the square pan with aluminum foil paper so when it\u2019s done all I do is just change a new sheet of foil paper plus it come with handle tools that\u2019s a plus. Great product for its price.",
