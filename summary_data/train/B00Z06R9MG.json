      "text": "This version of the phone has only 8gb of internal storage, there is a micro SD slot but only a few apps are movable to this. Every time I wanted to download a new app there was not enough internal storage left so I had to delete something else to make room. It's a nice little phone if you only use a few apps, but it wasn't good for my needs so I returned it and bought the 5.5\" version, this has 16gb so much better. I cannot speak highly enough of Amazon's returns procedure though, they could not have made it much easier for me.",
