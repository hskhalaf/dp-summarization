You'll be charged a premium price for something that is certainly not premium quality. If I'd have known that the lifespan of this product was so short I would have bought a cheaper one.",

That doesn't help me get good sleep. I thought this pillow was a luxury item when I purchased it. After sleeping on it for several nights in a row, I've come to realize that it is almost a necessity. My quality of sleep is waaay better then before, and I don't even notice the tiny amount of space or weight it adds to my pack. Comfortable, strong, very easy to adjust, and packs down so small. Highly recommended.",

Super comfy when resting your head. It was smaller than I imagined in my head but yet it's still perfect. I will probably invest in the larger one at some point. Wraps back easy and fits in it's bag perfectly. I can't wait to use it officially when camping.",

If it's fully inflated, it's way too thick, even while I'm on my side. This may be in part because I have a fairly cushy mat, which allows the shoulder to sink down a bit. Just could not get comfortable on it. Will go back to small therm-a-rest cushion, even if larger pack-size and weight.",

We have never used pillows for backpacking so this is not a comparison, but they are light enough that it was not a concern which is why we have not tried pillows before, we just didn't want the weight.

They seem sturdy, and the side that has a soft feel is quite nice. Hen they deflate easily and go back in their compact little bag. AWESOME!!!",
