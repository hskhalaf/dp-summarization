      "text": "This is a great affordable DJ controller. Very solid build quality. Buttons are very responsive, jog wheels feel just as sensitive as the higher end Pioneer controllers. Pad scratch feature is cool, not overpowered lol. Cross fader moves smoothly for clean cuts and scratches. Mixer section has all the features for professionally sounding performances. Pitch sliders are a bit short ranged, these could have been longer like the similarly priced Numark Mixtrack Pro 3. Comes with Serato DJ Lite which offers a few improvements from Serato DJ Intro such as monitoring line meters for volume management. The unit has a good weight and offers grip ridges for handling. I'm very satisfied with this product and strongly recommend it.",

Serato says I still have to purchase an upgrade licences to use it with this controller. I guess I didn't read the fine print. Serato DJ lite is a bit too limited for me.",

I tell ya what... I Love It!! Very easy to use and I am using it with VDJ8 program. Its just a tad bit longer in length (about an 1.5 inches), but so many more features when compared to my previous controller! I just wish that the soundcard in the controller had TRS/XLR outs instead of the RCA. but other than that... This controller is truly AWESOME!!",

Its ehhh for me. I probably will not use them even to learn with. Fade fx are a nice touch for mixing in to the next song.

I practiced with the Serato software and produced sound from my pc but when I connected to the controller there was no sound coming from the speakers.

Also the SB3 has 16 pads which are far easier to switch pad modes from sampler to hot cue and others. HJV only beats the SB3 in jog wheel quality and sound card quality.",
