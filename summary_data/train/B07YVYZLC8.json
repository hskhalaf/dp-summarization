Not only that the anc that they\u2019re going for isn\u2019t even as good as the anc on the beats studio 3s! And you\u2019d think for the money you\u2019re spending they would give you a hard shell carrying case for these! You can keep these flop cans. Imma stick with the beats studio 3s until you guys rectify the mistake.",

These are out and about headphones \u2014 not lounging around headphones. ANC should be more than enough to drown out the gym noises. Sound quality is on par with any other headphone in this price range. Very good, well balanced.",

The noise cancelling isn't the best, but they aren't Bose or Sony so that is to be expected. The main issue is that because these are over ear and they need to fit snug for some noise cancellation, they end up hurting your ears after just 1 hour of use. Because of that reason, I cannot recommend these to most people.",

Just seems for $299.99 they could include a couple cords and a charger. I don't know what they mean about noise cancellation but when I play music from my echo show I can hear everyone talking. Probably should have just bought a cheap set then I wouldn't have been disappointed.",
