From exclusive features to the highest level of performance, these babies will make even seasoned grillers blush.\n\nWEBER'S ORIGINAL GAS GRILLING SYSTEM\nNotice how sturdy the shroud feels as it opens smoothly on its hinges? See how the burners roar to life on the very first try? Delighted by how simple it is to achieve a mouthwatering meal every time? It's no accident. Weber spends countless hours perfecting the grilling systems on its gas grills, assuring easy assembly, an evenly heated cooking surface, and precision controls so you can tone things down or up to the perfect heat level for direct or indirect cooking.\n\nCOOKBOX AND SHROUD\nThe cookbox houses the components of the cooking system: cooking grates, burner tubes, Favorizer Bars, and the grease management system.\n\nMade of cast aluminum, Weber's gas-grill cookboxes are durable, efficient, require minimal care and maintenance, and can withstand the heat needed to grill at any temperature. In addition, the shape of the cookbox, when combined with the shroud, allows for the proper circulation of heat around food for even cooking whether you're using direct or indirect heat.\n\nCOOKING GRATES\nWeber gas-grill cooking grates come in three exceptional materials: porcelain-enameled steel, stainless steel, and porcelain-enameled cast-iron. Each type retains heat evenly and sears food beautifully. Porcelain-enameled steel cooking grates are durable and easy to clean. Stainless steel rod cooking grates make lovely sear marks, hold heat very well, and clean up with ease. Porcelain-enameled cast-iron cooking grates combine the ease of porcelain-enameled with the superior heat retention of cast-iron--no need to season and easy to clean.\n\nBURNER TUBES\nWeber's burners are made of high-grade stainless steel, which will stand up to the small amounts of water found in liquid propane and natural gas. The burner tubes are made of a singular piece of steel with no welds, making them stronger and more resistant to rust and burn-through. And while they are protected from grease drippings and food by the Flavorizer bars, Weber cart gas grill burner tubes can be cleaned easily by gently brushing with a Weber stainless-steel grill brush.\n\nControls for each burner give you the ability to grill by the direct or indirect method. Even more, the burners are spaced to provide heat across the entire cooking grate, and the burner valves have infinite control settings, so you can fine-tune the heat levels. \n\nFLAVORIZER BARS\nThe innovative Flavorizer bar system, originally created by Weber, is designed perfectly to perform a variety of functions on the Spirit , Summit, and Summit gas grills. Angled just right, the Flavorizer bars catch drippings that smoke and sizzle, adding flavor to your food. Any drippings not vaporized by the Flavorizer bars follow the slope of their unique angle and are funneled away from the burner tubes, down into the grease management system. Not only does this help prevent flare-ups inside your grill, but it also protects the burner tubes from becoming clogged.\n\nMade of either porcelain enamel or stainless steel, Flavorizer bars are durable, long lasting, and easy to care for. Periodically brushing them clean with a Weber stainless-steel grill brush will help keep Flavorizer bars performing at their best. \n\nGREASE MANAGEMENT\nWhen juices drip off the meat, they funnel down to the Flavorizer bars, and then what doesn't vaporize into wonderful smoke goes down into the grease management system. The grease management system consists of an angled grease tray and catch pan. The grease tray rests beneath the cookbox a safe distance from the burner tubes to prevent the grease from catching fire. Grease is channeled down the grease tray and into the catch pan. Both the grease tray and catch pan are easy to clean. The tray easily slides out of the cabinet for cleaning, and when the catch pan starts to fill, simply remove the disposable drip pan, toss it in the trash, and replace it with an empty pan.\n\nFUEL GAUGE \nA fuel gauge lets you know exactly where you stand on fuel at all times.\n\nSEAR STATION BURNER & SIDE BURNER (SELECT MODELS)\nMaximize the heat without minimizing grilling space.

Clark5.0 out of 5 stars Like a kid at Christmas!Reviewed in the United States on January 23, 2016Style: Natural GasVerified Purchase I had been wanting one of these grills for years, so when my old Genesis Silver finally bit the dust, I was secretly happy. This grill is great and is everything I hoped it would be. It has a massive grilling surface that heats evenly. The sear burner works great and has helped me grill some mean steaks. It is easy to start all the burners and the lighted knobs and grill lights on the handle are a real plus. I've only used the rotisserie once to cook a pork loin, and the pork loin came out great. It is very nice having the rotisserie motor fold down into the side table. There is a lot of storage underneath the grill, especially since mine is natural gas, so no propane bottle. My wife has used the side burner a few times to cook things and said she likes it better than the one on the old Genesis Silver.\n\nHowever, every grill has both positives and negatives, so I will list a few things that could be better. I wish the infrared burner for the rotisserie was longer. It was long enough for the whole pork loin, but I'm not sure how well it would work for multiple roasts or chickens. It also does take a while to light all six burners and turn them off, but I guess that is what you get with a large grill. I think the smoker box is OK and have used it once, but don't expect it to give more than a little smoke taste to what you are cooking or to smoke that long. If I really want to smoke meat, I have a separate smoker for that.\n\nWhen this arrived, I felt like a little kid at Christmas time and I keep getting that same feeling every time I use this grill.Read more 23 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse M. Parker5.0 out of 5 stars Great grill - super hot for your steaks, super low for the slow grill technique.Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2018Style: Natural GasVerified Purchase So, I've had this thing about three months. I've had a lot of different gas grills including multiple Weber Genesis, Charbroil, and some Sears. I've always considered them a compromise as I think gas can't offer the same temps as charcoal - especially natural gas which is what I have. And, I agonized over the price of this grill vs the alternatives. As it turns out, it was totally worth it. On the high side, if you light all six burners and let it warm up for a few minutes, the flavorizer bars literally glow red. I can cook a 3/4\" steak 'black and blue' in like 8 minutes. We're doing a lot of sous vide lately and with the sear burner on, this thing puts in nice grill lines brilliantly. On the other end, I was also pleasantly surprised, I like to cook chicken legs and thighs low and slow, set the temp low enough that they take like 45 minutes to cook and they come out juicy and nice. Previous grills could barely set low enough for this. I was surprised to discover that this grill, will all burners set on lowest heat is not warm enough to slow cook chicken.\n\nThe specs imply that this grill is very heavy and might be difficult to have delivered or difficult to assemble. Ours was delivered by a truck with a lift gate but the guys were in too big a hurry to use the lift gate and then they dropped it! Luckily, it comes well packed and there was no damage. They set it behind the front gate so it was not visible from the street. That evening, my son and I were able to easily carry the main part of it through the house and out to it's proper place. We then carried all of the other pieces out as we assembled it. It took about 45 minutes to assemble, but we're really handy, ymmv. We already had a natural gas connection but the quick connect on it was not the right one. This grill comes with both halves of the quick connect, so a couple wrenches, a few minutes, and a little thread sealer and we were cooking.Read more 6 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse yarnpig5.0 out of 5 stars So glad we selected this Weber grillReviewed in the United States on July 20, 2017Style: Natural GasVerified Purchase A wonderful grill, we are thrilled with it. It was delivered as promised, the driver was gracious enough to place it where we wanted it. What a break for us as seniors. We ordered the set up service but had to find our own set-up service as we live in a small city but Amazon Customer Service kept in close contact with us, almost daily in fact, to see progress was being made. Special thanks to Robert E. in Customer Service who became our new best friend. We were generously compensated for our troubles.\nWe are now looking forward to the time to learn to use the new grill. Just ordered the grill cover to go with it and it looks splendid on our patio. Wish we had chose Weber 20 years ago instead of the pricier one we had. This one should last that long. We highly recommend ordering this grill from Amazon.Read more 7 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Nick G5.0 out of 5 stars Beautiful well made grillReviewed in the United States on October 11, 2015Style: Liquid PropaneVerified Purchase Love it. Slept on the couch for about a week once my wife figured out how much I paid for this barbecue grill.

From exclusive features to the highest level of performance, these babies will make even seasoned grillers blush.\n\nWEBER'S ORIGINAL GAS GRILLING SYSTEM\nNotice how sturdy the shroud feels as it opens smoothly on its hinges? See how the burners roar to life on the very first try? Delighted by how simple it is to achieve a mouthwatering meal every time? It's no accident. Weber spends countless hours perfecting the grilling systems on its gas grills, assuring easy assembly, an evenly heated cooking surface, and precision controls so you can tone things down or up to the perfect heat level for direct or indirect cooking.\n\nCOOKBOX AND SHROUD\nThe cookbox houses the components of the cooking system: cooking grates, burner tubes, Favorizer Bars, and the grease management system.\n\nMade of cast aluminum, Weber's gas-grill cookboxes are durable, efficient, require minimal care and maintenance, and can withstand the heat needed to grill at any temperature. In addition, the shape of the cookbox, when combined with the shroud, allows for the proper circulation of heat around food for even cooking whether you're using direct or indirect heat.\n\nCOOKING GRATES\nWeber gas-grill cooking grates come in three exceptional materials: porcelain-enameled steel, stainless steel, and porcelain-enameled cast-iron. Each type retains heat evenly and sears food beautifully. Porcelain-enameled steel cooking grates are durable and easy to clean. Stainless steel rod cooking grates make lovely sear marks, hold heat very well, and clean up with ease. Porcelain-enameled cast-iron cooking grates combine the ease of porcelain-enameled with the superior heat retention of cast-iron--no need to season and easy to clean.\n\nBURNER TUBES\nWeber's burners are made of high-grade stainless steel, which will stand up to the small amounts of water found in liquid propane and natural gas. The burner tubes are made of a singular piece of steel with no welds, making them stronger and more resistant to rust and burn-through. And while they are protected from grease drippings and food by the Flavorizer bars, Weber cart gas grill burner tubes can be cleaned easily by gently brushing with a Weber stainless-steel grill brush.\n\nControls for each burner give you the ability to grill by the direct or indirect method. Even more, the burners are spaced to provide heat across the entire cooking grate, and the burner valves have infinite control settings, so you can fine-tune the heat levels. \n\nFLAVORIZER BARS\nThe innovative Flavorizer bar system, originally created by Weber, is designed perfectly to perform a variety of functions on the Spirit , Summit, and Summit gas grills.
