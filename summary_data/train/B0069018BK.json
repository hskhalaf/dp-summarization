All the guys in my club paid $100's of dollars for their equipment and when they saw what I bought for the money, they were impressed. So much so, that I'm fairly sure I've sold a couple more of these just by default. GREAT harness. Also, being a small woman, I bought the small. Fits perfectly. I'm looking forward to using this thing for many years to come.",
