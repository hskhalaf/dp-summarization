They may be easier on your butt to sit on, but the thickness of the pad raises the sitting position, while back of the chair are same height as the ones (Samsonite) that don't have padding, making the back supporting position much lower. They are not comfortable to sit on and don't provide enough back support.",

Nobody had any problems or discomfort being seated in them. The padding is cozy and ample. If you got a set with bad padding, you should contact the company who sells them because you likely got a faulty chair. Great product, good price, I will likely order more in the future.",

The backrest is quite low, and the seat feels shallow - not deep enough to feel fully \"planted\" in the seat. I'm a 5' 10\", 145 pound male and would prefer a chair about 20% larger overall. The chair's finish is textured, paint quality is very good, and the seat cushion very comfortable - just a bit too small.",

The chairs are sturdy, the cushion is very cushiony, and the pattern and color of the fabric was great. While I did give the chair a five, because overall it's well made - the back seems shorter than most metal folding chairs I've come across. I do have a long torso, but it still hits me further below the shoulder blades than is really comfortable.... but while doing crafts I'm rarely bent back.. and usually \"hunched\" forward :) Nonetheless, I was very happy with the purchase. Thanks!",

The chairs are very sturdy and can accomodate a larger-sized or heavier weight individual without worry.",
