But when you recieve them they will not say 100 % cotton anywhere they just simply say Egyptian cotton.",

I was not going to pay for a replacement Ralph Lauren, even if I could have found one. There on amazon I found this single sheet available for purchase. Is it as nice as the Ralph Lauren? Not quite, but almost. But then the expensive Ralph Lauren tore, didn't it. This is a good quality sheet and for the price you could not do better. It has deep side pockets, stays in place, and feels good next to the body. Glad I made this purchase.",

Fits extra-deep pockets while maintaining a snug fit and clean look. Elastic around the entire edge of sheet. This is an excellent sheet for the price. Please know 200 count sheets can be quite soft as it's the length of the threads rather than the count that makes fabric feel soft and substantial.",

I washed the sheet immediately and you could tell it was not going to soften up over time and it has a very thin almost paper like feel to it. Then there is the issue of breathability - there is none. I was a very uncomfortable couple of hours of sleep before I took the sheet off altogether. I do not recommend this product.",
