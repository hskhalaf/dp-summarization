First time, things came loose so figured I'd take the blame for that. 2nd time out, the whole thing stopped working all together. Relay seems to still be good, everything is hooked up right. My only guess at this point is the motor burned up. DO NOT BUY. Friends have harbor freight winches that work just the same if not better for half the price",

Came with everything you need for a clean install and more than enough wiring. Just be sure to order the model specific mounting plate for your atv or side by side as this will simplify installation. I went with the KFI mount. Overall the winch is a great value. It is well made and operates extremely quiet. Very happy with this purchase and couldn't beat the price! Thanks Amazon",

This winch is powerful I used it to free my atv from a mud hole that I was high centered in and tried to pull up some bushes in the yard with it and it pulled the atv with front and back brakes firmly applied. I am impressed with the quality of this product from the couple of times I have used to.",

The installation on a 2009 Yamaha Grizzly is a bit of a pain, as I had to custom-make a bracket to make the solenoid fit inside the battery cover. I also had to cut the extremely long power leads, but that wasn't the end of the world either, you just have to know how to solder on some new ends. I'm pretty happy with this purchase and it's what I wanted. Time will tell if the winch lasts as long as I hope it does!",
