I finally came across phat 5.5 rosacea wash and cream and it is the only thing that works. And it works very, very well. Not only is it efficacious, but it is cruelty free and vegan, which makes me very happy. I have also tried their shampoo and conditioner. It is a truly wonderful and effective product line.",
