      "text": "Pretty good, and makes it easy to shave my back. I find it struggles in some areas, and the blades get clogged without being able to really clean them out due to the nature of how they're mounted (to protect your skin). Still, WAY easier than how I used to try to get the hair off my back. Worst area is around my shoulder blades where it struggles to get the hair off, and is most likely to take skin off, too. I can easily reach that area with a traditional facial razor, which works much better.",

      "text": "I bought this product without much expectation to be honest, I want it something to shave my back hair myself without asking someone to help me. I purchased the regular BAKblade 2.0 withe the 2 blades, not the BAKblade 2.0 Elite which I think is enough to get the job done. I shaved my whole back in about 2 to 3 minutes, I only have to re-shave once a week to maintain it. Not sure what is the evolutionary purpose of men back hair is for, but this product is certainly very helpful for personal grooming. Yes, I would recommend this product to men with hairy back.",

Because it never fails; I would be in a hurry and he would always ask me to knock down the hair on his back. He would want to shave his back before going to a pool party, or to a sports club locker room. He began using the Bckblade, and he loves it. Very easy to use. It\u2019s easy to change out the blades. So my gag gift turned out to be the best gift!",

It's fairly easy to use, you just need to get the exact angle for best results. I personally can't use it dry without getting a rash but with shaving cream or liquid shower soap it's fine. As far as ergonomics, the problem is it slipped out of my hand and dropped to the tile floor of the shower and shattered so now the blades won't stay in place.",

Firstly, it isn\u2019t long enough to get all your back. It also cuts and scrapes your skin as you shave. And the most disappointing aspect of this product are the blades. They are literally useless and dull after one shave. JUST ONE! It becomes completely dull. I\u2019m not going to spend 10-15 dollars every couple weeks on the blades. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this product.",

I am a hairy guy, but the Bakblade 2.0 allowed me to get back to smooth skin in just a couple of minutes. My wife appreciates a wrll groomed husband, and this made it easy. My only caution is to got slow for the first few swipes as it is sharp and I got a couple small knicks as I went a little too fast, but nothing serious.",

On my skin, the blades work perfectly. I would recommend already having your back relatively shaved first, and then using the Bakblade 2 or 3 times a week after that. Great! Update 15 months later: At about the 8-month mark the blade holder broke and I used a twist tie to hold it together. Now the major hinge broke, and it's just about unusable. we The thing works great, but it's just not very sturdy.",
