      "title": "Equivalent to Graston brand quality",
      "text": "I\u2019m a physical therapist and this is equivalent to similar handlebar tool from Graston kit. The weight of the tool and shape of the edge are perfect for instrument assisted soft tissue mobilization. It\u2019s also easy and safe enough to educate patients to use on themselves without causing fatigue or aching of the hands. Very happy to have a high quality tool that didn\u2019t require the purchase of a $2500 set! It\u2019s still not a terribly cheap instrument but heavy duty, heavy weighted steel instruments that are quality enough to use in a clinic are rarely this cheap either! Worth the price tag",

It feels comfortable in hand and will work great on larger muscle groups like ITB, Hamstrings and quad. group, gastric and back. Hopefully I can use it on upper traps but it may be a bit too heavy, large for that area depending on the persons bodyframe for application. I would highly recommend this 4 edges in 1 tool. It also comes in a nice leather case to protect it. I will be ordering more tools for other areas with smaller muscle groups from this brand.",
