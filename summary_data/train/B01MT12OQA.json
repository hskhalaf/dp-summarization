Disconnecting the power adapter or video cables and reconnecting them usually fixed the issue. Eventually the output signals were lost and couldn't be restored. I swapped out power adapters with no luck. So for < $15 it did its job for 2 years. So not a bad value. I am replacing it though with a much higher quality device that includes its own AC power adapter, rather than depending on a USB power source.",

Cables are fine, tried swapping them anyway. Blu ray player is fine, tried swapping that too. Tried a different splitter and things start working again. Conclusion: the NewBEP HDMI Splitter is not working. Don't waste your money or time on this splitter.",
