If I can only get a micro with a rotating turntable, I'll get one for $50 and save my money. Decidely an unhappy customer here.",

Well, it turned out to be an approximate fit once various protrusions and hardware are taken into account; and doesn't match the space. Nor does GE apparently have a model that fits. So I am stuck with it on a counter that could otherwise be used for other things. And one can tell the quality is just not what the previous model offered.",
