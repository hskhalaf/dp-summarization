      "text": "It has a very fast response to changes in PM 2.5 and a well-designed iPhone application. I used a hand vac in another room of my home and instantly the sensor indicates the particle count has moved to the unhealthy range. I have an electrostatic filter in my central HVAC system and this unit can detect when the HVAC blower is on and removing particles vs when the blower is off. With the dangers of air pollution well documented by WHO, this device should be used everyone who wants to have a healthy environment. I had to contact their support organization about a minor issue and they were extremely responsive.",

      "text": "I like the little device and what it tells me. It's not as good as the one from England, but acceptable. The primary trouble is, the battery only lasts until about lunchtime, then it will only come on for about 1 - 2 minutes at a time the rest of the day. I don't know if this is by design or not, but it really sucks. I want to constantly monitor the air I breath, not pull that thing out to check the air and then put it away.",

It has a light on it that indicates the air quality in your vicinity in real time. It also indicates this more precisely on the app, based on PM. Its great to see how the air quality is wherever you go and to make any adjustments (open a window, move work locations) lessen your exposure. Highly recommend!",
