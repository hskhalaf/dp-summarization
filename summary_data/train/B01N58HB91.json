After letting it stand unplugged for 2 hours as instructed in the directions for use, we plugged it in and immediately noticed how quiet it was. We have it in our great room not too far from our recliners, and we cannot hear it at all. It cooled down to the desired 50 F in about 20 minutes. We have it loaded up with our favorite white wines, and the temperature of the one bottle we've opened so far was perfect. Could not be more pleased!!",
