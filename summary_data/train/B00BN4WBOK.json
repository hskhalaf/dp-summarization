But this coffee makes weak and terrible tasting cold brew. Comes out a light brown water, and that's after over 48 hours of brewing. I've been making cold brews for almost 2 years, so the ratios of coffee to water were all correct. Do yourself a favor. Get Starbucks Ethiopia and have them grind it on \"french press\" (the coarsest setting they offer). It makes an excellent cold brew.",

Perhaps they use a different process to grind it and there are finer grounds within it which leave the residue behind.",

One of the reasons this is a great choice is because it's a coarse ground. That's the best type to use for cold brewing so that you don't block up a mesh filter (if using one.) This in a Hario or Takeya is really the perfect fit. Leave the grounds in there maybe 18-24 hours, pour over ice and enjoy. Many people like to dilute it with water, but I say no to that for a coffee as strong as the day ahead. :)",

Works well with my cold brew coffee maker. I had no issues with grounds leaking into the coffee, it was the perfect ground size. I will definitely be buying again, much better than any other cold brew I'd have and in the long run its much less expensive than buying from a fast food coffee place.",

This produces a concentrate that I dilute with an equal part milk when drinking. I find that some very fine grounds escape the infuser and end up in the bottom of my pitcher; however, I consider that unavoidable with my current setup, and I just take care not to disturb the contents at the bottom.",

    "description": "Tiny Footprint Coffee, the world\u2019s first carbon negative coffee. Through a unique collaboration between Roastery 7 and the Mindo Cloudforest Foundation, one an Artisan coffee roastery and the other a nonprofit conservation organization, the two teamed up to create the ultimate combination of good karma. So, how is our coffee carbon negative you might ask? It\u2019s simple, really. It takes 4 lbs. of CO2 to produce and distribute 1 lb. of our coffee. For every pound that\u2019s sold, we donate a portion of the proceeds to fund reforestation in Ecuador\u2019s Mindo cloud forest. Over time, these trees will remove 54 lbs. of CO2 from the atmosphere. You see? More CO2 removed than emitted. Our reforestation efforts along the Northwestern Andes of Ecuador help to plant native tree species throughout the Mindo Cloud Forest region in heavily deforested areas. These trees not only sequester massive amounts of carbon from the air, but also provide habitat to hundreds of local bird species, reinforce soil conservation techniques, and rebuild water tables. The Mindo Cloudforest Foundation works directly with local landowners to provide jobs related to the care and redevelopment of the cloud forest. Making coffee great takes time, effort and passion. At Tiny Footprint Coffee, we pour endless hours into sourcing the finest, sustainably-grown Arabica coffee beans from around the world. Beans that are not only shade-grown, but also organic certified, and most often fair-trade or Rain Forest Alliance certified. We also purchase coffee from small, family-owned farms that are not fair-trade eligible, yet grow some of the most beautiful, best tasting coffees on the planet. We do all of the roasting and training from our roastery in Minneapolis, MN where we\u2019re working hard to make the entire roastery carbon negative \u2013 from fully bio-degradable coffee bags, high-efficiency lighting and fuel-efficient ribbon burners on our roaster, to composting coffee grounds and reducing waste around the shop.",
