No matter what was done to stabilize them, they kept twisting forward and falling off the rim. Now it is too late to return it. Save your $35.00... find a different contraption.",

The only problem is that the arms that give so much support also really restrict your arm movement. It was so aggravating that we took off one of the arms to allow arm movement. In our case that didn't pose a problem because I've got grab bars mounted to the wall.",
