It doesn't close tightly because of the mounted scope on the xbow; the strap that holds the two sides is too long; the latches are cheap and tend to fall off easily at times, but not break and the foam pads fall out. After some minor adjustments like taking a heat gun to the top to make it close properly; shortening the strap; and glueing the foam pieces in place, it seems to be working out ok. In hindsight, we should have just taken his xbow to a store that sells this case to see how it fitted before purchasing this one ( which is a lot cheaper on Amazon.com).",
