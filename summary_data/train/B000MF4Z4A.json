      "text": "I have owned the A460 for some time now and have no complaints. I purchased it for under $100.00 from Amazon so have no complaints. I needed a general-purpose camera to take fishing and on metal detecting outings and the camera has worked great it both situations. I took this camera and two sets of rechargeable batteries on a two-month business trip to Japan, Singapore and Diego Garcia and it did an excellent job. The only complaint I have is it is a little bulky but nothing I cannot live with. I use other larger cameras for low light work so that was not an issue for me.",

It can handle up to a 2gig SD card, so she has lots of room for the cruise her grandma is taking her on this summer. If we had to do it again, we would probably move up a notch, to get better video. But in her case, as fast as video eats memory, maybe we did the right thing after all. Bottom line, it's great for the money, and Amazon's price beat almost everyone else out.",

      "text": "I've been very happy with my camera so far. It has a distinct improvement over my Kodak EasyShare in how it handles lighting (there's a specific setting for indoors, which works great). It powers up quickly, takes crisp photos, has good color quality, and includes a lot of specialized features for what is essentially a point-and-shoot. The only drawback is that the navigation system isn't always intuitive, which can create problems for people who only need (or can only use) a simple design, but unfamiliarity can be overcome with practice. And since it allows them to include so many specialized shooting modes, I think it's a fair trade.",
