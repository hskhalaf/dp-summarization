I had a gas chainsaw previously and I'll tell you that not having to worry about gas and yearly maintenance will be such a relief! This product was ready to go right out of the box! All you have to do is add the oil. Glad I also read the reviews on Amazon before I bought it too to make sure I was getting the correct chainsaw for my needs. This chainsaw works well, is very light-weight and I didn't have to worry about the electric extension cord ever getting in my way! A great product to have!",
