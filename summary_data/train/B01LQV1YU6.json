They almost had me as a loyal customer unfortunately I would never buy an Asus again.",

I had a Samsung Galaxy once, but why spend the extra $300-$400 on something that you drop and break, or simply just goes sideways after 2 years max. Cellphones have become insanely expensive. People used to choke on the cost for a new laptop, but these are even higher in price and they generally don't even last half the time of a decent laptop. This device is perfectly well rounded. It takes great pictures is fast and does anything most people would want it to do. And it looks just as sharp as many of the flagship phones out there. Think about it.",

AMOLED screen is absolutely beautiful. Another thing is the camera is also a bummer. The image is not as sharp as I would like. The size of the images are huge but the quality was not that good. I was comparing to its previous generation. Again, the hardware is awesone for this phone but the software is dragging the overall performance.",

Two months and they refused to acknowledge that the phone is defective. I don't have $500 to throw away on a garbage product and even worse customer service.

      "text": "Not sure with the antenna on ASUS ZenFone 3 or jus the handset I received. I still have my Samsung J7. Both of my phones have the same service provider. However, my Samsung J7 shows a full 5 bars signal while the ASUS ZenFone 3 only shows 2 or 3 bars. The signal might be the issue but sending attachment through text does not go through on the ASUS ZenFone 3 while I have no problem with my Samsung J7. So I now revert back to my old Samsung J7 and using the ASUS ZenFone 3 as a camera. :-( Again... Not sure if it is my handset that is not good or all of the ASUS ZenFone 3.",
