He entertains himself by knocking it down the stairs, goes to get it, runs back up, and does it again.

I have a KONG RUBBER you similar to this one I bought when my dog was 2 months old, he's now over a year old and the toy is still like new!! When it comes to KONG'S rubber toys... Honestly folks..there's not one thing I can say that I dislike about the product or products period. They are made JUST RIGHT!! #KONG #AMAZON",

He can crack a tennis ball in half in less than a minute so I was looking for a good strong ball that he also couldn't destroy. This is it but he lost interest pretty quickly (probably because it's not fun if he can't destroy it). It's very heavy weighted. Could easily put a hole in your wall if you throw it hard. Great ball though, wish my dog still used it.",

He is a very enthusiastic chewer, and finds more joy in the destruction of an item than the chewing of it. For this reason, he has lost some interest in this ball, because it is still in one piece. =D I am really impressed, the teeth marks are minimal, the ball is sturdy, and he hasn't been able to tear any chunks off of it at all. I also purchased the tire, bone, and large kong treat dispenser, and they have held up just as well. The bone is definitely his favorite for playing tug of war.",

      "text": "Our \"aggressive chewer\" was eating every tennis ball we bought despite his begging to play fetch all the time. So I found this and it's been a money saver! It is a bit of a cannon ball though and knocked out a few of our fence boards that needed replacing anyway, lol! But with an adjustment to throwing differently and using the amazing bounce this has, it's been great. He catapults himself into the air to catch this thing and absolutely LOVES it. Highly recommended for similar situations.",

This guy is gentle, but when it's time to chew, he needs something durable-- I've watched him disassemble braided rope toys so they look like mops and he can bite a tennis ball in half within minutes. I needed something durable enough for his jaw that was safe from being swallowed. He went nuts just for the smell of the new rubber and loves how much he can throw the ball (more than the regular XL Kong we already have). Put a bit of peanut butter inside and he stays engaged for 30-40 minutes easily.",

I don't really think this is much different than the original Kong; it's kind of heavy so I wouldn't play catch with her using this (tennis ball works better), but it's tough and great for stuffing.
