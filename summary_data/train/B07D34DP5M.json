This problem has been addressed in the veikk osu tablet community but has yet to be solved even in the latest driver. To add, this tablet is really for osu! beginners as the configuration makes it very hard to improve. If you wanna draw and drag, this tablet is good but for hovering, especially if that's your preference, i wouldn't recommend.",

Cons: -Set up can take a while since you have to get rid of previous tablet drivers. -No buttons on the tablet itself. -Tablet itself is a little bit small, so large brush strokes aren't recommended. Overall: A very good starter tablet, or tablet for someone who only wants it for games like Osu!. Other than getting a little confused as to how to actually set it up, I didn't experience any issues with it. And it draws well, without latency or any weird skipping around the screen (like some tablets I've used before).",
