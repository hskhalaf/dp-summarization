It recognizes it as a portable media device named \"Nexus 5X\" but says the device is empty. It does charge the phone. However, this is useless to me. UPDATE: I left my phone connected for to the PC for about an hour today and went to check on a phone notification with the pull-down and found a 5-item menu for the USB connection. The third choice was \"Transfer Files\". I really wish I'd discovered this sooner. I've had this cable for a month, but now, all is well.",

Update: Also worth noting that this charger does not fit into my phone when the phone is in its case, which I got from Carved. The rubber around the insert is bigger than on the official google brand cable, and so cases that are designed to fit the google brand cable may have openings that are too small for this cable.",
