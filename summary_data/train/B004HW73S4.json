      "text": "I LOVE this camera. I had wanted something similar to my go-to, workhorse CANON Power Shot A550 because of the intuitive logic of it, VIEW FINDER, use of AA find-anywhere-batteries and terrific quality photos and video. I just put this smaller, sleeker Canon through its paces and I am SOOOOOO happy with it. (and Ebazon, the dealer I got it from really went above and beyond to provide the advice and assistance that moved me from a previous purchase to this totally perfect one. So.....I guess my husband can inherit my 550 now cause I'M GOOD TO GO! (oh did I mention what a terrific price for this quality it was)",

      "text": "Pros: uses AA batteries. This is a major plus for me. Cons: like most compact point-and-shoots, the sensor is small so it is not good in low light. For any camera there is a trade-off between ISO (higher gain=more sensor noise) vs exposure time (longer=more blur). This particular camera is aggressive to pick higher ISO over longer exposure . So with fully automatic settings, in low light you'll get a lot of color noise. The key to taking decent pictures with this camera is to manually set it to ISO 200 and you will do as well as possible. If you hold it steady you can get still a good picture in low light. Overall, a pretty average point-and-shoot.",

      "text": "I wanted a nice but relatively inexpensive digital camera that used AA batteries and SD cards. AA batteries as they're easy to buy and replace and SD cards as I have a bunch of them already. It takes good pictures, up to 4\"x6\" I'd say. Flash seems basic (good for about 15 feet indoors depending on existing lighting). Battery life has been OK so far, no worse than any other AA based digital camera. I like that I can change some of the settings (i.e. resolution) so the JPEGs aren't so big. The kids were filling the digital cards quickly until I rolled back some of the settings. It's been working fine.",

This A1200 is better than the later models, as it has a knob on top to do settings rather than going through a software menu. Photo quality is fine. It also has a real viewfinder, even though its small. We use some three dozen of these over the years, and the Canon quality comes through. Very few failures, even with staff that misstreats them. I hope thse will continue to be available.",

While these do not last as long on a charge as a proprietary battery would, you can buy them anywhere, and if you are caught half way through the day with low batteries, you can duck into a store anywhere in the world and buy a fresh set.",

Not an SLR substitute, but you can stuff it in your pocket and get decent shots from moderate wide-angle to moderate telephoto, which is kinda what you should be looking for at this size and price point.",

I purchased this camera primarily to take advantage of 720p24 video with a relatively high data rate (higher than most). You'd never know it, though. The video is so-so at best. I never planned to use this camera for snapshots, but if this is your purpose, you'll like this camera even less than I do.

    "description": "Color:BlackCanon PowerShot A1200 12.1 MP Digital Still Camera with 4x Wide-Angle Optical Zoom(Black)\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nIt\u2019s Your Choice: LCD or Optical Viewfinder.\nAn Optical Viewfinder makes capturing images simple and easy.\n\n\nWThe PowerShot A1200 digital camera gives you a choice that\u2019s getting increasingly hard to find on digital cameras today. It\u2019s equipped with an Optical Viewfinder in addition to the LCD screen. Many photographers prefer this classic, familiar option that lets you simply hold the camera to your eye and shoot.\nThe camera\u2019s big, bright LCD screen gives you a wealth of important information about the shot. However, using it to compose and focus requires that you hold the camera away from your body. Many people do this with one hand, arms away from the body, effectively creating camera shake that can distort a shot. Using the Optical Viewfinder helps ensure that the camera is held steady.\nThe great thing is that from shot to shot, whether you use the Optical Viewfinder or LCD screen is your choice. \n\n\n\n\nEverything\u2019s Easy.\nSmart AUTO intelligently selects the proper settings for the camera based on 32 predefined shooting situations.\nJust set the Canon PowerShot A1200 digital camera to Smart AUTO and you're ready for maximum enjoyment from your picture-taking every time.

Since AA-size batteries can be purchased at any store, simply get new ones locally.\n\nShoot without Distractions.\nNew scene mode: Discreet Mode disables the sound, flash and AF beam so you can still capture images in quiet areas.\nHow many times have you found yourself in a situation where you wanted to take a picture, but were reluctant (or simply not allowed) to disrupt the setting with noise or flash? New Discreet Mode makes picture-taking possible in museums, at performances, anywhere light and sound would not be welcome. Simply turn the mode dial to Discreet, and the camera\u2019s sound, flash and AF assist beam will be disabled \u2013 without changing any other settings. If the camera senses low light, ISO speed will be automatically raised to get the best possible shot. You can even switch to playback mode to review still images or video, and the camera will remain muted.\n\n\n\n\nPhotographic Artistry That\u2019s Easy for Anyone\nCreative Filters offers fun and artistic ways to capture photos.\nCreative Filters Mode gives you lots of fun, easy ways to make your photography more creative. The camera does all the work \u2013 you simply choose an effect and shoot!\nFisheye Effect imparts a fun, familiar curvilinear distortion to your image that\u2019s ideal for kids and pets. Miniature Effect plays with perspective, giving any shot the look of a world created in much smaller proportions \u2013 great for landscapes and city shots. When you shoot in Toy Camera Effect, you get the vintage effect of a first-generation camera, ideal for giving portraits a slightly distorted, unevenly saturated look of a picture you\u2019d come across in your attic. Monochrome lends a moody beauty to your photography, producing shots in Black & White, Sepia or Blue. Super Vivid saturates colors to heighten the intensity and impact of any shot. Poster Effect takes away transitions between objects in the frame to give your image the high-impact look of a hand-painted poster.\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the Image on a Big Screen.\nLarge, clear 2.7-inch LCD makes taking and viewing images a breeze.\nThe PowerShot A1200 digital camera has a large 2.7-inch LCD screen that gives you the big picture, whether you're shooting, reviewing or showing off your images. This high-resolution screen offers a crisp, clear and bright picture. It also features Night Display for easy viewing in low light.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.7-inch LCD Screen",
