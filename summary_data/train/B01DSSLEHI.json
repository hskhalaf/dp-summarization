Easy set up and it's up and running just as soon as plugged in. Large non-glare screen.is an attractive component. Keyboard is Dell's standard cheapo but it does the job and it's nice to have it and the mouse wireless. It comes with surprisingly good and long in-your-house hardware warranty but there is no software support offered by Dell on computers not sold by them directly. Don't be put off by things you've heard about Windows 10; in fact, it's a good operating system and not difficult to learn.",

I couldn't believe it so I checked the ad for this on Amazon and seller claims we get full I year warranty. Not so much. Amazon is taking it back and gave me a 30 dollar certificate for my trouble.

      "text": "Don't believe what you see in the picture. The keyboard and mouse that come with this piece of crap computer are not wireless. Totally false advertising! Also, the clock does not sinc with the local time and there is no \"change the time\" option on the clock/calendar. I swore I would never buy another Dell product after my very disappointing laptop experience with them years ago and the crappy Dell laptop I just got rid of at work but because there were so many good reviews, I decided to go ahead and give them another chance. What a big $600+ mistake I have made! Dell really sucks!",

I have nothing but good things to say about this Dell. It is excellent for what I need it for. I don't need or do gaming, so that is not an issue for me. As other reviewers have said, I highly recommend this PC if you don't need gaming. And the price is reasonable.",
