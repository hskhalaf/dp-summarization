Luckily I was smoking chicken wings and didn't need a long smoke. With these shavings, I would have been refilling the chamber every ten to fifteen minutes tops.",

There's enough sawdust here to do about two smokes from each bucket if you're using the four hour rule (add wood every hour for four hours) and filling up the hopper. There's good variety. I think the flavors could be a bit stronger since the wood is kiln dried and not sappy in the least - so it's got good smoke flavor but it's all sort of the same. If you want smoke flavor and you're not looking for hugely forward \"cherry\" flavor, for instance, these are great!",

Well, I am beyond happy with the way these Smoker chips (really fine, fine, fine shavings) performed and the delectable FLAVOR they imparted to my Wild Alaskan Sockeye salmon could NOT have been better.
