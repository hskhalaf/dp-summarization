      "text": "This is a wonderful concept, but..... From 15 feet away can't read date if you need glasses But more importantly this clock didn't keep time. The longer I let them run without resetting, the more the time became incorrect. After 2 weeks of not resetting, I have one running 15 minutes fast and the other 10 minutes slow. As the whole idea of a clock is to tell accurate time, these are useless. May have been a bad lot, but I'm reluctant to reorder Sending them back",

I bought the 2-pack and regularly use both of them for checking the date/day etc. They do not auto-adjust for time changes so that is manual. They also gain/lose about 1 minute per month so every time I change them for season time changes I also make the adjustment on the time. Easy to read day or night. I had a friend comment on how much he liked as well. I paid a hundred bucks for these two - seems a bit overpriced for the materials involved but I still like them. I like the looks of the walnut colors even though they are plastic.",

      "text": "It is cruel to sale a clock that cannot keep time! I purchased this clock in July 2018. It does not claim to be an accurate precision time piece, nor is it time updated atomically. With that said, it first started losing a minute or so a couple of months. My microwave keeps better time. Over time, it gradually got worst. A year later, it is loosing 10-minutes a month. My 88-year old mother, for whom I purchased the clock, gets confused as to which clock to follow. Continuity and stability is very important for elderly. Shame on American Lifetime\u00ae for producing such a product marketed for the elderly, specifically those with dementia! SHAME!",

The clock display turns off when disconnected from external power but the internal rechargeable battery retains the memory and settings until power is restored. The only thing that the display lacks is the room temperature. I subsequently ordered three more clocks as gifts for family and friends. The only minor negative I have is that delivery took a day or two longer than predicted.",

They were very easy to adjust and an added bonus to have the choice of stand up or on the wall. I purchased one for myself after seeing how handy they are. I would highly recommend to anyone.",

This adds another layer of complexity, so I do understand. Very satisfied with the product.",
