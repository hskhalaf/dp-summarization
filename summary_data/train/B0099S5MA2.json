It worked fine and I would have happier if I could attach it to the sunshade, so keep the thickness YOUR shade in mind when purchasing. I would recommend the parrot devices that can be installed in the vehicle. Much more hassle free. I passed this item to a friend. This parrot was not for me.",

Battery life should last one to two weeks, less if you use phone more often, of course. I use mine in a convertible and while it's difficult to hear/talk to with the top down, it's easy to unclip and hold it closer. In fact, its portability is one of its best features as sometimes I'll even bring it into the house and use it there too.",

The only other caution I have for prospective buyers is to beware of the thickness of sun shade that this will clamp on to.

Even in this noisy truck the called party can hear me very clearly and the speaker is loud enough for mwe to hear as well.

I do find that background noise can cause it to attempt a call, as well as it doesn't always understand my voice commands for calling or GPS. Overall it is a good device and I would recommend it for wireless Bluetooth users as an alternative to an earpiece.",
