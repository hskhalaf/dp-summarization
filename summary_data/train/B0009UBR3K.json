I was supervising him and was very impressed with the game. He was able to go to the game pound and pick some dogs. He has to take care of them, feed them, walk them and even do to the pet store to purchase food, water and toys. It's a great game. The dogs are adorable but I absolutely love the way it helps teach children responsibility with pet. It's not your normal brain sucking game, there is learning involved in pet care. We love it!",

There is no way to have it plug in to two DS machines and each child have their own dog. We bought a second one for my other daughter. Now they each have their own dog and they can do \"bark mode\" together. They can play with each others dogs and take them to the park. It is cute.",
