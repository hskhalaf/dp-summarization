I love the modern look and neutral colors (it's so hard to find items that aren't hot pink safari themed, etc) but it is still fun and interesting to my little girl. Keep in mind that the orange on the mat is neon- much brighter in person than it looks online. I also love that this mat is so soft compared to others, it makes for even more sensory stimulation for baby.",
