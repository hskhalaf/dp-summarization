After the third move, I had had it with tape! The end always gets lost, you misplace the scissors, etc.. So I started looking for an alternative and found this. This stuff beats tape any day!! Works not only for sealing boxes, but for wrapping paintings/pictures/plaques etc. and no scissors needed! It makes the job easier and so much faster. Worth every penny!",

When you get to the part of unpacking just stretch the wraps a bit and slide them off the box. No marring or damage to the box. The product works well and a roll goes a long way.",
