ALSO only 1 came with the adhesive 3M tape, easy fix though I split the 3M in half and decided to mount it anyways to test it out and avoid the return process. But definitely not satisfied now I have to do the return process anyways. Another thing the labels on the box both are identical, they both say that they\u2019re for PS4, maybe someone placed the wrong item in the wrong box. Who knows.",
