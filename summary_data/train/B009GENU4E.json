I've been hunting for a healthier treat for my cat and the ingredients looked good for this product. Unfortunately my super picky girl won't eat soft treats, so I'll pass these on to her kitty cousin. She did give it a good smell and tested the texture by chewing one, so it must have been appealing otherwise, but she's very picky about texture and this didn't pass her chew test and she spit it out. If this brand sold crunchy treats though I would purchase those to try if the ingredients were like these ones. If your kitty likes soft/chewy treats, this should be a hit.",

I think I could find a treat they like more, but I have no complaints about this one, so it gets 5 stars overall from me. B-plus to A. More treats than I'd expected. Bag should last a little while. They're apparently still palatable after a few spilled ones have been left out overnight, which is a point in their favor.",

These are soft (but not overly moist and not at all wet) treats, about the size of a single pea or so. My cat LOVES them and gobbles them up when we shake the treat bag. I would certainly recommend them to others!",
