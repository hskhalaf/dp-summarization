I've seen a lot of systems and played a lot of games. This game hands-down has the best graphics, some of the most engaging gameplay, and most enjoyable gaming experience I've seen. If I had any complaints I would say that there needed to be a bit more 'gritty' feel to the world for a bit more authenticity, and that there should have been some more secrets, and perhaps a larger superboss to beat ala Ruby Weapon.

But its not perfect some of the dialogue at certain points felt hammy at times and the CQC of the game needed some polish.

The diverse environments that will make you stop and stare, two dozen enemy types to conquer, a variety of weapons to customize and discover, the AWESOME lore to find both in the open world and enclosed areas that reveal the past and explain the present, on top of the surprises in not just the main story, but added in the Frozen Wilds DLC, make this game a must buy for a single-player gamer like me. Oh, and the voice acting is pretty much top notch.",

      "text": "This game has the flavor of the rebooted Tomb Raider series with an immerse linear storyline and an enormous landscape to traverse. The characters are well drawn and enemy AI well done and surprising. As with other recent very large open world games (Tomb Raider, Assassin's Creed, Uncharted) there is a central sense of purpose to the many hours of exploration. The crafting and weapons systems are well done and the graphics outstanding. Highly recommended.",
