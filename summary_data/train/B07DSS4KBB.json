Even though the color on the ottoman is slightly darker than our chairs, it coordinates beautifully. The ottomans are lightweight, yet we have had no problem with the wind blowing them around. You may have to watch the color of frame you are ordering, though, as one site we saw said the frame was a wine/burgundy color and another, black. We bought the black frames which match our patio set frames. Other than that, the ottomans were the same. We recommend them.",
