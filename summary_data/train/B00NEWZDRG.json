The tech hasn't really been updated since it was originally designed and there is no flash-off auto feature, which would have been nice. The other thing that bugs me (and this might be user error) is the auto focus that keeps refocusing when you move the frame so you can't select your focal point and then reframe the shot. Very sturdy, overall good picture quality, but I wouldn't buy it again.",

I've only used 3-4 lenses on it, but mostly stuck with a 35AF. It's a tight shot up close with that one, but if you drop in a larger lens scope, it's good for anything.
