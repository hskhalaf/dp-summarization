Does challenging stuff very well, like Straight No Chaser's a capella version of \"The man who can't be moved.\" I mean, just on that song alone, the bass blew me away. Louder than my ears can handle when sitting at the desk. Price point is perfect. I mean, you get a really good experience, and you don't have to pay an arm & leg. And you get it without a subwoofer. Awesome. Strongly recommend.",

I guess I'm not as picky as some, but I did want speakers with a good sound for movies, videos, music, etc. These turned out to be very good speakers. Would I use them to play music for a large party in my back yard? Probably not. But to play a Celene Dion duet with Andrea Bocelli in my living room (I like to play my music loud).....very nice! I am very pleased with my purchase. Amazon comes through for me again!",

Easy set-up, but the sound quality leaves a lot to be desired - it's all bass :( and you cannot adjust the levels. They put the tweeters on the back, so maybe that contributes to the overriding effect of bass. The picture should have clued me in - it shows the large bass speaker out of proportion to the smaller mid-range and you don't even see the tweeters. I kept them because it was easier than returning them. What the heck - for the office, they're ok.",

    "description": "The Logitech Speaker System Z520. Bring your music to life-at your desk and around the house. Its 360-degree sound helps project audio evenly in all directions, so you get a great listening experience throughout the room. Amplified two-way design realistically reproduces your music, videos and games with clear, natural sound.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nFrom the Manufacturer Now hear this--everything. The Speaker System Z520 transforms your desktop into a room-filling sound experience. Unlike traditional front-firing speakers that focus all the sound only in one direction, Logitech 360-degree sound technology projects sound evenly in all directions. So you hear the full range of sound not just in front of the speakers, but everywhere in the room. High-performance extras like the two-way design (a separate main driver and tweeter in each speaker), deliver detailed lows, mids and highs. 26 watts (RMS) of power let you crank up the volume. There's even a convenient iPod input. So you can turn these self-powered speakers into a standalone system for listening to your favorite tunes in any room.\n\n\n\nHear it all, all around the room, with detailed 360-degree sound\n\nYou don't miss a beat. You want to hear every waling sax note, subtle background vocal and smooth bass line. And you want to hear it all, not just when you're sitting at your computer, but wherever you are in the room. That's a lot to ask from most desktop speakers, with one notable exception. Engineered with Logitech 360-degree sound technology, the Speaker System Z520 delivers powerful full-spectrum sound all around the room. Combined with 26 watts (RMS) of party-volume power and an input for your iPod, you're in for a music experience that ordinary speakers just can't match.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n\nTraditional desktop speakers focus sound in one listening \u201csweet spot\u201d\n\nLogitech 360-degree sound for room-filling audio clarity without dead spots \nA lot of desktop speakers promise a great sound experience. And that's true\u2014as long as you sit in the narrow \u201csweet spot\u201d directly in front of the speakers. But when you move out of that sweet spot, it can sound more like a dead spot. Details drop out. Your music starts to sound muddy. \nLogitech 360-degree speakers project sound evenly in all directions for a full-room sweet spot\n\n\nLogitech solved this audio challenge with 360-degree sound technology. Rather than using only a forward-firing driver, Logitech speakers are acoustically engineered with both forward- and backward-firing drivers. Result? Your whole room becomes a sweet spot. That's because sound is projected and reflected more evenly and over a wider range of space. And high, mid-range and low frequencies hold together. So your music sounds full and crisp, even if you're behind the speakers. \n\nAmplified two-way design for twice the listening pleasure\nMany desktop speakers in this price range use only one driver in each speaker. But each of these Logitech speakers has two separate drivers designed to give you a clearer, richer, more textured listening experience. The main driver delivers warm, natural mid-range and deep bass. The tweeter sings with crisp, clear highs. And dual integrated amplifiers keep every sound in perfect balance.\n\n\n\n\n26 watts deliver powerful party-level volume\nFeel free to crank up the volume. With 26 watts (RMS) of power, you'll have ample sound to wake the neighbors. And high volume doesn't have to mean ear-splitting screeching and crackling. Your music comes across in rich, clear, distortion-free detail, even at volumes loud enough for a Saturday night dance party. \n\n\n\n\nOn-speaker iPod input for quick and easy connectivity\nWhy settle for speakers that only work with your computer? The Speaker System Z520 also works with your iPod or any other MP3 player. Just plug your iPod directly into the speaker input and listen to all your favorite songs in 360-degree room-filling sound. These versatile speakers also make a great standalone system for your iPod. So you can easily add music to any room in your house.\n\n\n\nClutter-free twin speaker design\u2014easy on the eyes and simple to set up\nYou don't have to take up a lot of room on your desk to have a room full of great-sounding music, movies and games. Your new speakers are small enough to fit easily on your desk without occupying much workspace. They're simple to set up, right out of the box. And they're designed to complement the clean, contemporary style of the latest notebooks and monitors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENHANCE YOUR LISTENING EXPERIENCE WITH GREAT LOGITECH PRODUCTS.\n\n\nLogitech Speaker System 523\n\nConnect your 40-watt (RMS) Logitech Speaker System Z523, and rediscover the art of listening.
