Food heats quickly and cooks well, and the quality of the items makes me treat them \"mindfully\" - washing them by hand, heating them up slowly etc. which definitely improves the results of my cooking, as well.",

After less than a dozen scrubs with a soft sponge and some bar keepers friend, the copper sheen will come back and spots will come off but the copper on the outside of one of the pots is starting to wear away.

The cooper really spreads the heat evenly across the pan or pot very well and the handles don't get hot to the touch so you can move them around easily while cooking without the worry of burning yourself. Overall I'm very pleased with this product and would be buying from this brand and company again!",

    "title": "Calphalon Tri-Ply Copper 10 Piece Set, Brown",
    "description": "Size:10-Piece| Color:CooperCalphalon Tri-ply Copper unites centuries-old culinary tradition with premium performance and distinctive style. Brushed copper exterior complements both traditional and contemporary decor. Copper exterior and aluminum inner core combine for superior conductivity and precise cooking control.\n\nAMAZON.COM\nThis set is a wonderful acquisition or gift for gourmet cooks who are just as concerned with the appearance of their cookware as they are with its performance. The set includes all the necessary pieces for a complete kitchen: 8-inch and 10-inch omelet pans, a 3-quart covered saut\u00e9 pan, a 6-quart covered saucepot, and 1-1/2- and 2-1/2-quart covered saucepans.\n\n Part of Calphalon\u2019s premium Tri-Ply Copper line, this brilliant stainless-steel and copper-accented cookware cooks beautifully and looks gorgeous. The pan\u2019s exterior is crafted of copper--the superior metal for heat conduction--while a heavy-gauge aluminum core runs through its center. The combination of these two metals provides more exact control while cooking and excellent end results. The interior is made of 18/10 stainless steel, which is nonreactive to acidic foods and offers a reflective surface that makes it easier to know when foods are completely cooked. This cookware has Calphalon\u2019s patented stainless-steel Cool-V handles that stay cool to the touch on the stovetop and stainless-steel lids that fit snugly onto the pan for a tight seal. All Tri-Ply Copper cookware is oven-safe up to 450 degrees F and is covered by a lifetime warranty. --Cristina Vaamonde \n\n What's in the Box\n8-, 10-inch omelet pans; 3-quart covered saute pan; 1-1/2-, 2-1/2-, and 6-quart covered saucepots\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nIntroducing Calphalon Tri-Ply Copper.\n\nA Classic for Today's Kitchen\n\n Precision crafted to deliver the premium performance you expect from Calphalon cookware, Calphalon Tri-Ply Copper unites centuries-old culinary tradition with distinctive style. Featuring graceful curves and a stunning combination of expertly finished metals, Calphalon Tri-Ply Copper is as beautiful as it is hard-working. It will satisfy your eye for fine design as well as your appetite for fine food.\n\n Each piece of Calphalon Tri-Ply Copper cookware is carefully crafted from three different metals--each with its own special benefit in the kitchen.\n\n Calphalon Tri-Ply Copper cookware's brushed copper exterior not only brings lustrous warmth and classic beauty to your home. It also contributes to the superior conductivity and cooking performance of each pan. (Copper is among nature's best conductors of heat.) Calphalon Tri-Ply Copper pans feature an inner core of pure, heavy-gauge aluminum. Aluminum is another highly conductive metal--and the thicker the aluminum, the more conductive the pan. Together, copper and aluminum guarantee quick searing, beautiful browning and the precise cooking control you need to achieve spectacular results in the kitchen.\n\n Calphalon Tri-Ply Copper cookware's 18/10 stainless steel interior surface is non-reactive. It won't tarnish or change color when you cook acidic foods like tomato sauce. It's also highly reflective. That makes it easy to see inside the pan--to judge color and texture changes that indicate when foods are properly cooked.\n\nTo manufacture Calphalon Tri-Ply Copper cookware, we bond these three metals together under extreme pressure into a single disk. The disk is then expertly drawn into its final shape-a vessel with equally thick walls and bottom, to ensure even heating.\n\nTri-Ply Copper is designed in the same spirit of simple, functional elegance that distinguishes all Calphalon cookware.\n\nGracefully-curved Cool-V long handles stay cool to the touch during stovetop cooking. Clean, unfussy stainless steel covers fit snugly inside the cookware, sealing in heat, moisture and flavor. Flared rims add strength to withstand years of spoon-rapping and cabinet-clashing--and make it easy to pour sauces neatly and safely without drips and splashes.\n\nCaring for copper cookware.\n\nHow you care for your Tri-Ply Copper cookware depends on which look you love.\n\nTo keep your cookware looking bright and shiny, we recommend you use RADIANCE, the Calphalon cookware cleaner specially formulated for copper and stainless steel. RADIANCE is the fast easy way to maintain a spotless \"like-new\" shine.\n\nSome cooks love the natural mellow patina that develops when copper is exposed to heat and air. If you're among them, simply wash your cookware in hot, sudsy water using a dishcloth, sponge or Dobie pad.\n\nAlways wash your pans by hand--never in the dishwasher. (Automatic dishwasher detergents contain harsh chemicals that can permanently discolor copper.) And be sure to dry thoroughly to prevent spots.\n\n \n\n 1. Copper exterior and aluminum inner core combine for superior conductivity and precise cooking control. \n 2. Lustrous brushed copper exterior combines classic and contemporary styling. \n 3. Non-reactive stainless steel interior offers the reflective cooking surface many chefs prefer. It's brushed to maintain its like new appearance through years of daily use. \n 4. Ergonomically designed stainless steel Cool-V long handles stay cool on the stovetop. \n 5. Heavy duty stainless steel rivets secure handles for a lifetime of safe cooking. \n 6. Precision fit stainless steel covers seal in heat and moisture. \n 7. Flared rims are more durable; make pouring neat and easy. \n 8. Oven and broiler safe for maximum versatility in the kitchen. \n 9. Lifetime Warranty \n\nWhat to expect when you cook with copper:\nExposure to heat, air and humidity changes the appearance of copper. You can expect copper cookware to change color when you cook with it. It may turn a deeper orange, pinkish orange, or even develop purple and blue streaks. This is perfectly normal and is not permanent. As your cookware cools, these colors will subside and a warm, mellow patina will result.\n\nThe ideal way to clean copper\n\nSome cooks love the patina that develops when copper is exposed to heat and air. If you're among them, simply wash your cookware in hot, sudsy water using a dishcloth, sponge or Dobie pad.\n\n To restore your copper cookware to its original bright and shiny appearance, we strongly recommend you use RADIANCE, the Calphalon polishing cr\u00e9me specially formulated for copper and stainless steel. Simply wipe RADIANCE on with a sponge or dish-cloth, rinse well and dry thoroughly. (Take care when drying. Any remaining water droplets can cause spots!) RADIANCE is the perfect way to maintain a spotless \"like-new\" shine.\n\nRADIANCE not only returns your cookware to its original luster and color, it also prevents the gradual tarnishing that occurs when copper is exposed to normal household conditions.\n\nThe ultimate cookware/cleaner combination\n\nCalphalon Tri-Ply Copper cookware is subtly brushed to naturally mask fingerprints, tiny scratches and other signs of daily wear. Use RADIANCE along with Calphalon Tri-Ply Copper cookware and you'll experience the ultimate in easy copper maintenance.\n\nOther cleaning methods:\n\n You can also polish copper cookware by making a paste of 1-1/2 cup white vinegar and 2 tablespoons of coarse salt. Apply the paste to the copper surface with a sponge or dishcloth then rinse in hot water. To remove fingerprints and other small blemishes, simply buff your pan with a soft cloth.\n\nSee more",
