      "title": "Canon PowerShot SD890 IS - Plan on replacing it in 2 years",
      "text": "I replaced my Nikon point & shoot with a Canon because I was told the quality was better and the motor that operates the focus and auto zoom were less likely to break, like the Nikon did. I loved my Canon PowerShot SC890 IS until it broke in exactly the same way (and I baby my cameras - never once dropped it or exposed it to weather or sand). I also spent about $100 more for the Canon vs. the Nikon hoping I wasn't buying a disposable camera. I was wrong. It is just an expensive disposable camera. Next one will be a cheap Nikon that I will plan on replacing in a year.",

After 2 or three shots and struggling to get the button to work, it just didn't. The images I were able with the camera were amazingly good - good color balance and detail. But the flimsy on off-switch? Amazon was great and accepted the return no questions asked. Even paid for the postage. Maybe I just got a dud, but I didn't want to make the same mistake again and am getting a different camera instead.",

This is slightly thicker than some of the popular ones out there, but that quality of the photos more than makes up for it. Give it strong consideration when shopping around, it's worth it.",

Its generous 10 megapixel resolution, combined with a sharp zoom lens provides excellent images and accurate colors. My only complaint is the tiny size of the power (on-off) button. Although I have small hands I have great difficulty accessing the button to turn on the camera. To help alleviate this problem I glued onto the button a rectangular piece of plastic to provide a raised surface, and it has proven to be of great help. However, there's no excuse why such an important button should be so inaccessable.",

They tended to come out blurry due to the long exposure and no image stabilization. The Canon PowerShot takes great pictures in low light. It has the image stabilization and very easy way to change shutter speed to optimize the picture. The one negative issue is menu access. Reviewing photos on the camera is not very intuitive. I recommend the Powershot for anyone looking for a basic point and shoot camera.",

Given that the camera itself cost only $100 more, the clearly better option was to buy another camera (and not another PowerShot). I've handled this camera with care and always carried it in a protective case, so the lens error was definitely an inherent design/mechanical problem. A good friend of mine also had a PowerShot (not sure of the model) and the same thing happened. If you only need a camera for a few months, get a PowerShot. Otherwise, look elsewhere.",

The zoom goes to 20x and the motion stabilization means that the pictures are very clear - no blurring due to a bouncing or moving hand. I took snaps in a theater w/o flash and they came out clear and bright. Auto focus processing is about .5 secs. Image storage processing can take about 3 to 5 secs. The battery is good for about 250 pictures. I didn't test for movie duration. I'm very pleased with this camera. My girlfriend bought the SD750 and she is jealous of the pictures my camera takes.",

    "title": "Canon PowerShot SD890IS 10MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom",
    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\n In the PowerShot SD890 IS Digital ELPH, the iconic ELPH style is fully complemented by the latest in digital technology. Beautifully slim and elegantly curved, the SD890 IS Digital ELPH incorporates the most powerful optical zoom in the ELPH line -- a full 5x optical zoom to really expand your photographic options. A 10.0-megapixel CCD heads up a long list of advanced features that not only deliver ultra-impressive image quality, but make the entire experience fun, exciting, and creatively rewarding. \n\nPowerShot SD890IS Highlights \n\nAdvanced 10-megapixel Digital ELPH with curved silhouette design With this camera\u2019s 10.0 megapixels of imaging power, you\u2019ll capture an astonishing level of detail. Enlarge and crop with absolute freedom to create images that not only radiate rich depth and clarity, but fully reflect your creative vision. Owning the PowerShot SD890 IS Digital ELPH is in itself an expression of your creativity. The distinctive and curved silhouette design is rendered in translucent matte silver with a muted gloss for a highly individualistic appeal. \n\n\n\nPowerful 5x optical zoom lens and Optical Image Stabilizer to reduce blur The PowerShot SD890 IS Digital ELPH has the longest optical zoom ever incorporated in an Digital ELPH camera: a full 5x. A zoom this powerful opens up a world of possibilities in your photography, and thanks to innovative Canon engineering, it\u2019s housed in a camera that\u2019s sized to go everywhere with you. With many cameras, hand-held shots taken at the long end of the zoom can be marred by blur. The PowerShot SD890 IS Digital ELPH incorporates Canon\u2019s exclusive Optical Image Stabilizer. The technology detects and effectively cancels camera shake, for clear, sharp images every time. \n\nWith Canon's Face Detection WB (right), skin tones are not affected by overall lighting Improved Face Detection Technology sets the focus, exposure, flash and white balance automatically Canon's powerful Face Detection Technology delivers even better results with the PowerShot SD890 IS Digital ELPH. The Face Detection Technology continues to recognize faces in a scene, and concentrate exposure (daylight or flash) and focus upon them. But the SD890 IS Digital ELPH adds more: Face Detection WB means the camera concentrates upon faces when calculating white balance for the best possible skin tones. Face Select and Track lets the SD890 IS Digital ELPH user highlight one face among several in a scene, and the camera concentrates on that person, even as they move around the scene. Face Detection Technology is a powerful contributing factor in Canon's new Motion Detection Technology. \n\nAnd with 18 Shooting Modes including 11 Special Scene Modes, you\u2019re ready for whatever shot comes your way. \n\nMotion Detection Technology automatically detects subject movement and optimizes exposure control Life doesn\u2019t stand still for picture-taking. That\u2019s why Canon included its advanced Motion Detection Technology in the PowerShot SD890 IS Digital ELPH. This sophisticated feature works in the background to instantly evaluate how fast your subject is moving. Then it automatically selects and sets the optimal exposure and ISO settings to keep everything looking sharp and clear. When you need higher ISOs for action-stopping shutter speeds, Motion Detection Technology provides it. But when no movement is detected, it allows lower ISOs for excellent color and detail. So whether you\u2019re shooting a bride walking down the aisle, a ballet recital or even a child\u2019s soccer game, you can relax and shoot with confidence knowing you\u2019ve got the picture you intended. \n\n2.5-inch PureColor LCD II screen for bright, accurate color and a wide viewing angle The PowerShot SD890 IS Digital ELPH gives you large 2.5-inch LCD screen for excellent control when framing your shots. Canon\u2019s PureColor LCD II offers more spectacular color, resolution and contrast even when viewed at an angle (compared to PureColor LCD). The screen is highly durable and easy to see in any light with a scratch-resistant, anti-reflective coating. It also features Night Display for easy viewing in low light\u2014a perfect feature for gathering friends and family around to see your images. \n\nDIGIC III Image Processor for superior image quality and improved functionality With DIGIC III, your images boast superior quality, the camera operates at top efficiency and battery life is enhanced. What\u2019s more, DIGIC III enables Canon\u2019s Face Detection Technology and Red-eye Correction to give you better, more true-to-life people shots. Simply press the Shutter Button halfway down, and the camera automatically pinpoints the faces in the scene and chooses the ideal focus point. The camera controls exposure settings and flash to keep every face looking bright and natural. Red-eye Correction can be handled in-camera, in two ways. The entirely new Red-eye Correction during shooting uses the Face Detection Technology to recognize and remove red-eye from flash images as they're taken, before the file is written to the memory card. It's also possible to correct red-eye during image playback, using simple settings in the PowerShot SD890 IS Digital ELPH's menu. \n\niSAPS Technology is an entirely original scene-recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos, iSAPS works with the fast DIGIC III Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy, as well as exposure and white balance. \n\nRed-eye Correction provides three options for removing red-eye from subjects in flash pictures.\n1) The new Red-eye Correction during shooting actually identifies and corrects red-eye in human subjects as pictures are taken. \n2) The SD890 IS Digital ELPH can be set to automatically detect and correct red-eye during image playback.\n3) The user can manually locate any red eyes in a scene during image playback on the LCD screen, and command the camera to remove them. \n\nThe PowerShot SD890 IS Digital ELPH also features ISO 1600 and High ISO Auto settings that reduce the effects of camera shake and sharpen subjects in low-light situations, giving you greater shooting flexibility. \n\nPrint/Share Button for easy direct printing and downloading The PowerShot SD890 IS Digital ELPH's Print/Share button makes direct printing easier than ever. Simply connect the SD890 IS Digital ELPH to a Canon PIXMA photo printer or SELPHY compact photo printer or any PictBridge compatible photo printer, press the lighted Print/Share button and print! Also use the Print/Share button to transfer images to a computer (Windows and Macintosh). \n\nPrint your own ID photos in up to 28 different sizes or use the Movie Print function to output multiple stills from a recorded movie on a single sheet with a Canon SELPHY compact photo printer. \n\nWhat's in the box \n\nPowerShot SD890 IS Digital ELPH body, Lithium-ion Battery Pack NB-5L,Battery Charger CB-2LX, SD Memory Card SDC-32M, Wrist Strap WS-DC2, Digital Camera Solution CD-ROM, USB Interface Cable IFC-400PCU, AV Cable AVC-DC400",
