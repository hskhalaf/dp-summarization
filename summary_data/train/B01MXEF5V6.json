My 16 year old dachshund was diagnosed with IVDD and had trouble balancing while walking. I was hoping that the wheelchair would make taking potty breaks a little bit easier. After setting it up and getting him into his harness/vest, I noticed that the wheel chair was too heavy for him to walk with so I decided to return it. Be aware that you will not receive a full refund if you open and try on the product. I, unfortunately, only received 68% of my money back due to the fact that I opened and set the wheelchair up.",

We have 2 special needs pups so we waited on the second chair till we tested the first to see if it worked out.

Everyday we are able to walk a little further, and Ziggy enjoys being out and able to smell the squirrels in the neighborhood.",
