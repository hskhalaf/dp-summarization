It is sturdy and stable for hanging light-weight backdrops. It is small diameter tubular metal, so when fully extended would not be adequate to hold heavy materials as it would likely bow in the middle. It is a nice bonus that the carry case, bag weights, and clamps are included with the stand instead of having to purchase separately. The connectors, fasteners, and pole clamps are lightweight plastic, so this stand is probably not recommended for heavy-duty, frequent, professional use. This unit met my expectations and fit my needs perfectly, so I would recommend it to others.",

Nothing could have been further from the truth with mine; I had it assembled within fifteen minutes out of the packaging without even glancing at the instruction sheet!

It stays up unless you actually forcefully knock into it. It folds up nicely into the travel bag and assembles pretty quickly. I'd definitely recommend it for a DIY project like ours, but if you're doing a pro photoshoot, you may need to upgrade a bit.",

The width adjustment is easy, you basically just pull/push the bars across. It\u2019s fairly stable - the legs can be opened/closed a good amount. The sandbags are a nice extra. In addition to using this as a photo backdrop, I use it to hold the screen for my mini projector. I use the included clamps and a set of shower curtain hooks to pull the screen tight. No issues.",

The materials- and bars especially- feel flimsy and easily bent/ broken, and it takes two people to assemble the top part; otherwise it will take you a lot longer to get it up and the background sheet in place. So, if you're going to use this for doing self-tape auditions in your home or studio, make sure you have a lot of extra time to set it up.",

Works perfectly. And the results look professional. Including the sandbags indicates that this vendor has thought out the system and the real needs of a background support system. The construction is sold and the price is right. I recommend this background support system.",

He did have some difficulty fitting the two cross bars together. It came down easy too and fit back into the travel bag no problem. We were inside so we didn't need to use the sand bags. It even stayed up when the little kids were running around it and pulling on the fabric and hiding behind the curtain. Totally worth the money and I will be using it again for future events and photo shoots.",

Came with bags to fill with sand to add weight for securing however I did not need to use. Sturdiness can be challenged when maximizing the extensions due to being light weight.
