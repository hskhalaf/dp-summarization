My review will be updated on how the paint seems after a few months. UPDATE: I had the cover on for a few weeks straight (Taking it off once but washing it before putting the cover back on) IT SCRACHED MY PAINT! My paint was in great condition so I\u2019m extremely disappointed. There are now scraches around the whole body!! I highly recommend you do NOT buy this car cover.",

I've seen car covers that are reinforced in the roof area- especially around the antenna- that would be a good idea. All in all, after I put a patch on it, it should be okay.",

About 3 months ago, any light rain soaks straight through onto my car and leaves the entire car wet. The material holding the strap on has torn and is useless. What's the point of a car cover that can't even protect it from water and has a strap dangling off that scratches the car? 3 layers?... What a joke. Would not buy again. I've reached out to Leader accessories to see if they stand behind their 1 year warranty. I will update following any response if I get one.",

Its breathable and lightweight easy to put over the car. It has a tie down at the rear that can be tied to your bumper hitch for security plus eyelets on the sides for an under the car security cable if you choose to use one. Fairly loose fit on my Subaru wagon except at the back its a bit tight. Acceptable for the low price. If it lasts a couple of years I will be happy.",

Nothing but mineral spirits and elbow grease removes the stains. I wanted a cover to keep the pods from my car and this worked perfectly. I will not be covering my car for extended periods in snow and rain. While I had it covered we had a very strong wind storm and the cover stayed perfectly in place.
