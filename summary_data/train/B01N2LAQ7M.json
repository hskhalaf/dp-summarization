Carabiners are HUGE and will easily fit around pull-up bar. Straps are substantive and well made, which will easily support my 230 lb. frame. My thanks for a quality product!!",

Feel great, and very sturdy, no tearing or stretching noises like they're struggling to stay stitched together while I'm holding me up. The straps are long enough to where my hands can't touch the pull bar while I'm hanging. My hands barely get to the carabiner while i'm doing leg lifts and knee raises so I can grab the straps right below the carabiner. Abs are sore right now from using these straps. Definitely a solid buy.",
