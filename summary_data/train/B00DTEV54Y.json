After using on my dogs, I ordered the one for cats (haven't built up my courage to attempt bathing them just yet!). There was no soap residue left on my dogs and it rinsed out easily. It did dry their skin a tad but not that bad and that may be due to my using diatomaceous earth a few days prior to bathing them. Their hair felt softer than I expected. Without perfume they don't smell \"good\" but that's better for them, as perfume is for humans, not a dog's sensitive nose. A little pricey but overall I'd recommend this product and purchase again.",
