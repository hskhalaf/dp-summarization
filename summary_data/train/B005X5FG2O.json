I'm short waisted and wondered if the bottom would be too long, but it's perfect. These bras hold up extremely well (I keep buying new ones because I change sizes not because I've worn them out) and the colors are very cute. Definitely worth the price!",

The girls are not squished, but protected and do not move, which is a must. The should straps are padded for comfort. My only issue is the razorback option takes a second person, but I've found that with most convertible style straps. This is a definite must buy!!!",

I will never wear any other type, and as a 34F, be assured have tried others. Fyi I ordered the LeMystere sports bra at the same time for comparison and immediately packed it up for return. That bra was more plunging, like a T shirt bra, offered comparatively less support, and the band was extremely tight, even though I ordered the same size as my LeMystere Dream Tisha regular bra. My regular bra was manufactured in France, but they are made there no longer; unfortunate and perhaps the reason for the discrepancy.",

Definitely not enough support for running. So much for reviews--it still comes down to personal trial and error. The cups are rigid and I suppose if you don't quite fit the shape, you are out of luck. And, the big brand name printed on the front is ugly. I returned them all and am going back to the Wacoal Sports Bra, which fits me great.",

The band was tighter but the cup size was too small. I Had to return because the fit was all off and I didn't want to be stuck with a pricy undergarment that I'm not going to wear.. I'm sticking with my Enell bra for now. The only thing I wanted was a different way to secure the bra as the front closure on the Enell gets bothersome after awhile.",
