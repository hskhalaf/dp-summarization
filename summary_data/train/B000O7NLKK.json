She has long hair so I usually use it on the length of her hair and not so much close to her scalp. I mostly use it in the mornings in the same way as a detaingler. I\u2019ve never sprayed it on my hair to see what I think of the fragrance all day. We\u2019re on our second bottle.

Considering rosemary repels other (garden) pests, it makes sense that it would do the same for Lice. It may have been luck but I'm sure this product helped. Atleast for my own peace of mind. Just remember, this product is not to treat lice/kill lice. It's a preventative measure.",

The seller provided good customer service, acknowledged the issue with the product description and sent me a small bottle with the sprayer. I very much appreciate that. The product smells nice and seems to be working so far. In case they have not updated the product page, just know that if you order the 32oz bottle, it will not come with a spray nozzle.",

It works great as a detangler for my daughters long hair. And her hair is always nice and soft. Definitely a must have for anyone with kids in school.",

It\u2019s strongest when you spray the spray and are using the shampoo, but once hair dries and you\u2019re done spraying the odor dies off tremendously. Must have for anyone trying to avoid lice!!",

So i decided to look into something else. Found this one, based on good reviews i purchased. Smell is not horrible. I leave the conditioner over night. Today, i comb out hair and some if the lice were already dead. I will recommend and keep on buying this product.",
