I had purchased a Harmony Universal Remote and it was not a model referenced for programming by Harmony. I had to designate it as a Samsung Sound Bar to program the Universal Remote. It also could not learn commands by pointing the remote at the soundbar",

I have had people at my house who really compliment me on my nice sounding TV. I had the soundbar and sub-woofer working within 10 minutes out of the box. The soundbar learned to operate with both my Sharp LED HDTV and Direct TV Satellite remotes. I have owned a pair of Energy speakers before. I really loved those speakers. So, I knew that the Energy soundbar was going to be good. And it is!!!!!",

    "title": "Energy Power Bar Soundbar with Wireless Subwoofer (Satin Black) (Discontinued by Manufacturer)",
    "description": "The Energy Powera Bar instantly upgrades your sound system without requiring a receiver. Just plug in and stand back. The two-way soundbar houses two domed tweeters and two 3-inch drivers for clear, distortion-free sound reproductions. Those drivers are aligned in the exclusive Convergent Source Module (CSM). Unique to Energy speakers, the CSM technology places tweeters and mid-woofers in close proximity to act as a single source for coherent, seamless dispersion. The speaker effectively disappears, sonically. The soundbar comes complete with an 8-inch wireless subwoofer with a down-firing fiber composite cone and ported enclosure for precise, room-filling bass performance. Measuring 30-inches in length and exuding a contemporary look, the Energy Power Bar is the perfect companion for high-definition picture and a necessary substitute for underwhelming flat-screen speakers. The remote control learning feature allows the easy-to-install-and-use system to function via your existing TV controller. The Energy Power Bar is designed to quickly connect to most TVs without additional cables. An included digital optical cable connects to your TV's digital output and then to the back of the soundbar. For those few TVs without an optical audio output, there is also a 2-channel analog input (cable not included).The soundbar can be positioned on the included rubber feet on a shelf or stand or can be wall-mounted using the included easy-to-use mounting template.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nENERGY POWER\u2122 BAR\nForty years of audio research, development, engineering, and manufacturing has led to the creation of Energy\u2019s latest line of speakers: the Energy Power Series. The products in the Energy Power\u2122 Series provide simple audio solutions that instantly upgrade your sound system without a receiver. Just plug in and stand back. The power is undeniable.\n\nThe Energy Power Bar Difference\n\nIntroducing the Energy Power Bar, the brand\u2019s first-ever soundbar. This two-way soundbar packs a mean punch, equipped with two domed tweeters and two 3-inch drivers for clear, distortion-free sound reproductions. The real difference in the Energy Power Bar comes from our proprietary Convergent Source Module Technology. This amazing innovation places the tweeter and mid-woofer in close proximity to act as a single source for coherent, seamless dispersion. Translation: huge sound that\u2019s also acutely accurate.\n\nHeart Pounding Bass\n\nEvery home theater needs a subwoofer. That\u2019s why we include an 8-inch wireless subwoofer with a down-firing composite cone and ported enclosure. It\u2019s the perfect companion to the Energy Power Bar and provides the thunderous bass that you feel as much as hear.\n\nSimple Set-up\n\nThe Energy Power Bar couldn\u2019t be easier to set-up because it was designed to quickly connect to most TVs without additional cables. An included digital optical cable connects to your TV\u2019s digital output and then to the back of the soundbar. For those few TVs without an optical audio output, there is also a 2-channel analog input. You can also program your TV remote to work with the soundbar\u2019s functions.\n\nPure Beauty\n\nThe Energy Power Bar measures 30-inches in length and boasts a contemporary black satin finish that will not only fit into your d\u00e9cor, but enhance it. The soundbar can be positioned on the included rubber feet on a shelf or stand, or can be wall-mounted using the included easy-to-use mounting template and built-in keyhole mounts. \n\nThis easy-to-setup and use one box solution is the perfect companion for high-definition picture and a necessary substitute for underwhelming flat-screen speakers.\n\nWhat's in the Box\n\nOne black satin finish soundbar, one 8\u201d wireless down-firing subwoofer, one 1.5m optical cable, one pair of rubber feet, wall mounting template, and one owner\u2019s manual\n\nTechnical Specifications \n\n * Frequency Response - 50Hz to 20kHz +/- 3dB\n *  Power Handling - 200 watts peak\n *  Tweeter - Two .78\" (20 mm) soft dome tweeters\n *  Midrange - Two 3\" (7.6 cm) IMG drivers\n *  Subwoofer - One 8\" (20.3 cm) down firing fiber composite cone / ported enclosure\n *  Inputs - 1 Optical input, 1 RCA input\n *  Mounting Options - Two built-in keyhole mounts for wall mounting\n *  Dimensions - Soundbar: 4.4\u201d H x 30\u201d W x 4.1\u201d D; Subwoofer: 11.5\u201d H x 9.5\u201d W x 14\u201d D (Dimensions include grille and feet)\n *  Weight - Soundbar: 5 lbs / 2.3 kg; Subwoofer: 15 lbs / 6.8 kg\n *  Finish - Soundbar: Satin Black; Subwoofer: Matte Black Vinyl",
