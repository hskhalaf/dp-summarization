Having average fitness and being able to \"end\" you're small dash helps. We got it on the second try. Comfort isn't great. Lying seems to be the best if you have a pillow. Reclining is a bit odd because the couch has you sitting deep in that crack along the middle. Sitting straight up is relatively comfortable if you have a back support. In all, it is better than nothing, comfort-wise. Finally, it is pretty loud. The material is very crinkly. Every movement is very audible, probably worse than, for example, a Walmart air mattress.",

It didn\u2019t hold air for long, like maybe 10 minutes of use before needing to either tighten the strap or re inflate.

The one star review is actually misleading because it's not worth the one star. Another annoying thing is the bag which it's supposed to fit back into is so small it does not fit. Why do the manufacturers give bags that are too small for the product once it has been opened? Ugh!",

I have had this for less than 30 days and i have used it in soft, non-rough surfaced areas. There are no holes in it and I followed the directions in order to inflate it, but still it does not stay inflated for long. Hope this helps for the potential buyers!",

It\u2019s easy for him to inflate and quick to deflate, really light weight. I really thought it would have popped by now but it\u2019s still holding strong!!",
