Apparently, lots of people have had similar experiences from this Apollo product. Unacceptable.",

I wanted a NICE, decorative and elegant looking shaving bowl to display on my counter with the other \"manly\" things like a double edge razor and shaving brush and straight razor. THis looks nice, but just isn't quite what I wanted or expected.",

An elegant receptacle and whipping cup. Made of decent quality metal being light to medium in weight, the perfect size for any round soap puck and deep enough to whip up a good lather. Love the cover to hide what is left uncleaned like most men would do. The etching is a nice touch. It's a bit expensive like all men's shaving products today, but hey, polished steel and an elegant design for those expensive shaving soap pucks!",
