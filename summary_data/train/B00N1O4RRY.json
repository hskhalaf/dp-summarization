I'd recommend a large air cooling unit. The temperatures run at a maximum of about 65C with a large air cooler (when stress tested). You won't need any more than that if you're not over clocking! I'm not over locking this so can't speak for what point you'll need to look at water cooling.",

As a performance feature, Intel HT Technology also increases processor throughput, improving overall performance on threaded software.\n\nWith Intel HT Technology, multimedia enthusiasts can create, edit, and encode graphically intensive files while running background applications, such as virus protection software, without compromising system performance.\n\nIntel Turbo Boost Technology 2.01 automatically allows processor cores to run faster than the rated operating frequency if they're operating below power, current, and temperature specification limits.\n\nIntel Turbo Boost Technology 2.0 is activated when the Operating System (OS) requests a frequency higher than the rated frequency of the processor. Whether the processor enters into and the amount of time the processor spends in the Intel Turbo Boost Technology 2.0 state depends on the workload and operating environment.\n\nMaximum turbo frequency indicates the highest possible frequency achievable when conditions allow the processor to enter turbo mode. Intel Turbo Boost Technology frequency varies depending on workload, hardware, software and overall system configuration.\n\nBOX CONTAINS\n1 x CPU",
