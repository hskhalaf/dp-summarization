Chili Cheese was my favorite (would love to see this flavor in original Popchips, too), but they are all very tasty and equally satisfying. For those of you who aren't keen on the texture of original Popchips as compared to regular chips, these Ridges mimic other ridged chips more closely in my opinion.",

After taking a bite I realized these were not ridged chips. Then I went back to examine the open package to find that all 24 bags are identical. No ridges and only BBQ. Since I'd eaten one bag I guess I can't return the box, but I am definitely disappointed that I didn't get what I ordered. Wish I had unpacked the box before eating one of them so I could have returned it.",

Avoid this box of small bags.",
