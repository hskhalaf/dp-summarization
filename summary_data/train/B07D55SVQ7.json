      "text": "This lamp mostly performs as expected. Stability could be better as it is a little bit on the lighter side. If the base was metal or a heavier type of wood, it would make a huge difference. Cable management could be better, either with more clips or if the USB and accessory power plugs were facing down instead of up (that would help give it a cleaner look). I would also pay a little more if one of the USB ports was USB-C (and fully compliant). The hole for the pull-chain should probably be better protected as the pull-chain will likely wear out the edges very quickly. Those are all minor issues for an otherwise good idea for lamp.",

The white also brightens up the bedroom nicely. They are lightweight and easy to put together. The only issue with them is that they are firm on our hardwood floor but they may be slightly wobbly on carpet.",

Virtually everything with a plug is compatible with a smart outlet so this lamp isn't special. I believe they use the smart device tactic to make more sales and charge extra money. If you want this to be a smart lamp you'll need to purchase a smart outlet, bulb, or switch separately. You can buy a similar lamp of same quality for $30 to $40 dollars less and make it a smart device yourself. You'll get better features this way without spending an initial $75.00+ on the lamp alone.",

I have peace of mind knowing that I can charge my phone while watching my favorite TV shows and/or movies in the comfort of my living room! Customer service was absolutely amazing! A+++ :-)",

For the height, it's very likely to fall over because it has no weight to it's body. I had to place a heavy planter on the base to give stability. The materials feel very cheap and flimsy. It's definitely not worth the price. Positive... The charge port is pretty cool, but... it's a plastic. This would be good in a teenager's room, or even a college dorm room.",

      "text": "I am using this as a side table, light for a small bedroom with no space to put an end table. With this lamp, I do not mind not having an end table. This lamp does everything and more. The lamp as 2 USB ports for charging devices, as well as an outlet which I use to plug in my Amazon Echo Dot. Light source bright, and lights up the entire room, excellent for reading, etc. The only thing that I would want different, would be to have a choice of lampshades for the lamp. Other than that, this gets 5 stars from me! Thank you.",
