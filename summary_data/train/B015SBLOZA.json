The metal cross bracing is uncomfortably close to the mesh support webbing, and it will poke you in the back if you are not careful with loading.",

The interior is nice and spacious and managed to hold multiple massive bottles of beer I picked up in Belgium along with all of my clothes/toiletries/etc. If you use the straps, it disperses the weight quite evenly throughout your body. I highly recommend this backpack if you're looking for a solid, durable travel bag.",

Gregory has always had amazing fit and this does the job. I am just starting to get serious about ultralight multi-day hikes so this is my training bag.

I was completely ignorant to backpacking since I have never done it before. The people at REI were extremely helpful. Every backpack I tried on had a different comfort feel to it. At REI they will put weights in the backpack so you could get the real feel of a full backpack.",
