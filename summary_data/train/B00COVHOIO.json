Now everything sticks and you end up with dark bits that are almost impossible to get off. I hand wash and don\u2019t use any abrasives on it. Update: I contacted Oster and they said to use Pam (I guess their non-stick griddle needs a non-stick spray to make it non-stick?). I did that and ended up with another huge mess with black bits on the griddle that are impossible to get out. This is what it looks like. To say I\u2019m disgusted is an understatement.",

      "text": "I bought this grill last October and have used it quite a bit between now and then. I really wanted to like this grill but it does not hold temperature. I am satisfied with everything else but have verified with an infrared thermometer temperature swings of up to 100 degrees. This makes cooking breakfast pancakes or eggs correctly nearly impossible and the grill nearly useless. The grill itself is also quite thin and this probably contributes to the temperature problem. When I cook pancakes I can never tell if I will get an undercooked cake or one with a scorched line where the heating element circles the grill.",

When cooking French toast or pancakes, there was no noticeable difference in browning between the edges and the middle. I also like that the griddle easily disconnects from the base, making it very easy to clean. I definitely recommend this skillet!",

Oster has agreed to replace the griddle with a newer version. Hopefully, they have improved the surface on the new grill. Their customer service was quite receptive to my issues with the griddle.",

It cooked evenly, heated quickly, and was by far the easiest and fastest to clean. It's a little more spendy than others, but the quality is worth it. Love the reversible option as well. Definitely worth the buy.",

It cooks Great on both sides and is very easy to clean. The detachable base makes storage so much easier. It is great quality overall and I am glad to have bought it.",

If cooking a thick steak or chicken place a cover over it. It will cook much faster. Lets face it, nothing is truly better to cook on other that a gas or charcoal grill. I would definately recommend this product. One catch it doesnt really clean great. It cleans up well but eventually leaves some staining. Oh anther thing I would still recommend a non stick spray or olive oil just to make sure your eggs come off nicely.",

I've always thought the temperature know seemed a little clunky for such a pricey griddle, but I was willing to overlook that. About two months ago, the griddle and indicator light started turning off on their own while cooking at lower temperatures (around 300 degrees). Now they turn off randomly at any temperature while I'm trying to cook.",

    "description": "Offering the functionality of two appliances in one, the Oster Titanium Infused DuraCeramic Reversible Grill/Griddle converts from a griddle to an indoor grill pan with a simple flip. This electric griddle and indoor grill features a titanium-infused DuraCeramic PTFE- and PFOA-free, nonstick ceramic coating that won\u2019t flake or peel even after extended use. The temperature control lets you precisely control heat and detaches smoothly from the unit when it\u2019s time to clean up. The removable drip tray collects fat and grease to help promote healthier cooking. And thanks to its expansive 10- by 18-inch cooking surface, this indoor grill offers enough space to prepare meals for the entire family. For added convenience and easy cleanup, the base, cooking plate, and drip tray are all dishwasher safe.",
