Even though the description calls out how wonderfully waterproofed it is, Wenzel states that this tent was manufactured directly for Amazon and is not intended to be water resistant. Of course, we didn't know that until after it rained on us. It is a spacious tent and easy to put up, but only made for dry climates. We had water come through the bottom seams and all of the window seams. With the way that the window is made, the water will pool in the bottom between the screen and the flap so that it seeps in.",

A snake or ants or rodents could easily get in. In addition, the two zippers along the bottom were difficult to close because they kept getting snagged on the little rain protector runner, which was impossible to keep out of the way. If you are easily annoyed and frustrated with stuff like this then get another tent.",

Only con so far that I can see is that it's very hard to get the sides of the tent to remain fully taunt (unlike many of my old Coleman tents). This didn't reduce the interior space but does affect the look and raises issues about overall durability in the long run. The screened in front area is great during those mosquito infested late nights!",

However, there are a few things that I would like improved: 1) it would be nice to have some hooks along the insides of the tent. 2) entrance space is a little too low compared to the entire tent. 3) Two-way zippers would make it easier to go in and out. Overall, it's a nice tent and definitely worth the money. Also, I noticed that the front zipper flap is kind of weird at the top. I wasn't sure if this was the actual design... Pictures included.",

It was a very windy day in the mountains so perhaps some of that is on me for putting up such a high profile tent. Other than that, I loved the front porch area that we used for a card table and chairs setup. And I like the fact that there's a wall between that and the back area for sleep, so I can keep that closed while we play cards. Once I find a tent pole replacement, I might give this tent another chance...just in a more heavily wooded area protected from the wind.",

This tent cannot be put up by just one person and also no matter how many stakes we used we needed to reinforce with ropes at every pole just to get it to stand to put the rain fly on. While my 5 year old son was in the tent it collapsed and a pole hit him and left a mark on his forehead!!! We slept in the car and called Amazon immediately they are working with us to return the product however it ruined a wonderful family vacation!!!",

We had some heavy rainstorms over the course of a week and did not have any problems with leaks with the exception of the outermost door, which let in a very small amount of rain where the three zippers met. As with many tents, the outermost door also wanted to get snagged on itself unless unzipped in a specific manner. Otherwise great.",

This tent also does not have a cord hole to the outside nor one between the two compartments making running cords impossible without 1. Cutting fabric and creating your own. 2. Leaving zipper open with cord going through. Pros: Easy to set up. Spacious and can stand straight up in the main room but not the forward room. (I\u2019m 5\u20199\u201d). There is a ring for a tent fan/light which was a bonus! And it looks very nice and breaths well. My tent is never hot which is amazing!",

Please note however that it may be prudent to purchase about 5 - 10 heavy duty stakes ( thick sturdy ) just to be on the safe side depending on the sort of terrain on which the tent is to be pitched. A ground-tarp was also purchased and strongly recommended to help prevent moisture from below.",

    "description": "Great for camping with family or friends, the Wenzel Klondike measures 16-feet by 11-feet. The Klondike sleeps eight, five in its 98 square feet of interior space, with room for sleeping three more in the 60 square foot screen room with its zip up walls. 6.5 feet of head room lets you stand up straight while inside the tent. The attached screen room can also be used as sun shelter, a picnic room, a gear room or a room just to relax in. A full mesh roof and two mesh windows keep bugs out and let the breeze in. In addition a rear mesh vent creates ground breeze. Weather Armor polyester fabric with a polyurethane water resistant coating protects from top to bottom. Double-stitched, lap-felled seams through out the body of the tent provide a shingle effect against water. All threads, zippers and webbing are treated with superior water repellency applications to enforce these critical areas. The Klondike has a fiberglass frame and uses Power Corners that increase the tent's stability in high winds. Included are two hanging pockets that create an area for items needing easy access, a storage duffel and a 10 year warranty against defects.
