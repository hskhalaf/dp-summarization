They are easy to store and handy for any occasion where you need an extra chair. Highly recommend product.",

My one complaint is that they really recline back just a bit further than ideal for use at a table. They are not super heavy-duty, so respect the weight limits. Within those limits, though, the lightweight construction actually makes them a bit more comfortable, as they do flex a bit to conform to your sitter.",

It doesn't have a cushioned seat so I wouldn't recommend it for seating over 4 hours time. But if you are looking for some chairs to use as an extension of your seating for a temporary seating setting (1-4 hours) I would say these chairs are sturdy and can accommodate that. Also the type of material would seem like it won't get hot or cause sweating if used outside. Very lightweight and easy to fold away.",

I'm worried about how they will hold up long term, however. They look cheaper in real life then these photos on Amazon can depict. If you weigh more than 200 pound, I suggest you gingerly sit down on these or they will buckle under the weight. Flimsily made from plastic and very thin aluminum that will get you out of a quick bind but I don't advise these for any type of heavy use or you will be highly disappointed.",
