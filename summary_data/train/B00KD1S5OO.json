Probably my favorite thing about this calculator is that if you have gone into a sub-menu to access a certain function (for example, cumulative normal probability distribution function), it will stay there after you enter the calculation, so you can access it repeatedly.

So be warned about that when purchasing this calculator.",

I find it very easy to use and it has lots of instructions and clear icons. It is absolutely invaluable to bc I'm taking calculus but the only problem is that it lacks I/O feature. Anyone looking for a Calc will understand that that's what makes fractions, logs, surds and other math problems easier. It's unfortunate and I would recommend looking into the 9800 series for that. But it is still a great calculator.",
