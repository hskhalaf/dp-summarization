It comes assembled, it's quite sturdy and well put together, and though it's unfinished, it looks great. I may not finish it. This is one of the most satisfactory buys I've made on Amazon. Price is very reasonable, delivery was spot on. Couldn't be happier.",

It sits firm with no wobble whatsoever. It's kind of heavy, which I really like. It's comfortable and the seat has a bit of a bow that makes it nice to sit while I put on my boots. The stickers on the bottom indicate that it was made in Thomasville, NC, USA, which is a bonus to me. I would highly recommend this item for any person who is looking for this type of stool.
