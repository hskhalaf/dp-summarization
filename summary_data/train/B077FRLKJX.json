They look and feel like a much more expensive pair of headphones -It was super easy and FAST to connect to my phone. Fastest Bluetooth headphones I\u2019ve had. -The only constructive feedback I have is that it isn\u2019t as loud as other headphones but the quality of the sound is great and makes up for it.",

Mostly I like how the cord doesn\u2019t rest on your neck & hangs behind the head instead. So happy mpow came out with this rose pink color in the updated version & I expect them to last much longer!

I cannot fix this, also, I tried every one of the ear pieces that they sent and the headset never fit totally right, the earpieces seem bulky and kind of fit weirdly. However, even if they did fit correctly, as when I manually manipulate them to stay in my ears, the sound is really off between the two buds. Additionally, pink color is like the color of my skin and it kind of looks, for lack of a better term, weird.",

Still another broke within 3 months and the replacement lasted even less time. In stark contrast these earphones don't move around or fall out of my ears, so adjusting every few minutes. The sound is crisp and clear with a fabulous battery life. You'd be hard pressed to find better over the ear earphones at this price point.",

The major con is that for some reason if I wear my device on my left arm in its running band the bluetooth connection starts to skip really bad. Sometimes it just stops for seconds before resuming the music. I don't know if its because the right headphone has the controls or what but it is an extremely annoying bug.",

I was listening to an audiobook while soaking in the Mexican Gulf (the phone was in a waterproof pouch), a large wave hit me and I was underwater for a few seconds, the headphones never failed. Their foam earpieces are VERY comfortable and they block external sounds very efficiently, it's like wearing earplugs that deliver sound too :)",

When I carry my phone in the picket of my jeans while walking, I get a fair amount of cut out when phoning or listening to podcasts. Also when I first turn the headset on and start listening to a podcast for the first few minutes (3-4 but it seems forever), I hear an occasional higher pitched beep like some kind of error. I find them comfortable enough and easy enough to charge. There battery life seems good but with the problems I have had I usually don't leave them on long enough to really test",

      "text": "I couldn't be happier with these wireless bluetooth headphones from MPOW. The directions lost a little in translation, but a little trial and error and they were simple to setup, pair with my phone and my laptop, and listen to great music. The sound quality is impressive in such an economic pair of headphones. For now, it seems the battery life is also pretty good. So far I have listened four different times for a total of about 2 hours on a single charge (over 2 days). The noise cancellation feature is ok. The headphones fit comfortable over the ear and the small wire connecting the L and R does not bother me. Highly recommend this set.",

Sound is better than earphones I've used in the past - better than I expected for the price. My phones stopped working after about 10 months - they wouldn't charge and couldn't be powered up. I contacted Mpow tech support. They suggested a few things to try, but none worked. In our email exchanges, they always responded within no more than a day or two. When their suggestions didn't help, they sent me a new pair of earphones. That's how support should work!",

One good thing that could be a bad thing is the noise cancelling works really well. It works so well that I don't use them when hiking or walking in a crowded urban area. They block sound so well it's hard to be aware of your surroundings. They are perfect for lounging at the beach and doing yard work. The sound quality is about what you would expect from headphones in this price range. The mechanics that hold them in your ears is well designed. They are comfortable.",
