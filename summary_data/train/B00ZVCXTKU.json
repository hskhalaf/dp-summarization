Within the first two days that rule was out the window. They're super lightweight, one of the most comfortable shoes I've owned and to top it off they even look pretty good. I paid around $65 with Prime; in retrospect, considering the somewhat moderate price and qualities of the shoe, and provided size is correct upon receipt, the choice is borderline no-brainer. If they maintain well against the wear and tear, the next shoe could quite possibly this same shoe. In a new color, perhaps.",
