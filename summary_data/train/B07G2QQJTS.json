      "text": "I purchased this Dust Devil vacuum and it has surpassed my expectations. It works incredible on hard flooring and light carpets. i.e. throw rugs, bathroom rugs. It is superb in sucking up dog fur as I have 2 German Shepherds. I love the attachments as they can clean high spots I can't reach and the attachments are great for cleaning blinds, curtains and tower fans. The vacuum and attachments are very user friendly. I honestly can not say enough wonderful things about this vacuum. Great purchase and definitely deserves 5 stars. Highly Recommend!!!!",

I am always having to lean it against something else, and sometimes, even that doesn't work. It fell onto the floor this week, and one of the pieces the cord winds around broke off. I've used the vac for less than two weeks, so this is really disappointing. If the manufacturer is not going to make a vacuum that stands up easily, then they should make sure it doesn't break easily.",

Also, with this vacuum, stuff gets stuck up around the filter and you either have to pull it out with your fingers or dismantle it. Dismantling it to clean out around the filter or to clean the filter is awful. It's a full-on wrestling match getting it both on and off. Definitely would not recommend this vacuum.",

Suction is good but, not only is it flimsy-feeling and parts/cords/tubes don\u2019t clock into place securely without a lot of effort, but, more importantly, it is incredibly loud and has a high-pitched screeching whine. My family couldn\u2019t tolerate the noise or the high whine, and, consequently, wouldn\u2019t use the vacuum. It is certainly inexpensive, and would probably do the job, but, as usual, you get what you paid for (or rather, don\u2019t get what you didn\u2019t pay for). Amazon was great about the return and I exchanged it for a more expensive vacuum with more features, and, hopefully, a more quiet motor.",

Took off the bottom to see if perhaps something was stuck in there. Nope. Tried it again and it's still smoking. This is an inexpensive vacuum and the only thing I can do according to the owners manual is mail it back at my cost. Hardly worth the cost & the effort. I thought that being a Dirt Devil brand I would at least get a year or two out of it. Don't waste your money!",

There\u2019s one flaw that makes a big difference for me, the hose clip where it attaches to the vacuum became loose. The design and plastic are cheap and not very sturdy in this area and what happens is the loose fit allows air flow and the vacuum loses suction. I thought about just duct taping it but then I can\u2019t use the hose at all.",
