A lot has been said about the creases in the screen in the reviews. I don't know how any portable screen wouldn't have creases if you are folding it up to carry around. If you are leaving it up in a permanent position, those creases should go away because the screen is pulled pretty lightly. I have not once noticed them once the movie starts going.",

It is light enough for me to drag it across the floor (somewhat awkward by myself, because it's a large, wobbly screen haha) and place it in front of my TV when I want to use it. Takes me a couple minutes to move it back against the wall on the side of my room when not in use. Easy to set up, and I like that it can be broken down and placed into the bag for on-the-go. I plan to also use this screen for outdoor parties with friends. Don't worry about creases in the screen. Give it a couple days, and they will smooth out.",

Super sturdy aluminum frame as well. Really well designed. If you kick up the back stabilizers, leaving the one's in front down, you can push this giant screen directly up against a wall for more space and convenience. I've used it now a few times, at work and at home, and I can say with no reservation this is one of the best screens I've ever had, and I really love it when companies can demonstrate real ingenuity and execution to make a product both great...

I was also concerned that the folding line from storing would show during screenings but they disappeared once completely assembled.

Once it is on the frame, there are no wrinkles. The frame is fairly thick extruded aluminum and unfolds and locks very easily. Although I didn't need them, it comes with legs, some anchor stakes and even some rope to anchor it if you use it outside (otherwise it could blow away). It even comes with a nice soft sided carrying bag for storage.",

It also has the extra extension legs available (for an extra fee) making it far more useful when you travel to conference venues with variable height ceilings. If you do presentation and want to make a professional impression, a few extra dollars on these sorts of aesthetics is very worthwhile.",

I'll be gathering all my stuff in hopes of getting a new case for it. Follow-up...notified merchant of the torn stitching and they sent a replacement. Unfortunately it too was torn.

It also came damaged. I was tempted to return it, but due to it's size I decided to just keep it. One of the legs wouldn't fit without getting pliers to bend the metal.

      "text": "Love this screen. I bought it for movie nights in our back yard during the spring and summer. t's very easy to assemble. Takes one person about 10 minutes and it's solid when it's up and standing. It's a big screen, so on a windy day it could potentially blow over. But the supplied stakes have prevented that from happening. So no problems with the wind. It also comes with a black zip-up bag that makes it easy enough to carry, not too heavy. I evaluated many screens before deciding on this one, and I'm glad this is the one I bought. Works like a charm.",

The biggest reason is that it does not need to be tethered to a power cord. It is lightweight and was easy to put up. You can also detach the legs and just hang the screen from wherever you feel like watching a movie. I definitely plan on using it inside the house when outdoor movie season is over! The screen itself provides an excellent viewing surface. I am very happy with this purchase.",

We eventually got it, but are worried about how long it would take to put it back up. If you are purchasing for an event, make sure you leave enough time allotted to assemble the screen. Otherwise, just as expected.",

We have setup this screen about 6 times now and it's still as hard to snap, which is a good thing since you don't want it loose but be prepared for it to make your thumbs sore.

The instructions say it needs something so why isn't it just included?!? Otherwise, this is a great product. So easy to set up. Stores in bag very well and screen has it's own separate bag that is good quality. Pretty portable. Good quality picture, but I'm sure that depends on quality of projector. Would definitely recommend!",

I have a studio apartment and the 120 inch screen fits perfectly. The two sizes bigger must be even more incredible. I barely had to look at any instructions out of the box, and with the help of a friend, I had it up in 15 minutes. It\u2019s taking less time as I get used to it, even when doing it alone, which gets better with practice. The creases may still be visible after full assembly, but completely unnoticeable during projection. The carrying case is perfect.",
