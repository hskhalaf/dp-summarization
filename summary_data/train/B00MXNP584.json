However, 1-1/2 years later, the touchscreen panel just went dead and that's unacceptable on a $190 deadbolt. The *electronics* part of the warranty is only 1 year... go figure. (and yes, I changed the batteries out a couple of months ago, and they were at 98% when the panel went dead). If you rely on the electronics (and don't carry a key as a result), and it fails... well... To be fair, there *is* a newer version of this out now, called the Connect. That carries a 3-year warranty on the electronics.",

In about 15 minutes the old lock was out, the new one was in, and the system was paired to a SmartThings Hub v2.0. Of interest... the installation paperwork says there may be issues using lithium batteries. I have been using lithium batteries in the first lock, after the batteries wore out, without an issue.. I used the Duracell batteries included in this lock, instead of using lithium. Winter is coming. We will see... Highly recommended product.",

      "text": "This seems to be a very well constructed dead bolt lock with Z Wave support. Since we already have the ADT Pulse system, getting the Sense for $229 or the model with a bult in alaram for $20 more did not make sense (pardon the pun :-) ). If you are looking for HomeKit compatibilty and want to use Siri then go for the Sense model else this one does the job perfectly well. Integration with any Z Wave hub is seamless and the one touch lock feature is excellent. Overall very satisfied and would recommend to anyone looking to get into the Smart Home Game.",

Built from high quality materials, this keyless deadbolt gives you a high level of security at the main point of entry.
