However, being that my teeth aren't super yellow at all, it's hard to judge how well it whitened my top teeth. I finished the 5-day, top teeth only. I do think it improved somewhat. Last night was the first for the bottom teeth. I have 4 more applications to go for the bottom. I'll know more after I'm done because my bottom teeth were more yellow than the top ones, so more change for marked improvement. However, the price is ridiculously high, I'm sorry to say!",

Then do the bottom once. There are not many in the box. Maybe four days using top and bottom, but they are not needed so much on the bottom as they will whiten so as not to notice a maybe one shade darker than the top. Wish the company could package a larger number per order in the box. Not overly priced, just need to be a bit smart about using to make them last.",
