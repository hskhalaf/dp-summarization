Even at the slowest setting, images fly by too fast to see (in some graphics programs, ACDSee for example).

Microsoft used to make a good mouse but this one is junk. I feel like a sucker for buying it. I won't buy anymore hardware from Microsoft. I'd let Microsoft stick to making software and get a Logitech mouse.",

When I use the default setting the mouse works greatly. pros: compact laser precision ergonomic design more buttons pretty good tracking cons: some tracking issues when speed is very fast more effort needed to click right button than my old MS 3000 mouse not all buttons customizable relative short receiver range(~1.5m) In all, I would say it is a pretty good mouse and worth buying",

The cursor was also very erratic. You would think it would be better with a laser but it's actually worse. I finally had to stop using it completely out of frustration.",

I don't see any problem with the thumb bottom, it works as a magnifier perfectly with out any problem. I think when they say they can't turn this magnifier off is because they hold it too long.

    "description": "Your pointer will never be more accurate!This Microsoft Wireless Notebook Laser Mouse 6000 is the solution to getting rid of your old ball mouse. With 1000 Dpi, it is more responsive and delivers smoother tracking. It s Tilt Wheel technology makes browsing effortless by allowing you to scroll horizontally as well as vertically. Take it with you easily with its snap in USB receiver. Plug and play this Microsoft Wireless Notebook Laser Mouse 6000 today! 1-YEAR DIRECT WARRANTY\n\nAMAZON.COM\nWhen you first start using the Microsoft B5W-00001 Wireless Notebook Laser Mouse 6000, you'll wonder how you've managed without it all these years. Offering an unmatched package of ergonomic design, accuracy, style, and advanced features, this mouse will give you the comfort and performance that your work deserves.\n\n \n\n\n\nFour-way scrolling with Tilt Wheel Technology.View larger. \n\nGet five times closer with The Magnifier. View larger. \n\nSnap-in receiver automatically turns off the mouse. \n\nMicrosoft's Laser Mouse 6000 features an innovative, ergonomic design. Accuracy and Performance Features\nFeaturing high-definition laser technology, the Microsoft B5W-00001 offers laser precision as you scroll through your files. Smoother tracking means less strain on your hands and wrists, and higher responsiveness means that you'll quickly notice an increase in your productivity. The mouse offers four-way scrolling, adding even greater efficiency and comfort to your work. The entire scroll wheel tilts from side to side, acts as a button, and reacts to how quickly you roll the wheel to enable smooth, accurate maneuverability. For example, if you're working with a super-wide spreadsheet, you can tilt the wheel from side to side to scroll right and left, without having to click the sheet's tiny scroll arrows.  If you work with a lot of digital imagery, you'll love the mouse's magnification feature. With this feature, you'll think that you have a magnifying glass pressed against the screen. With a simple press-and-hold motion, the magnifier enlarges the area of your screen that fits inside the lens. You can easily adjust both the size of the lens and the level of its magnification. The Magnifier works in most programs. (The Magnifier is not compatible with Direct3D API in full-screen mode, media players, OpenGL, and Layered Windows. If you are using Mac OS X, the Magnifier enlarges text and images on the entire screen.) When it's time to touch up photos, or fine-tune detailed tasks, the magnifier will quickly become your best friend.\n\n The mouse also features advanced Microsoft technologies that help prolong the life of your batteries, which means that you can spend more time working and less time running back and forth to the store. The B5W-00001 automatically enters standby mode when it's inactive for a certain length of time, which minimizes unnecessary battery drain. In addition, the light in the mouse's optical sensor illuminates only as brightly as is necessary to provide optimal tracking power. And finally, the mouse features a handy snap-in receiver that plugs in when you're ready to work, then snaps into your mouse when you travel, further preserving battery life.\n\n Of course, as its name implies, the Microsoft B5W-00001 is wireless, which means you'll never have to hassle with cords again. An ambidextrous, ergonomic design that features a rubber-sided grip and a sophisticated form gives this mouse a cutting-edge look and feel that will complement today's latest technology. So if you work with a computer that runs Windows XP and has an available USB port, the Microsoft B5W-00001 could be the mouse you've always wanted.\n\n \nWhat's in the Box\nWireless laser mouse, receiver, 1 AA battery, software CD-ROM, and user's manual.",
