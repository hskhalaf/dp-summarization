Far more grippy surface, far more flexibility, far more comfortable, far more usable. Using oven mitts you are far more likely to drop your food than wearing these. They are well insulated and very comfortable. I'm not sure how well they will wash out food stains and only time will tell but so far I am incredibly happy with these.",

Definitely need a plan in advance - you can't just grab a hot baking pan and move around leisurely. The middle finger is a bit short. The multi layer fabric bunches a little as you slide your fingers in, so it takes a little wiggling to get comfortable. Overall, these gloves are inadequate for general, comfortable use with oven-hot pots and pans, so I'll be looking for something different.",

They do a great job of protecting you from the heat while also giving you the flexibility to still use your fingers (and thumb). I'm 6'1\" and while the gloves are a little tight they definitely fit (and I'm hoping they will stretch out a little as I use them).",
