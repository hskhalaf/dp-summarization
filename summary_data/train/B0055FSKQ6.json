Poor QC since the damage clearly occurred at factory while putting together the pre-screwed parts of the chair. Contacted the company but no response yet, will update accordingly. Very happy with the one chair that I was able to put together. Seems sturdy and looks like it will last a long time.",

I don't much like the comfort of any type of Adirondack chair. I just don't like them but others seem to love them so I bought these. I'm so glad I did. They are very good quality and they look so nice around my fire pit on my patio and are at the ready-to-serve. Buy them. You won't regret it.",

I wanted to surprise my wife the next day and didn't want to wake the neighbors with my drill. Ended up spending *hours* with a little allen wrench and my hands wanted to kill me the next day. Totally worth it, tho'.",
