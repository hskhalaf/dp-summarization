Most of the failures I've seen reported (but have never suffered first-hand) appear to be mechanical, not electronic, Users have blamed failure of support bearing or other axle structure around the spinning drive. So I figure a prolonged amount of time sitting there spinning will be a good shakedown. No problems. Tested with WD's diagnostic software on a standard file set I use on a new external HD.",

      "text": "The hard drive came in beat up, but probably original packaging. I purchased a 1 TB drive and received a 500 GB drive. Packaging printing indicated a 500 GB drive (correct) but box had a sticker on it indicating that the package actually contained a 1 TB drive (what I ordered and paid for). Between the beat up packaging and the sticker, I have my suspicions that something isn't quite 100% here, and this might be a \"gray market\" device. It also could be completely innocent. At any rate Amazon is replacing it, no questions. For what its worth, the drive, included USB cord, and instructions/warranty sheet all look like they are new.",

Causing it to be fairly incompatible with older hardware or just take forever to install because it has to fail on the first weird software driver before trying the next.

The USB 3.0 port is an exceptional increase in speed both reading and writing. The compact design fits well in a protective case I found here on amazon. The drive is quiet.

When used with a USB 3.0 port, the transfer rates are very fast and reliable. The hard drive casing is attractive and durable, with tiny rubber bumps on the bottom, that prevents it from sliding all over your table. The USB 3.0 connection is a reassuringly tight fit. If there was one area that I think could be improved on, is to make the USB 3.0 cable a little longer. Overall, an EXCELLENT buy, and I am VERY happy with it.",

      "text": "If I could give this ZERO stars I would. This drive is not compatible with MacBooks. I bought this drive as a backup for my computer. Over the years I've been saving data and other information on this drive and now it doesn't work when plugged into the computer. I've tried it on multiple computers and it will not work. Now all my files are gone and since the serial number is not visible I'm not able to get a replacement. DO NOT BUY!!!",

      "text": "The WD Passport seems great so far. The included backup software does what it says - automatically backs up any new files from your computer to the external hard drive. It is small so it takes up very little room on my desk. I have not had to restore anything yet, but I have searched the drive to be sure it is backing up my files (which, as I said, it is). So, I presume that restoring things will be easy if needed. I use mine on Windows 7 Home Premium and it works smoothly. I recommend it and will update this review if there are any new developments.",
