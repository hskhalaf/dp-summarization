      "text": "Took 2 of these on a 7 day family backpacking adventure, and used them every night. We hung one inside our tent, and used the second one outside for cooking. I sun-charged them before leaving on our adventure, and never had to charge them again on our trip. We were totally prepared to carry them open on the outside of our pack to re-charge, but never had to. We liked the two intensity light settings, and the emergency signal setting. They fold up nicely, and are not overly heavy. They double as great additions to your emergency kit at home too. Besides, I LOVE not using batteries!",

Eventually it does get a little dimmer if you run it all night on the brightest setting but it stays on and still puts off an impressive amount of light even when dimmed. Charges easily enough-just put it in the sun! I'm thinking of buying a couple more just to spread around the campsite and keep on the lowest setting. This always works awesome as an emergency light to keep inside your home.",

I will add my 5-star review to the list! I used the hook to hang it from the top of our tent. It easily provided enough light for the entire space (12-man spring bar tent). It wasn't super bright in all of the corners for detailed lighting, but it was good enough. I'm going to get a few more of these to fill in the holes and to light another tent. The best solar light I've ever seen or used!",
