I purchased it so I could wash my little plastic measuring spoons, some plastic beverage bottle caps, a gadget I use to score the thick skin or peel of fruits, like oranges and avocados, (this gadget is the size of a ring someone would wear), and any other very small items that need washing. Unfortunately, the gaps between the metal grid are way too large, and everything slips through to the bottom of the dishwasher! This basket is great for larger \"small\" items, like a baby bottle ring or other kitchen gadgets that aren't really small and/or thin and/or short.",
