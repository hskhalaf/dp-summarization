The resolution of this headset is so low that it makes it difficult to play most flight simulator games. For most normal gamers the resolution is just great, but for flight sims in particular, the low resolution is a deal breaker. I can sympathize with Oculus since a higher resolution would make it even more demanding in terms of graphics, but the great thing about resolution is that you can downscale if needed. I am definitely looking forward to a higher resolution Rift in the near future!",

I was expecting to have a better experience from using a powerful PC, but was disappointed when it didn't even match the console, let alone outperform it. If you are considering this, I recommend you find somewhere to demo the PSVR, Go and Rift then determine for yourself if it is worth it.",

Also, more games are set up for the vive rather than the oculus, I have played a fair share of vr games from steam on my oculus, and some games that have vive controllers, and say they are meant for both, run poorly on my oculus. Unless you plan to play games that require you to constantly face forward, get the Vive.",

I'm using a GTX 1080 card, and there is no detectable lag from head movement to image update, so there is no motion sickness. (or VR sickness.) In my old age, I tend to be more sensitive to that than other people. I'm an EE, and I'm amazed they can track head movement to such a fine resolution.",

It works far better than my dad's Gear VR for his Note 8, but not quite as good as my friend's Vive. It has an onboard microphone and the included speakers were surprisingly good (a relief as they would be trickly to replace). A great deal in cost versus application",

Adding a third sensor to the mix lets you get the most out of the system, since it gives you room scale for playing games that let you walk around your space. The Touch controllers are capacitive so that games that use it can sense some of your fingers lifting from its grasp to let you point and wave or make a fist, and they fit very snug in your hands. With the three sensors, I would put this system slightly above the Vive for a perfect set up.",

If you turn vibration off the batteries only need to be changed monthly. Headset is lightweight, easy to setup. I got an extra sensor (3 total) and an 8ft cube of room scale VR. vive controller emulator allows me to play vive exclusive games (fallout4). This thing is kick ass. great price.",

Just BTW: we chose this over the Vive because of the non-need to permanently install the tracking cameras, which is really impossible in our shared dining room / playspace. The ability to set it up and take it down quickly is what won us over on the Oculus.",
