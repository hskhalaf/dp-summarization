The manufacturers website says it's compatible with Adobe Illustrator cc 18 & Photoshop's latest version, but whenever i try to draw with the pen in Illustrator, it doesn't register the strokes on time. The video above shows what i'm experiencing. My computer meets the system requirements for both adobe and XP- Pen. I've updated all drivers to the latest postings and I've tried going on help forums and for adobe customer care. All the advice i'm receiving lead me nowhere and I'm at my wits end here. I know i wouldn't have experience this issue with Wacom or the more commercially known tablet distributors.",

If you are looking for a cheaper solution for some basic work, skip this. Its terrible. (Forgot to add, the Stylus came to me busted anyway.
