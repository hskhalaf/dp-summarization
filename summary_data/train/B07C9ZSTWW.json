The charger stopped working and after 3 emails so far I haven't been contacted by the manufacturer to replace it since it has a 1 year warranty. No matter how good a product is, its CRAP if they won't stand behind it. Note: I have emailed them from both of my accounts and have checked all spam folders and junk mail folders.",
