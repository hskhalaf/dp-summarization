When held up to light you can see thru thin fabric. Runs very small. 3xl is more like 1xl. Sleeves are even smaller and shorter compared to body. Cuffs and waist band have absolutely no stretch or snugness. Worth about $5 at local thrift store. Not the $25 I paid. Would give it 0 stars if possible. Yes this is definitely going back for full refund",

Comfortably loose without being baggy. The hood is lined with a soft black material. The overall hoodie fabric is just your basic cheap cotton/poly blend. The neck and near the cuffs will pill up in just a couple weeks. This isn't going to stay sleek like more modern polyester fleeces such as Under Armor.

I can still wear it but it's not as comfortable as my others, so I probably won't wear it much. Not sure what's up with the maroon one, but I would certainly recommend other colors.",

A lot of other hoodies for the same price can deteriorate after 2-3 months of wear, but I've had this for over a year and now it still has a lot of life. I got during a sale for $20 each but $40 is still very reasonable. You definitely want to buy 2-3 next time they're on sale.",
