      "text": "This is expensive for a foam roller. But it's way better. I used a cheap foam roller and didn't understand why people swear by foam rolling in general. I'd use it for a couple of minutes and not notice any improvement in flexibility or pain. When I got this one, I got it: It's much firmer, so it actually causes your muscles to release tension. Pretty fantastic for everything below your neck. For lower back pain I love doing crunches with the roller in the mid-to-low back. It really releases tension there. Make sure you look up exercises targetting the areas you're working on. A good tool is nothing without knowing how to use it.",

This one is good if you're going to put a lot of weight on it because the foam centered ones would collapse or warp if you put too much weight on them (the cheaper ones from Walmart). So for rolling your back, this one is perfect. If you're going to roll your sides or T-band, way too hard - perhaps I can put a towel or spongie pad over it though for doing those. It will definitely last a long time. Overall I'm pleased.",

I first bought the shorter one which was fine at first. After a while, I found that it was too much trouble to try to stay on it. With this larger one, I can roll side to side as I am rolling front to back. It's great!",

It is the perfect balance of the hard non compressible core with a perfect amount of foam/texture overlay. The only ? is durability, but I suspect it will hold up better than the pure foam ones.",

I have a foam roller that has been a lifesaver in getting rid of the knots and tension in my body, but the foam was breaking down and it didn't provide as much pressure as needed. They had one of these in the chiropractor's office and I tried it out - it's great! If you use a roller often (I try to use it every day), it is worth the investment. It's very sturdy and feels great when you roll on it. I got a short version of another kind that was bumpier than this one (because it was cheaper), but it's almost impossible to use.

It also works great for arms legs, shoulders etc. as well. Most gyms have these, and if you're able to I recommend trying one out before you buy.",
