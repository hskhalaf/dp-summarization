It was well-liked for its comfiness, on-the-spot fit and sizing, and efficient waterproofing. Not to mention, it was also liked by people for its satisfying level of cushioning. It, however, failed in a couple of items. To conclude, the Skechers Relment Traven hiking boot has enough good points for it to be considered trail-ready.",

However these boots just don't cut it. The insoles wore out within a few months, so I replaced them. But within a year, thay are literally falling apart at the seams. I came to Amazon to look for a new pair of boots, and when these came up I felt compelled to leave feedback.",

They are well made, sturdy and comfortable with a nice memory foam insert. The biggest thing for me is that they are totally waterproof. How long for? No idea but it\u2019s nice to have warm and dry feet for a change instead of cold and wet like I\u2019m used to!!",

I've not tested them in wet conditions so can't confirm how waterproof they are and I've only had them a short while so can't confirm their durability. I'll update this review at a later date but it's 5 stars for now. UPDATE: I've worn these boots in various conditions over the last 6 months and had no problems whatsoever, very happy with purchase1\ud83d\ude00",
