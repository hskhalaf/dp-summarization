My only qualm with this ( and honestly it's one that I have with most eye liners I've tried) is that it \"melts\" off of my face fairly quickly. I do find myself having to reapply the product and also wiping away under my eye lid several times a day. Again... This is something that I have encountered with just about all eye liner pencils... Doesn't keep me from continuing to test out different one's though! Overall, great pigment, great price, very creamy. Will most likely buy again at some point if I don't find an alternative.",

The white works for brightening the inner corners of my eyes and my cupids bow, though, which is nice. The black doesn't really stay put when I use it as regular eyeliner. It tends to smudge. Since it's not great for tightlining either, I don't really have a use for it, but I imagine someone with less oily eyelids/more eyelid space would probably be fine (I'm oily and have hooded eyes, but I do use good eye primer).",

I thought I have eye infection and started to treat it . Week later I felt better and used eye liner again - had a lot of discharge again... I never had any allergies before . I wish I could test what it is in this liner .",

A note that the colors are a bit less vibrant once applied and dry - this is not a complaint just an observation. Once dry they will not budge. Excellent value and I will definitely order this product from the supplier again. The color range will not disappoint.",
