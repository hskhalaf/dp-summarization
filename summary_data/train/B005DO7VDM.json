      "text": "It's a great little combo welder that works as advertised but some of the components are sub par. The reason I gave only 3 stars is because the preasure gauge on the argon flowmeter leaked internally. I leak checked with soapy water to confirm the leak origin was not at a connection. It is a slow leak but when you only have a small bottle in your garage every little bit matters. I reached out to the seller asking for a replacement but never got a response. Very frustrating.",

Used this one on and off maybe 6 times for a grand running total of 15 minutes run time. Don't make the same mistake as me, it can and probably will happen to you, stay off Lotos! Not sure what to do now, guess I'll give their customer service a shot.",

SMAW functions well with 6011, 6013 on 120vac, would like to try 70xx on 240vac. I have not had an opportunity to use the TIG function but I know it will not TIG up aluminum. The only negatives are the quality and length of the ground and user end cables. Maybe 6 feet, need a minimum of 10ft just to move around. Other than that very satisfied, lightweight so I can get it down to the boat dock and back.",

The ammeter works properly and allows precise adjustment of power, which is critical for works repeatability. 200 amp are real. It has a powerful TIG welding startup and a very stable arc. On the other hand plasma cutting can cut 1/2 inch thick, quickly and clean without problem. I have a metalworking shop for over 10 years and I think this machine is ideal for field work that require an economical, flexible and versatile welding machine. Finally, the short cables are offset by how light is the equipment.",
