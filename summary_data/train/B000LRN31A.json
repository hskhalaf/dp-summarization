The motor is not brushless and it requires oil frequently so if you're looking for low maintenance clippers, these are not those but you won't find clippers of this quality that do not require maintenance. Brushed motors are more powerful. Also, keeps in mind that these clippers are HEAVY but they cut fast so the problem kind of works itself out. You want lighter clippers so you can use em longer but lighter clippers take longer to cut. If you buy these clippers the fur will just fly of in seconds. You won't HAVE to hold it for long. ^___^",

      "text": "This product is unacceptable. I will return if I kept the box it came in. It became too hot to hold within 5 minutes. I tried both low and high speeds. The dogs objected to it being used around their feet and it seemed to pull their hair rather than cut it. I have been trimming dogs for more than 30 years (springers, setters) and never had this problem with Andis or some older Wahl clippers. I used 5, 7F and 10 blades and finally managed to rough trim one of my dogs. I could not use it to do a good job. I would give it no stars if possible.",

But we figured the single speed is likely to be more reliable so we didn't press the matter, didn't really want a two speed replacement.
