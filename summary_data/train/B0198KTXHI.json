Purchased for my 6 month old to grow into and it\u2019s one of his favorite toys (he is now 8 months so we\u2019ve had it for about 2 months) The propeller with lights is a great touch to the standard ride on toys. The only thing I wish was that the seat opened up like other ride on toys do. This would be a great present for ages 8 months - 18 months as it is on the small side! I included a video of my 8 month old playing on it. I\u2019ll add he is on the taller side (95th percentile for height).",

My granddaughter absolutely loves it. I believe it\u2019s her favorite toy. She\u2019s going somewhere when she\u2019s on it I have no idea where, but she\u2019s going with purse inhand.",
