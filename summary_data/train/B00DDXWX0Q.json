The starter yogurt doesn't even have to be stirred into the milk. Just pour in milk, put in the starter, set the timer, and wait. This takes about a minute.

The size is perfect for holding a wide mouth quart sized mason jar which cuts down on plastic exposure on my food and makes storage easier than the provided containers.

My only criticism is that the lid provided does a terrible job covering yogurt that is straining and I use a plastic stretch cover instead.",
