Upper in leather, synthetic material or fabric based on color; foam sole with Tuned Air cushioning; rubber sole. Origins of the Air Max Plus shoe: the revolutionary Air-Sole unit debuted in the Nike Footwear line in 1978. The 1987 marks the debut of the Nike Air Max 1, the first model with visible Air unit in the heel, which shows the fans the characteristics of the new technology , in addition to offering all the typical benefits of Air-Sole. In 1998, Air Max Plus introduced the cushioning system that \"tuned\" the Air-Sole units with specific parts of the foot, to give greater stability and support to runners. Thanks to the sunset-inspired colorways and wavy design lines, which recall the beaches caressed by the wind, this shoe has gained such popularity that it soon turned into a real cultural phenomenon.",
