This lens is not in a Canon box, it comes with a tulip and a soft carrying case, but doesn't come with instructions or the warranty sheet which concerns me a little. I'm going to do more research because I'm not happy so far. I might return it just to be safe.",

This allows you to capture everything in the ultrawide-wide focal length. Thus you are not risk at missing a more close-up opportunity when trying to get in an ultrawide shot. Sharpness wise, it is a compromise most definitely, but it is worth this compromise for the extremely useful zoom range of this lens. Recommended, unless you need edge-to-edge sharpness - where I'd recommend a TS-E lens instead.",

Corners were less sharp, but I'm not worried about that. I was considering the tokina 16-28 as well, but got this one instead and have no regrets (didn't try out the tokina at all however).",

Canon 17-40 mm 4.0L vignettes a lot especially at 17 mm so I wouldn't recommend it.

This is certainly a lens that I will keep on permanent standby in my collection. That's high praise since the only other lens that I can say that about is the 135 f/2.

I bought this lens a few years ago, prior to an Alaskan trip, and have used it all across the lower 48. This was my first \"professional\" lens. You will definitely see more image clarity with this than with a standard lens. Is it worth the cost difference? That depends on how important those \"once in a lifetime\" images are to you. I have many of those images hanging in my house, and when I look at them, the cost of the lens never crosses my mind.",

This lens takes such a crisp photo everytime. I wish I had bought this earlier. All those places I have visited... I have taken photos but they would have been better if I had this lens. It is easier to get the best equipment than to visit those places for a second time.",

    "description": "Product Packaging:Bulk PackagingFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nBroaden your perspective with the Canon EF 16-35mm ultra-wide-angle zoom lens. Specifically designed for improved edge-to-edge image quality that meets the strict requirements of professional and high-end amateur photographers alike, the lens lets you bring more area into focus while providing greater depth of field. The lens features three high-precision aspherical lens elements--ground, replica, and GMo--that produce even better image quality than the original Canon EF 16-35mm USM lens. The circular aperture, meanwhile, produces a beautiful and natural background blur when shooting at wider apertures. Other details include internal focusing, a ring-type ultra-sonic monitor (USM), and new AF algorithms for fast and quiet autofocusing. The lens carries a one-year warranty. \n\n\n\n * Focal length: 16-35mm \n * Maximum aperture: f/2.8 \n * Lens construction: 16 elements in 12 groups \n * Diagonal angle of view: 108 degrees (at 10 feet) to 63 degrees \n * Focus adjustment: AF with full-time manual \n * Closest focusing distance: 0.92 feet \n * Filter size: 82mm, P=0.75mm/1 filter \n * Dimensions: 3.5 inches in diameter, 4.4 inches long \n * Weight: 1.41 pounds \n\nThe EF 16-35mm f/2.8L II USM is a high performance, water-resistant, and ultra wide-angle Canon L-series lens.
