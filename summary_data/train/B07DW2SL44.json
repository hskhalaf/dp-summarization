None of them popped the whole party and the confetti ones are so pretty! Pro tip- blow the confetti balloons up with a pump instead of your mouth so it doesn\u2019t get the condensation from your breath inside. I rubbed them on my daughters head to get the confetti to stick to the sides haha",

Not sure. Also the helium only lasted a few hours, maybe 4 or 5. They were already starting to come down by the end of the party so definitely wait until just before your event to fill them",
