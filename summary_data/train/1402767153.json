It has information on seasons and shows what region of the United States the plants are likely to be found. It also has recipes and other information plus on poisonous plants and look alikes. I used an earlier addition of this feild guide and found it very useful in derermining edible plants. I found food I would have likely not eaten without this reference. Its great for backwoods camping and backpacking or even desert hiking. No info on mushrooms. And includes nutbearing trees.",
