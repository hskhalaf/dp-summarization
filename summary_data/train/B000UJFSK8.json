I'm glad I tried it, and am having fun playing it, and I know better what I don't want in a bass drum now. I think this head is well-suited towards rock/prog/metal as it is a 2-ply head with a LOT of attack! Very fun to play quick double strokes with this head, and it sounds flippin' nasty when tuned properly but good tuning is a must or it will sound like doo-doo. It's easy to tune on my kit compared to some other bass drums and heads I have tried",

Very nice low tone, warm, resonate (I still put a little towel inside the drum to give it more punch). I also put a Remo Falam Slam patch on it so I don't dent the head like I've done to others in the past, still sounds great.",

This head brought a nice fat attack and had a nice \"wet\" sound, which I prefer for a kick drum. It was a world of a difference from the studio-x it had on it. I ended up using the thinner of the two rings it comes with.",

    "title": "Evans EMAD2 Clear Bass Drum Head, 22\u201d \u2013 Externally Mounted Adjustable Damping System Allows Player to Adjust Attack and Focus \u2013 2 Foam Damping Rings for Sound Options - Versatile for All Music Genres",
    "description": "Size:22-inch| Style:Drum HeadWhether you play rock, blues, country or metal, the Evans EMAD2 Clear Bass Drum Head is a true working drummer\u2019s choice. Named for the externally mounted adjustable damping, the versatile system caters to all bass drum tones by allowing each player to control the attack and focus of the drum head by choosing one of two removable foam damping rings. Choosing the thinner foam ring allows for punch and focus without sacrificing resonance, while choosing the wider foam ring maximizes the low end and attack of any bass drum. The 22\u201d drum head has an outer ply of 7mil and an inner ply of 10mil film for added durability. Enhanced with revolutionary Level 360 technology, the clear bass drum head is easier to tune, with a wider tonal range than ever before. Applying the new Level 360 collar shape to the EMAD2 bass drum head allows it to seat itself properly and in turn provides a head that is easy to tune and a sound that is studio ready. Evans EMAD2 clear bass drum heads are available in sizes 18\u201d to 26\u201d with multiple thickness and coating options. For over 60 years, Evans Drumheads has been a pioneer in drum head manufacturing and design. Now part of D\u2019Addario & Company, Inc., Evans products are proudly made in a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in the USA to the most stringent quality controls in the industry. The D\u2019Addario family\u2019s heart, soul and love for making music is put into every drum and accessory we create, and we never stop inspiring performance.",
