      "text": "You're lucky if you get 2 years out of one of these pool brushes down here in Florida. So, I've been through many of these. Eventually the chlorine and the UV weaken the bristles and they break. Then you have a brush with no bristles. This one fits the extension pole well. It attaches securely. The head shape is such that you can brush the walls, the bottom, and the stairs very efficiently. It does a great job. The pool looked nice and clean, but when I brushed the floor, I couldn't believe the amount of dirt this thing discovered. I brushed it into a pile which made it easier for the pool vac to vacuum up.",
