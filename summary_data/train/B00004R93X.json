I have only used it a few times but it works good. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was due to the size of the pitcher. It is a little small and the lid has a whole in the top so if it were to sit in the refrigerator for a couple of days the tea might pick up the taste or smell of other things.",

Thought perhaps there were too many uncleanable parts, and two removable filters were horribly stained, and was time for a replacement. Imagine my shock when saw this simple little plastic machine on sale for $159!! Wow! It\u2019s a great model, and, for me, incredibly long-lasting and reliable, but could never justify that price point for a new one. Too bad it can\u2019t be purchased for a reasonable amount.",

It does what it states and make some great tasting ice tea. Plus at the new price of $11.00 its definately a steal especially if you are buying something else you might be eligible for the free shipping.",

The only drawback is it does not permit strenght adjustment, so I only gave it four stars. For the price, it's a great deal!",

The only drawback I have had is that the pitcher doesnt like the dishwasher dryer. It deforms and cracks with the DW dryer on. I have replaced it once and since have forgotten and ruined the second pitcher. It still receives the lid, but very tight and the pouring spout is cracked so it leaks. I am ready to buy a new replacement pitcher and would hope by now they are making new ones to be dishwasher proof. -RSP",
