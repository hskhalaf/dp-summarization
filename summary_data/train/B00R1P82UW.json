Bathing with this body wash is refreshing and I like the scent which is cool, because I'm very sensitive to scents/smells. I say give it a try, because I think you will like it.",

Then I had a rash pop up all over my torso. I had not changed diet, laundry detergent or any other environmental factors. I wondered if it might be yeast - the jojoba wasn't working, and nothing else was working either. I tried this (I apply straight with my hands, since I thought my previous use of a loofah might be spreading the rash) and within two weeks it was completely cleared up. I didn't have a formal diagnosis, just a hunch. This stuff paid off!",

This is a lot more expensive for less product and the packaging is poor. There is no pump. The spout in the lid gets easily clogged, so you have to unscrew the lid and pour it out during a shower, which is inconvenient and wastes product. It was worth a try but I will not refill the order. I also bought the Jason Tea Tree body wash, which comes in a pump bottle and has about twice as much product for $5 less.",

The tea tree oil/eucalyptus scent is a little strong while in use, but it rinses clean and the scent does not linger. If using as a body wash, be aware tingles a bit on more sensitive areas, so use with care in \"those\" areas if you have sensitive skin.
