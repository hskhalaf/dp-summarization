It just doesn't do anything other than squeeze me in the middle. Which, isn't bad with some shirts.",

It's very, VERY flexible, so if you are running or doing any cardio with lots fo overall movement, this will work well for you. If you're looking for something that will also give you lumbar support for lifting, this may not be your BEST bet, though it's better than nothing.",

When you wash the belt the red color runs and when you sweat, the red color transfers to your clothing especially if you are wearing light colored workout gear. So be careful with that.
