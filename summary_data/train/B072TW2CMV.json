You really have to hold it right so that it doesn't dive under the curl of the wave and wipe you out. Wearing this on your hand makes it hard to swim though. But, overall, I'm satisfied with this purchase.",

I\u2019m used to body boarding but this was a cool experience as well. It gives you a really nice extra push when you\u2019re swimming and even better base when you\u2019re catching waves! I\u2019ve seen crazy expensive ones that don\u2019t look as good as this one. Crazy good value!!",

      "text": "My son had fun using this on our beach vacation last week. It worked well and was less bulky and cumbersome than a full boogie board. He was able to get some good wave rides. The only downside is that is that the small size doesn't offer the chest/stomach protection that a full board does, so you need to be careful of getting scratched up by the sand.",
