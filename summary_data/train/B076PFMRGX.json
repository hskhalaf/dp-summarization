This leads to very weak coffee and wasted grounds\u2014exactly the result i hoped to avoid by buying an expensive, highly rated machine.",

To clean, I just use a dishwasher pod throw the pod in, pour boiling water into the carafe, and leave it for a couple of hours. The stains will be magically GONE.",

It's a shame that Bonavita's quality control and customer service are so bad, because this product really did make good coffee when it worked.

      "text": "This coffee maker is excellent except for the fact that the carafe is very, very difficult to pour out of unless the top is on. This makes it hard to fill the coffee maker with water and is generally annoying when you try to pour coffee. Secondly, there's no timer and no auto stop so you have to wait for the full coffee cycle to run before you make coffee. These issues have all been very frustrating and I regret buying this coffee maker. I've been impressed with Bonavita's craftsmanship so I'm confused as to why these simple things were overlooked in the design. I'd look elsewhere unless you're ok with these limitations.",

One thing I had to get used to was the level of grinding your own beans for optimal results. I previously used a medium grind on my coffee beans, but this one tastes best with a finer grind. Experiment a bit with different grinds and find the best one that works for you.",

You can\u2019t make the coffee with the lid on. You can\u2019t do the brew and walk away for a little bit thing, because you need to put the lid on after the coffee is brewed. A minor step, but a poor design. Everyone else allows you to have the lid on and brew the coffee. Shame this one doesn\u2019t.",

Quality Issues: 1) plastic construction looks and feels cheap 2) carafe materials are thin and poorly constructed 3) carafe does not seal well and occasionally leaks 4) design - cannot pour coffee unless the lid is attached. with the lid attached the carafe does not fit back in the machine unless the brew cup is removed. Bottom Line - I would not buy again unless the price is reduced and carafe is redesigned.",

No hassle, just forwarded my Amazon confirmation, and they sent me an upgraded model (1900TS). The new model is better in two ways: the pour spout was changed so it no longer slops water on the counter when you fill the reservoir, and the coffee basket sits on the pot which keeps the brewed coffee warm until you put the lid on. Because of these changes and their prompt no hassle replacement, I upped my rating to 4 stars.",
