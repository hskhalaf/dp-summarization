The quality of the material I think is the problem. Compared to the shoes I got and my kids got was much more thin. The soles on these shoes were not thick and the toe part started to fray almost immediately. Unfortunately I would not purchase these shoes again. \ud83d\ude14",

We only use these shoes by the beach so the shoes don't work for us. They not only let sand in but trap it in collecting around the base of the sole. The only way to clean out the sand is to take the shoe off and turn it completely inside out using my fingers to pry sand from around the sole. Other water socks I've purchased don't let sand in and if they do it drains out once you're in the water. Sand simply continues to collect in these shoes making it painful to walk.",

The odd shape of the sole made them awkward to walk in as the base of the toe area actually protruded inward. I decided to donate them immediately as I knew they would not be used by me in the future.",

I have high arches and need support, so cannot wear everyday. However, it is important to walk \"bare footed\" as well. It helps to stretch muscles in feet without actually being bare footed. Super flexible soles so no resistance when stretching. Everyone stops me to ask about them. They say they look more comfortable then the water sport shoes they have.",

Not appealing visually, as the shape is awkward as mentioned before, and the fabric is so light that you can see all of your toe shapes.

I bought a size up because I knew I wouldn't have time to return them before my trip and I was i just stuck with my true size. They aren't the absolute most comfortable, but I don't know that this style really can be and still be good in the water. Great buy!",
