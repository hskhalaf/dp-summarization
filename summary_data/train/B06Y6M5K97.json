This case encapsulates around all 4 sides so it can't slip out...it's held in tight. All the cutouts for the iPad matched and the magnetic cover stuck to the iPad face as expected. The cover folds back into a triangle as a support, or kickstand for watching movies. Good value over more expensive covers.",

It feels like there is a magnet that holds it together when you use it like stand. Really well made and designed.",

I suppose age of the screen protector film was an issue so it was no great loss.",

First of all the color (navy blue) is very nice- not exactly iridescent but it has an attractive sheen and is a soft navy, not too dark. And I was never able to figure out how the stand worked on my old cover (even though it looks the same) but this one works great. I am very pleased with my purchase.",
