I know very well how to use networks, routers, switches, etc. I set it up in range extender mode with duplicate network names for each band, and 802.11r roaming enabled. I used the linksys utility to determine the optimal extender location (quite close to the router). 1. Very little range increase. 2. Significant speed reduction. 3. The router w/ extender handed out duplicate addresses, and clients stopped working. I tried numerous changes to the setup over several weeks, and finally unplugged and tossed it aside.",

It just stopped working making funny noises so instead of trying to figure it out i just decided to buy a newer one and it was a success. Easy set up even if you can't do it with WPS access . You could also activate it using browser setup which is very easy to use. It even let's you know on the screen if you have the extender too close, just right or too far with a range of 10000 square feet . I'll be able to get connection in the yard as well. Great job lynksys!",
