Two years in, one of the wheels locked up, and the handle takes a lot of work to get up and down. Everything on the machine that isn\u2019t plastic gets covered in rust. 3 years in and this machine goes to the dumpster. Too much to deal with to use daily. I had an advance floor machine before this one that lasted 17 years, should have paid the extra for another one. Calling this an industrial machine is a joke. First and last time with a koblenz product.",
