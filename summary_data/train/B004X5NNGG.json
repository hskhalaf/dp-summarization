      "text": "Read woodyq review. I bought this 7 months ago. I've used it MAYBE for an hr runtime as I have 3 other grinders. I don't change types of wheels (cut,grind,wire, flapper) between them because it's annoying. This has always had a cut off wheel...maybe the least taxing of the choices. Picked it up tonight, used it for about 10 minutes...got super hot and started smoking. I'm going to run it until it fries, as there is 3 year warranty and I'm sure they won't replace it on my word alone. Besides that, ergonomics suck, cord is too short, and it gets really hot very quickly. I've had my one Milwaukee for over ten years of heavy use. Still going strong.",

There is an 90-degree handle included, but I haven't used it. The switch took a bit of getting used to as it initially seems to be momentary only, but move it to its small detent and it will stay \"on\". Dislikes: It has the worst gear lash, aka, backlash, of any power tool I own. As a result, it is loud and vibrates a lot. But hey, I didn't pay a refined price and it works for me.",

Update: Took it apart because porter-cable said the only way to get it fixed/replaced was to send it to st louis at my own cost. The price to ship would be half the price of the unit. It appears the failing part was one of the brush boxes. The screw was most likely over-tightened as it broke free at the tab that screws it to the body. I will be ordering a brush box and brushes to get the grinder back to working.",
