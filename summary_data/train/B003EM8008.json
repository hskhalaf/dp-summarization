I tend to go through headphones due to a lot of abuse, but the sound was fantastic and had great bass and great at blocking out other noise. Ordered another set of 4 of these (again because I'm hard on headphones) and now the style has changed. Thinner wire, less base, doesn't block out noise as well. I fail to understand why when people have a winning product that they feel the urge to redesign the product and make it worse. I guess it's to save money. Well they need to save their money because I'm certainly not spending any more of my money on these.",

At home they are left 'around' and in school they are placed within her padded chromebook case, so not the most abused ear buds.

The ear pieces are comfortable and stay in my ear well, unlike some other similar earphones I've tried. The bad is that they inevitably break and need to be replaced. Usually one of the earpieces will just stop working or the casing will crack. I've wondered if it would be more cost effective to stop replacing these periodically and just buy a nicer and more expensive headphone that won't break as often, but so far, haven't made that shift. For now, these definitely do what they're meant to do!",

It does have a button that pauses audio playback (it might mute a phone call too), which is useful. These seem to be sturdy. I'll buy another pair if these last me more than a couple of months. If not, I'll update my review. Side note: Why is Amazon asking me if these are Moisture Wicking? lol",
