He said that nothing is predrilled, so it would be quite a task and expensive by the hour to install them. If you're not handy and planning on installing them yourself, I'd find a different brand. If you are handy, \"Kudos\" to you and I'd recommend that you purchase these.",

I'm glad I took the chance. These are very sturdy and have the mounting kits included. I have not done any business with this company before so was skeptical. Wow I ordered these on the 4th which they were closed and still got these on the 8th. I'm on the west coast, incredible service and great quality and price. I will return. Thanks my restoration is now complete on my 73 k20 Chevy truck.",

My new Red Hound guards are twice as thick and are less likely to crack when I bump that curb again and they look real good on the car. I recommend them highly. Thank you. Jim",

Also, the description of the flaps are listed as \"Heavy Duty: No flimsy plastic here; our guards are thick, heavy duty polymer\". The flaps are DEFINITELY a plastic. I am most likely going to end up returning this product.",
