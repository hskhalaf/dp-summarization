But its too big to do in one speech session It works better to just pull out 1 or 2 cans to work on in conjunction with your other activities. The only problem I have, is 1 of the pictures is completely round and same size as can, and it is now stuck at the bottom and I can't get it out.",

But there are several picture cards for each letter so I just put the ambiguous ones aside. Durable as well since we do this as an activity together.",
