      "text": "I purchased these are replacements for candles I previously had that I loved, but I'm not sure where I bought them. I wanted drip-free candles with straight wicks so that they would burn after lighting and stay lit. Sadly, these candles are constantly putting themselves out as the wax builds around the wick and the wicks themselves keep folding over/laying flat. Would not buy again. *edit - After using them a bit longer, the 'dripping' got far worse and actually turned into entire waterfalls of wax flowing down the edge of the display and splattering down onto our throw rug. I'm revising my review from 2 stars to 1. Never again!!!",

Since the vanilla scent wasn't quite as strong or noxious, I decided to keep them. It seemed easier than to keep trying. If you have environmental sensitivities and need unscented candles, do not buy these. The advertisement is false. Not only that, but there's no way to control what scent you get.",
