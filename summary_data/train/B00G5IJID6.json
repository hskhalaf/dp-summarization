I remember these from when I was younger, and I can tell you, I had just as much fun doing it with my kids now as I did back when I was a kid. Just remember it is sand, and the projects go by very quickly.",

My adult assessment of the product is that it's about what I would expect. The plastic bottles seem cheap to me, but my son likes them and they haven't broken, so I guess that's all I can ask. FYI - If you're a Pinterest-er, look up how to make your own colored \"sand\" at home using salt!",

But as adult, I could see the lids didn't seal enough for sand to be kept in. So I hot glued the tops of each one. There was enough sand for all the bottles to be filled, barely. No room for spills. I had to scrape sand up to finish off the last bottle. As other reviews have said there is barely any glitter that comes with it. Overall, she enjoyed it for about an hour or so.",

I assumed that it would be really messy and not that entertaining. For my family it was the exact opposite. We poured the sand over our kitchen sink so we had very little mess. My kids loved the bottle designs, the colorful sand, and the easy to use funnel. It was also a good way to work on colors with my younger children. Overall very fun and cute.",

We ended up scooping sand off of the table and pouring mixed colors into the tops of the last bottles but it still wasn't enough. Great project, just be forewarned you'll end up with five completed bottles.",
