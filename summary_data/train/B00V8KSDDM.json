It blows so hard that going around corners can cause things to go where you didn't want them. That's evidently what the \"Low\" setting is for. On \"High\" it blows leaves, oak tassels and most sticks twenty feet across the deck. When the UPS driver delivered it he said he had several WORX products that all perform well. Add this to the list. Edit to add: Shipping was lightning fast. It was here less than forty-eight hours after I ordered it.",

I have been using this for 5 months, during spring and summer in Kentucky, and can confirm it is a well built, lightweight, intended for all people (not just professional yard guys), easy to operate, and gets the job done.

I experimented a little with blowing a few leaves around in freshly cut grass - it seemed to move light stuff around easily, but I would imagine heavy piles of leaves might be a bit much for it (without at least distributing the leaves a little first).",
