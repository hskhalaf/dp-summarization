It added a \"books\" option to the home page and there are a lot more customization options in the settings menu.",

Sometimes I put it on charge and come back later to discover it has turned itself on and has been running the whole time. I use it for audiobooks, and the most maddening thing is that it often doesn't resume where I left off but will go all the way back to the beginning -- or will start playing a different audiobook altogether! The Clip Plus was an ideal player, easy to use. Why on earth was it discontinued? I'm now looking for a better replacement from a different manufacturer.",

If you can find an older model that does not shuffle you can get it for about $150. From my point of view they took an excellent product and made it useless.",

About 100 rap, 50 rock, 50 classical, and I had to manually put each one into the corresponding playlist. What's worse is if you hit the up arrow, while at the top of the playlist, you'll jump to the >delete playlist< option, right below the last song. I had to manually re-enter all 100+ rap songs.

(card not included) Battery is excellent when listening to music/playlists. Listening to the radio seems to drain the battery more quickly. My 2 main reasons for purchasing through Amazon were unavailability locally & I had a free trial of Prime which meant quick delivery. As I stated I had 2 previous SanDisk Clip Jams.

I have little issues with every one of them, but overall they give me what I need. My biggest issue has to do with tagging in some books. Once I figured out a way to deal with that, I was happy. There's also an issue with volume on some books. Even with the volume control on high, some books are too quiet to use with speakers (headphones are OK).",

Once Sandisk's \"fix\" arrived I tried to reinstall the OS and the unit went completely dead. No CPR, no external defibrillation, no shot of epinephrine directly to the heart! The sucker is dead and I'm out about $40-50 bucks. No more Sandisk for me....ever!",

I have a folder substructure for my music (ex: jazz->artist->album) but you can only play per folder and not play all in the jazz folder or artist folder. So I downloaded a program to batch tag mp3 genres. Then realized this player can't play by genre either. Also if you use the additional microsd card the main shuffle doesn't recognize and add it, it can only play manually by folder. Or you have to manually create playlists. This player just isn't worth the money or the time to deal with it.",

Most people are using their smart phones for this type of listening, but I chose not to have a smart phone. I do own a Huawei Android Tablet, but this very small player is must easier to carry and use. Glad I read the reviews of others - the Clip Jam operates quickly and does the job!",
