I was pondering the thought of getting rid of the DLP TV because this would be my 3rd lamp replacement in just under 6 years. My last projection TV lasted 14 years and never needed lamp replacement. At least this time the lamp was affordable, and now I will hold onto the TV just a tad bit longer.",
