Overtime, I did notice the beam sinking in slightly, but it didn't much affect the sturdiness of it. It is great for someone who wants to get in practice on a safe, convenient beam. I took off one star because of the slight sinking and because the outside material is so different than on a real beam. While doing cartwheels, it is easier to slip off this beam because of its material than a real one. Other than that, nice value and super fun!",

It is an appropriate length for beginners and is flat on the floor, so a \"fall\" only results in a tumble. The only complaint I have is that it is somewhat soft and squishy so not a true match to a gym beam. (hehe, \"gym beam\")",

      "text": "I bought this beam for my niece who is 5. It arrived ahead of schedule and in great shape. She absolutely loves it. It is lightweight and easy to move/store. Coaching gymnastics in the past I can tell you that it will easily work for her level all the way up to gymnasts working on back-handsprings and back tucks. Turns are a little hard on it, but there are so many other skills you can work on that it shouldn't be a problem. I would highly recommend this to others.",

It's easy for them to pick up and carry around and I don't worry about them falling off it and hurting themselves. I gave it a 4 because it's usage is limited. It's great for walking on and possibly doing a cartwheel but much more than that will be difficult. For now it works.",

Instead of having her use all of our furniture and toys as equipment, I decided to buy her some things to use at home. This beam is perfect for her. It's safe for her to practice on in our house and easy for me to use too to show her how to do different things. Definitely worth the money.",
