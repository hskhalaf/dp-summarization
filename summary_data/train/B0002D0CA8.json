I'd say they are decent strings at a good price. Longevity is average. I always change strings a day before an acoustic gig, so I usually don't keep strings longer than 2 weeks, three weeks max.

At only 0.025\" diameter, I also appreciate the wound G-string (3). Plus, they're very affordable. I was paying more than $6/set for decent guitar strings in the early '70's.
