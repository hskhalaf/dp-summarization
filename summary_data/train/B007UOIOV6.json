I've never seen such display quality, HD resolution, great dynamic range, realistic colors and bright. The 8 mega pixel camera quality is exceptional and it comes with editing features and special effects. Audio quality is the best I've heard on a mobile device. Appilications I purchased for my Kindle Fire were readily available as were digital music downloads. The Amazon Wireless price for this phone blew me away! I highly recommend this smartphone!",

    "title": "HTC One X, Grey 16GB (AT&T)",
    "description": "The HTC One X is a gorgeous Android device sporting a solid polycarbonate body, spectacular 4.7-inch HD display, LTE 4G high-speed data, advanced 8-megapixel camera, and fast 1.5 GHz dual-core S4 processor. This smartphone also features NFC technology, 16GB internal storage, WiFi, DLNA wireless sharing, a front camera for video chat, and quadband GSM with WCDMA modes for international use. The HTC One X offers access to thousands of apps, games, movies, books, and music on Google's Play Store. \n\n\n\n\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\n\nWith the HTC One X, you get a turbo-charged super phone that's bursting with entertainment possibilities. It delivers theater-like entertainment with rich, full audio thanks to Beats Audio integration and a massive, pixel-packed 4.7-inch HD 720p multi-touch display. And combining the 1.5 GHz dual-core processor with AT&T's super-fast 4G LTE connectivity, and you'll be able to multi-task across a variety of apps with zero lag or wait time.\n\n\n\nDual-core 1.5 GHz processor, brilliant 4.7-inch HD display, and AT&T 4G LTE speeds (view larger). \n\n8-megapixel camera with Full HD 1080p video capture (view larger). HTC ONE X 4G\nAT A GLANCE:\n\n * 3G/4G/4G LTE connectivity\n   \n   \n * Android 4.0 OS\n   \n   \n * 1.5 GHz dual-core processor\n   \n   \n * 4.7-inch HD 720p touchscreen\n   \n   \n * 16 GB memory\n   \n   \n * 8-MP camera + Full HD 1080p video capture\n   \n   \n * GPS navigation\n   \n   \n * Wireless-N Wi-Fi\n   \n   \n * Bluetooth 4.0\n   \n   \n * Personal/corporate e-mail\n\nYou also get the AT&T Mobile Hotspot service built right into the smartphone--enabling you to connect additional Wi-Fi-enabled devices to the phone's mobile broadband signal (requires appropriate data plan). This GPS-enabled phone can also access the AT&T Navigator service for turn-by-turn directions.\n\nThe HTC One X runs the Android 4.0 operating system (a.k.a., Ice Cream Sandwich), bringing a redesigned user interface with enhanced multitasking, notifications, full Web browsing experience, and more.\n\nOther features include an 8-megapixel camera with Full HD 1080p video capture, 16 GB internal memory, Bluetooth 3.0 connectivity for hands-free devices and stereo music streaming, DLNA wireless streaming capabilities, GPS for navigation and location-based services, and up to 8.5 hours of talk time (see full specifications below).\n\nCAPTURE THE MOMENT WITH THE AMAZING CAMERA\n\nEasily capture memories and share them while on the go with the advanced camera capabilities of the HTC One X, which offers 8-megapixel camera and Full HD 1080p video recorder. You'll get super-fast image capture speeds--snap a shot in just 0.7 seconds. You'll also get great photos in adverse conditions thanks to the f/2.0 lens, which captures 40 percent more light than the f/2.4 lenses available on other high-end phones. It also comes with a Video Pic feature, which enables you to capture a photo and shoot video at the same time.\n\nSharing photos to Facebook, Picasa or Flickr is a breeze--and lightning quick at 4G speeds. You'll enjoy video chats over Wi-Fi and 4G connectivity thanks to the front-facing 1.3-megapixel camera.\n\nON-THE-GO ENTERTAINMENT WITH AUTHENTIC SOUND\n\nThe HTC One X features HTC Watch--an application and service that puts an entire library of the latest, premium movies and TV shows right at your fingertips. HTC Watch uses progressive download technology that makes it possible to watch videos without waiting for a huge file to finish downloading. You can either rent or buy videos, and if purchased, you can watch them on up to five different HTC devices.\n\nYou'll also be able to Hear the music the way the artists intended it to be heard with the integrated Beats Audio. Every sound is enhanced with Beats Audio and custom tuned for best audio performance with Beats Audio headsets (not included).\n\nVITAL STATISTICS AND PREMIUM DESIGN\n\nThe HTC One X weighs 4.6 ounces and measures 5.3 x 2.75 x 0.36 inches. Its 1800 mAh lithium-ion battery is rated at up to 8.5 hours of talk time, and up to 300 hours (12.6 days) of standby time. It runs on AT&T's 4G LTE and HSPA+ networks (850/1900 MHz; HSPA+/HSDPA/UMTS) plus international 2100 MHz 3G networks. It's also a quad-band GSM phone (850/900/1800/1900 MHz GPRS/EDGE).\n\nWhat's in the Box\nHTC One X handset, charger, USB cable, quick start guide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nANDROID ICE CREAM SANDWICH OPERATING SYSTEM\nThe HTC One X runs the Android 4.0 operating system (dubbed Ice Cream Sandwich), which adds powerful new ways of communicating and sharing while improving on the best Android features: easy multitasking, rich notifications, customizable home screens, resizable widgets, and more.\n\nThe new Ice Cream Sandwich interface features an onscreen navigation bar that replaces the hardware buttons for Back, Home, and Menu found with older Android-powered phones. And with Google+ integration, you can video chat with groups of up to 9 friends as well as easily upload and share photos and videos. Other features include:\n\nFace Unlock\nYou can now unlock your phone with just your face using the Face Unlock option. It takes advantage of the front-facing camera and state-of-the-art facial recognition technology to register a face during setup and then to recognize it again when unlocking the device. Just hold your phone in front of your face to unlock (or use a backup PIN).\n\nAnd the lock screen now lets you do more without unlocking. From the slide lock screen, you can jump directly to the camera for a picture or pull down the notifications window to check for messages. When listening to music, you can even manage music tracks and see album art.\n\nHome Screen Folders\nQuickly access related apps right from the home screen by organizing apps and shortcuts into folders--just drag one app onto another to create a folder.\n\nMultitasking\nMultitasking is even easier and more visual in Android 4.0. The Recent Apps button lets you jump instantly from one task to another using the list in the System Bar. The list pops up to show thumbnail images of apps used recently--tapping a thumbnail switches to the app.\n\nVoice Input\nThe new voice engine in Android 4.0 lets you dictate the text you want, for as long as you want, using the language you want. You can speak continuously for a prolonged time, even pausing for intervals if needed, and dictate punctuation to create correct sentences. As the voice input engine enters text, it underlines possible dictation errors in gray. After dictating, you can tap the underlined words to quickly replace them from a list of suggestions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAT&T 4G LTE NETWORK\nAT&T's 4G LTE network allows for quicker access, smoother media streaming, and faster web experiences. LTE technology is capable of delivering mobile broadband speeds up to 10 times faster than 3G. Additionally, LTE technology offers a faster response time due to lower latency--the processing time it takes to move data through a network--vastly speeding download times for web pages as well as improving services such as mobile gaming and two-way video calling.\n\nBy the end of 2011, AT&T plans to launch its 4G LTE network in 15 major metropolitan areas, covering at least 70 million Americans. Coverage will continue to expand in the next few years and is planned to be largely complete by the end of 2013.\n\nAnd when combined with 4G HSPA+ technology, AT&T is capable of delivering a quicker, more consistent mobile broadband experience than ever before. AT&T has deployed HSPA+ to virtually 100 percent of its mobile broadband network, which enables 4G speeds when combined with enhanced backhaul (via Ethernet or fiber). Backhaul is one of the major pieces of a telecommunications network. Think of it as the limbs connecting AT&T's cell towers with AT&T's backbone network that provides access to the Internet.\n\nTech Talk\n\nLTE = Long Term Evolution\nAdvanced wireless technology capable of increasing AT&T's already-fast network speeds. Now in select markets with deployment ongoing. HSPA+ = High Speed Packet Access\nPaired with enhanced backhaul--the accelerated pipeline between our network backbone and cell towers across the country--this technology boosts network performance. \nOPTIONAL AT&T SERVICES\nAT&T Navigator: This premium GPS navigation application includes audible turn-by-turn directions, real-time traffic updates and re-routing options, and 3D moving maps (additional charges applicable). AT&T Navigator offers several other features to make your commute more enjoyable and reliable, including mobile access to Yellowpages.com. You'll be able to find the closes ATM, restaurant, gas station, Wi-Fi hotspot and more with over 10 million business listings.\n\nAT&T FamilyMap: Locate any phone indoors or outdoors on the AT&T Network. FamilyMap provides peace of mind by being able to conveniently locate a family member from your wireless phone or PC and know that your family's information is secure and private. Want to verify that your child arrives home from school each day? Set up a Schedule Check to automatically get location information sent to you via text message or e-mail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONNECTIVITY\n * Ultra-fast 4G connectivity via AT&T's LTE and HSPA+ networks.
