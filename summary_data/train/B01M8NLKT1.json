      "text": "This heater delivers on all promises! It warms quickly and does focus the heat so you are not trying to warm a large area and wasting the heating power. It is also extremely light and easy to move. Definitely more energy and cost efficient than my other small space heater. When you are chilled and sit near it the heat seriously feels like a warm hug. My cats worship it as a god, second only to sunbeams. I actually had to get a second one so I could use it and not jockey for position with the cats. Great for offices where you are freezing and just want to warm yourself and not office mates.",

      "text": "I was amazed at the heat this little heater produces. I was trying to heat up a small area of my garage so that I could work out there. I tried several ceramic heater and some other tall forced air heaters to be able to work comfortably in my garage. None of the heaters did an adequate job of keeping me or the space warm. This parabolic heater worked great, almost too well. I initially turned it on high but soon had to put it on the low setting. Almost made me open the doors to the 20 degree cold to cool the room down.",

      "text": "I've had several Presto Heat Dish Heaters. I ordered this one for my mother who is always cold. We haven't had any problems... no off-gassing or strange smells. Just plugged it in and it does it's job. It keeps my elderly mother bathed in warmth, so she is happy. Not to mention the two cats, who think we bought it for them! And, although it does heat the entire room I'm happy because I can sit in the same room without being hot. Just aim it towards those who are cold and those who are more warm blooded can benefit from the heat, without having to be bathed in it.",

It easily heats a small room in your home, even when the outside weather is cold and windy. I've enjoyed this exceptional heater for over 10 years without any failures; and had to purchase a replacement only because the first one was damaged during a move. Highly recommend!",

This newer model is more cheaply made and cost twice as much! It also has an annoying clicking sound and shoots out a flash of light when it automatically increases the heat. It does save me lots of money on my heating bill.",

In Utah, we heated our entire house using 3 of them and they lasted, going full blast, for at least 3 years. This was much cheaper than using our propane central heat. We live in a more temperate climate now, so the one we recently purchased is used in our family room to give a little added warmth so that we can keep our winter thermostat on 68 degrees for the rest of the house. Our cats love it and snuggle up right next to it.",

However, recently it has started to smell \u201cHOT\u201d when plugged in. Once this started I unplugged heater from the wall & not only was the plug HOT, my outlet has a small brown heat mark and was hot as well. Really disappointed that I will no longer be able to use this due to being a fire hazard! This is the time of year I need it the most! Anyone else experience this?? Even the cord was HOT.",

Keeps you toasty warm so there is no need to heat the entire room. Costs a third less to operate than 1500 watt heaters.
