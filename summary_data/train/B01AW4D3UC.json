The unit never fell to the ground and was never harshly treated. I filled the tank before work, inserted it into the bottom unit, ensured it was properly sealed, and then left the house. Upon return, all of the water had leaked out and damaged my nightstand and my wood floors. Think about whether you want the same thing to happen to you - - and then buy something else.",

Using the little brush to clean out the insides is important to keeping high intensity flow.

Works instantly and completely silently. KIND of easy to clean but still a pain to get the scale off. I wish you could turn the power light off in addition to the \"night light\" which is like having a 100 watt bulb on. Even the power button itself is SUPER bright and can't be turned off while it's in operation. I wound up taping paper over it so it didn't make the bedroom so bright. A great bargain for the $, light, portable, easy to fill. Highly recommend.",

Also, the mist lasts for about 12 hours on the lowest setting but less than 8 hrs on the highest output setting. So we are refilling it with clean water every day.

The cons are that the tank is too long to fit in the bathroom sink for a fill-up, the on/off button has to be pushed a few times (like three times) in order to turn it on or off. We have to fill it up in the tub. But it does come with a little brush to clean all the nooks. Brush is really cheap, but it helps. A pro is the the top is flat, so you can let it rest it in the kitchen sink while filling it up.",

Will definitely buy another PureGuardian -- but a different model that will be easier to fill.",

Thanks to ultrasonic technology, it disperses a soothing, cool mist into the air and is ultra-quiet, making it ideal to have on while you sleep. A low water indicator light lets you know when it\u2019s time to refill the water tank and the night light feature makes it a great addition to kids\u2019 rooms. PureGuardian humidifiers create a better home environment for those suffering from colds, allergies and dry skin. Note: Run time is based off of running the unit on low speed, also depends on atmospheric conditions. It is important to only use GENUINE Guardian Technologies replacement parts to maintain product performance.",
