I had purchased a protection plan from Asurion and received a gift card reimbursement from them as soon as unit was dropped at UPS. I will try a different brand dash cam next time.",

Company will give you the run around and request you send them money via PayPal to ship you replacement parts and then go ghost.

It starts recording immediately after the ignition is turned on. The night mode enables high quality recordings in poor lighting conditions. The WDR (wide dynamic range) system can record greater scene details, from shadows to highlights than normal. The 6 glass lenses plus 1 infrared filter lens are designed to prevent fogging from heat generated after long recording, providing sharp and vivid images in a wide range of weather conditions. Coupled with a highly sensitive image sensor, the Rexing S300 guarantees sharp and superior video quality. The S300 records Full HD videos (1920 * 1080p) at 30 fps with H.264! Please note: The package does not include microSD card. \n\nWhy Choose S300? \n\n1. Emergency Lock Button & Accident Auto Detection Feature (G-Sensor) can lock current video file for you. \n2. Improved design and wedge shape make it easy to mount behind the mirror without blocking your view. \n3. An adhesive mounting pad is the preferred mounting mechanism. It provides a secure and permanent mounting without distraction, much safer than competitive products. A suction cup is included as an alternative. \n4. Multiple additional venting gills have been added to improve reliability in extreme weather and temperature conditions.\n5. Ergonomic design of functional buttons improves user interface and makes it easy to operate with both hands. \n6. The super wide range lens covers a wide range of areas and collects more evidence details. \n7. The rotatable lens enhances flexibility of capturing either front-view or rear-view of activities. \n8. Premium real HD quality video(1920x1080) for both day-light and night condition. \n9. Top-notch customer care at thinkislandllc@gmail.com. \n\nHere is the BrandNew product: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KLYBNH2",
