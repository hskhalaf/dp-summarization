      "text": "The print quality and speed are actually quite good. This printer gets one star because of the high toner use and poor tech support. After 5 months of use, each time one toner cartridge runs out, they all have to be replaced. That's a cost of about $300. Tech support says that shouldn't happen and they had some suggestions. But the suggestions were useless and they were unable to help me solve the problem.",

We printed a few thousand pages on it, replaced the ink cartridges (yes, with genuine cartridges, OUCH the cost!) and it became unusable for us. I'd suggest testing it out upon arrival to you, so that if it malfunctions, you are still within a reasonable window to replace it.",

I don't know about Windows products; however, by going into the system preferences and turning on Printer Sharing, your MacBook can connect through your iMac and print directly and wirelessly. YOU DO NOT NEED THE WIRELESS VERSION OF THIS PRINTER. You can save hundreds of dollars by simply turning on the ability in your Mac to allow your other devices (iPad, iPhone, iPod, etc.) to speak to the printer through your desktop. The printer is a little loud, but I don't care. The color is strong, and it's a breeze to set up. I look forward to taking over the world from my home office.",
