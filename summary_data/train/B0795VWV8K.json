After trying this, I won't buy anything else. Also, it's important to know, Quilted Northern \"ultra soft and strong\" is not the same. It's not as thick or soft. Quilted Northern Ultra Plush is the best.",

      "text": "My roommates and I have bought this tissue for last one or two years, it\u2019s thick and comfortable to skin. The only small shortcoming is it\u2019s not good for wiping face, and my roommates usually buy another more expensive one for wiping face. But overall I will give it 5 stars, highly recommend! :-D",
