Used it for the first time yesterday and it did a good job of preventing flare ups while grilling burgers and ham steaks. Downside is though that the picture shows grill marks on the steak for this item. Yea unless I am doing something wrong no grill marks are ever going to present themselves. think of these as pan frying without all the juices staying in the pan. Good for those meats that typically have a higher fat content and thus flare more. Good news is that grill marks are possible. Just take the mat off at the end of cooking and briefly grill over the open fire.",

Really no significant grill marks unless the temperature is at or above the 600 degree limit. I suspect people who like these, use them at higher than recommended temperatures. Also the meat juices pool and are problematic. Finally, they require cleaning after each use - not something I do with each use of normal grill grates. But, if you want a grill mat this brand is high quality. I bought it because of the stated 600 degree limit instead of 500. Maybe it's thicker than \"cheaper\" brands. If so, maybe this is why I don't get good grill marks?",

If there's an issue is that the mat has such a non-stick surface that whatever you are cooking can slide around the mat. As such, use good tongs or a good spatula when trying to flip your food. One suggestion is to cut the mats to the size of your grill when you receive them. This will enable you to fully close the lid on the grill and retain heat for the cooking process.",

The Yoshi mat did not do as well in terms of high heat.",

No sticking at all, just wonderfully seared chicken, slightly charred outside and juicy inside. Can\u2019t wait to use for other meats and veggies that usually stick to the grates like shrimp and whole fish. Cleanup a breeze. Most slipped right off then an easy scrub with soapy water finished the job. Bonus: we usually bring two heavy griddles camping, now we\u2019ll bring these to lay over the grates of the grill and fire ring. So much lighter and non stick!!",

So, I purchased another brand made of copper. For now, the mats remain in the original package unopen. I am seriously reconsidering the purchase due to possible health concerns.",
