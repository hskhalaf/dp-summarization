I had the chicco keyfit infant seat before needing to upgrade to a convertible carseat. The strap quality between the two is huge. I never had any problems cinching the straps on my chicco.

The shoulder strap covers never stayed on. The shoulder strap in general were always to loose or to tight. The leg straps always fit his thigh incorrectly and left marks.

It takes a large amount of effort, and when you\u2019re in a rush it\u2019s easy to give up, and then your child is loosely in a seat and in danger. I have contacted Graco support. After a lengthy process of all their requested pictures and videos to show them the problem, their response was to pull the cord straight forward. Difficult to do fully when you safely rear-face your child and the pull-cord is against the seat. I have the Slimfit in another car and you can 10x more easily tighten the straps to the safe amount.

What? So, if I\u2019m going 70 on the highway, and my 1 year old manages to unbuckle his seatbelt, that\u2019s not a safety issue? I could understand if he was 2 or 3, but 1 is still too young. DONT BUY THIS SEAT! We bought evenflow before getting this Graco. The Evenflow was perfectly fine in regards to safety, it just wasn\u2019t as comfortable. My son wasn\u2019t able to unbuckle the Evenflow chest strap, but he can unbuckle this one which was more expensive. Don\u2019t buy!",

Our small newborn is too floppy and his head ends up twisting around due to lack of support. I would say stick to 6 months to toddlers for this seat unless you have an especially large baby. It\u2019s a pain putting him inside. He\u2019s so uncomfortable.",

It was very easy to install and is small enough that the front driver's seat in my small SUV can still go back far enough for me to be comfortable. I used the car's built in anchors because we couldn't get the car's seat belt option to fit snug enough. My granddaughter said it is comfortable and she likes the cup holders. The extension panel is a nice feature for providing extra support and rooms for her legs, since we are still using the rear facing option. I am very happy with this purchase.",

I had one in my primary car and bought this for a second car, just because I'm used to it and because it's like the cheapest seat out there. When rear facing, to facilitate tightening, I would pull the slack tight from behind the seat first and then pull from the strap in the front. Can't do that while facing forward, but it seems to be a little easier to tighten, probably because the straps should be anchored above the child's shoulders vs below when rear-facing. Otherwise, I think this seat is very easy to install. My daughter seems comfortable. I like the cupholders.",
