I have low swing speed and do not take a divot with my irons, so I do not see noticeable improvement on spin. I have always used low compression balls such as the Titleist DT Trusoft for distance. The Snell obviously has a harder core but I am seeing longer drives with it. It is my go-to ball now. I am a senior with 17 index.",

However, for a mid price ball they respond and act great. I would compare these to Maxfli Soft (around the same price range). These trump the Maxfli\u2019s around the green. For bogey golfers on a budget who go through a dozen every 3-4 rounds, this is the ball for you! I want to try the MTB Red because I don\u2019t know which one is better but this black model is still great!",

I get a bit less distance but more height with the MTB in comparison the E6Soft. In summary, the review and comparisons that rate the Snell balls are dead on. I love this ball.
