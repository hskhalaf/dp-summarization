      "text": "I bought this set 7 months ago, in September 2014. I live in the northeast and got a LOT of snow this winter. I guess this table couldn't stand up to the weight of it, because I went out to my porch for the first time since the snow melted this spring to discover that two of the legs of the table had bent backwards and snapped off (in the same spot on both legs). Since the legs broke off, I'm able to see that the inside is hollow and the metal portion is quite thin (see photo). In summary, I paid $550 and got one season out of it. I'd advise that you avoid this product.",

I especially like how there are these screws on the bottom of each leg to easily adjust the table so it balances properly. They came with brown cushions that felt nice but I found to be really plain so I ordered more colorful cushions to replace them. I'd recommend this product.",
