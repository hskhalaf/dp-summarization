I can't imagine how it has changed so radically over the course of a few months. The last three were bought from Amazon - the first one came from Natural Grocers.",

Can you explain why its yellow versus the usual white? a lot of people are having this issue and you havent explained why and if its still the safe to consume. Please advise, I would like a replacement.",

It would be nice if the packaging said more about ingredient sourcing and whether pesticide or herbicide is involved in its production chain. \"Non-GMO\" doesn't mean industrial chemicals weren't involved. I'll probably buy it again, in about 6 months. It's nice to have around, if you have chronic pain. -Account holder's progeny",
