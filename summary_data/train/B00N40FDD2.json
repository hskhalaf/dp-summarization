      "title": "machining quality not great",
      "text": "quality here is dubious. I dont see any markings but I suspect they are made in a certain populous country in the far east. I had to drill out the bit holder to fit the individual bits. It was a couple thousandths too tight and they wouldn't fit. Also the fit between the pilot shafts and the cutters is sloppy and could allow for eccentric holes. I have not tried them on any materials of significant quality - i.e. steels, but I am not optimistic. I'd search the auction sites for a used set of american made pilot bits.",

Either the threads weren\u2019t fully cut, or perhaps the rust fouled up the threads. Trying to screw the set screw in, far enough to engage with the guide, resulted in the screw becoming irretrievable bound. Aside from that the guides, bits and holder seemed to be of acceptable quality but I didn\u2019t get to use them to cut anything.",

      "text": "Good price, but the grub (or set) screws on mine were crappy, and were easily replaced, though! Also the pilot guide shaft was a bit short on the 1/4\" pilot. Others were about 1/4\" longer. Odd! It was difficult to get that pilot to stay in the holder while drilling in a drill press. That being said, for an inexpensive set for the casual hobbyist user, it is a good value.",
