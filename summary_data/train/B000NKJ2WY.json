The only issue with this product is that its read/write speed is slow as molasses. I use it to stream pictures over my gigabit network and that works fairly well. It actually streams my music fairly well also, the problem hits when the OS indexes the drive or any other operation calls it, then you get the occasional hiccup. Nothing major really just rare hiccups. In my opinion this makes a great network attached backup drive. For a streaming NAS take a look at the D-Link 323 for its speed at a good price.",

There are plenty of hacks for this device allowing it to do much more than simply store your files. This is a powerful little device, great for storing media of all types.
