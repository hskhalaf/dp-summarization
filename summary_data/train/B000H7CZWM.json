The pictures came out very good and the battery life is very good. My only complaint is that the screen is very hard to see in bright sunlight, but I think all cameras in this range without a viewfinder have the same problem. Also, the price was great. I would recommend this camera and I like the blue color- it is different from the rest.",

This new stylus is perfect. The battery life is excellent and the image and color quality is superior to previous generations. I have found it to be very durable to this point and I am not very careful with how I treat electronics. A great, compact 7.1MP camera for the price!!!!",

    "title": "Olympus Stylus 740 7.1MP Digital Camera with Digital Image Stabilized 5x Optical Zoom (Silver)",
    "description": "Color:Silver\"Olympus Stylus 740 7.1MP Digital Camera with Digital Image Stabilized 5x Optical Zoom Silver \" Description The camera is available in silver (B000H7CZWM) and blue (B000HTJ6NG).\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThe Olympus Stylus 740 digital camera delivers the long distance image capture benefits of a 5x optical zoom lens tucked inside a streamlined, all-weather body design. The camera's ultra-slim form contains a wealth of features not typically found on a camera in such a compact size, including: \n\n * A powerful 5x zoom lens that combines with Digital Image Stabilization to ensure crisp, sharp images in any situation--group shots of friends and family, landscape vistas, or zooming in on the action at a sporting event; \n * A large 2.5-inch LCD and Bright Capture Technology that makes composition, capture, and review of images in all lighting situations a snap; and \n * Olympus' exclusive TruePic Turbo Image Processor, which renders brilliant blue skies and accurate flesh tones, coupled with a 7.1-megapixel image sensor to produce crisp, high-quality, large-format prints.\n\nThe camera is also available in two colors: silver and blue. 5x Optical Zoom\nOlympus incorporates new lens technology into the Stylus 740 that enables the 5x optical zoom lens (36mm-180mm, f3.3-f 5.0 equivalent in 35mm photography) to bring the action five times closer in an ultra-slim body design. Olympus' lenses are known worldwide for producing sharp, vibrant, high-quality images. This is achieved through a number of key technologies, such as Olympus' high-refractive-index lens elements and dual super aspherical lens elements, designed specifically for digital cameras.\n\n Stylish, Ergonomic Design \nThe Stylus 740 is defined by high-performance, durability, and style. In addition to the all-weather construction that made the Stylus famous, the Stylus 740 features a metal body, clean lines, and smooth, rounded edges that make it comfortable to hold and easy to handle. In an ultra-slim size that's less than one inch thick--3.8 x 2.1 x 0.96 inches in all--the camera fits snuggly into a pocket and won't crowd a purse or briefcase.\n\n Digital Image Stabilization \nThe Stylus 740 includes a Digital Image Stabilization Mode, which boosts ISO sensitivity and shutter speed for capturing crisp, clear pictures--free from the blur sometimes caused by camera shake or moving subjects in virtually any shooting situation.\n\n All-Weather Durability \nTypically, water and photography are a bad combination, limiting outdoor photography options when rain, sleet, or snow are involved. The compact, all-weather Stylus 740 can brave the elements and go virtually anywhere. The metal body construction is durable and lightweight with rubber gaskets throughout the interior to ensure that rain, snow, and dust won't get in the way of great photos.\n\n Bright Capture Technology for Easy Low-Light Photography \nThere are times when you want to photograph subjects in low light without having to use a flash--for example, trying to capture the softness and warmth of a candlelit dinner or natural skin tones in subdued lighting. Olympus' revolutionary Bright Capture Technology makes it possible to clearly compose subjects on the LCD. With specific scene modes for high-sensitivity settings (up to ISO 2500) and rapid autofocus, even fast-action photos can be captured under low levels of light. Plus, Bright Capture Movie enables users to record the moments in the dark even after the candles are blown out!\n\n Bright Capture Technology in Action \n\n 7.1-Megapixel Image Sensor for Superior Image Quality \nThe 7.1-megapixel CCD image sensor inside the Stylus 740 delivers high-quality images that are consistently sharp and vivid even when printed in large formats--up to poster sizes as large as 15 x 20 inches.\n\n Large 2.5-Inch LCD \nWith a bright 2.5-inch LCD, the Stylus 740 easily doubles as a portable digital photo album. The larger LCD makes it easier to view images clearly both when shooting and sharing photos with friends without having to download images to a computer.\n\n TruePic Turbo for High-Speed Response \nOlympus' exclusive TruePic Turbo Image Processor enhances image quality for brilliant blue skies and accurate flesh tones and delivers faster overall processing speeds for rapid start-up, shutter release, and playback. TruePic Turbo enables the Stylus 740 to capture information from all 7.1 million pixels with pixel \"micro-smoothing\" that delivers clearer and more color-accurate photos. The fast start-up of less than one second and nearly instant shutter release time ensures a high-speed response so the camera is always ready to take great pictures.\n\n 27 Selectable Shooting Modes\nWith 23 pre-programmed scene modes, such as Beach and Snow, Available Light Portrait, Sunset, and even Under Water Macro, the Stylus 740 makes it easy to capture beautiful images in a variety of lighting and shooting situations. Plus, with QuickTime Movie Mode, the camera can also record VGA-quality videos with sound, limited only by the size of the internal memory or xD Picture Card in the camera.\n\n Built-In Help Guide\nWith the Help Guide function, each of the camera's features is easily accessible even to novice users. By simply holding down the Guide button on the back of the camera, users can access brief descriptions of each of the camera's functions and scene modes. An improved auto-set Shooting Guide provides users with an explanation of which features to use in a given situation and then sets the camera automatically for the selected feature in the Guide.\n\n One-Touch Easy Print--No Computer Necessary\nThe power of PictBridge technology enables photos to be printed directly from the camera to any PictBridge-enabled printer without using a computer. The one-touch \"Print\" button makes printing a single-step process. Printing and sharing images has never been easier!\n\n In-Camera Editing \nUsers can edit photos anywhere with ease by utilizing in-camera editing features, which include red-eye fix, resizing, adding frames around images, inserting text such as \"Happy Birthday,\" and adjusting color brightness and saturation.\n\n Underwater Photography \nThe large 2.5-inch LCD, 5x optical zoom, compact body size, and three underwater scene modes make the Stylus 740 the perfect camera to take along diving. The new PT-034 underwater housing is constructed of transparent polycarbonate with safety-locked o-ring seals, enabling the Stylus 740 to safely travel down to 40 meters below the surface. Large red grips, a responsive shutter button, and a precision zoom lever make it easy to operate even when wearing diving gloves. Plus, with Bright Capture Technology, images can be easily previewed on the LCD even in the darkest waters. (Underwater housing is not included--must be purchased separately.)\n\n Olympus Master Software \nOlympus Master Software provides the ultimate in digital imaging management. An intuitive user interface makes downloading images to a computer quick and simple, and images are searchable by date or keyword in the Calendar View. Also, with one-click editing tools, such as red-eye removal, images can be touched up before printing or e-mailing. Online support, templates, firmware upgrades, and other user services are just a mouse-click away.\n\n What's in the Box\nOlympus Stylus 740, wrist strap, WIN/Mac USB cable, audio-video cable, LI-42B Li-Ion rechargeable battery and charger, instruction manual, warranty card, and a CD-ROM with Olympus Master Software.",
