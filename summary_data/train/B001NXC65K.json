I can start wiping off the surface with a paper towel or sponge within a few minutes of turning off the grill - the grease comes right off. You can wash the drip tray in the dish washer.

This is one of the simpler smaller more economical units, and as such does not have the removable or interchangeable plates. But it works like a charm. Cleaning is as simple as warming up the unit, and then using a dry or wet cloth (or even kleenex) and just wiping it down the grooves. In addition to your standard usage (grilling meats, sandwiches, etc), you can get very creative. I have cooked vegetables, including sliced potatoes on here that come out great. Even warming some dessert items, such as brownies or cookies, come out great. Highly recommended.",
