If you use it while you're on deck, then swing the bat without it, it makes a big difference. If you're using a heavy bat, and you warm up with the weight on it, it will feel lighter to you when you swing the bat without it. So, it has two uses. It fit on several different bats nicely without flying off. I know that is a concern with many people. In fact, they are outlawed in some little leages, so make sure to check that out first.",
