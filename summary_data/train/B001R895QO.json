I understand of course it's going to be skin tight (obviously) but if you order based on the sizing chart you will most likely end up with something too small. I'm 6ft, 38\" waist, 215lbs and the XL was too tight for me. I was very impressed with the velcro, it held extremely well, the zipper was also on point.",

I went XL (6'1\" & 198#) based in the the fact everyone was saying the run small and it's a bit too large. Should work fine because I'm slowly getting fat. Now about the suit... It's just fine. That's it, fine. It's lightweight, quality zipper but the velco seems low quality and the cuffs should be tighter. The fold over for the neck cuff is bulky and pokes the back of your head when you're paddling. That being said. It's exactly what I expected for the price point. I would purchase again and also recommend to others.",

Not a matter of going to the XXXL because that would be too big on the bottom - just an unusually sized wetsuit - would recommend trying it on somewhere before buying. I have had several Hyperflex wetsuits over the years and they are great products - no performance issues with them ever. This particular model just fits weird.",
