Cranked it until the battery was dead. Had some hard starts this year, but it always did get going. Then, I thought about trying Starting Fluid and purchased the Prestone AS237. The stuff works great! Today, after just about a minute of trying to start the mower, I grabbed the Prestone and gave about a half-second spray into the intake. Once I did that, the engine started immediately. Great stuff. I willalways have this on hand now.",

A little rough at first but smoothed out and I was able to drive to get new fuel. This was only a couple bucks! Well worth it though I wish it was a much smaller can...
