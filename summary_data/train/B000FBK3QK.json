In the meantime I had the TV repaired by a professional who noted the power supply was blown. End result was that my claim was denied on CyberPower's review of the unit. I don't know of any other reason that 2 electrical devices have blown power supplies, but buyer beware- the connected device policy will not protect you.",

To troubleshoot, I checked the battery charge level (~13.25V) and checked to see if each unit would work despite the error code, but they would not. As I don't see that I did anything incorrectly, it appears the manufacturer has a problem in their logic board.",

      "text": "I originally saw the listing for this item, and was skeptical, because it was only $20 more than the previous, less robust unit I bought 13 years ago... and the multiple bad reviews I noticed, were no help. But since it was within budget, I took a chance on it, and now I'm glad I did. It works great, and even communicated with Linux for monitoring, without need for special configurations. If any of the above-mentioned issues are stopping you from getting this unit, ignore them, and just DO IT.",

      "text": "I use this UPS system with my custom-built gaming PC. While $150 seems excessive for what looks like a fancy surge protector, it is absolutely worth the investment to protect a $2500 machine. I no longer have to worry about my PC losing power due to outages (or electrical work, as happened last week) and have plenty of power capacity and outlets for anything at my workstation. This system can even be used to provide more safe and consistent power from \"broken\" or \"weak\" outlets or through extension cords (although this type of use is likely advised against by the manufacturer).",

My only gripe is that the power outlets on the back are way, way too close together. There are far better layouts than this. Anything that is a \"wall wort\" type power adapter -- need a short extension or they will take up 2 or three outlets just from their shape.",

Luckily after I got it, we haven't had a power outage or quick blip. Even if this gives we a couple minutes of internet if / when the power goes out, it still allows me to get my hotspot up and running. Will definitely be a life saver when there is a brown out or a quick flicker that is enough to normally reset my equipment.",

I currently have my main computer and one monitor plugged into it and on average it reports a 53 minute estimated run time, which is a bit lower than I expected, but I also have a pretty beefy system.

    "description": "Size:1500VA / 900W| Pattern Name:SingleA mini-tower UPS with line interactive topology, the CyberPower Intelligent LCD CP1500AVRLCD provides battery backup (using simulated sine wave output) and surge protection for desktop computers, workstations, networking devices, and home entertainment systems. The CP1500AVRLCD uses Automatic Voltage Regulation (AVR) to correct minor power fluctuations without switching to battery power, which extends battery life. AVR is essential in areas where power fluctuations occur frequently. The CP1500AVRLCD comes with a three-year warranty (including coverage of batteries) Battery Backup Supplies power long enough for equipment to properly shut down when utility power fails. Helps prevent loss of data and minimizes the component stress caused by a hard shutdown. Surge Protection Diverts excess voltage away from sensitive electronic equipment during an AC power surge or power spike to prevent damage. Data Line Protection Prevents power surges that travel through telephone, coaxial, and Ethernet lines from causing damage to electronics. Line Interactive Topology Exists when a line interactive UPS has an auto transformer that regulates low voltages (e.g., brownouts) and over voltages (e.g., spikes) without having to switch to battery. Automatic Voltage Regulation (AVR) Provides clean, consistent AC power by automatically regulating low voltages and over voltages, within defined tolerances, when incoming utility power has minor fluctuations. Simulated Sine Wave Output Uses pulse wave modulation to generate a stepped, approximated sine wave to supply cost-effective battery backup power for equipment that does not require sine wave output. GreenPower UPS Bypass design Is a patented design that allows utility power to bypass the UPS transformer, when AC power is stable, which reduces energy consumption, noise, and heat buildup. Multi-function LCD panel displays immediate, detailed information on the UPS battery and power conditions, alerting users to potential problems before they can affect critical equipment and cause downtime. Ultra quiet design minimizes noise during operation for a quieter work environment. PowerPanel personal software provides a user-friendly dashboard interface for controlling and monitoring the UPS. Free software download available here. Energy Star: This model is an Energy Star certified Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) system. Energy Star is the trusted, government-backed symbol for energy-efficient products and practices that help save money and protect the environment.
