Its impressive performance rivals the Samsung Galaxy S5 for smartphone top dog, but the Z2's slick glass and metal design trumps the S5's plastic body. If you're looking for both style and substance from a phone, you've come to the right place.",

This phone is fast, beautiful, and the video playback is amazing, also people have complained about the speakers, well I just came from an HTC with a back speaker, and let me say the fact that the speakers are in front are a huge improvement! Also the notification LEDs behind the speaker grill are awesome and will light all different colors according to the notification, yellow for instagram, purple for yahoo, white for messages, And more very cool feature.",

While shooting in 4k with a compromised 32 gb card (3years old) with .314 firmware, it got quite hot after around 4th minute but didn't close or anything on its own. Although it might had had I carried on. Gem of a device which will carry on for 2 days with light usage easily. From my past experience with Sony devices, they age well (better than Samsung and HTC in my opinion.. but then it could be due to my ownership), I hope this is no exception.",

But because it's not a popular model, the people at the phone company didn't truly figure out how to transfer my information from my HTC one to the xperia. Weird right? I had to update my phone as soon as I got it, because I wasn't able to play ANY videos. None on youtube, Facebook, or anywhere. So after that was solved I was able to play videos. Also the battery rate sucks unless you use the battery power save options. Other than those issues the phone is amazing.",

It also drops the wireless connection every so often. I have heard that part of the issue is that it is running Android 4.4.2 instead of the latest 4.4.4 which fixes some of the wireless communication issues. You can always switch to the latest cyanogenmod image for the Z2, but you'll lose many awesome Sony software features (camera software, noise cancellation support for the sony earbuds, etc)",

      "text": "I just ordered this phone from Amazon a few days ago and I am pleasantly impressed. It's a very speedy phone, not loaded with bloatware since it is an unsubsidized phone, takes incredible images, has a lengthy battery life, and is waterproof as well. It may not be as feature laden as say a Samsung Galaxy S4 (which this Xperia Z2 replaces), but it doesn't everything well and you won't feel that you are missing out on anything. Even though this is the \"international\" version, it is compatible on ALL GSM compatible networks, including LTE. It will work with no issues on TMobile and AT&T networks (and all other companies that use these companies' networks). I highly recommend this phone.",

The replacement seemed fine except the scratches on the sides then I noticed the charging dock doesn't work with it on the magnetic connection. Then i opened the album and their are pictures of guys working on phones and other strange things. Then I felt the back and turned it over and the back glass was not fastened properly and became two pieces quick. I'm sure this is a 5 star phone but not when you're buying new price and received a refurb or jerryrigged device. So beware this is not new and you never know what you actually get.",

Sony android version is nice almost like the plain Google android version of Nexus, just few more apps. Water resistant and a good camera..I think is one of the best cellphones out there and now that the Z3 is out you can get the Z2 cheaper, compare specs and you will see that is 95% same thing that the Z3 why pay more.",

But I was dissapointed to see that the camera got some humidity when I submerged the phone underwater for over 5 min twice. I wouldn't go playing too much with this unit its waterproof feature. I have friends with other phones such as the Nexus 5, HTC One M8 and Samsung Galaxy S5 and, believe me, no current phone comes even closer to be as nice as this Sony Xperia Z2.",
