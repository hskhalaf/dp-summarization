I do miss the view finder I had with the other camera, especially in sunlight. I mostly use my camera for nature photos and hiking. I think it was a refurbished camera, and my great price wasn't. I replaced it with an Olympus 820 series Tough which takes great pictures and has good battery life, though I did get backup batteries so it wouldn't die on a backpacking trip and the LCD screen is very good even in full sun.",

I believe the photos are on par with SLR camera photos I have seen. The Canon A 2100 IS is the perfect size, not too bulky, but not so small that it is hard to operate. The transfer of photos to your computer is very easy with no hassles. I highly reccomend this camera to anyone and is a great bargain.",

So eventhough i very well like the rest of the features, not able to take a pic at the right time made me return this camera.",

    "title": "Canon PowerShot A2100IS 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 6x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-inch LCD",
    "description": "FROM THE MANUFACTURER\nFrom the Manufacturer \n\nYour creativity knows no limits with the sleek, compact PowerShot A2100 IS. Engineered with 12.1 megapixels of resolution and a 6x optical zoom lens with Optical Image Stabilizer, you\u2019ll get the awesome image quality you\u2019ve always dreamed of. The bold, bright, supersized 3.0-inch LCD offers a clear view of everything. Evolved Face Detection Technology and Face Detection Self-Timer give you new control when shooting moving subjects and group self-portraits. Smart AUTO makes getting great shots astonishingly easy. \n\nPowerShot A2100 IS Highlights \n\nNew, slim, compact design with chrome accent line\nThis sleek digital camera will draw admiring glances from across the room! Its design is truly remarkable. Slim yet wonderfully solid, the Canon PowerShot A2100 IS is so compact it fits in perfectly wherever your travels take you\u2014to the corner store or the farthest corners of the globe. The sophisticated black finish is contemporary yet classically elegant. The distinctive chrome accent is a discreet, yet defining design element that bespeaks quality with just the right modern flair. It\u2019s a camera made for those who refuse to compromise style or performance. \n\n\n\n12.1-megapixel resolution, 6x optical zoom lens and Optical Image Stabilizer\nWith the PowerShot A2100 IS, dramatic, personal pictures have never been easier to shoot and share. This 12.1-megapixel camera lets you create impressive large photos of family and friends you\u2019ll be proud to display. The high-resolution 4000 x 3000 pixel images taken by the PowerShot A2100 IS can be enlarged up to 13 x 19 inches. \n\nThe PowerShot A2100 IS has a 6x optical zoom lens that makes it easy to get the inspiring, emotive close-ups that will make your images lasting keepsakes. This magnificent lens gives you the power to shoot distant subjects with razor-sharp precision and stunning lifelike color. You can brilliantly capture a bird high atop a tree, a child\u2019s winning goal from across the stadium or a school play from the last row. \n\nThe PowerShot A2100 IS is equipped with Canon\u2019s acclaimed Optical Image Stabilizer Technology that automatically detects and corrects camera shake\u2014one of the leading causes of fuzzy or blurred shots. Even when zoomed in, you can get the steady, crisp, brilliant images you\u2019ll be proud to shoot and share. And Canon\u2019s Optical Image Stabilizer Technology is so convenient to use. It functions perfectly with or without a flash. \n\nA World of Advantages with Canon\u2019s Technology \n\nDIGIC 4 Image Processor has evolved Face Detection Technology that tracks the faces of moving subjects and lets the shooter enter the frame seamlessly with the Face Detection Self-Timer. \n\nDIGIC 4 Image Processor \nCanon\u2019s most advanced image processor, DIGIC 4, delivers evolved Face Detection Technology that keeps every face in every photo looking its very best. The technology finds and tracks the faces of moving subjects until you\u2019re ready to shoot, then delivers perfect focus. In addition, exposure, flash and white balance are compensated, so that faces exhibit natural skin tones and backgrounds are properly exposed. \n\niSAPS Technology is an entirely original scene-recognition technology developed for digital cameras by Canon. Using an internal database of thousands of different photos, iSAPS works with the advanced DIGIC 4 Image Processor to improve focus speed and accuracy, as well as exposure and white balance. \n\nA Face Detection Self-Timer automatically detects an increase in the number of faces and makes the appropriate adjustments. For instance, to include the photographer\u2019s face in a group shot, there\u2019s no need to rush in. Just put the camera on a stand or tripod, specify Face Detection Self-Timer, and the camera will wait for the photographer\u2019s face to get on-camera before it takes the shot. Motion Detection tracks moving subjects in a much larger range\u2014allowing you to wait for the perfect shot without refocusing. \n\nIntelligent Contrast Correction\nDIGIC 4 also makes possible the i-Contrast (Intelligent Contrast Correction) system, which controls the compensation level in pixel units to brighten dark areas while leaving bright areas unchanged for better images where the main subject is dark, and more natural transition. The PowerShot A2100 IS can even use i-Contrast in playback mode to adjust images that were shot without the setting activated. \n\nRed-eye Correction provides three options for removing red-eye from subjects in flash pictures. 1) Red-eye Correction during shooting actually identifies and corrects red-eye in human subjects as pictures are taken. 2) The PowerShot A2100 IS can be set to automatically detect and correct red-eye during image playback. 3) You can manually locate any red eyes in a scene during image playback on the LCD screen, and command the camera to remove them. \n\nLife doesn\u2019t give you second chances to capture special times. That\u2019s why the PowerShot A2100 IS features an ISO 1600 setting that reduces the effects of camera shake and sharpens subjects in low-light situations, giving you greater shooting flexibility. ISO can be expanded to 3200 when you select ISO 3200 Special Scene mode. \n\nLarge, high-quality 3.0-inch LCD for easy on-camera viewing\nThe PowerShot A2100 IS\u2019s 3.0-inch LCD screen gives you the big picture, whether you\u2019re shooting, reviewing or showing off your images. This high-resolution screen offers a crisp, clear and bright picture. It also features Night Display for easy viewing in low light. \n\nSmart AUTO intelligently selects the proper settings\nJust set the Canon PowerShot A2100 IS to Smart AUTO and you\u2019re ready for maximum enjoyment from your picture taking every time. It\u2019s a relaxing and satisfying way to shoot because you can completely concentrate on your subject knowing that the camera has the technical details covered. Advanced Canon technology intelligently analyzes your situation and shooting conditions. Then it automatically selects an appropriate setting from 18 specially defined settings. So whether you\u2019re photographing flowers, a captivating sunset, or your friends at the park, you can be confident that you\u2019re getting dramatic, memorable images. \n\nShooting Modes\nAdvanced presets for the best possible photos under certain conditions. With 18 Shooting Modes including 9 Special Scene Modes, you\u2019re ready for whatever shot comes your way. \n\nUses 2 AA-size batteries for convenience anywhere you go\nConveniently, you don\u2019t need to worry about running out or recharging of batteries. Since AA-size batteries can be purchased at any store, simply get new ones locally. \n\nThe Complete Print Solution \n\nPrint/Share Button for easy direct printing and downloading, plus ID Photo Print and Movie Print with select PIXMA Inkjet Photo Printers and SELPHY Compact Photo Printers. \n\nThe PowerShot A2100 IS\u2019s Print/Share button makes direct printing easier than ever. Simply connect the PowerShot A2100 IS to a Canon PIXMA Inkjet Photo Printer or SELPHY Compact Photo Printer or any PictBridge compatible photo printer, press the lighted Print/Share button and print! Also use the Print/Share button to transfer images to a computer (Windows\u00ae and Macintosh\u00ae). \n\nPrint your own ID photos in up to 28 different sizes or use the Movie Print function to output multiple stills from a recorded movie on a single sheet with a Canon SELPHY Compact Photo Printer. \n\nWhat's in the Box\n\n * PowerShot A2100 IS body \n * AA-size alkaline battery (x2) \n * 32 MB SD memory card (SDC-32MB) \n * Wrist strap (WS-800) \n * Digital Camera Solution CD-ROM \n * USB interface cable (IFC-400PCU)\n * AV cable (AVC-DC400)",
