The Cons: ~It requires 2 AA batteries for each candle, so you need 18 batteries. The remote comes with a battery, but not sure how long that will work. ~Not all of the candles actually work consistently. Some take a few minutes to work. ~The color of the flame is okay, not as realistic as I had hoped. It is orange, not a white light like the picture at all.",

The flame mechanism is more of a fixed plastic bulb like the fake plastic candles from decades ago, like the ones that people put in Pennsylvania windows around Christmas time in the 1990's. Because of this it doesn't have a random flicker like Luminara or many of it's more modern competitors, there is a 3-5 second flicker pattern that is really noticeable and detracts from any belief that these are real candles. I tried 5 different brands for Christmas presents and this was the only brand to use this much older technique. While there are a lot of candles for the price, you certainly get what you pay for.",

My big objection was that when multiple candles are placed near to each other, they all flicker together. It looks fake, unnatural, and it's a dumb problem easily solved. The flicker should be totally random, not all candles synchronized. Three stars because it does what it says it does and little else. I returned them and would not recommend unless you intend to have only one candle within sight at any one time, or not use the flicker mode.",

Also, when using the remote to change the different functions I have to click the same button multiple times as it only turns the function on for 1 or 2 candles at a time. I\u2019m not sure if I just have a faulty set or if I need a replacement. In order to turn them off I had to manually turn them off as the remote didn\u2019t work. Otherwise they are beautiful and look and feel like real candles",

I love how you point the remote at the individual candles themselves and you can turn them off and on I have noticed just from picking them up and putting them down they will turn on as well So far I am a fan of them and I love the mood they set for a room!",

Nice wax exteriors, a great assortment of sizes - Everything worked from the first, and although they need 2 batteries each they arrived in great condition. Bought rechargeable AAs to cut down on waste. One remote worked for both... but then again the remote for our TV sound bar can also turn them on and off.",
