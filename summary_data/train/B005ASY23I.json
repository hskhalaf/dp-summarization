On the third tire of the Odyessy the compressor just stopped working. Nothing on it was hot to the touch, but the light wasn't on and nothing we did could revive. We tried to use it again 2 weeks later on my Civic but it still wouldn't come on. We contacted the company tonight about getting a replacement under the warrenty.",

Part of the carry handle is supported on the nipple coming out of the compressor so just by carrying this or setting something on top of it all the weight is on that nipple and breaks it off.

I paid $50 for this so why wait weeks to get the same thing for the same price. I'll be throwing this away and buying a real quality compressor. No more viair junk.",

The reason I bought this is because it advertised it will fill truck tires and it did. Noise was normal and the time it took to fill the tires seemed about right.
