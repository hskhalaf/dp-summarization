For $200+ you should get more than 1 year use. My Garmin is over a decade old. Yes I do have to replace the battery yearly but it's something I can pick up at Wal-Mart. Very disappointed",

I really hope that these things are ironed out in the future, at which point I would love to re-buy it, since the actual concept is brilliant as are the associated tools and online applications.",

Read the manual and tips (like turning off the cellular while in use), watch videos online and you should be good to go. The battery last a long time, but probably not as long as they claim.
