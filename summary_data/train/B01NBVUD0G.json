It was complimented for delivering immediate comfort and for having a tacky outsole and warm interior.However, it still was not able to evade criticisms. Overall it can be said that the KEEN Targhee III Waterproof Mid is an affordable hiker that can please beginners and seasoned hikers alike in their on-trail adventures. Its questionable durability, however, is something that might make potential buyers take a step back.",

As I'd struggled to find a comfortable pair of boots, I bought another pair. Fit is wider at the toe than many boots so they fit me better; I measure an 8.5 and these in a 9 fit well. Photos taken after 6 months general use (no hiking, better treated than first pair) - once they got wet the leather on one boot went like tissue paper and disintegrated. I've continued to use them for heavier use (dog walk) and after another couple of months the soles are de-laminating.",

They look robust and the smooth Nubuck looks good after applying G-wax. Probably not the most popular colour hence a good price but who cares when they are wet and muddy!",
