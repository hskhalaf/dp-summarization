The false alarms only happen in the middle of the night. It's hard to fall back to sleep after hearing \"Fire, Fire\". We are utterly frustrated with the device. We've read all the instructions--double checked everything--no dust--fresh batteries--good battery install. A true NIGHTMARE",

They changed the mounting plate, so now the old quick mounting plates have to be uninstalled so I can install the new quick mounting plate. They changed the FireX pin connector to the Kidde version. So while this says FireX all over it you're going to need to do some rewiring. Just to make the rewiring part a little more interesting they changed the colors of the wires. I assume it works fine. I just installed it, and luckily my house didn't catch on fire while installing it.",

That will take about 30 minutes to change. Why couldn't they just keep it consistent so it would be easier to replace?",

Major box stores and some retail stores only have detectors (and not just Kidde) which are not UL listed. Watch for the UL symbol on the back of the unit. It is a better product in quality due to Approval Lab testing and manufacturing followup.",
