She was aware that Garnier Skin Active Clearly Brighter Anti-Puff Eye Roller is not a concealer and not an under eye moisturizer. This product is clear and does not brighten the under eye area at all, in fact, it emphasizes dark circles and also causes a mild burning under the eye. It is false for Garnier to make claims that it \"has a cooling gel formula that brightens skin in just one use\".",
