Everything else was clean and spotless but idk what the heck happened here! Wasn't bought used either. Rock and hard place with time- wasnt that difficult to clean, so I cleaned it up real well and it wasnt hard to remove what was there. Going to keep it cause that's life but will inspect everything more closely from now on.",

Was no one aware or did they not care? Very unhappy...",
