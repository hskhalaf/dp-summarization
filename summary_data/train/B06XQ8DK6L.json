When I unpacked it, the plastic was already coming apart from the zippered compartment and all of the zippers were splitting. Yay, another cheap piece of crap from Amazon! I had a travel toiletry bag from Wally World that I bought almost 15 years ago and it FINALLY gave out. This one took 15 minutes.",

I ordered the blue flower and while cute, it has \"DINIWELL\" on the huge plastic label on the front and then sporadically all over the bag in the same blue color. Does this affect the function? No. However, what an eyesore. It looks so tacky and NOT what was in the picture. It was only 10.00 so ill keep it, but just so others know.....",

The problem is that when she filled it ( and it wasn't overly full) the square piece of velcro that holds a flap down came off right away. This is an easy fix and I can probably fix it easy enough now, but it was kinda a bother on the trip and she resorted to using a Walmart sack instead.",
