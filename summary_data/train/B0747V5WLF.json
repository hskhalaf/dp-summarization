However, it was missing a washer and two screws as well as the furniture pads for the bottom. Luckily, I was able to make it work - but the process didn\u2019t match the assembly instructions. No big deal, it\u2019s still perfect for my living room and looks amazing. Super sturdy and sleek. Just be aware if you purchase the open box! It will be as described but may not have all the hardware due to its \u201copenboxness\u201d :)",

It does loose 1 star because there are screws sticking out on the bottom bars. I have tile flooring and these screws scratch up my floor. They do include little white sticker feet but those do not stay on. Overall, I like this table and love that it matches the bookshelfs to pull my livingroom together.",

I used it in one of my AIR BNB but soon took it out and put it in my place because I loved it so much Pro: it was easy to install/ sturdy Con: just the stickies rubber protectors that they give you to protect the table from scratching the floor sucks, it actually leaves rubber marks on the floor (but there easily wipe upable), and then the rubber protector moves or come off . They need to design something better for that, but besides that it\u2019s great !!",
