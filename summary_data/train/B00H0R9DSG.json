In an attempt to return the unit for a replacement I've found the warranty period is only 90 days so I'm stuck with it. Obviously Gaems knows these screens are low quality and realize the likelihood of something going wrong because I've never heard of a manufacturer having a warranty period of less than one year and 90 days is just ridiculous. The screen also has poor contrast and it's hard to find an angle where the display does the games any justice. Very dissappointed.",

Then once I booted up the monitor, I discovered half of the screen was cracked. Not sure if it happened during delivery, or if it was not tested, but this was suppose to be a new device. Probably just gonna buy it directly from the producer next time, since I'm nervous about trusting this seller again.",

The box itself does a great job of protecting the console (ps4/Xbox1). Especially while being deployed in the desert, you close it and no sand gets in. Overall I'm very satisfied with this purchase. Cons - I have slight issue with the monitor getting to register with whatever console I have connected sometimes. Just have to keep tapping the input button until it warms ups.",

It should have came with more space for the acssesories, a tighter clip on the strap because on strap keeps coming updone, and the television should be recognizable by the console so you can play TV APP through it. Hard to open sometimes. It should have came with 2 locks and keys to keep it shut for the price of it. But the item matches the descriptions well. You do have to be up close to play on that small screen though",

The monitor displays better than my TV at home. The shell provides good protection. Needless to say, it definitely eliminates the need to carry a TV with me on the go. Sound is pretty good, also. I'd say throw in your choice of portable speakers for the best experience, specially if the area you'll be in is loud.",
