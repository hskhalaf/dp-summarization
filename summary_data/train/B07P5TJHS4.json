The sound is clear and these earphones are great for listening to music without the distraction of wires. Personally, I wouldn't recommend this for videos, as, being true wireless they have a delay. However this is not noticable when listening to music. I highly recommend this product. Even at its price, it is well worth it.",

Otherwise they\u2019re in decent condition for second hand, and pound to value well worth the money.",

Three levels are highlighted; \"battery level high\" - 100%, medium 50% and low 20%. However at 20% it's only minutes before \"Please recharge\" is announced and they shut down. I bought for the much hyped sound quality and noise cancelling features. Both are equalled by much cheaper and better designed alternatives. The greatest floor however is the latency against video. It's so bad that watching any video is, while obviously not impossible, quite a lot more than annoying. I cannot recommend these.",
