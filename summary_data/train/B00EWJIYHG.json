Or perhaps worse, if you clean the top it will soon constantly ooze water, or whatever you have in your water bottle. I love the bottle, the strap, and the size...but I have had three sets of these and finally I cannot tolerate the constant leaking from the crappy cap and bottle combo. Nathan, please wake up and fix this!!!!",

He wasn't dehydrated anymore after runs. He used it everyday for months in his regular daily run, until the stitching gave finally and the strap came loose. Maybe they have resolved that problem since. If they have, I would totally order it again.",

If you like going on 2-6 mile runs, and don't like carrying large volumes of water, this might be a great product for you.

After looking at the design, I figured it out and it shouldn't be too bad. However, we shall see how it holds up during the race. Overall, a decent purchase.",

      "text": "I love this bottle and it's wrap! The wrap fits for my hand size a lot better than the Amphipod I purchased a while back. The only complaint I do have is the cap. The cap that is on this bottle is not conducive to running in any nature. When running or walking with this style of cap, you WILL splash yourself. I had to hold my arms stiff in order for it not to leak. It was awful. The bottle and wrap are awesome but, the cap on this sucks.",

I drank my liquid far faster than I would have just so I wouldn't waste it.",
