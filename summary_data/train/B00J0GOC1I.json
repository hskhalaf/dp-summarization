I am so PISSED. Do NOT waste your time purchasing this product. I'm not the type to leave a negative review but PLEASE don't let yourself get scammed.",

The buttons are recessed, I'm guessing to prevent accidentally pushing one, and kind of hard to be confident you're actually pushing them. The buttons themselves are easy to push though. My sausage fingers have a hard time though. The unit runs cool enough to get through a whole goldendoodle without burning your hand.

I wish I knew how to easily replace just the cord or send it to be fixed instead of buying a whole new clipper. They do last a while though I have had 3 of them in about 4 1/2 years and wouldn't recommend any other clipper.",

I have a poodle with allergies & some mats but even with some parts combed out we had to cut her down all the way to skin. Now she looks sad. 4 stars cause they kinda cut great the first day, down hill after that",
