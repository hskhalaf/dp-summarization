      "text": "This is my son's second pair of this shoe - same color, same style. His foot definitely runs toward a wider width so some of the Under Armour are just too narrow. The Scramjet fits him perfeclly and before this grey pair, he had a multi colored pair (same style and shoe). My son loves the fit and they have lasted until he was ready for another size or until they looked shabby and I thought he needed a refresh!!",

      "text": "These are great shoes. My son loves them. I said they fit somewhat small because he wears a 4 in Nike and we ordered a 4 in these and they were pretty tight on his foot. We returned them and ordered a 41/2 and they fit perfectly. They are holding up well to the daily shenanigans of a 9 year old little boy. I would highly recommend these shoes to anyone. I love Under Armour as a general rule, and the return and reorder was completely stress free and easy. I just handed the return to the UPS guy when he arrived with the new shoes 2 days later.",
