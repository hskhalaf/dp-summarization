I'm not a fan of bass, so I read that open-back is the way to go. The only thing that takes getting used to is that you can hear any ambient noise around you. I decided to get the e10k amp, just in case, and it seems to work well. Personally, (and from what I read) I don't think it's necessary. Once I found the preferred amp settings, I instantly fell in love with them.",

But 'weaker' means you notice the bass is weaker when you switch between the two, but you also notice that thunder, explosions, and other rumbling sounds all sound correct in these headphones, rather than overpowering. The downside is that you will hear *any* sound. These headphones provide no sound isolation whatsoever. Cat purring on your lap? You'll hear it if the music/audio is quiet enough. I have worn these headphones for multi-hour (2-3+) gaming sessions and they don't cause my head to hurt the way the ATH-M50X headphones did.",

I have large ears and I find on other headphones my ears rub against the inside of the headphones, causing pain after a few hours. These are not the case and are well ventilated,(on the open back version anyway). If you use hyper Xs, Turtle beaches, or astros its time to buy these and stop buying into gimmicky gaming headphones.",

Not much bass since they say it is \"reference\" audio, the bass was still good for me. overall if you ever find this on sale, grab them! you can plug them to your phones too",

But, after a week I have really grown to appreciate the totality of the sound. Every musical element is well defined, and the bass is very present and natural sounding. These are not Beats, but in many ways they are better. For $150.00 (Now they are $129.00)(I hate when Amazon lowers the price a week after I buy an item) you can't go wrong. By the way, these are the most comfortable headphones I've ever had. Anyone who complains about the comfort of these cans must have a head like Herman Munster.",

Would certainly recommend for home use, not so much in public as they allow nearly all background noise in (unless you want to hear what's going on, then open-back is great :)",

Highly recommend a Tidal subscription if these are your main headphones for music. Amazing for gaming as they are comfortable, and do not cause fatigue in long session.
