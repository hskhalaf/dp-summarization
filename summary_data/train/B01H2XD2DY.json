I didn't hear any noise, not even through the radio. It runs like a champ. Stays cool, never hot. If I could change anything about it, it would have a longer cord. But, I did use an extension cord to run lights to the back of my Jeep.",

I have also used it for a cordless drill charger and it did just fine.",

The switching transistors are correctly heat-sunk to the case and the PCB is well made and well soldered. The only slight negative is the AC receptacle, which appears a bit flimsy. Nonetheless, it worked with a wide variety of AC plugs that I had around the shop, with repeated insertions.",

I\u2019ve ran numerous items on it from tablets, laptops, phones, desk fans, etc and never have had an issue besides in the last couple months when it has a noise coming from the fan (but after 4 years I would have expected it to break along time ago.) this has helped me out when my AC went out on my patrol vehicle and had to use a desk fan to keep cool in the middle of Florida in the summer. Great product, 10/10 would recommend.",
