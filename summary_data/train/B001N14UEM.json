I took this bag with me to my last visit to Cozumel and it is an awesome bag to tote your fins, snorkel mask and necessities for a day on the beach. This bag fit my gear, and the zippered pocket fit my phone, smokes, camera, and sunglasses. Plus, the bungee cord on the front can secure your flip flops or a wet towel if you don't want to get your electronics wet. I am very pleased with this purchase and recommend it if you're looking for a light, durable gear bag.",

I can get my boots, gloves and mask (in it's case) to fit using both pockets and my great packing skills! It is a tight fit for all of this so if you have anything more than me I would consider different options. I do still have room for a snorkel but thats about it. Either way it's perfect for me! and i Love it!",

Most of the time one is sufficient, but I guess I am just a two-shouldered backpack geek. Other than that, it is perfect. I love the capacity. We fit two full sets of gear (Fins, masks, and snorkels) without mashing anything important. That even left a little room for something to go in the outer pocket, but we didn't need that much. The quality is great. It is sturdy, and still has good drying ability when putting things away wet.",

If we end up snorkeling on a regular basis, I might opt for a larger bag or a second one of these, so we could each have our own. One huge improvement would be a dry pocket that you could put a phone, but for a simple snorkel bag, it's pretty good and I felt I got what I paid for.",
