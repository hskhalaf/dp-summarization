I compared Matcha Konomi Akira Ceremonial grade and the Matcha Wellness Superior Culinary blend. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the superior culinary blend! The color, texture and taste is a VERY close runner to the ceremonial grade. Highly recommend.",

I mix 1 tsp in about 1/4 hot water and shake in a mason jar until completely dissolved and then add in ice and nut milk. I'm totally addicted! As a side note, since I recently discovered this, be careful when purchasing matcha teas--you get what you pay for. Some have fillers such as brown rice meal--this one really is 100%, delicious matcha-ness!",

For morning tea with good flavor and the health benefits (theanine, catechins) this is a better way to go than many others you will find in pretty black and green packages. It's way better than spending double the cost on fancy schmancy ceremonial grade teas.",

I keep it for this purpose (just mix with hot water) but I use a little cheaper matcha for smoothies. This one is kind of my more expensive treat.....",

As an aside, I broke my \"bowl\" and instead of purchasing a new bowl to whisk the powder into an emulsion, I am using the aerolatte frother in my cup. This works even better and leaves a nice little foam at the top, that I was never able to accomplish with the whisk. I will be purchasing this Matcha again and again.",
