      "text": "Product was great, quality of the curtain is wonderful; I was expecting some flimsy cheap material and was blown away by the quality of the curtain. Putting it up was 1, 2, 3; My only downfall is that the width of my room is so long that I have to use the middle bracket and it prevents me from fully opening the curtain. I would suggest that if your room is 15' or longer to get 2 smaller curtains. I wish they made longer lengths also, my floor to ceiling in 10' but you can purchase extension brackets/rings to help.",

Both had sturdy polls and the curtains were well made. I was able to hang them right out of the package. Any wrinkles that were from the package, came out straight away when hung. I only have a 7' ceiling, so instead of cutting and hemming the material, I just let it pool to the carpet, and it looks really nice. It took minimum effort to hang the curtains and we had a private bedroom in about 15 minutes! I would not hesitate to purchase this solution!",
