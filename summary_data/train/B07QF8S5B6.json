The lowest, slightly crispy and slightly brown. And as expected the middle setting was a nice middle of the two. Weird thing is their is no brand name on the box and a sticker bar code that says made in China.",

I tried all the numbers near my choice and all I ever got was bread toasted on one side and un-toasted on the other side. Maybe I got a lemon but I doubt it. This seems to be par for the course for most toaster manufacturers.",

It could have been a bit longer as the heels were a fairly tight fit, but I think it will do the job for us in the long run.",

However, some of the heating elements on the toaster I received don't light up, and some heat up more than others resulting an uneven toasting. The toaster is adequate but was expecting better.",
