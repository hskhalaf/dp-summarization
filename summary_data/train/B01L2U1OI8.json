Yes, you do get a lot of false alerts, but they always read \"1\" so after the first couple of instances, you just learn to ignore those beeps.

Occasionally I'll get false activations from others cars in a nearby lane or in a parking lot it will go nuts from the door sensors but going down the road if works great. Occasionally it will be a little delayed in hilly terrain and if the cop just turns his radar on and off you don't have a chance, but I would buy it again.",

Sucks for me... But I must say I've a cobra in my vehicle for the past 5 plus years and love them so guess I'm back to using the old one",

This radar is one of the best on the market if you don\u2019t have $600 to spend on a top tier radar but you also don\u2019t wanna buy a $20 radar that will go off to every single thing it picks up aka a false alert. I\u2019ve had this radar for a couple months now and i can honestly say it has saved me from countless tickets. In my honest opinion it has paid its self off ten times over. Highly recommend this product!",

I pick up grocery store auto door signals occasionally, but after a few trips I know them by heart. I'm impressed by how well this detector sniffs out the speed traps. Highly recommended.",
