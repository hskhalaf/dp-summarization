Now, seeing it in person with only 350lbs on top of it, I wouldn't trust this jack with a 850lb transmission on it to save my life. The wheels are small and weak, the entire jack could barely hold a differential on top of it. this was a huge safety concern and the first use after assembly.",

At the end of the day, I requested a replacement jack, we will see if the second one works. My advice is to try out the cylinder before you put anything together, that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing on the next one. Amazon did make it very easy to return. UPDATE: 2nd jack works just fine.",
