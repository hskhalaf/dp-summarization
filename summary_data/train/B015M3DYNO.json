Your choice is to dim it between 10 pm and 7 am or not. No other timing is achievable. You have no control over how dim to make it. In fact it is rather bright for something that is supposed to be dimmed. Clocks at half the price have more and better features and dimmers. I am keeping it only because it is very large print and tells day and date. I will have to find some film to dim it down.",

This time zone default means the clock does not automatically change time when daylight savings time begins and ends or when the clock loses power.",
