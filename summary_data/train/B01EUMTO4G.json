We had a flea infestation in the carpet, and put this powder down over night and *poof* there were no fleas on my dog. However, be mindful about how much powder you're laying down because the directions have you use a broom to kind of push the powder around the carpet. In doing so, it will raise a cloud of powder in your house, and the smell is super strong.",

The smell is not unpleasant but is a little overwhelming so I opened the windows and doors to circulate air as I was applying it to my carpets, thats when the powder blew everywhere. The instructions say to sweep it around with a broom in order for it to penetrate into the carpets, not a good idea, it was all over everything! Had to wipe down every piece of furniture. Use the spray version instead, much easier to use.",

I use this carpet powder once a week or once every two weeks, leave it on my bedroom carpet, the dogs bed, and my living room rug. I haven't had a problem since I started using this on a regular basis. This is also a way better price than in the pet stores! P.S. this also smells HEAVENLY!",
