I thought I handled bug bites well until I practically slept with them, and my legs were covered in welts from mosquito bites. It was horrifying. After using this soap, I noticed I did not itch as much, and the bugs also seemed to leave me alone! Upon discovering this, that poor bar of soap stood no chance - it was gone in two weeks. I love this soap. It smells amazing and it works against bugs!",

If your looking for some real authentic tea tree soap I\u2019d HIGHLY recommend you try tea tree soap by essential palace.

The tea tree in this bar leaves my skin tingling and cool, and reduces the flare-ups, without the smell being too overwhelming. It's also excellent for shaving, as advertised on the box. My skin is soft and smooth and feeling great. I wish I could find this locally.",
