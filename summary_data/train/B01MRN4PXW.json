The last 3 of which were the 840v3, so when I saw the 840v4 I knew I had to try it. Love the updated look, and the fit is still right on. Wore them the day after receiving and had no issues at all, comfortable shoes for my daily outings. I know these are running shoes, but they are my everyday shoes for me, light weight and comfortable for the long day.",

There's an obvious different fit, too large in the forefoot compared to the exact same size in the prior shoe. NB has also made some cheapening moves, such as deletion of the lace keeper between the bottom two eyelets, deletion of the exterior reinforcements on the lace eyelets, and who knows what I can't see. Overall, material seems to have more plastic, less fabric. I'd take a look at these in hand before plunking down the money. I plan on shopping around for other brands, NB just isn't the brand it was",

The only negative is that I've found the soles to wear down in the front much more quickly than I'd expect. My last pair only lasted 4 month. I do walk a lot with my dog, but I'm not walking enough to see that kind of wear. It might be the cost of having a comfortable shoe that works with my orthotic. As usual, YMMV.",
