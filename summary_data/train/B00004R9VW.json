The 1 acre units are not as durable as the 1/2 acre units. The 1/2 acre units have a metal roof that the electrical grid attaches too. They changed the 1 acre units to a plastic roof that the grid bolts too. There is no support for the grid at the bottom, and thru the normal shocks of shipping, the grid breaks the plastic mounting points. Amazon has shipped me 4 units the past week, and all of them where broke upon receiving. Boxes look fine.",

We couldn't be upset, as we definitely got our money's worth out of it. It zapped all kinds of bugs, which made it so much easier to play around the pool and the yard in the evenings, especially when friends and family were over. I highly recommend it.",

Only reason I\u2019m giving 4 stars \u2b50\ufe0f, is because I had to order a replacement and ship back my first one. The first one had a perfect box, but the actual item was damaged. The metal part that zaps \u26a1\ufe0f the bugs was \u201cfloating\u201d in there. When I turned the box upside down to see what else was rattling, 4 screws and little pieces of broken plastic came out. I suspect during shipping, workers probably threw the box carelessly. Overall awesome appliance \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb",

Looked to change bulbs and when taking them apart, broke the end fittings which are flimsily made. Was disappointed they didn't last longer. Willing to pay more for a durable, effective product if I could find one. Have a little over 2 acres we were trying to make livable here in rural South Florida.",

Cons: the insecticide package that is included has very low quality adhesive and the underside area where it attaches to is poorly made and mishaped. I found that by just laying the cartridge inside the cage as close as safety allows works even better as it allows more heat to warm the scent tray up. Definitely a great purchase. 200-300 bugs at a time being zapped per minute is a good product when living down wind of a cattle farm.",

Easy to do just peel and stick the pad on the bottom and your good to go. This is a very effective device. If the sound of bugs getting zapped bothers you, then you would need to mount it far enough away that you cannot hear it. Very good item, I love it",

Upon opening the carton, a stream of plastic fragments, sheet metal screws, and other debris pored out. There was hardly any packing material in the box, and it had obviously been tossed about in shipping. I put it back together with crazy glue, machine screws, nuts and washers, and it works fine. Since I think my repair is stronger than the original construction, I won\u2019t be returning the item, but i would strongly suggest the company re-examine their shipping procedures. Deducting two stars for this reason.",
