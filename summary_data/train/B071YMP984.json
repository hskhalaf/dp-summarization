The brush is a winner! It is so lightweight that I can spend more time doing a blowout. The tines have two lengths that easily grab hair and hold, but they don\u2019t cause tangles. The brush heats up a LOT as you blow dry. That\u2019s great for setting hair but ouchie on fingers. I only did it once....! Getting this same brush for my mom and my sister. Not sure I can wait for their birthdays.",

It is a plastic handle inside and not glued very well. This is the second time a brush like this one has broken, both for the same reason of the crappy handle.

The fact that it just doesn't blow hot air constantly (it cools down and then warms up) really helps and with all the extra gadgets that come with, you can style your hair beautifully. The round brush also helps in getting a clean, smooth look. I'm very pleased with this product.",

I guess I thought it had more to do with technique and the dryer...but this brush is a game changer!!! My hair is so much smoother and softer. I feel like everyone with long hair needs this brush. My hair is long and wavy and frizzy, but this brush combats the waves and frizz like no other!",

My husband even commented on it! 5 stars!!",

I am also liking the bristles so far and they seem like they will stand up to the high heat of the dryer.",
