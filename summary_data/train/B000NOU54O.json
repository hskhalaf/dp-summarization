There is not enough space between the lens and the slide to use this magnification at all unless I use no cover slide. Also, I keep noticing a dark spot in all the slides when using the under-lighting. I took a photo without the slides through the 40x lens and this is what I see. I was so excited to get this microscope but it has proved to be very disappointing!",

I remember having a simple but solid microscope when I was a kid and wanted my kids to share that experience. Christmas morning they opened the scope and I installed the batteries. We had also ordered a separate set of prepared slides to have some good examples to look at. The kids were able to operate the scope with a little help, and soon were finding random things to examine. For elementary school age kids I think this is a good introductory microscope.",

It was easy to start using right away out of the box, after adding batteries. It's a good microscope for a beginner, that's a step above a \"toy\" microscope. I recommend buying some additional prepared slides, as the microscope only comes with a few prepared slides. That way, kids can start looking at a bunch of things right away without the trouble of preparing slides.",

It's actually well constructed, lightweight, and portable, but the optics are poor and the scope is missing critical features such as a fine focus and dimmable light. I gave a two-star rating based on the price/performance ratio and the fact that you can buy the much better AMScope M150C on Amazon for just $20 more and the AMScope is more than capable for high school age and older who want to do serious microscope work.",

      "text": "You really want to see inside a cell? Buy this one. I've had several toy microscopes in my 50 years, this one is not a toy. It's great. Very easy smooth focus wheel, super easy to get everything in crystal clear focus. The 3 lens let you move through the slides from a full view to inside the cells. DON'T WASTE MONEY ON CHEAP TOYS, GET THIS ONE. The light is also a great design, love switching from under the slide to top light for looking at surfaces. Very well made body and lens, this microscope will go through college with our son.",

We looked at many things - the human hair, skin, leaves, and a slide kit that had many different interesting things to look at. It says it is good for up to 18 year olds.

It would be better if there was a stop in place to prevent the slide from coming into contact with the lenses.

Glad we did - very clear easy to use. It is plastic so do not expect it to be heavy as real microscopes are.",

How handy to have this microscope. The kids got a kick to find that it was a crazy looking furry creature. It looked like a baby beetle with orange, yellow, and black hairs. Possibly a baby lady bug.

Also the light below the slide blinks a bit . Sort of loose I guess but with proper adjustment, it will work fine. Get more of those pre-prepared slides for continual enjoyment with your kids.
