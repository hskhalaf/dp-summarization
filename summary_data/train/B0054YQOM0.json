I bought this USB Internet adapter to access the faster speeds available on the 5G. My speed is now measured at 110Mbps. Though I expected something higher as advertised \"Up to 430 Mbps speed on Wireless-AC 5 GHz band\", doubling my old speed is acceptable, especially at this price. I am a little surprised at the chip itself, since the \"LINKSYS\" shinney logo was anything but shinney. It looked like it was left out in the rain.",

If you remove adapter and let it cool for 10 or 15 minutes it works again. However, it only takes about 15 to 20 min of internet time to overheat.

Linkysys website is down most of the time and they havent updated the firmware of this since it was released. Dont buy this junk get the Netgear or dlink atleast you will have reliable service.",

It worked great for a few weeks, but then that's when it started just cutting out on me sometimes. I'll be using my PC as usual, then all at once the WiFi signal gets cut out. It's a simple fix luckily! I just unplug it and plug it back in. It happens about once every 2 weeks or so. Kind of annoying, but it's not a huge issue I think. I would prefer it didn't do that, but it works, and that's what matters.",

Using Speedtest.net my download speed shot up to 60+ Mbs which is astounding. Am I happy with my purchase? Of course. This tiny wifi adapter greatly surpassed my expectations. Good job to Linksys!",
