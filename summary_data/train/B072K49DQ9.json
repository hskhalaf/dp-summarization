The innersole was simply a hard rubber like material - I expected some padding like memory foam or gel. I'm sure the soles of my feet would sweat after a short time. The insides of the straps were not padded sufficiently and I envisioned red and chaffed skin from rubbing against the straps. Teva did a nice job on the outside of the shoe but the inside needs more work to be made comfortable.",

Kiva support has been no help. Even a quality brand can have product issues occasionally, but the real test is how well they stand behind their products. I am disappointed and will be trying another brand for my next pair. It takes a little breaking in before the straps stop chafing, but once broken in these are very comfortable. This is my fourth pair and I tend to get a year or two out of them before I have worn them out.",
