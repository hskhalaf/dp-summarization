      "text": "This doorbell is working awesome! My disabled husband uses this to call for assistance when he needs it. I put one on his nightstand and one on the bathroom vanity. I attached them with the double side tape to secure them. I have moved the plug in receiver to the garage when doing chores. No problems. The biggest problem was the length of time it took to receive them. I didn\u2019t realize until after ordering that they were shipped from China. Great product as long as you\u2019re not in a hurry for it.",

Tune lasts long enough so that there is no question of whether or not it went off, even if doing something noisy like laundry.",
