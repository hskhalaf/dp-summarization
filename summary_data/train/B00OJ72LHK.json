Now...what you don\u2019t want to do is purchase any U-shank blades for this saw, because eventually the keyless bladelock mechanism will lose some of its spring-tension, rendering that multipack of B&D U-shank blades useless, especially the metal cutting blades. The bladelock mechanism will actually lock the T-shanks blades in places, while the U-shank blades are only held in place by the tension - they never really lock into place.",

This matters because when you either pick up or set the tool down, you have to either use two hands, or risk accidentally activating it with your index finger. Second, the adjustment plate is held in place with a screw that will vibrate loose over time. You MUST check this periodically, or you risk losing control of the tool if the plate gets loose and you pull backward. Third, it pulls HARD to the left. The trigger action is nice; the motor is strong; it is in other regards acceptable. However, I would not recommend this jigsaw for any shop.",

That was the second or third time I've used it since I purchased it, and haven't used it again since then for obvious security reasons. I've e-mailed B&D support today, and may add or subtract stars later on (and do a more thorough review), depending on how CS deals with it. It's still under warranty, after all. Gave it 3 stars since it worked fine before it happened.",

The vibration feels like it's being counter-weighted. It feels good in the hand; very solid and with reasonable heft. Blade changes require no tools; what an improvement! There is a spring-loaded lever that you push upward, and then you insert the saw blade in, and then let go of the lever. How can you go wrong for thirty bucks?",

It is rugged and looks to be built to last like my other Black And Decker products. I gave it 5 stars because of what I see as of quality in its price class.",
