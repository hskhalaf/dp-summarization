Pros *Dect 6.0 makes setting up your second phone very convenient - No phone line *Very Good reception everywhere in my home *Interface is nice, and very easy to use *Ascetically goes nice with the rest of my electronics *Accessing Voice mail from the handheld *Silent Mode! Turning the ringer off from 11PM to 9AM in my bedroom is great Cons *I haven't came across one so far Overall there are a plethora of options. This is a great phone that you won't regret buying.",

Pro's -Good build quality, nice weight. -Buttons have a nice tactile feel to them (I hate those phones that have mushy buttons) -Call quality is good (even in my Condo where there are 5 Wi-fi routers in range) -nice screen -good features Con's -Minor learning curve for some of the extra features, nothing the hand book couldn't solve. (plus easier than most phones) -Wish 'Off' button said 'End' like most cell phones. Overall this is a great phone as I mentioned before. I will probably be adding extra handsets in the future. Seems like this phone was worth the premium paid, Panasonic makes a good product.",

I would have used 3 if I designed it... Bottom line.. the speaker phone is terrible because the other person on the other end is always saying 'What? What?' it gets real annoying after awhile.",

The only drawback is that they do not function as intercoms with the original set.",

It has alot of good features, but the most important thing, the sound quality is excellent! I like having two handsets for the convenience, and the answering machine was an added bonus. I highly recommend this phone system. About the only improvement I would like is to have a bit more weight to the handset, but I suppose others would disagree. You will not be disaapointed if you purchase this.",

No warning when this happens,You only know when you look at antenna symbol that phone is inoperable. Do not trust this phone-returned phone the next day Ordered Panasonic corded/cordless phone,KX-TG1062M. Base is corded and works in power outages and does not have the \"cannot connect to base problems\". Has almost all features of this phone..Good alternative",

Again, feels cheap. My wife has an Uniden and it's a great phone (I got this one so that we wouldn't mix up our phones)...wish I had gotten that instead.",

    "title": "Panasonic Dect 6.0 Black Cordless Phone with Answering Machine and ChoiceMail (KX-TG7432B)",
    "description": "Panasonic KX-TG7432B Dect 6.0 Cordless Phone with Answering Machine and ChoiceMail\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nFrom the Manufacturer At Panasonic, we never stop trying to increase our knowledge of the ways in which technology can improve people's lives. That's why we've engineered our latest line of DECT 6.0 digital telephones with even more innovative features that enhance the way you communicate. Designed to complement your lifestyle and improve the way you live, our 2009 line features big button handsets and larger, clearer displays in sleek, simple packages. \n\n\n\n\n\n Long Range, Excellent Clarity and Greater Security\nDECT 6.0 (Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications) technology lets you move freely around your home with long range and amazingly clear sound. It also assures greater protection against eavesdropping for all your calls. Operating in the 1.9GHz frequency range, your phone will not conflict with other wireless devices such as computer routers, wireless keyboards, microwave ovens and other common household devices.\n\n Put a Handset in Every Room\nWith two handsets (one base and one satellite handset) and the option of adding up to four additional handsets \u2014 all while using only one base and one phone jack \u2014 go ahead and put one in the den, the kitchen, the master bedroom and the living room so you won't have to make a run for it when the phone rings.\n\n Silent Mode Lets You Choose When and Where the Phone Rings \nNow you can program each handset to ring \u2014 or not \u2014 at your discretion. Before going to sleep, simply set the bedside handset to Silent Mode so that it won't ring in your bedroom. In the meantime, the handset in the den will still ring when that important call comes in without disturbing the person who's sleeping.\n\n The Phone That Talks \nNow you don't have to be holding the phone to see who's calling. Using text-to-speech technology, the Caller ID information is announced between rings. The phone also boasts a talking alarm clock that will tell you when it's time for lunch, and a talking battery alert that politely tells you when your battery is low with a \"Please charge phone\" reminder.\n\n \n\n Block Unwanted Calls \nStore the Caller ID info of any and all unwanted callers into your phone's Call Block list so that you can eliminate future pesky calls. After the information is stored, those unwanted callers will receive a busy signal when they call you again.\n\n \n\n Never Miss a Call with the Light-Up Indicator\nDon't miss important calls when the ringer is off. The Light-Up Indicator with Ringer Alert at the base of the antenna will flash quickly to show that you have an incoming call, and it will flash slowly to let you know you have a new message. So turn off the ringer and never miss a call.\n\n \n\n Choice Mail\nWith Choice Mail, you can quickly view and retrieve a specific recorded message among many. No need to listen to snippets of other messages to get to the one you want. It\u2019s one more way Panasonic designs communication solutions for the way you live.\n\n \n\n \n1. Additional handsets sold separately. \n2. Requires subscription to name-and-number Caller ID, call waiting and/or voice mail services offered by certain local telephone companies for a fee.\n\n\n\nKX-TG7432B includes these additional features:  * Expandable up to six handsets\n * Up to four-way conference capability\n * Large-text display mode\n * Handset locator\n * Handset intercom\n\n\nWhat's in the Box\nTwo cordless handsets, one base, one charger, one telephone cord line, two AC adapters, four batteries, two belt clips, and operating instructions.",
