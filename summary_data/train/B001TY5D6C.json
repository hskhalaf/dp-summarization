That deserves five stars. The flowing water definitely tastes better than the stagnant puddles found in regular water dishes. I clean mine probably twice a week or so. The white color makes it easy to spot dirty water, and the size allows the clean water to last a few days. My cat loves it, so I love it!",

This is the second one. I blamed myself for the first fountain failure but I know that this one is not my fault. I will be shopping for an alternative fountain.

They contacted me; the pump/fountain was still under a 3 year warranty, so was shipped a new replacement pump in less than a week. They also supplied a return address label. I could not be more pleased, and I hope that other Cat Mate product purchasers will know they can get original parts for their products.",

It was easy clean, assemble/disassemble, filters are reasonably priced, and, most importantly, my cat would drink from it. Because of these reasons, I bought this one to replace it. The only 2 issues I've had is that: 1) the original water pump went bad about 6 months ago and 2) because hard plastic degrades over time, the cat water fountain will slowly become more porous, thus allowing for more places for harmful bacteria and other microorganisms to grow. But, these are wear-and-tear related issues, so I can't fault the company for that and highly recommend this cat water fountain.",

They seem to be unsure about the moving water and refuse to go near it.

The difference in reservoir sizes is minimal (2 L vs. 2.5L) so we're not sure why. If our cats are drinking more, that's great. If it's evaporation, the manufacturer might want to consider increasing the size of the reservoir or adding a removable/refillable reservoir for a longer time between refills. Filters work great and really cut down on floating debris - cats aren't as clean as they'd like you to think LOL!

      "text": "My kitties like this water fountain. For the most part it doesn't make much noise, unless the water level starts to get too low... but you have to rinse out the filter (or replace it) at least once every couple of weeks, or the fountain starts to get very noisy. It is also pretty hard to clean, because of all the small nooks and crannies, so I had to get a little bottle-cleaner brush to scrub out those areas. All in all, it works well and my kitties use it faithfully.",

I've had it for 6mo now and have no complaints. Works well, motor is quiet, holds a large amount of water - plenty for my 2 kitties, easy to clean. Make sure you take the motor apart in the way that the sticker tag tells you to get all the gunk out. I also bought the filter replacements and replace every 2mo.",

Shouldn't get clogged as long as you're cleaning it regularly (every 2-4 weeks, depending on how many pets you have). You can find replacement filters on Amazon for a few dollars.",

The three levels is a great feature and they love drinking the filtered water. It\u2019s quiet!!! Easy to set up, easy to clean, easy to see when the water is getting low, and when I need to add water to it, I just fill a glass with water and pour it in. One of my cats would only drink out of a drinking glass, but she loves this fountain. Even our large dog likes to drink from it. Great price and I would suggest to anyone to give this a try!",
