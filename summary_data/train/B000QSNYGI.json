It's also tested out well in independent testing, just google \"best protein powder\" and you'll find a few test results. Also some people on reddit ran tests on a bunch of brands.

I tried mixing it with just water just in case instead of milk I and threw it up again another 10 minutes later. So, I know it's the whey protein. Whatever you guys changed, my body refuses to accept it.",

Peanut butter, vanilla, doble rich chocolate same standar chemical flavor. Is still better than other brands flavor? - Yeah although they flavors taste the same still are better than most of their competitors. Would I buy it again eventhough is more expensive than other brands? I don't know if it doens't work maybe not, again if you ask only based on the flavor then yeah maybe I wil purchase it.",
