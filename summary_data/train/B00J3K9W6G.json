However, within 2 weeks of having the mirror mounted on my bathroom wall, the top part of the mount snapped right off! I have contacted the seller with hopes of obtaining a replacement item. I'm really hoping that this was just a fluke and that the items aren't all made with this horrible quality. I will update my post once I have received a response.",

The actual mirror is only 7 1/2\" in diameter inside the frame; the 9.8\" measurement that got me excited is to the outside of the pivot hinges which each stick out 1\", and really, who cares about that. The extension is 12\", not 13 1/2\". So in the end, it's the same size as all the other mirrors. And the metal is not as bright and shiny as I hoped to blend with my mostly chrome fixtures. It does feel heavy and solid, so I may not bother to return it. Still need to trip to the hardware store to buy appropriate mounting hardware to support the weight.",

I use this for applying makeup, extended out over the sink, because I am nearsighted, and leaning over the sink to get close to the mirror was a hassle. This eliminated that entirely, and it looks just fine, and professional, adhered to the wall at eye level. Finish is nice and subtle, I wish I'd bought this years ago.",

The flip from standard to 7x is a bit stiff, but better that than loose, I'm guessing it will loosen up a bit over time. I agree with other posters: Mounting to drywalls with the provided mollies is probably not going to give you the needed stability. There are BIG mollies that screw into the drywall that will give you a better mount. You could also use a butterfly type very easily with this particular mounting plate... there is plenty of room. In fact, that would be my preferred fastener if I couldn't get it into a stud.",

It was easy to install, the stiff joints (which another reviewer did not like) help to maintain stability in any position and the quality of the metal framework is excellent. I haven't used the magnification yet, but the regular mirror is excellent. I am very pleased with my purchase. I use it daily for makeup application and blow drying my hair. I will gladly get this product again.",

However, if you position it the way you like to use it, then just swing the whole arm back (instead of folding it up) then it works great!! It's the short arm that's tight, so I don't move the short arm, just the long arm. In fact, it makes it quick and easy to use because when I pull it out, the mirror is all set for me. For the price, I'm thrilled! Yes, I would highly recommend this mirror.",
