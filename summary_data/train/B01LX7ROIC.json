      "title": "Great on-ear noise cancelling option for those wary of bulky over-ears",
      "text": "While there are certainly over-ear options from other companies that can provide great sound and noise isolation, these headphones were also very impressive in these areas given their smaller form factor for travelling and commuting. It seemed to check all the major boxes in terms of great sound quality, effective noise cancelling, wired use without power, touch controls (though this was the only area where the headphones were a little slow to respond), sensors for pausing (upon removing them), strong battery life and relatively small form factor. One added bonus was the ability to switch through a few levels of noise-cancelling intensity directly from the headphones (in addition to the app), which some other models do not permit.",

      "text": "Fantastic quality, great ANC that does a very decent job blocking out even voices (within good reason). Very good pass through function (voices/sound comes through the mic), and great touch controls. Super demanding listeners might be bothered by a mild hiss sound at max ANC, but then they should pay about 2.5 times more to get a competitive solution. Super like the detailing with the illuminated logo. App does what it's meant to. Good thing it's there.",

      "title": "Excellent on-ear headphone for noise cancellation",
      "text": "Pros: - 4 Optional levels of noise cancellation. - Nice-looking appearance - Easy to control with gestures Cons: - If you use glasses, it's better to use over-ear or in-ear headphones. Wearing on-ear ones, including this, makes me feel uncomfortable, especially when you need to push your glasses... - It gets dirty easily (the white one) - The headphone interface is too sensitive. I cannot wear it when lying. Anyway, if you need a headphone to deal with the noise when commuting, it's a good choice. It's certainly one of the best headphones I've used, in terms of noise cancellation. But it's hard to wear it for a long time.",

Wouldn\u2019t have paid full price for these but at only \u00a3117 they are a bargain in my view and absolutely the best i\u2019ve tried under \u00a3150. Love the fact you don\u2019t look like a cyber man (fool) when you\u2019re wearing them as well, unlike virtually every other headset on the market. I read a review somewhere that these have a Sonos type experience, which I agree with, right down to the packaging. Classy product.",

They are not the cheapest but I think the price is definitely borne out in the overall quality, style and usability of the product. I am really enjoying using them. They are very comfortable, the noise-cancelling function is excellent and the controls are responsive and easy to use (but not so responsive that you keep accidentally turning them off or skipping tracks). The only improvement would be if they came with a hard case, as opposed to the soft one included.",

The noise cancelling is superb, dynamic tracks are easy going even by busy roads. Metal legs at the point where plastic often cracks. They fit well even on my huge head. They look great. Cons: The fabric will collect sweat and dirt. Not so easy to clean. Slip off my baldy head a little too easily. They're great though. Big recommend.",

These were discounted on amazon so went for them. They're very comfortable and the noise cancellation works really well. Music is clear and i have tried a wide range of music and it all seems good. Only thing i'd say is the buttons on the side seem to respond to my hair which is somewhat annoying to say the least! But thats a small annoyance which I can cope with to finally have some decent bluetooth headphones.",

The noise cancellation feature is very effective. Battery life easily survives a day out and about and the padded cups and headband make it very comfortable to wear. There is a built-in microphone on one of the ear cups which works moderately well and has good sound pickup. Included accessories are a 3.5mm cable for backup use with non-Bluetooth devices, and a micro-USB charging cable.",
