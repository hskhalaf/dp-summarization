One can insert frozen bread for there is a selection to indicated you are using frozen bread. A big thing for me, is that when the lever is depressed to begin toasting, it is securely in place. Some toasters in the past would release and have to be re-pressed. When the toast is done, a definte click can be heard. The lever can be raised slightly to retrieve toast that is shallower. Sound like an ad, but I am so happy with something we use daily.",

The bad news is that after 2 years the left two toaster slots will not stay down anymore. What is so hard about producing a toaster that works???? This product is warranted for 3 years.

It would feel much better if there was more resistance, or even indents or 'clicks' for the settings. The lack of resistance for the dials adjustment settings makes an otherwise nice product feel cheap. Also, don't forget to take the cardboard out of the slot before you use it for the first time!",

It will always be far lighter at the top than at the bottom. It seems worse on bagels than toast. The only way to toast really evenly is to stop halfway through and turn them top to bottom. Probably should have just sent it back.",

Waffles have to be rotated and flipped between the two cycles it takes to cook them to the level I like. The toaster looks nice but everything about it feels cheaply made.

I looked inside and it appears they use electronic sensors on each side to tell the toaster to lock down the handles and start the timer(s). In this case, a mechanical lock-down would have been preferable as it would be very unlikely to fail. The replacement is the same model and we hope it also lasts at least as long.",

    "description": "Cuisinart Metal Classic Toaster. Cuisinart's Metal Classic Toaster has a smooth brushed stainless housing with polished chrome and black accents. Its custom controls let you defrost and toast bagels and bread -- just the way you want them Press any of the four buttons, bagels, reheat, defrost and cancel, to fit your toasting needs. The browning control sets the desired toast color from light to dark, with six browning levels. Product Features Smooth brushed stainless housing with polished chrome and black accents Custom control: 6-setting browning dials, dual reheat, defrost and bagel buttons with LED indicators 1-1/2-inch wide toasting slots Extra-lift carriage lever Slide-out crumb tray Convenient cord wrap Instruction book Limited 3-year warranty Toasting Tips Toasting is a combination of cooking and drying of the bread. Therefore, differences in moisture level from one bread to another can result in varying toasting times. For slightly dry bread, use a lower setting than you normally would. For very fresh bread or whole wheat bread, use a higher setting than normal. Breads with very uneven surfaces (such as English muffins) will require a higher toast setting. Thickly cut pieces of bread (including bagels) will take longer to toast, sometimes significantly longer, since more moisture must be evaporated from the bread before toasting can occur. Very thick pieces may require two cycles. Cleaning and Maintenance Always allow the toaster to cool completely before cleaning. Do not use abrasive cleansers. Simply wipe the exterior with a clean damp cloth and dry thoroughly. Apply any cleansing agent to a cloth, not to the toaster, before cleaning. To remove crumbs, slide out the crumb tray and discard crumbs. Wipe clean and replace. Never operate the toaster without the crumb tray in place. To remove any pieces of bread remaining in the toaster, turn the toaster upside down and gently shake. Never insert any hard or sharp instruments into the slot, as this could damage the toaster and cause a safety hazard. Never wrap the cord around the outside of the toaster. Use the cord storage cleats on the underside of the toaster. Product Dimensions The Cuisinart 2-Slice Metal Classic Toaster measures approximately 10.75\" x 7.13\" x 7.13\". The 4-Slice Metal Classic Toaster measures approximately 11.15\" x 10.65\" x 7.5\". Warranty The Cuisinart Metal Classic Toaster has a limited 3-year warranty. Do not touch hot surfaces.
