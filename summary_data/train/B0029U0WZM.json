      "text": "I am very pleased so far with my Sony A330. It met one of my key requirements: it had to use my (pretty old) Minolta lenses, and they both fit and work perfectly. I was surprised, however, that I have to choose between the regular viewfinder and the video screen. I thought that even if I was looking through the viewfinder, the image would still appear on the screen. This hasn't affected my use of the camera, and my pictures are beautifully clear and sharp regardless of how I view them. I am delighted with my new purchase and looking forward to lots of great pictures, especially once I read the owner's manual!",

    "title": "Sony Alpha A380L 14.2 MP Digital SLR Camera with Super SteadyShot INSIDE Image Stabilization and 18-55mm Lens",
    "description": "Configuration:14.2 MPFROM THE MANUFACTURER\n\n\nThe Sony a380 DSLR camera brings you the freedom of Live View, which lets you compose and shoot photos using a tiltable 2.7-inch (diag.) LCD screen. SteadyShot INSIDE in-camera image stabilization reduces blur in every shot, while 14.2-megapixel resolution preserves those special moments in spectacular clarity and detail. \n\nSony Alpha a380 Highlights \n\n\n\n2.7-inch (diag.) Clear Photo LCD Plus featuring Live View with Quick Auto Focus\nA large 2.7-inch (diag.) Clear Photo LCD Plus display features Live View with Quick Auto Focus, which lets you compose and shoot pictures in real-time using the LCD, just as you would with a point-and-shoot camera. In addition, the LCD display tilts up or down for low or high-angle shooting situations, such as capturing a child\u2019s first steps or shooting over a crowd. \n\n14.2-megapixel resolution for ultra-fine detail\nA 14.2-megapixel APS-size CCD image sensor captures your images in spectacular, high-resolution detail, giving you the freedom to make large prints and tight crops without sacrificing quality. \n\nSteadyShot INSIDE in-camera image stabilization\nSteadyShot INSIDE in-camera image stabilization is built into each camera body, so every a-mount lens benefits from the ability to minimize blur due to camera shake. \n\nLightweightand stylish body\nThe DSLR-A380 features a stylish, modern design with an intuitive button layout for easier operation. In addition, the lightweight body and revised grip make the camera more comfortable to hold and carry. \n\nIntegrated on-screen Help Guide and Graphic Display\nAn integrated on-screen Help Guide and Graphic Display help take the complexity out of DSLR photography. The Help Guide offers clear, concise explanations of various modes and settings, while the Graphic Display helps you understand the relationship between aperture and shutter speed, as well as the effect each has on photographic results. \n\nHDMI terminal and BRAVIA Sync compatibility\nAn HDMI terminal gives you the option of connecting your camera to a compatible HDTV and playing back your images in stunning high definition quality(HDMI cable required, sold separately). In addition, BRAVIA Sync works with compatible Sony BRAVIA HDTVs to let you control camera playback using the television\u2019s remote (HDMI cable and BRAVIA Sync capable HDTV required, sold separately). \n\nHigh sensitivity (ISO 3200) for superior noise reduction\nA broad sensitivity range from ISO 100 to ISO 3200 enables you to capture beautiful color images even in very dim light -- with High ISO Noise Reduction technology that reduces picture noise artifacts at high-sensitivity ISO 1600 and ISO 3200 settings by eliminating noise from RAW data after analog-to-digital conversion. \n\nEye-Start Autofocus\nEye-Start Autofocus System begins precision autofocus adjustments the moment you raise the camera to your eye, so the camera is ready to catch the perfect moment. \n\n9-Point AF Sensor\n9-Point Center Cross AF Sensor with improved focus control to help bring images into sharp definition more quickly, and predictive focus control automatically calculates the position of fast-moving subjects. \n\nUp to 2.5 fps continuous shooting\nContinuous Shooting lets you shoot at up to 2.5 fps (frames per second) while viewing your subject through the optical viewfinder so you never lose track of the action. \n\nCreative Style settings\nCreative Style settings give you control over how the camera processes your images. Choose from 8 finishing styles, including Standard, Vivid, Potrait, Landscape, Night View, Sunset, B&W, and Adobe RGB, and fine tune them to your personal taste with the ability to adjust contrast, saturation, and sharpness settings. \n\nDynamic Range Optimizer\nDynamic Range Optimizer provides two levels--Standard/Plus to improve results with backlit subjects and recover details hidden in shadows or lost in glare. Normal DRO improves detail using standard gamma curves for fast shot-to-shot response time, while Advanced DRO adjusts dynamic range area-by-area for greater accuracy. \n\nBuilt-in Pop-Up Flash\nThe Auto Pop-Up Flash automatically pops up and fires as needed when the camera is set to certain scene selection modes, helping first-time DSLR photographers shoot more effectively. In addition, the a380 features an integrated hot shoe, which lets you expand your lighting options with a range of accessory flashes (sold separately). \n\nAnti-Dust Technology\nAnti-Dust Technology helps keep the CCD imager clean, resulting in consistently better pictures, by utilizing a static-free anti-dust coating on the CCD filter, as well as an anti-dust vibration that automatically shakes the CCD to help dislodge dust each time the camera is shut off. \n\nStamina Battery power \nStamina Battery power allows you to take up to 500 shots on a fully charged NP-FM50 InfoLITHIUM battery when using the optical viewfinder mode, and you\u2019ll be able to see how much power remains in percentage increments, so you can keep shooting in confidence. \n\nSmart Teleconverter 2x Digital Zoom\nSmart Teleconverter 2x Digital Zoom lets you zoom in electronically on your subject and reproduces pixels on a 1:1 basis so there\u2019s no degradation in picture quality. One touch zooms in at 1.4X, while the second touch advances to 2x zoom -- creating the 35mm equivalent of a telephoto effect with the camera\u2019s standard 18-55mm optical zoom lens. \n\nBIONZ image processor\nThe advanced BIONZ image processor uses hardware-based Large Scale Integrated (LSI) circuitry to enhance images with rich tonal reproduction, reduced noise, and improved white balance and exposure control, for clear, sharp photos even at high sensitivity settings. \n\nPhotoTV HD compatibility\nPhotoTV HD compatibility lets you automatically create high-resolution thumbnails optimized for viewing on a compatible Sony BRAVIA HDTV. \n\nScene Selection Modes\nScene Selection Modes optimize camera settings for different shooting situations. Just turn the Mode Dial to select from Portrait, Landscape, Macro, Sports, Sunset, and Night View modes. \n\nIndex and Slide Show Display\nIndex and Slide Show Display enable you to quickly review your photos using 4, 9 or 25-frame index views, or as an automatic slide show with fade-in/fade-out effect. \n\nFunction Guide Display\nFunction Guide Display provides intuitive and easy to use on-screen menus that can be activated and operated with one hand using the Fn (Function) button and controller button to adjust Flash mode, Autofocus mode, White Balance, Metering mode, AF area and D-Range Optimizer. \n\nDual slot Compatibility for Memory Stick and SD media\nCompatible with high-capacity Memory Stick PRO Duo, Memory Stick PRO-HG Duo and SD/SDHC media (sold separately) for convenient storage and sharing of your images.",
