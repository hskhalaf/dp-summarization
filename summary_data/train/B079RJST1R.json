Not sure what people pack but there is no way I could fit enough stuff in the suitcase. The pockets for underwear and socks are ridiculously small. Finally there is not even a way to extend size as is usual on much cheaper bags.",

I was surprised at how much I could pack and the compartments will help me to stay organized. I plan to use a small backpack as my personal item (tortuga 27 L) that opens and is compartmentalized like a suitcase. It may be stretching the size limit for a personal item but if packed lightly it should easily fit under the seat.",
