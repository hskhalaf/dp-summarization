There is no warranty or link to promised EBook...basically this unit looks identical to the other 20 billion on amazon....most for half the price. I liked the videos the creator had done, he seemed like a good guy. Just disappointed for him. And sad that Amazon keeps peddling incorrect information about a company that went under 7 months ago....I hope someone is going to read this and tell me I\u2019m wrong...preferably before I return....but sadly, I think Dave\u2019s last video sumed it up!",

This is not a criticism, but you do have to be very careful with the 2 smaller injection needles, as anything (like pepper, etc.) in the sauce you're injecting will clog the openings. Not so with the larger needle (3rd one). The kit does not come with anything to clean the smaller needles, so you have to improvise (if one gets clogged). I found a large paper clip, straightened, of course, managed to work, but it took some time and effort. Yes, would definately buy again, now that I learned the hard way about the smaller injection needles. My bad.",

Surface finishes clean and complete; no ragged, half-formed finish on any surface; knurling is complete on injector \"needles.\" Cap and 'needle' screw threads properly machined and finished. Unusual from a piece that normally would have been fabbed of 'chinesium.' Oddly enough, this is fabbed from actual stainless steel. Quite surprised! Goes to show China CAN produce quality work when they want to. Came w/ suggested marinade recipes. When next the grill is fired up for the appropriate meat, this 'BEAST' will be put to use. I doubt it will fail. Thus, a recommended, excellent product.",

Also the box it came in made me feel like I was unboxing a Rolex. Fitted foam inserts and nice packaging. Stores perfect in a drawer",
