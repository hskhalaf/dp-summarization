If your house is old, I recommend selecting one size larger than needed, or else the room will take longer to warm, and may not reach the desired temperature. The installation instructions were clear and easy to read. One suggestion is that when installing, be sure to locate and attach the heater to wall studs. Pre-drilling the holes works best, prior to mounting and then wiring the heater, as the pre-stamped screw holes don't work so well and it is easy to accidentally bend the fins during mounting.",

The heaters look great installed on the wall under the windows a few inches above the baseboards.",

Since I bought the original units from an electrical parts house, I'm willing to replace with an Amazon supplier and hope for a better outcome.
