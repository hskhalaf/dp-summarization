I understand that this subscribe and Save deal but I've been doing the subscribe and save for over a year now I think I should get a little bit more of a price break. And for it to go up $20 every month it's kind of hard to budget for diapers that you need for your baby's butt especially when you want to have good quality suck of thus brand.",

They don\u2019t absorb wetness and many times she has \u201cblown\u201d out. She wakes up in the night soaked because these diapers can\u2019t absorb enough liquid.

Great absorbency and leak protection. Nice and soft, and not at all flimsy feeling. And the best part of course is that they don't cause diaper rash or irritate his skin in any way! They even last overnight without leaks or rash! Definitely worth the price!",

      "text": "Started using these when baby was about 8 pounds, as indicated on the package. Like several other reviewers, we started having blowouts that had never occurred when using Pampers. Stains everywhere, on her onesies, on the swing, tons of laundry being done, what a pain in the butt. However, now that our little girl is over 10 pounds, the blowouts have stopped. So these work perfectly well in a very limited weight range, but you may want to stick with size one until baby is close to 10 pounds. Now that we are getting closer to the upper weight limit, we are unsure when the switch up to the next size or whether to buy another case of this size.",

Seems comparable with the Seventh Gen sizes. And I like that they are plain white.",
