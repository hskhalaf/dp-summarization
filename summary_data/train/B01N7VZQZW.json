So when I brought her home I immediately looked up a natural substance that could help her stressed kidneys. If I don't use this she is straining in the box. So it is very important that she gets her drops twice a day. She plays, has gained weight and is becoming very social. Thanks Pet Wellbeing!",

My cat will happily hunger strike any food she doesn't like. After a few months of using this, took her for blood work and the vet expected her kidney values to have plummeted because we increased her hyperthyroid meds. Surprise! Kidneys were stable! The vet was shocked. I credit this stuff! A few months later, started seeing a holistic vet for herbal treatment supplementation, and the herb she recommended for healing kidney disease- Rehmannia- is the first ingredient in these drops! This stuff is the real deal.",

      "text": "My 14 year old cat was diagnosed with kidney disease and we thought we would have to put him down. I just couldn't bring myself to do it because he was otherwise still our precious boy. Three weeks ago I ordered this product after reading several reviews. I am amazed. He went from peeing on the floor in front of the box to happily getting into the box. His coat is improving tremendously. I am keeping my fingers crossed that this product is the reason.",

I'll do that for a few days and then add two drops for a few days. Hope he'll get used to the taste/smell gradually. I cross my fingers that he'll tolerate 5 drops eventually.
