As soon as we were safe at home I cam here to order the same seat again because I was so impressed with how well it kept him safe. It's also very easy to install and not too wide. Wish we hadn't had the opportunity to test it out in such awful circumstances, but now will tell everyone we know how grateful we are to this car seat.",

Very annoying and dangerous. My son was using it at the lowest height and it wasn\u2019t until he grew taller that I\u2019ve discovered the issue.",

I first purchased an even flow brand high-back booster and it felt cheaply made and the fact that it would not latch into the car is just ridiculous in my opinion. Anytime I would make a turn while driving, the seat would tilt my son to the left or to the right. How can that possibly be safe? It\u2019s super easy to latch, and with the push of a button it\u2019s just as easy to unlatch it and move into another car. I highly recommend this high back booster.",

It's better than most because it does have a latch system so you don't have to worry about the seat sliding off the car seat. It just seems a bit flimsy to me but I'm comparing it to the Recaro car seat I had in there prior which seemed like it was bolted to the car. The back is adjustable so it can fit kids that are taller to protect their heads.",

Its not the newer latch system with the push button it's the traditional anchors buy the important thing is that is HAS a latch system to keep the bottom seat from moving. I recommend putting the anchors in sideways to start to latch easier and turned sideways after releasing for an easier pull out. Make sure you sit on the car seat and pull the straps to tighten one at a time in order to keep it from being too loose or coming loose.",

Now when my child climbs into the seat, it doesn't move more than about an inch to the side whereas before you could literally move it about six inches. My child says it's comfortable and likes that they can unbuckle themselves. Spend the extra money to get the latch system!",

The only other thing that is questionable is the middle sections material is held on by a tiny little hook not sure if the hook will last but I hope so and if not it could be easily fixed with new hook sewn on.

    "description": "The Graco Affix Highback Booster Seat with Latch System helps safely transport your big kid from 40 to 100 lb* and up to 57\" tall. It provides a secure connection to your vehicle seat with its one-hand front-adjust Latch system, making self-buckling easier for your independent child. While the purpose of the Latch** in the Affix Booster is to secure the booster to the vehicle seat while the booster is unoccupied and help facilitate independent buckling, you will secure your child in the booster seat with the vehicle lap/shoulder belt. The seat has an integrated cup holder and hideaway storage compartment to keep child's drinks and favorite things within arm's reach. This seat is Graco ProtectPlus Engineered to help protect your child in frontal, side, rear & rollover crashes. *To continue to meet industry standards, we have increased the weight minimum from 30 to 40 lb **Since the Latch system only secures the booster seat to the vehicle in this application and is not used for installation, it may be used regardless of the weight of the child (up to the maximum weight recommendation of the seat).",
