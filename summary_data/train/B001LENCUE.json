I agree with her about the the benefits...but as a slightly older first time parent, I can't read the numbers on the bottle without reading glasses! I don't think they could have imprinted smaller, more translucent numerals on the bottles than they have. Heck, I'm sure my son has gotten the wrong oz. to formula ratio because of this. Why make a great product and forget those who's eyes aren't what they used to be. This may be a non-issue for younger parents but for us 40 somethings, these can be frustrating.",

I followed all the directions, which the only thing that was different was STIR the formula instead of shake, because if you shake it, it will leak. So I think most posters who have said that, didnt follow directions. I haven't had any leaks at all and everything came in great quality. And her spit up has been greatly reduced.

Not even to shake milk. If u shake the milk with it, dry milk gets stuck on the top n inside. Pro -eassy to hold -eassy to clean -good size In my opinion, its beat to get the GREEN one. I will be exchanging this once. (Baby is 2 month old)",

The wide nipples seem to be the most similar to real breasts and it was a easy transition from breast feeding to bottle (*maybe an initial resistance, but eventually took after a few tries). My children did all have gas, but it did seemed to be less than other brands. The best feature is that the bottles are lightweight enough that my 5 month year old seemed to easily be able to hold it and feed himself when propped on a boppy/pillow/resting chair, leaving me handsfree for all the feedings!

He would make more noise and choke more, and had more drool coming out the side and I'd have to stop to burp him more. While these have more parts to wash, I'd rather spend my time washing them than dealing with an unnecessarily gassy baby. Once you get routine down on washing the parts, it's a minute out of your day to clean them. I include that bit about cleaning them because that's the #1 question I'm asked when people see me using them; \"how is it cleaning all those parts?\"",

It forced her to slow down and she wasn't taking in a lot of air. Now she drinks comfortably in our arms as we feed her. These wide bottles are great too for pouring in the formula. The narrow ones make it tricky and its easy to spill. Highly recommended and we will definitely be using these for our next baby.",

The measurements on the side are clear, small, and hard to see, but the benefits of this bottle definitely make it worth it.",

    "title": "Dr. Brown's Original Wide-Neck Bottle, 8 Ounce, 3-Pack",
    "description": "Size:3 CountThe Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Wide-Neck Baby Bottles offer a wonderful feeding experience with innovative vent technology. Dr Brown's bottles use a patented 2-piece internal vent system for your baby's comfort. This system creates positive-pressure flow for vacuum-free feeding that is similar to breastfeeding. The breast milk or formula flows freely without nipple collapse. As the baby feeds, air is channeled from the nipple collar through the vent system to the back of the bottle. Air never mixes with the breast milk or formula so oxidation is prevented, thereby maintaining essential vitamins such as C, A and E. The vent system eliminates air bubbles in the formula or milk, which helps to reduce feeding problems like colic, spit-up, burping and gas. Dr. Brown's bottles are completely BPA, PVC, lead and phthalate free for your baby's safety. Each bottle comes with 1 Level-One silicone nipple, 1 two-piece patented internal vent system, 1 cleaning brush and instructions. To Prevent Leaking: Do not shake bottles; Do not warm bottles with parts inside; Make sure you are using the correct nipple level for baby. Please visit Dr. Brown's webiste to contact customer service with any questions or concerns.\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nThis is created by a physician. Dr. Brown's Natural Flow baby bottles feature a patented internal vent system that helps reduce colic, spit up, burping and gas. Its positive pressure design allows babies to feed comfortably, because the vent system eliminates the air bubbles and vacuum. All the parts are dishwasher safe. Dr. Brown's 3-pack of wide neck 8 oz Polypropolene baby bottles comes with Level 1 silicone nipples and cleaning brush.",
