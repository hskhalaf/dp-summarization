Used them on the front end of a Ford F-450 with dual rear tires. Wear is exceptional. Would recommend these for purchase.",

Looking forward to ordering 4 more soon I now have 6 new tires on my Ram 4500 these seem to support the weight better than the original ones. Very happy delivered quickly",

Plan on about $300 to mount these (and you'll have to get it done at a shop that works on semi tires), and the disposal fee *per tire* is about $15 in 2019. I'm happy with the tires and hope they will last a long time.",
