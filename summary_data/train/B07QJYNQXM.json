      "text": "This product is labelled incorrectly. Although it shows 7000mg per bottle and 116.6 mg per serving, when it arrives the servings only have 33.3mg per serving. I originally purchased the 5000mg at 81mg per serving for my arthritic dog. It worked good but I wanted to up the dosage a bit so moved to the 7000mg bottle. After giving her 2 doses, she was limping and in pain again. As I looked at the bottle I realized the discrepancy in the dosages. I went back to the 5000mg and she was better the next day. Returning all the 7000mg bottles as they are all wrong.",
