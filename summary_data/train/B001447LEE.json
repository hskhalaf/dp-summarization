Still, convenient. (When my Wife is not looking I still use a fork and a match for the marshmallow.)",

We've made a bunch of s'mores already and they turn out great. Without the press, marshmallows start to expand and tip off the graham cracker, but this little press is just enough to hold the whole thing together. The steam must help the chocolate melt, because we used to melt the chocolate on the graham cracker and then add the marshmallow. This saves a step and is fun to use. It's easy to handwash, too.",
