These are those mitts. They're comfy and provide that securing sense of overkill when it comes to handling hot stuff around the oven. Feel ridiculously safe wearing them.",

They are a nice size and not super puffy and thick. The insulation works great, not even a hint of warmth gets through. Really happy with these!",

I have always chosen straight silicone for the grill but my wife wanted these because the \"dark red color matches our kitchen so nicely!\" I had a flare up and had to move some steaks. These gloves were literally in the flames for several seconds and I barely felt any heat through them. The silicone stripes are an added bonus. I'm assuming they help with heat protection and they also grip trays incredibly well. The food on the tray falls off before the tray will fall from the mitts. I can almost rest a sheet pan at a 180 degree angle (key word here...almost). Great product, highly recommend.",

Not these...the \"grips\" are well placed and the mitt fits and enables me to move hot items from the oven to the counter with ease!
