Since it is made for children (but I'm in my 40's) and very mild, I usually lather up and let it sit on my hair while showering to ensure a thorough clean. Great for children and grown-ups.... especially for those allergic to coconut!",

The bottle can still be used with out a pump. We have tried other brands but this seems to clean the best without drying my daughters hair. This product is 100% tear free. I was worried about this but some shampoo went over my LO eyes, she just wiped it off.",

Takes a little more to get big suds, but that's okay with me. Best of all Paul Mitchell products are cruelty free.",
