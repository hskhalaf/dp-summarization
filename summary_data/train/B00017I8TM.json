      "text": "Pros: 1. Relatively easy to assemble 2. Looks attractive Cons: 1. Needs more shelf bracket holes. The company decided where they should be and this has reduced options of shelf placement. I store my DVDs alphabetically. Some shelves won't accept special over-size cases like metal ones due to the limited shelf bracket holes. A poor design in my opinion. 2. The left side of each shelf is partially hidden by the decorative wood piece. It's difficult if not impossible to see the title of the left most DVD on each shelf.",

We also found it necessary to install shelves before securing the top. With that said, once it is together it is sturdy and an efficient storage system.",
