I understand that the rug didn't cost much compared to higher quality rugs of it's size, but I definitely thought it would last longer than two months before it started unraveling.

The problem is that this is NOT an outdoor carpet. It has a rubber backing and when it rains the rug gets soggy with water and will not dry. The rain just sits on top of the rubber backing. I have to lift it (with help) over a railing to get it to drain, and I'm guessing that when it's wet it weighs 100 lbs. I would recommend this for indoor use without hesitation. I would warn against it for outdoors and I think advertising it as indoor/outdoor is very misleading. .",

One is on a covered porch and the other is on an adjacent deck that is not covered. It seems to retain alot of water for an outdoor carpet. Other outdoor specific carpets I have bought seemed to dry out much quicker.",
