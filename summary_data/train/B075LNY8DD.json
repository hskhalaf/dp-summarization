      "text": "Great sausage stuffer! My husband is from South Africa and he really misses boerewors so he decided to make his own after being inspired by a friend. His friend had bought this exact sausage stuffer. My husband first purchased a more expensive one made from aluminum but the stuffer plate would scrape the inside as he was stuffing the casings so some aluminum would get into the meat. We returned that one and purchased this one and my husband is very pleased!",
