I hated the way this French press worked. It doesn\u2019t have a large mesh surface to strain the grounds out of your coffee, rather a plastic piece with 6 small mesh holes. Required way more force to plunge than necessary. In the end, it was this piece that broke as the actual plastic body of the coffee press never failed.

However, there is always a small opening through which the coffee grounds can extract [bitterness] into the finished chamber - I like the splash guard and extra strainer attached to the lid, although I wish the main screen-mesh had smaller openings - The filter, filter lock, and press-plate assemble cannot be taken apart to clean",

The only problem I've encountered so far is the press has a rubber or silicone squeegie type plunger and it's no problem to press down. The issue is once the plunger is all the way down it takes a little more effort to reverse the direction of the squeegie when you want to pull the plunger out for cleaning. Other then this the press is great and hasn't broken once... yet.",

      "text": "Having stayed in the US for more than 3 years and being unsatisfied with the US coffee (which doesn't taste like the Indian coffee made using filters) and the instant coffees, this product was a blessing. It works on the reverse priciple of the Indian filter coffee technique and gives very strong coffee. Like this product and it is very affordable. Desi guys will love it:)",
