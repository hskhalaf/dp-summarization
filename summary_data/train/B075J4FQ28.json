It's about respect of the knife, which this knife bag has no regard for. The knife slots are extremely loose around the handle so when you tote the case around and open it up, the knives are not secure. I own expensive cutware and obviously going for a bargain bag was a terrible idea. If you truly love your knives, this is NOTthe right case.",

The only bad thing i can really think of is that you should make your slots for pens just a little bit longer everytime i open it my marker and pen are loose in the roll, really nbd. I really liked the slot for my steel though. The zippers and stitching all seem very well done! (Although the zipper was seperated in two places when it arrived, i just unzipped it and zipped it back and havent had any other issues from it.) Overall im very happy with my purchase.",

But outside of that the honing steel slot is a favorable feature, the amount of slots fits my needs for what I need to carry around.
