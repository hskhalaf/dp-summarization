Didn't try it out until past the return window so now I'm stuck with it and will either have to fix it myself or start a warranty claim.",

The issue is common to some other reviewers: the flashlight will simply not function with batteries and fully assembled. The light does come on/flicker while I'm screwing on the cap but once it's on there the flashlight is completely dead. This to me says lack of workmanship and QA. I am attempting to have it replaced via Amazon and will update this if the replacement is working as advertised. Update: the replacement was DOA as well. Horrible product. Avoid at all costs.",

No issues with the switch operation on mine. Plenty bright enough to see everything you need to at close range, yet small enough to maneuver into tight spaces and light enough to carry in a shirt pocket. Great light!

I highly recommend The Stylus Pro (just make sure you get the 100 lumen version and not the older version with around 60).

Anyone with weak fingers will have trouble with this light. You can rotate the tail cap to turn it on and off, but it's a bit cumbersome one handed.

I posted a response under another one of these, so I'll offer my solution here. I put o-rings (slightly snuggle than the barrel) under the clips. These hang neatly on stick-up hooks, and flip over onto the barrel and out of the way. I've suggested this to the manufacturer. Glowing o-rings are even better.",

The included holder that you attach to your belt is a nice addition as well, but it's too bad there isn't a flap for it. Battery live is decent but the maximum brightness won't last very long. It will eventually go to a baseline brightness that spans many hours before the batteries fail. Highly recommend!",

      "text": "Despite the diminutive size, this flashlight is quite bright (65 lumens) thanks to the C4 LED. Battery runtime of 6.5 hours on 2 AAA batteries is quite impressive. Also despite its low price tag, it has a quality feel and build to it which defines Streamlight products. The reason for the negative star is the weak clip. It's simple folded metal, not spring laded, so it is quite weak. If you don't care about the clip, say because you are going to keep it in the included pouch on your belt or in your pocket, then it's a 5 star product. Update: Dropped rating to 2 stars as I lost the flashlight due to the weak clip.",
