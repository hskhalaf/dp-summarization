At times he is weak in the back end and at times he is very awkward and wobbly and will occasionally fall. This helps him walk much better with my assistance so he doesn't fall. I would recommend this product to anyone. It is really well made and well desinged, nice and padded, and designed perfectly for the male dog so he doesn't pee on it while wearing it. Definitely worth the money. The greatest feature though is the leash part that I connect to his collar so the harness doesn't slide backwards on him while walking.",

I can clip it on her while she is still in her pen, lift her up and it still stays securely around her. It's made potty breaks much easier. She's already started trying to move her legs since we have begun using it. It's a great help to keep her wobbly paralyzed back half, from going anywhere her front half isn't going.",

I\u2019m able to slide the hand grip to be able to adjust where I provide the most support for her. She shows no signs of being uncomfortable while walking with this on. Great product!",

This sling was PERFECT. I loved the handle, the padding, and especially the integrated lead to hook to her collar. This allowed me to not only help her up, but hold her back when she wanted to do more than was advised. Important to note for post TPLO, let your dog do the walking. I made the mistake of trying to help too much and that complicates the three legged walk. When I eased off and let her do it...the sling did it's job.",

But looks to be the answer to my problems. It is made very well and I can almost feel the love and care from which it originated.",

It works exactly as described, and has allowed him to continue to go on short walks (it does get tiring to support him, but we've managed), sniff around the neighborhood, and move easily around our house with us. As his back leg function has deteriorated, it allows us to give him support while he eats and drinks. It has certainly improved his quality of life, and very likely extended his life. Highly recommended!",
