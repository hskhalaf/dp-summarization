They stop people and pets from tracking in wet or muddy foot prints. I have washed them many times and personally had no problems doing so. They collect leaves that come in the door also. Now I have bought 3 more for a vacation home that is out in the country. We had 17 people for Thanksgiving and I had one at all three entry doors. Worked great.",
