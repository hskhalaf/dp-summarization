      "verdict": "The Zoom Rize is an excellent team basketball shoe from Nike. These high-tops have all the boxes checked and then some. The traction, cushioning, and materials all work exceptionally well. Everything else\u2014support, lockdown, stability, and containment\u2014works close to perfection.\u00a0Overall, the Nike Zoom Rize gives the Nike AlphaDunk a run for its money. These high-top basketball shoes perform better on the hardwood and are also a lot cheaper.",
      "pros": [
        "These Nike basketball shoes have top-notch traction, nearly all reviewers assert",
        "According to them, the traction pattern provides 360-degree coverage and is hardly affected by dust",
        "Many users observe that the traction seems to be durable enough for outdoor play",
        "The foam midsole feels incredible, most testers declare",
        "They claim that the foam has very good compression, a little bit of bounce, and feels quite plush",
        "According to most owners, the forefoot Zoom unit feels similar to the Nike LeBron 16\u2019s",
        "It is responsive and very stable",
        "The engineered mesh upper is very strong and supportive, almost all testers state",
        "The materials don\u2019t take long to break in, several players remark",
        "It just feels incredible once broken-in",
        "The Nike Zoom Rize\u2019s asymmetrical lacing provides exceptional lockdown, a significant number of testers report",
        "These high-tops have excellent ankle support, some owners note"

      "cons": [
        "The traction picks up quite a bit of dust, many testers report",
        "However, they say a quick wipe will do the trick",
        "The Nike Zoom Rize doesn\u2019t have the best court feel, some reviewers gripe"

I couldn't justify keeping them based on the fit - maybe that's why we don't see them around anymore. I'm ambivalent about the quality and feel of the material; it felt \"cheap\" in some ways. Again, hard to justify for a $200 price tag. Overall, I still think this is a decent shoe IF it could fit properly.",
