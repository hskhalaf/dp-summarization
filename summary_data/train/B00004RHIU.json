      "text": "The tool was a little difficult to position on a flat piece of mild 22 gauge mild steel. If I positioned just right it cut very well. Upon inspection I found that one of the blades was not ground correctly which caused the tool not to sit flat. I called DeWalt support and they confirmed the blade was not ground correctly. I\u2019m returning the tool and Amazon is replacing, the only issue is a 3 week lead time, hopefully it will improve and I\u2019ll give an update, maybe 4 or 5 stars next time",
