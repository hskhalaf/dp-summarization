That's as many as I'd recommend playing due to size and the find it rings. Which it would be awesome if they had more of them. With 4 people playing it's about 3 rings per person... but we've had players find more than 3 items before. Give the little ones more time but the game is alot of fun and well worth $20. I'd buy it again.",

It took us a little bit of time to get the hang of it--at first we were spending way too long looking through our pictures, but then we learned quickly that if we don't see the object in a few seconds to just move on. Once we figured that out, the game went quickly, and we both loved playing it. I love that I can keep these cards in my purse and pull them out at restaurants or other places when we have to wait instead of handing her a gadget.",

We now play that if you land on the 2 clock to add 2, you instead just lose your turn. And, we don't spin again after landing on the clock. We also play whoever gets to the castle wins, not everyone wins. But, I appreciate the collaboration of the game in eye spying.",

I have a few criticisms: the board is too long for the average dinner table and playing it on the floor is too hard on the knees. The objects you are trying to find are teeny, so wear glasses. And, the sand timer gives you very little time to find anything. We altered the rule about the clock hands, so we stood a better chance of getting to the end. I do like that it is a cooperative game and everyone moves together to get to the end. If you like looking for hidden pictures, this is a great children's game.",

The board has many whimsical and interesting things to discover, like any Richard Scarry book. Even little toddlers who can't understand the rules will enjoy looking for clues. I think your window is 2.5 to 7 years old for most enjoyment of this game (though you should watch little toddlers with the smaller pieces).

      "text": "Our family loves this game! It is easy enough for even a 3 year old to participate and be successful at. The \u201ceveryone wins or everyone does not win\u201d aspect makes it great for those younger children as well. Though not stated in the rules, you can certainly play the game so that one person is the \u201cwinner\u201d if you choose. My only complaint is that 2 of our board pieces have torn apart at the seam (fixed with packing tape), which I think is due to current games being cheaply made as we are typically not rough with things.",

The board is FULL of hidden items and the artwork is wonderful. Great for visual scanning, counting, and cooperative play.",
