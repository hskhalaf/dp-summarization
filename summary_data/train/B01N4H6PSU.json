The tube on this model is almost a foot too short and has no clip to secure it to the backpack. The backpack itself appears to be sized for toddlers as it was waaaay too small for me and I\u2019m not that big. My other unit fit great, what happened? This will either be returned or given to one of our three year old grandsons.",

Perfect amount of room for all my nicknacks while spending a full day on the slopes. It holds more than enough water for the day. An added plus is that you can adjust the water amount in the bladder by not filling it up all the way to allow for more room for your supplies. I dont know how I lived all these years with out this?!",

I have only worn this skiing but it really made a difference for a few reasons. 1) It's a good way to hang on to keys and wallet, however annoyingly my Iphone 7s is a bit too big - but i prefer to keep that in my jacket pocket anyways. 2) Hydration on the slopes makes such a difference, and the water does not freeze. 3) You dont even feel it on your back when skiing or on the lifts. A minor complaint is that it is a little finnicky getting the full bladder into the pack but nothing that cant be done.",

The tube valve has the new improved design. 2. the water bladder uses a different type of hook. #2 was a bad change, it made it very VERY difficult to remove the bladder to refill water. The original design is way superior, I'm not sure why this decision was made. If this was the only change, I would have given it just 3 stars. I added one star back for the valve upgrade.",

The zipper to access the tube should have some mitten friendly grip. The tube needs to be in the pocket to keep it from freezing,",

The pocket for the water reservoir is too tight against the bladder, and upon taking it out of the pack to fill it, the bladder caught a zipper and completely ripped open the entire thing. I think this design is very flawed, I don\u2019t even want another to replace it, I want my money back. The only way I would stay with this company is if they have some kick ass customer service because this is unbelievable.",
