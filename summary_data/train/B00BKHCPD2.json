I tried calling the manufacturer many times, but no one would answer the phone, nor respond to multiple voice messages. I contacted Amazon for a return and repurchase. All went seamlessly. The new unit arrived with all parts functional. I assembled it alone (with the assist of a few throw pillows for support) in about an hour. Because the bottom of the storage is a bit flimsy, I took some leftover hardwood flooring to made a stronger bottom and slid it into place. Looks great in my entryway with the shoe storage I was looking for.",

Take your time and think about what you're doing and you'll be pleased with the results. The finished product looks great and has instantly solved where to put our guests hats and coats when we entertain. Highly recommended.",
