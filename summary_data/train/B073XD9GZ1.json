I\u2019ll also randomly notice the thermostat saying ~97 degrees Fahrenheit when the incubator is still set to 38 degrees Celsius. I didn\u2019t have any issues with my first hatching cycle (21 days)- 100% of my eggs hatched and I didn\u2019t notice the incubator acting up at all.

I suggest running it without eggs for a month, checking 2-3 times daily, so you can master humidity control before buying or collecting eggs. (If you have free eggs, then go for it!)

Think of any issue you've had with the Magicfly and multiply them by two. If you are incubating duck eggs, the automatic egg turner won't be able to rotate them 360 degrees. This isn't a fault of the incubator. I think it would rotate chicken eggs well. The eggs are rotated on their sides, but the distance they tray moves isn't long enough to completely rotate a duck egg because duck eggs have a larger circumference. I also recommend getting two quality digital thermometers that record the highest temperature so you can see if it's spiking.",
