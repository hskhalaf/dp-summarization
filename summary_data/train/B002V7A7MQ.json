Especially since we are always re-stretching out the net and it just does not have enough bounce to it. We seriously have had more fun with a small exercise tramp and racquetballs and get a better result. Just my opinion maybe we are playing it wrong and don't really understand the game but I think if it had a better net or bouncing system it would be awesome and more worth the money. This is really cheap in my opinion. Sorry and Thanks",

Some things you have to keep in mind when you're setting it up though. 1. make sure that the ground you're laying it on is flat. Ideally, it should be relatively soft as well because you can be jumping up and over the net and diving to get the ball. 2. you should make sure when you're setting it up to make the net REALLY tight. That's super important to get an optimal bounce.",

There's a choice a 3 ball version or 1 ball version-- get the 3 ball.
