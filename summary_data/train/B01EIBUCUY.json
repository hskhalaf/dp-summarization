      "verdict": "The Tracker FG from Vivobarefoot pleases both experts and neophytes on the trail. Its abundance of good qualities is enough to gain people\u2019s approval. Its surprisingly comfy confines, supportive design, and attractive look all add up to its good reputation.However, its lacing system and performance over icy grounds were causes of concern. By and large, the Vivobarefoot Tracker FG can still deliver well on most terrain types. Using it on icy surfaces may appear to be a gamble though.",

However the sole began to detach after only 6 weeks of light walking. After contacting the manufacturer and supplier with a photo I received no replies. I've since tried a repair with glue. I cannot recommend these boots because neither the product or corresponding customer service are up to scratch.",

Due to current circumstances, lockdown, the boots have not been used excessively or even to my normal level. However, holes have appeared on both boots at the side where shoes naturally bend and crease. A bit rich in an almost \u00a3200 boot. Update on customer service. Downright appalling. Vivobarefoot attempted to shift blame to Amazon. Amazon fulfilled their part of the deal in exemplary fashion. Vivobarefoot are responsible for the manufacture and build of the boots. And that is where the problems occurred.",

The leather is cracking even with the high upkeep (waxing, removing mud ect...) used for walking the paved street and very minimal hill walk (which is what they are designed for?). Not happy at all with this product. The vivobarefoot trainers are great but would never buy boots again.",

I saw other reviews with the same problems and ignored them before buying - it was an expensive mistake. I\u2019ve bought from vivobarefoot before but never, ever again. Avoid avoid avoid.",
