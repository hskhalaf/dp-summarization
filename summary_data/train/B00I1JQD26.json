These are completely not worth the money. I'd end up buying 2 pairs a month at this rate and I only walk about half an hour a day. I really wouldn't recommend for quality. I'm going to contact Amazon about the replacement policy on this garbage. A real shame because they are very comfortable and easy to walk in. Very shock absorbent.",

The design too is really nice. Only downside is they do crease very easily, and I even noticed some white powder building up in the creases. I brushed this off and put some coconut oil I had lying around into the dry areas and it seemed to solve the problem. I think this was after wearing them in the rain, which woudl explain it.",
