      "text": "A pretty amazing way to get into flying drones with practically no risk. These are surprisingly hardy, responsive, and incredibly fast on the speed setting. Two shortcomings: 1) After every battery charge, you need to recalibrate the flying so it stays in place rather than drifts. Somehow, there should be a way to hold that in memory. 2) the battery tends to slip out while flying which gets the drone off balance. Overall however, these are incredibly fun, and highly capable.",

      "text": "Wow, these little drones are amazing! Fast and extremely agile, they even do flips in midair. My son and 10-year-old grandson love them, using the fighting mode to challenge each other and add to the enjoyment. Each transmitter is similar to a video-game controller, so you can figure things out quickly. There is even a safe-landing button to use while learning. Battery life is certainly adequate, but I would get extra batteries or charging sticks if away from home. The price is quite reasonable considering you get two complete drones plus USB chargers plus spare propellers. Holy Stone (Holyton) has come up with a product that is fun and well thought out.",

The mini drones do take practice to get used to and while they are durable enough to survive crashes its probably not wise to test fate. The only concern I have, thus a 4 star review, is they the props pop off in crashes and they can be hard to find as they are black and don't stand out. You get extra props in the box, but with kids and teenagers this is a concern. Marking them with bright tape or paint would be a good idea.",

I'm not too happy with the controller. It's small, the buttons aren't intuitive, and switching modes is clunky. However, if you just want to get up in the air it'll do fine.
