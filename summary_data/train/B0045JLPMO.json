I like the auto-backup feature of the drive. I've setup weekly backups plus the drive software automatically backs up every file as it is changed. The only thing missing is network ability and I am about ready to add that by purchasing the network dock then I can plug directly into my router. Great value for the money. I really do love this drive :-)",

USB 3.0 transfers data faster. 1TB is a very large capacity. 1,000 full length movies could be stored on this. Cons: USB 3.0 and 2.0 are not backwards compatible with 1.0 but such is the way of technology and it's the same for all USB devices. Just something to be aware of if your computer is over 5yrs old. Dropping it can destroy the data, unlike a solid-state drive or flash drive which have no moving parts.",

Also, trying to get the older model returned to Seagate has been a major challenge. So I am placing some of the frustration onto this purchase as well. This seems to run hotter than my older one and that has me feeling anxious, so backing this up is not optional. If you want to retrieve data...make sure to back up when changing the data. Of course that is true all the time, however, with the running hot, I am particularly cautious.",

The price point for a great 1.5 TB or 1TB field drive also can't be beat.

Also, mine did not come with the pre-installed movies like other users had mentioned in their reviews.",
