I imagine most people will be using as a media centre - the added power here resolves all the frustrations of latency as you navigate around the menus, and generally improves on the visual performance. I've no doubt that other myriad uses of the Pi will benefit in a similar fashion. Awesome device and although I planned to hand-me-down the Pi(1) to my daughter, I've decided instead to just go and buy another Pi 2.",

It's also fast enough that I can do most of the development on it too so that sure saves on electricity as it only uses 4.5 watts instead of 60+ watts.
