It has a small-ish footprint compared to other normal gym bags, but you can fit SO much in there, and keep it organized at the same time. I was worried before purchasing that I wouldn\u2019t be able to fit the straps over my shoulder comfortably, but as you can see in the photo it does that easily. Lots of compartments, perfect spots for blender bottles or water, and gym shoes fit in with plenty of room for clothes and gym accessories.",
