We purchased this in advance of our dog's orthopedic surgery and I am extremely happy with how we are able to fit this around her knee without causing any pain or discomfort. There is an easy \"reheat\" option but we haven't had to use it yet b/c it retains the heat for quite some time. Once she is healed this will be saved for ourselves should we find the need for it in the future.",

No scent to it at first, and after first use it smelled like overcooked rice. Then after 3 uses it smelled really really bad. Also, the heat doesn't last long. It's warm for about 5 minutes and that's it.",
