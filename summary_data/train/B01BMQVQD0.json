The only thing I would say is that if you have a wide foot like I do I would get a half size bigger, they are a bit snug. Usually a 12 is too big for me, so I got an 11.5 and the length is perfect they are just a little snug if you are used to having a little more room in your shoe. Other than that they are as awesome as I always thought they would be! classic Mashburns!",
