      "text": "This printer is overall great, but there are a few things to keep in mind. First of all, there are not individual cartridges for color. There is just a color cartridge and black cartridge. Also there is no USB port for printing straight from USB. The great part about the printer is its network features. It can scan and print over the network and works great with Mac OSX and iOS with Airprint. I have not tested it with my windows devices as of yet. An important thing to remember is to uncheck the Instant Ink box if you don't want that. I unchecked it and I have no issues with pop-ups as others have talked about.",

If you let it sit for more than a month unused, no amount of cleaning will help you, it will only work again with new cartridges. I needed something that could I used every month or so to print random things. Most of the time this thing fails or requires a new cartridge. Given the price of cartridges it's also cheaper to actually buy the printer again, which is weird and ridiculous. This machine is disposable and the quality is terrible. I deeply regret this purchase and the people who engineered this machine deserve to feel bad.",

Why is Hewlett-Packard making me pay extra just to use a device I already own? I will be removing those Instant Ink cartridges and using my regular ones I bought with it. If I print too often, it will only cost more. If I don't print often enough, the ink might dry out and ruin the printer. That said, at least you can cancel the Instant Ink subscription and use regular cartridges.",

However, the print is noticeably darker, broader, and less crisp than our old printer. The paper tray holder fewer sheets. It looks much less laser-like and, obviously, will use more ink. I am disappointed.",

      "text": "Good cheap printer does what I want it to do. I don't print pictures it's a waste of money when Walgreens or whomever does it so cheap. Used to have a great picture printer I purchase 5-6 years ago printed great but always had issues with it telling me cartridge was damaged or missing ever time I replaced them and they weren't even after I'd clean the head off. And cartridges were $100 for all now they are $30 for both and printer cost me $45 so if it goes down I'll just launch it out the window and grab a new one!",
