The footwear was also commended for its waterproofness and grip on challenging terrain. On the other hand, the shoe\u2019s narrow fit wasn\u2019t for everyone. All in all, the FT18 GTX from Berghaus offers the required performance to day hikers, thanks to its positive set of qualities.",

        "A handful of outdoor enthusiasts raved about the grippy outsole of this Berghaus product",

Initially they felt tight and narrow with poor grip but after a week of constant wearing in, they have settled into a comfortable fit and feel a lot more flexible and stable. They are a very breathable lightweight hiking shoe which offers minimal support with questionable grip in wet conditions so would definitely be more suitable for everyday use rather than a long haul trek.",

This made them out of my budget which is a shame. (update) So I decided to buy the black pair in a size 9 (the half size up as previously mentioned.) They arrived in a box stating black and size 9. When I opened the box the pair were grey, size 8.5!! Probably the same shoe as I previously bought just put in a different box!!",

They are quite rigid, with almost no flex between heel and sole. This is a good thing, of course, for fast walking over variable terrain. They are clearly well designed, excellent grip, smart, robust and well made. Very comfortable and padded, with the super grip on the soles should be better than trainers on ice and snow - e.g. for commuting. The colours are restrained, ideal for both men and women.",
