I highly recommend this spike.",

Running in spikes has taken significant time off his times on the track..5 seconds off 400 and 10 seconds off 800..which has made him very competitive.",

They completely ruin your calves for your next race, and I've had some resounding calf problems from indoor, when I raced 6 times in one weekend. Theyre gonna wreck your calves, but if you have one race, and you're trying to lay down something nasty, these will get you there.",

    "description": "Saucony Ballista Running Spikes The Ballista is designed for the track star who is giving it everything they have in their mid-distance events. From the 800 metres to the mile, these lightweight, durable shoes can carry you to victory. Flexfilm Upper The upper of the Ballista Running Spike is constructed with Saucony's Flexfilm which is a strong, lightweight material allowing for fewer layers in the shoe, boosting a seamless, flexible feel while reducing the risk of irritation and discomfort. This adaptive material is melded to the mesh upper which allows much-needed airflow throughout the shoe, keeping the feet feeling cool and dry at all times, eliminating any distractions. Minimal Midsole The midsole of the Ballista is purposefully minimal as it's designed for fast, quick races. Keeping weight at a minimum is critical to the Ballista, so there would be no need to add extra cushioning to the midsole. 2-Part Plate Outsole The Ballista is Saucony's first spike to be engineered with multiple compounds to reduce weight while still provides rigidity underfoot. The underfoot comes with 6 spikes that are designed to propel you forward while hitting maximum speed. This versatile shoe allows you to remove the spikes and allows you to be ready to hit the track, trail, mud or pavement at any time. **You don't want to feel your toe cramped up against the front of the shoe. A spike should feel like it was meant for your foot, a little more snug than a training shoe feels so we would recommend half a size up on normal shoes**",
