This size is a tad too big for me (I'm 5' 9\" and about 135lbs) but it's not a big deal and I'd rather it be too baggy than too tight. The only thing I wish it had were side pockets. It has two breast pockets and one back pocket. One bonus thing though, lots of the other beekeepers really liked this color as opposed to the standard white suits and I agree. I like this more subdued color a lot better than the bright white.",

Update: The front zipper also failed after one year of use (about once a week at most). STAY AWAY from this unless you only need it once or twice.",

I really like the veil which has plenty of room. Can't wait to try it out! The measurement from the shoulder to crotch is very short and the legs are very long. For my long torso, it rides a little and it makes it hard to get the screen on and off. It does the job though.",
