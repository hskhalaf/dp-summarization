My husband asked me what I needed yoga socks for and I will tell you exactly what I told him: a. if your feet get cold in yoga, especially if you are doing slower forms, these will keep your feet warmer b. because the toes are free, you still get the stability of being without socks and having your toes avaialble for good balance c. the grippers on the bottom keep you from slipping like you would if you just wore regular socks to yoga to sum up: I love these socks, they are super comfy, wash up well, and the colors are very fun!",
