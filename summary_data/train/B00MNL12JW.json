When inflating make sure you have a tape measure so you can inflate to exactly 32 inches in diameter because it does not give PSI. You definitely want to inflate to the 32 inches in diameter to get best results on the snow slopes (that's what we use it for). Great product for the price!",

I bought this one so the cooler's center of gravity sits lower and even if it did tip the cooler wasn't going anywhere, without the tube. This tube is the perfect size to fit snugly around a 48 quart cooler and it holds up to the abuse of being stretched around the cooler. It does require either a bike tire pump (or similar) to inflate (and takes a while to deflate), but that's not a problem and the valve is well protected by a large cap.",
