The item arrived very well packaged and cushioned. There was padding on both sides of the glass panels to keep them intact. I fully inspected the unit for any defects or scratches and could not find anything that was damaged. The hinges and drawers all work as designed. The frosted glass etchings are a wonderful accent. I am very satisfied with this item",

      "text": "My second one. My first - idiot installed the light fixtures poorly and one fell off the wall and broke the glass and dinged the wood, so the need to buy a new one. It's been 16 years so it was a miracle that they are still making them. I have always LOVED this. It's appearance is gorgeous and the quality is excellent. When something needs to be done right, you do it yourself - I bought new - better hardware and installed the light fixtures myself (renovation). My jewelry chest sits on the en-suite counter between the light fixtures (above) and it looks as fabulous as ever.",
