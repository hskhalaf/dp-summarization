If you buy a few of the other Mega Bloks Star Trek sets you can have the whole cast on board. And if you buy 2 more bridge sets, and do some custom building, you might even end up with a complete Enterprise bridge! If you are a die-hard Trek fan, it is worth the extra expense and effort to build a bridge in all it's 360 degree glory!",

The pictures make it look like it might be just a fragile facade but it is actually quite sturdy as there are a surprising number of bricks used in its construction. The printing (no stickers here) on all of the panels and monitors is fantastic. The figures use the standard Mega Bloks articulation scheme so there are plenty of posing options and they even have quite good likenesses considering the scale. I was afraid I might feel a bit underwhelmed but this set is well worth the money.",

This kit has very solid construction so you don't have to worry about it not staying together. The characters are great too. Even Nomad is included! Very good quality set. Great for any fan of the original series.",

The pieces are very, very small in some cases, so be careful around younger children or pets. The instructions are easy to follow, and I'm excited for when the whole thing is done. The only odd thing about this is that it came with two Uhura figures. All others were included, we just got an extra one too.",

The scene was nicely detailed and the set was easy to put together and play with. They thoroughly enjoyed the time together and the finished product looks great on a shelf in the movie room. It's a great alternative to the more expensive Lego brand.",
