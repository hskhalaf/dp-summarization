I researched it and it seems Ford has changed their formulation in the past 6-12 months and at the same time the label changed.

If you have a 6 speed miata (or perhaps any miata, whatever this stuff works in) do yourself a favor and buy it. It made the car more enjoyable. No more annoying 1 -> 2 crunch, it just slides into every gear like a knife through butter now.",

Can't say the shifting feels too much smoother, but the fluid that came out was pretty bad and I'm definitely glad I put the correct spec fluid in there instead of some generic gear lube like most people do. Have been driving with it for a while now with no issues. Cheaper than buying this stuff at the dealership too!",
