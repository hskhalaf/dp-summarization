This one did fine. It's just a simple pump sprayer. No frills and that suits me just fine. It gives nice coverage of the food and its not hard to spray. The container holds a good bit of oil too. It's a nice silver finish so if you want to leave it out on your counter it looks nice. Glad I got it! I'm trying it on wings next!",

      "text": "Just to be clear, what you are ordering is a metal can with a screw-on top similar to what you would find on a bottle of hairspray. The container is well made. Simple operation: Unscrew sprayer unit, put in what you want to spray, screw sprayer unit back on container and pump with index finger to get spray. That's it. Nothing more, nothing less. From reading the reviews here, you think you are ordering something with 2 chambers where you can dial in the percentage of each oil you want to use. Perhaps those reviews are for another product, not this one. The product seems to work fine. I gave 4 stars because of the confusion.",

Coming to the handyness its sized right to hold and spray. The amount of oil it can hold is also good. But dont fill it to the top this will lead to leaking when you spray. May be something for the product to be improved?",
