I really like this watch. I promise to revisit my review after the replacement proves to be worth the second chance. OK so now I've had the replacement a couple of weeks now. I have kept it wound and its running perfectly. I'm going to carry it on my cruise in February 2019. Dec. 31st. update. Still working perfectly and quite beautiful",

This makes me even more sad because how were we supposed to know without wearing it and his job is dirty so needed a special occasion to break it in.

The watch is nice in appearance, but after a week, this watch consistently loses 90 minutes a day, every day, even when fully wound to the winding resistance point twice a day. Also, the hands are VERY thin, and thus difficult to see against the visually crowded clockwork background. Yes, I understand that for accuracy, you can't beat an electronic quartz movement, but an hour and a half a day? Every day?",

He LOVES this pocket watch, and so do all of his coworkers. It looks and feels very sturdy and good, and it makes such a satisfying sound when he winds it. It's become his signature piece and a lot of his clients now even know him as 'the guy with the pocket watch.' I definitely recommend!",

The chain is long enough to allow for placement in the coin pocket without having a chain hanging down to your knee. This is a great watch. It appears to hold time very well and stays wound for a very long time. I'm extremely happy with it.",
