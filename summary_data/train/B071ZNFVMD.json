These bags are so useful, They do not retain any smells and I use it for both food and carrying things from car to home. You can put A LOT in the bag and bag retains a neat and firm shape. Not just for food but for groceries and anything else non-food related. Great bags with multiple uses. Update August 2020. I bought 2 dishes of take-out food (hot) in another city and placed inside bag, 7 hours later after arriving home, the food was still warm. Impressed.",

      "text": "Purchased these for Instacart and Postmates deliveries. Product folds flat and is quite lightweight. Sadly the zippers on both of mine are very rough and get caught all the time when try to zip them up, especially around the corners. After 6 days of use one of the bags tore a seam at the zipper down one complete side making it basically useless for temperature control deliveries. I will keep using the torn one as a backup for non-thermal deliveries but that defeats the purpose of buying thermal bags. I\u2019ll stick to my cheap Ozark Trails Walmart thermal bags which are bulkier but much sturdier and whose zipper only goes down one seam.",

We froze water bottles (so ice wouldn't melt in the cooler) to keep in the cooler when we switched to a different hotel every 2 days. The food stayed cold, even ice cream stayed somewhat frozen (soft serve consistency) for an hour and a half. One XL bag held a lot of food. Would highly recommend for anyone traveling between hotels or airbnb's.",
