I do not like the 9 iron. I don't know what it is, but my 9 iron is messed up or something. I can hit my pitching wedge (also a hybrid like the rest of the clubs) further and more consistently. Can hit the 8 iron just as well. But when I pull out the 9, it's absolute mayhem. Also... they give you a hybrid SW. I'd recommend just going and getting an actual SW. Hybrid SW feels very weird.",

Some golfers may prefer continuing to use the traditional wedges instead of the short-iron hybrids. Customer service is excellent. The product specifications appear to show the hybrid lofts as being one club lower than the usual irons (i.e., #4 hybrid is indicated with a #3 iron loft etc., ). Could possibly be an erroneous description -- but, did not make any appreciable difference in playability for me. (Haven't measured the actual lofts, yet). Will purchase from this supplier again.

The mid flex is good, the heads, although not heavy, instead of the 'click' or 'ting', have a heavy 'thud' feel reported back to your hands. The ball flies well, overall, a good buy.

Head covers were nice but too large to fit into either my cart bag or walking bag and ended up using socks instead of supplied head covers. Same distance as with my normal irons, but it has been nice to see that my bad shots are not quite as bad. If you like hybrids over regular irons, I'd recommend these clubs and the price is very, very reasonable. I'm 71 and carry a 7 handicap.",
