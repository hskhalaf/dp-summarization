All safety precautions were followed to a tee, two beaten eggs were used, two minutes per side, latch fully locked down, and it started shooting egg out the sides with about a minute left of cooking time. Not to mention the resulting omelet looked horrible. This 1 star review is pending however if the company can tell me whether or not the unit is faulty, could just be a bad one, but given this isn't the first complaint of egg-splosions I'm not holding my breath :)",
