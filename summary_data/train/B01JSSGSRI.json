If I didn't know better I would think Bob is creating his own dirt to clean up...lol... One suggestion is to ensure you move any cords or dog chew toys up or Bob will eat them....Bob does a great job and we couldn't be happier with this vacuum.",

Best of all, Bob picks up all the cat hair and litter that has been tracked, on both hard and carpeted floors. The written instructions are clear, thorough, and done with a bit of fun flair.",

It might work better in a small room w/o too many hazards to navigation. I have three other bots, two Roomba's and a Xiamoi, all of which navigate rooms far more effectively and efficiently than the the bObsweep. I will be replacing it with a Roomba.",

Response time to questions or concerns is answered in a very timely manner and that is appreciated! Your on-line troubleshooting videos are the best and with my last Bob I was able to repair the sweep easily.",

I think the previous model moved faster and may have bumped a little hard on some table legs. In order to clean the brush one must remove a screw that holds it in place.",
