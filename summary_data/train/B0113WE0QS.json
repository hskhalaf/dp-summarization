I would have given it 5 stars, but the edge of the wrap where the Velcro is does slightly dig into my side.

I had severe sciatic pain in one hip that only yoga seems to alleviate, and this didn't seem to do much for me at all, so I'd just as soon not wear it. But if you've tried everything or have other symptoms a support band might alleviate, I would say this one is great to try. Congratulations on your pregnancy and good luck!",

      "text": "This saved my back and pelvis from about 20-30 weeks of pregnancy. I could tell a huge difference between when I had worn or not worn it for the day. However, the instructions for putting it on were confusing and made it seem like it should be placed backwards. I had to come reference the photo a few times just to be sure I was right. Also, if you wear it with non maternity pants the Velcro can get very very scratchy. I always made sure to wear with maternity pants so I could wear it over the top part. It\u2019s well made, though, and I will definitely be saving it for my next pregnancy.",

Only complaint is that you have to really work to get the Velcro to light up on the back so that the scratchy side isn't rubbing your back the whole time. I plan to use it after giving birth to help compress my stomach to help with recovering, but the front has a belly shape so I'm not sure how well it will work for that since it won't apply even pressure across my belly (more pressure at the bottom than at the top).",
