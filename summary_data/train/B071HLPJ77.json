He normally wears an XL. I ordered a XXL. He liked the little bigger fit than normal making it easy to work in and no clinging. He liked the coolness.....better than sun hitting bare arms and no sunscreen. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",

He has an old UPF 50 shirt from REI - maybe they lose the sun protection over the years because the day he wore that one he burned a little through it... this one didn't let anything through!

In the woods, it could breathe a bit more, but spraying a little water on my back seemed to somehow increase the coolness, so I recommend doing that. It worked better in the open if there was a breeze, even in direct sunlight. Used it at the beach also and was happy with it. Clung when coming right out of the water, but if you squeeze out the excess, it stops clinging after a few minutes.",

The only thing that sucks is that I look better in it than out of it. ;) Considering the price, it's much better than any I've bought from major companies with marketing and logos that some people like to wear.",

I selected large for this shirt based on the sizing chart, and it fits just right all around, not too long. I plan to golf in the sun and heat with this long-sleeve shirt tomorrow. Just ordered the polo version, too.",
