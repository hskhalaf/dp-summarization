      "text": "What\u2019s to like about the Puro Sound Labs PuroQuiet On-Ear Earphones? Lots. Here\u2019s a list of the pros and the one con that I can see. Pros: They remain within safe listening levels no matter the source of the sound. Both using Bluetooth and when corded, sound levels remain constant. This set has effective active noise cancelling and is great for travel. 18 hours of battery life. The wired version doesn\u2019t easily tangle. They\u2019re sturdy - the frame is aluminum - not plastic. It\u2019s simple to connect to Bluetooth and there\u2019s an on/off switch and volume control. Well-padded earpieces. Cons: Cost",

      "text": "We've had lots of headphones for kids that are cheap crappy headphones. These are quality headphones for kids. The sound and build quality is awesome. They're like Bose or Seinheiser for kids. I would totally use these if they were big enough for my head! They're perfect for our tween girls. We have a pair of the noise cancelling ones and the ones that aren't noise cancelling. They're both just as good. We did have problems with a pair that wouldn't charge, but Puro's customer service was awesome. My girls love these, and we totally suggest these.",

It's comfortable, the sound is good, and it works from her phone. She also travels extensively, long distance international trips, and this will come in very handy for her. It's pricey, but she's old enough to look after the headphones well.",

These can be used wired or blu tooth and hold a charge for over 16-22 HOURS. They say \u201cfor kids\u201d and they\u2019re a little smaller but still fit adult normal to smaller size heads...",

We have an older Bose set and now these wonderful Puro brand so sometimes we don't have to hear their TV shows. For myself I do like the noise cancelling feature. I like to watch British programs on PBS or wherever and I understand them so much better with the noise cancelling. I'm a Senior Citizen so that may be why I like the noise cancelling lol",

The kid likes them. Being wireless is a godsend. Not having to worry about the wire snagging and pulling a phone or tablet to the ground. Not having to untangle them. Not having to plug them in. So great, especially when dealing with kids.",
