I've had mine for over 2 years and it still works well. Cons: 1) Can be washed away rapidly by rain if used outdoors. Suggestions: Using a squirt bottle, like the ones used for ketchup, helps to spread it around the house for ants.",

Everything was washed in hot water prior to putting the DE on/down. My dogs had flea baths and had topical flea product put on two days after the flea bath. Fleas have been out of control in Central Florida this spring. I also spread this on the grass using a hand spreader to kill any fleas in the yard. My house vacuum had issues with this poofing out of the allergy filter so I had to first use a shop vac then use the beater brush on my house vac",

For an indoor plant we got some gnat or fruit fly type bugs and this took care of those immediately. Its a very fine ground powder almost like powdered sugar in consistency. I would recommended getting one of those pesticide bulbs for applying the product. That allows you to mist it very finely and evenly. The 10lb bag will last you most likely a long time. I would buy this again if I needed more.",

Definitely kills the fleas within 2-3 days. I apply it to the pups outside. I would recommend using gloves as it does dry out the skin relatively quickly. And wear a dust mask if you're like me and have asthma. Applying the DE with a flour sifter or an unused paint brush really helps with the spreading and getting it into carpets or floor seams.",
