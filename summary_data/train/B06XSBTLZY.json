Arch support is perfectly shaped for my foot and the ankle walls are stiff as they should be to provide protection from ankle twists for court use. I\u2019m using these for daily hard court pickleball play and I have been very pleased with the comfort and support. These shoes are relatively light but plenty firm and seem like they\u2019re constructed well enough for long lasting use.",

Lemme just say OMG I love the bottom of the shoe and it stops right along with me and doesn't leave any marks on the courts. Not to mention they look great with a white and black tennis outfit haha. Because of the arch I will have to buy soles for these but overall, they're great shoes. I recommend these men's one for females because men naturally have a wider foot and I do too and it's super comfy to play in them!",

I exchanged a pair of Ds for EEs and they still felt a little snug, but not so tight that I couldn\u2019t wear them. The length was good. After a few hours of use they are still snug but acceptable. Still, I knocked off one star because an EE should not feel like a smallish D. Otherwise I like these shoes. They look great, the construction is solid, they\u2019re fairly light, and very stable. Hopefully they will wear well, but if they don\u2019t I\u2019ll update my review.",

It's really quite painful and I can't find what's causing it. I should add that I also own a pair of NB 996 shoes that is remarkably more comfortable. The 996 is a soft, cushioned, stable ride. This shoe, the 886, is lighter, but it is much harder. Some people have complained about the 996 not being wide enough in the 2E size. That is not the case for me.",
