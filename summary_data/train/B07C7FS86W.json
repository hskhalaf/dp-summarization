When people tell me I don't look 44 it's because I froze my face with collagen naturally by taking these daily!",

My hip doesn't hurt as much, I feel strong and flexible and I will definitely keep taking collagen for the rest of my life.",

Not sure I notice a difference with pain relief, but I don\u2019t really have issues with pain yet. I am 27 so I feel like taking them is more of a preventative measure anyway, so I never expected immediate results. Very happy with these.",
