      "text": "This little bugger is great! Tested it by sweeping and vacuuming my best, then turning it on....wow! It sure does pick up a lot. Great suction! We have a puppy and it instantly cleans up the flowing fluffiness that collects on the floors. We chose this brand based on the great ratings and lower price compared to similar, more popular brands. Thankful we did. The timer feature is great too. Set it up to run while you're asleep or gone for a time. It instantly docks itself when finished. Make sure your socks, cords and small items are off of the floor. It will choke on them. Easy to clean. Easy to use. Highly recommend!",

I love how quiet it is, the battery life, the Alexa features, the ability to start from phone and schedule to run automatically, the price! So many things.

It would start back up, but shortly after started to make a loud rumbling tractor noise. I checked filter and emptied a bunch to check for anything that might be stuck. Nothing appears to be stuck anywhere from what I can see. I requested to return a few days ago and have not heard from the seller.

On Jan 4th 2019, I received the product and it worked great the handful of times I have used it. I just found out that because it was refurbished, the warranty is 90 days from the seller I bought it from. Very disappointing that Amazon or the seller won't fix/replace something that was hardly used before having issues. I would not recommend buying the Shark vacuum.",

Instead of the delightfully simple remote that comes with the 700, the RV850 requires the use of a crap App. What a bummer. I hope to be able to find another 700!
