The spaces are too small for the game pieces (which is challenging for little hands with developing fine motor skills) and the graphics are way too busy (which makes it hard for a child to easily follow the path). The recommended age range is 3-6, which I think was accurate for the original design, but it is certainly not true now. I was very disappointed when I saw the game board and we no longer try to play it because it is too frustrating for my daughter.",

It has cards and while some of the characters are different from what I remember, they are not dressed in lingerie with lollipops over their breasts. My 4 year old lives this game and it's a great introduction into board games. Taking turns, matching colors, following rules, and sometimes losing are all great skills he is acquiring by playing this game.",

We played the regular way as well and it is always exciting when someone gets a character card and gets sent across the map. I highly recommend this game.

      "text": "I ordered this for my young children, reflecting nostalgically on my own childhood during which I would sit in front of this game board and play with the pieces for what seemed like hours. I was hoping for the same experience for them. Unfortunately they've remade the game where it now reflects that chaotic scenes in children's television programming. The game board is smaller, super crowded, and way too busy. It was difficult to even follow the colored road! I felt overstimulated just glancing at the board. It was really disappointing.",

I bought, in the store, at Christmas the chutes and ladders game for her and it is very cheaply made with a flimsy board and just not the same quality as this. Thanks!",

The game plays out in perhaps 5 minutes and therefore is quicker and easier to play than 'Chutes and Ladders'. Also, the child does not have to count as required in 'Chutes and Ladders'. Both games are excellent, but start with 'Candy Land' if you have any doubt of the toddlers ability to count and stay attentive for perhaps 15 minutes as necessary for 'Chutes and Ladders'.",

The game-board is approximately 18\"x24\" in size. Initially, the board seemed rather small, however, I suppose the smaller size makes it easier for a child to reach across the entire board.

It is exactly as expected. If I had any criticism it is that the cards are too flimsy but I do think that they are normal quality for board games.",

    "description": "If you loved playing the Candy Land board game when you were a child, you can share the experience with your loved ones and start down the \"magical\" road to sweet surprises! This adorable version of the classic Candy Land game features gingerbread men as movers, colored cards, and fun illustrations that kids love, with different destinations like Cookie Commons and the chunky Chocolate Mountain. Players choose their cards, move their pawns, and let their imaginations soar as they make their way to the castle to win! For 2 to 4 players. Hasbro Gaming and all related terms are trademarks of Hasbro.\n\nAMAZON.COM\n\"Once upon a time, King Kandy, the Imperial Head Bonbon and Grand Jujube of Candy Land disappeared.\" Thus begins the magical journey of Milton Bradley's classic Candy Land board game. Captivated by the story of a kidnapped king and eager to help find him, little ones move their gingerbread pawns along a rainbow path and through a land of candy characters, all subjects of King Kandy's realm. \n\n Playing cards thoughtfully designed for non-readers are coded with colorful squares matching the jeweled stepping-stone path or an occasional token matching one of the characters' symbols: draw a blue card, move to the nearest blue stepping-stone; draw a snowflake and earn a visit to Queen Frostine's iceberg. There are occasional pitfalls, too: land on the wrong square and you might be stuck in Molasses Swamp until a red card is drawn. With all these enticing, sugarcoated images (and King Kandy plainly visible at path's end), children can't help but be delighted by Candy Land. It's delicious! Instructions are in both Spanish and English. Candy Land is for two to four players) --Julie Ubben\n\nFROM THE MANUFACTURER\nEvery child's first game, Candy Land is a colorful way for a preschooler to experience the joy of game play. The game teaches color recognition and matching while reinforcing the lesson of taking turns and being a gracious winner or loser. You will love to see the smile on a young person's face as they travel through Candy Land. Includes four gingerbread pawns, a gameboard, a card deck, and instructions in English and Spanish.\n\nREVIEW\n\n\nFor 2 to 4 players Includes game board, game cards, and plastic playing pieces No reading required to play Skills: color recognition Supply is limited -- \n\nSee more",
