The skip hop one is much larger when folded with the same amount of diapers and wipes in it and the pad is about the same size. With the Comfy Cubs mat, I like that the Huggies soft wipe fits right into the wipe holder. Super happy with my purchase!",

A handy strap lets you attach it to a stroller etc. so it is very convenient. A great item to carry at all times especially when traveling somewhere a changing area might not be available.",

After receiving it and seeing how nice it was, I decided to order one to keep inside my diaper backpack. Some might be disappointed that it doesn't come with a wet wipe case, but that's not a big issue to us.",

It's perfect for when we go to the park, especially since I'm out a lot with TWO little ones, I don't need to get both over to a changing table, I can lay this right on the grass. This is great!",

Now we use liners instead of the mat. Still using the bag and pocket compartments because they are great.",
