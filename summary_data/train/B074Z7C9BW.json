However, I have a new phone case that is a ribbed, raised surface and the ring has came off under a little pressure. I plan on super gluing the ring to my new case to fix this. (I used to have a case with a rough glitter surface and had to use super glue to reinforce)",

I also had to get another car holder to accommodate the bulk on the back. Not a deal breaker because it is still cute and sturdy.",

      "text": "When I first applied one of these rings to the back of my phone case, it was extremely difficult to adjust and it eventually popped off. Thankfully, I was able to reapply it with ease and after some more use, it became very easily manipulated. Now, I can twist it any direction and it has stayed securely in place. I use it to steady my phone, prop it up, and I have even hung it on random hooks. Now, I can't stand to use my phone without it!",

      "text": "This product is perfectly functional in terms of adhering to the phone and providing a good, solid grip. However, the black paint on the exterior started rubbing off in less than a week and now it looks really patchy and white. I'm still going to use it because it works, but I don't think I would purchase again because of how it looks.",
