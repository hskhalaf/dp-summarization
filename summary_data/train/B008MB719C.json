With the F1.4 Leica lens, it works great indoors without a flash and performs extremely well outdoors for landscape shots. It has a lot of features packed into it including 4k video, which I have no interest in. But it does shoot bursts in a way that enables the capture of sharp photos in a fast moving situation. The camera is small enough to fit in my back pocket. I use it as a back up to my Lumix FZ1000, which has the great telephoto lens.",

      "text": "I had the Canon G12, G15, Canon S110. Value proposition over other cameras is its f/1.4 at wide angle 24mm. I quite like the aperture dial and the camera lightness The image quality and performance is similar to the Canon G series. However, the autofocus is quiet faster in G series and I prefer its ergonomics. For the price, a very good competitor in the advanced compact segment. Actually, LX7 offer the best value for money between the enthusiastic cameras.",

Noise at ISO400 and above. Having said that, this lit tle gem is worth every cent that you spend on it. The Strengths are: Rich feature list. Physical Controls.Expandability with Flash Hot Shoe and OVF/EVF. Killer Video. Great Image Quality. Great set of filters, stackable, in camera. Good in camera Panorama, Hand Held Night Mode, HDR. Can be used by all, from beginer to advanced photographer.",

Best of all, the picture quality compares well to most DSLR. It would be a significant improvement if there's a built-in view finder, GPS bookmark and wifi capability.

This is the perfect camera for those who hate that 'wash out' look. It's nice to have a flash option but it's even better to do without and just get that natural color look in dim settings. The White Balance options are great! Camera has a dedicated button for that labeled as \"WB.\" Can't beat the price of $299.00 either! I'm already getting my co-workers to look at this deal from Amazon!",
