This kills plant life to death in a 5-star kind of way - I can spray an area and never have to trim there for the rest of the summer. Year-long liquid weed-trimmer goodness. P.S. I, too, hate Roundup \"because Monsanto\" but whattayagonnado? It works, I buys, part of my soul dies.",

Now don't expect sprayer quality but just to spray out a third of the bottle and only push a button, I could afford to go back over it because my hand was having squeeze cramps. Unless I report back otherwise, assume Roundup still kills bermuda grass unless this grass is magic grass (My Cousin Vinny homage).",
