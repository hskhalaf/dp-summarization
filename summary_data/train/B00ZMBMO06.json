Do you know how much these games would cost if you bought them separately? 30 games for this price! Though, I wish they would've thrown at least one Donkey Kong game in here but that's ok. Of course, it's a few bad apples in here but it's still a good compilation.",

As In, if the game didn't have online play originally then it doesn't have it in this. That was a major sticking point for me. Like it's not hard to build in online play for these retro titles.

Viva Pinata is actually pretty fun as is Jet Force Gemini and Blast Corps. Of course Banjo Kazooie is top notch. I dropped it a star because there isnt actually anything on the disc. All it does is trigger a download, so we had to wait a while before we could start battling toads, but other than that its great!",

Also the controls are a lot more smooth for older games due to the fact that the xbox controller makes the games 10x easier to navigate and move around in older games (compared to the Nintendo 64 controls' at least) Overall great buy and a must have for Xbox gamers.",
