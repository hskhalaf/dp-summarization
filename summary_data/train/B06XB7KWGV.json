I do put my hand on the back of the I-Pad when customers are signing for their credit card transactions, just because. Really no reason, I just do it. Some people press very hard when they write, and I just don't want to take a chance of it falling backwards. You can put the I-pad vertical or horizontal. We love it.",

I have read the other reviews about the holder having some play in it, but this has not been the case for me. I did have to take my iPad out of the case it was in because the case made the iPad too thick and I could lock it in. All in all I would highly recommend this stand.",
