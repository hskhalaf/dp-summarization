The lumens is also very adequate for a medium sized area. Not too bright and not too dim. Perfect for keeping it on at night and doesn't bother your sleep at all. Another cool part is how you can use it to cover up an entire outlet for unused sockets. Loving it.",

In fact, I've already ordered more to place in other areas of the house.",
