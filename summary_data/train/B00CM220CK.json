Hoover has been out of stock for a long time. I have read people's old posts on other sites that they could not get the part due to Hoover being out of stock. Really, find another floor cleaner and save yourself the heartbreak of a relatively new machine breaking down.",

Things I love: - Picks up the gross water making the cleaning go much faster - There is a separate container for clean and dirty water - There is less drying time - Little scrubbers on the mop bottom do a good job on the dried mud Things they could improve: - This does not reach the grout to scrub it - I am not sure if I can use my standard cleaning products or only products designed specifically for this machine Pro-tip: buy a long handled grout brush and use in conjunction with this mop. You will get great results that way.",

It was 2014 when I first received my FloorMate. And, it was working just as it was brand new 6 years later!! Replacing only due to operator error. Our entire house is tile and hard wood so, it is an amazing value for this type cleaner.",

I didn't see any hair clogs when I inspected it but there wasn't any.
