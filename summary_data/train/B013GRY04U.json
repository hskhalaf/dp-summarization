I saw the recommended led bulb was only 400 lumens but people seemed to think it gave off good light so I tried it out anyhow. I ended up using a fluorescent bulb instead. A 15W (about a 60W replacement) works much better than the recommended bulb but I'm getting a 23W (about 100W replacement) now to make it even brighter (1600 lumens). Great lamp otherwise!

The piece is actually screwed into the lamp already, you just unscrew it and put the globe on then screw the piece on to hold the globe down. Another thing to mention is that you can customize the length of the pole. The pole is five peices that simply screw together. Easily customizable. Not too bad, all in all.",

It is very easy to assemble (my 11 yr old daughter was able to put it together). Does not require any tools, just fit the pieces one after the other. The only reason I will give a 4 star is the top (cup that holds the light) is plastic, a glass would have added more aesthetics to the piece given that it is likely to be used in living rooms.",

Like the easy on switch that I could put anywhere I want on the pole. Easy to put together, very heavy base. Use it in a very large bedroom. Would buy again",
