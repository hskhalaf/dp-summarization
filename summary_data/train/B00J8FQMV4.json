As with most fsa products I've used, they're consistent performers. By positioning this stem on the -6 setting, I was able to flatten the stem rise and only increase reach by 1mm. In terms of construction, it is a good machined piece of aluminum and comes with the required screws. The 4 bolt bar attachment appears secure when tensioned to 6nm as indicated.",
