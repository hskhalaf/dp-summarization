      "text": "I bought this to use for voice amplification, not singing. It seems to be plenty loud, but there is a bit of distortion at the high end of the volume. I would not use this for singing in public due to the distortion factor, but for kids goofing around with karaoke singing at home, it's fine. I chose this one over the more expensive amps because it's LIGHTWEIGHT. I will wear this around my neck, across my body, or maybe clipped in a pants pocket. It's much better to wear 4 oz. around you neck than almost 1 lb. These little amps are great when you work outdoors and have to talk to crowds. They really save your vocal chords.",

For a small ampilifer it definitely worked better than I could have even hoped for. this was a great buy and when or if it ever dies I know i will have to buy another one because it is a must have! It also was very well made. It was boxed perfect and Honestly Im not sure if I could find a negative thing to say.",
