Still, for late night arrival at a campground, we were grateful to have a tent that set up in seconds. I'd use it again under clear skies, but wouldn't rely on this in unpredictable weather.

If you got practiced with it, you could probably pack it up in under a minute. Because of reviews about the design defect regarding waterproofing the door, I applied silicon spray to the whole thing and bought an inexpensive tarp to set up over it if heavy rain is expected. This both keeps the water completely off of the tent and also gives a waterproof front porch area in front of it so you can dry off and not track mud into the tent. It's a good combo.",

Now storage wise, not bulky, it lays flat, approximate circumference measurement to be about 3ft. Could be an inconvience to some with a small vehicle trying to transport other gear as well.
