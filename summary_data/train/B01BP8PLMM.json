      "text": "We are very happy with the Dolphin Premier. We've been using it for a month. When we opened our pool this year, our cover had a couple holes, and a lot of trash had really dirtied the water. It had never been this bad...the pool bottom & walls were very dark & badly stained. In a couple of days, it had cleaned the bottom & walls and our water was clear. No hand scrubbing on walls was needed. It picks up very small particles and it's easy to clean the filters. It has trouble cleaning our steps, maybe because they're fiberglass. Still very happy",

I like the fact the pool pump can still run since this is ran off of an outlet rather than the pool pump.",

So after waiting an hour on the phone on hold,Jabari was unable to assist and stated his supervisor Michelle Brooks will not cover it. After using it less than 12 times it breaks, I would not buy it again. I had a Hayward Shark for ten years and never had a problem. Dolphin premier is not worth the money.",

Depending on the design of your stairs in and out of the pool, it may or may not work well. So don't get your hopes up for the stairs but the cleaning of sidewalls and up at the waters level edge cleaning is great.",
