To be fair, the display and sound are both as one would expect other laptops in the price bracket. In the era of rating inflation, I will up my rating to full 5 stars.",

Sound through the headphone jack is low too. I found out about the HDMI port not working while I tried hooking up my computer for a class presentation. I'll probably have to send my computer in to get fixed and once the mouse pad and HDMI port gets fixed then I'll update this review to 5 stars. This is a great computer for the most part, I think I just got a lemon. I'm not rough with my computer at all and I've never dropped it either.",

However, the battery life isn\u2019t great and it usually only lasts 2-3 hours between charges. And as others have pointed out, the chargers tend to overheat and burn out the internal components. I\u2019ve had this computer for less than a year and am already on my third charger. I hate to recommend someone not buy a laptop just because of an issue with the charger, but replacements are expensive, hard to find, and it\u2019s just annoying to constantly be replacing them.",

The internet issue started about a month ago, a few months after I purchased this. It has trouble just finding a wi-fi to connect to and when it does it loses it. I have restarted in and shut it down, waited a while, and started back up and still internet issues. When you pay over $800 for a laptop you would expect it to work perfectly for at least a year especially since I don't do much on it",
