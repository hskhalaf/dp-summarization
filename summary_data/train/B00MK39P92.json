Picture quality is fantastic and bulb is plenty bright to view during the day, even in eco mode. Fantastic for a first HD projector. With great color reproduction, low cost-per-inch, and high contrast ratio, I can't fathom why anybody would buy a TV over this... I would say my only complaint is the keystone correction which causes major distortion, so avoid using it at all costs. I'm sure this is typical of projectors in this price range (if not all), but either way, do yourself a favor and mount/position it properly so you don't have to use it.",

WATCH OUT: a lot of projectors call themselves \"1080p compatible\". that just means they can read the signal. but their image is still lower resolution. this one here on the other hand, has a native resolution of 1080p. that means the image you see that's being projected, that's a 1080p image. I haven't found any cheaper projector on amazon with a \"real\", native resolution of 1080p. and yet the quality is great. (can't speak for sound though, I use external speakers)",

I looked up the \"optimal\" color settings and adjusted accordingly and all I can is is HOLY S***!! My neighbor has a 2K unit he bought 4 months ago and even he says the picture is better than his.

Projector was mounted with the following: VideoSecu LCD/DLP Projector Vaulted Ceiling Mount Bracket with 22.4-Inch Extension Pole - Black PJ2B 1C9 (it would be better if you can buy another one, since pieces have to be re-adapted to match projector's mount plate).

It cannot throw a direct forward image. Meaning, its projection is either thrown from the floor (up), or from a ceiling (down). No directly in front. So keep that in mind. Be careful when first setting it up. The remote is fast acting and we accidentally set the language to Indonesian. We had a humorous 10 minutes setting it back to \"Inggrish\". So far we love this unit. And I'm happy I picked this simple device for my first projector.",

I hooked it to my PC and sat in my chair for 10 minutes just being amazed at how clear and sharp it looked in my living room. I would buy another in a heartbeat, and two of my friends bought one after they saw mine. Update: May 2020 I hit the lottery with this thing. Now going on 6 years and it still looks great. After 6 years I'm guessing the bulb is going to need replacing soon but it still projects a great image. If and when it bites the dust, I'll probably buy another one. I'm super happy with this one.",

It does get pretty hot right away, but that's obviously what it's supposed to do and I've had it on no more than 5 hours at a time and it's never over heated, nor did it show any signs of over heating.

While the inner box was not damaged as the outer, I am concerned that the unit was subjected to excessive rough handling and will show up in shortened component life.

      "text": "the picture is good, much better than the led projectors I had before it. It was advertised as having up to an 8,000 hour life on the bulb, I have just over 1,600 hours on the bulb and it is currently unwatchable, I was hoping that spending over $500 dollors would finally get me a projector that would last at least a year. It was the cheapest DLP projector i could find, and it looks good, but if you buy it you might want to get an extra bulb to go with it.",

Cons: Very small throw adjustments (Required building a new mount closer to the screen than my previous projector). Fan noised has increased dramatically since purchase.
