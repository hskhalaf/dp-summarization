Beware, they do have a narrow opening that you would normally be able to fix with loosening laces, which is not an option here. It's the reason I ordered a size larger than I usually wear and it turned out to be the right call. Be sure your socks are loose around the toes because they will stretch tight when you pull the shoes on. Any old timers like me will know the significance of that statement. I'll try to post an update after I've worn them a while.",
