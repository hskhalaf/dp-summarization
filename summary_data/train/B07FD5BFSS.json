      "verdict": "The Ontario Mid is a successful addition to Merrell\u2019s wide selection of outdoor products. Its trail performance is appreciated, thanks to its comfy confines, roomy toe box, and true-to-width fit. It was a bit lacking in arch support though.Overall, the positives of the Merrell Ontario Mid outweigh its shortcomings; using an aftermarket insole can resolve its weak point though.",

        "The majority of the Merrell Ontario Mid reviews admire the plush feel of the Merrell Ontario Mid",

I did swap out the insoles, but I do that to everything I buy since I found some that I'm in love with. So far they have been durable but I'm assuming with the soft rubber sole they will wear fast, but for comfort I am fine with that.",

They are a hiking tennis shoe so to speak? They are very light and pretty much true to fit. The toe box is a bit tight but with time I'm sure that will get better. I've had heel issues that led to blisters in the past mostly due to a seam in the heel-these boots don't have that -nice! Give these a try if you're looking for something light and pretty darn comfortable!",

Did some appraisal and found the company had put the cheaper non waterproof Olive Green in the box for the more expensive Dark Earth. Quite sneaky and some people might not even notice the difference. Not happy and will contact the vendor for an explanation.",
