You are either a proud person or you are a wizard because there is no way to complete assembly that quickly. I will say that it had a solid build quality. Thick powder coating, heavy gauge steel, solid fasteners, etc. If you are looking for a tow behind aerator, this is the unit to buy. I did all the research for you.

The mechanism to raise and lower the spoons is smooth and effective. That's a nice feature when you need to cross the driveway. The directions say to check the tightness of all bolts after a half hours of use. I found several that needed more tightening. One spoon fell off but fortunately I found it and re-attached it. I used a few pavers as weights in the tray.",

    "description": "If heavily compacted or clay-rich soil is choking your lawn, then the Brinly 40\" Towable plug aerator is your solution for healthy, lush grass. Many landscapers & gardeners don\u2019t realize that lawn aeration is a vital step to a beautiful yd. Without it, a lawn's roots can be deprived of air & needed nutrients. Unlike spike aerating - which slices grooves in the soil - plug aeration actually extracts soil plugs to open spaces for roots to expand & to allow air, water, & fertilizers to get to the root system. After aerating, the soil \"plugs\" Are left behind on the lawn to break down & Return vital nutrients back into the soil, promoting healthy growth. Indiana-based brinly-hardy company has been manufacturing quality lawn & garden attachments since 1839 taking the work out of DIY yd. Maintenance only gets more effortless with each Brinly product in our broad line of durable attachments. The best yd. Require the best tools get a yd. Like the pros with Brinly!",
