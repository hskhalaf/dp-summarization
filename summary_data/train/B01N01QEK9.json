Even at 7 at night the light is so visible against a wall from about 10ft back. But great product and am definitely telling friends to buy these",

Going by reviews, I picked these. Super easy to install, and put out an amazing amount of nice, bright, white light. My only complaint would be that the high beams aren't really any brighter than the lows. Inconsequential really, as the low beams are orders of magnitude brighter than the factory high beams were. I guess the aim is ok, because even being a taller 4x4, I haven't had anyone flash their lights at me yet, thinking my high beams were on.",

I'm sure I need to mess with the wiring and relays to get it sorted out. Just a warning to anyone else, LED's use less electricity and the vehicle is set up to supply a set amount of voltage to the headlights. Some vehicles may not produce the correct amount for these (or any) aftermarket LED headlight kits. Be warned, you might have to have them professionally installed so the workers can fix any voltage issues.",
