I can barely squeeze the bottle, nothing comes out. I tried to empty some of the product, same thing. I emailed company they said they've received similar complaints on new bottles and they won't have newerr bottles until December or January. Guys, if you know there's a quality issue, stop selling. These bottles are just difficult to use they are impossible. They literally don't squeeze. I'm not sure how something so obvious slipped by your quality control.",

Even applying balm and oil couldn't tame it. I think the shampoo is great, but I switched to a different conditioner and it's working much better. Looking at the ingredients, there is alcohol in this conditioner and not in others I have tried - that may be the cause. I don't know.",

Great stuff, lasts decently long, will continue to buy until my hair falls out.",

Also, read the ingredient list! Lots of essential oils, nothing synthetic or harmful in the list at all. Smells amazing, wonderful leather. I have actually used it on my hair once or twice. I can't say enough about how wonderful this product is! Will deffinately be repurchasing.",
