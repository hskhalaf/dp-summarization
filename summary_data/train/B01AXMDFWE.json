      "text": "I've used many brands of shoes over the decades. I came across Hoka completely by accident when I saw a review of them by a husky 300+ lb guy on YouTube. I'm also overweight so after listening to his review I decided to pull the trigger on a pair. Wow. Incredible, best-ever support. Since the Vanquish 3 model is out, I was able to get these Vanquish 2's for $89! After one run in them, I came home and ordered a second pair. I will say this, though...I have a narrow foot and these fit perfectly. So you might take that into consideration if you have a wide foot.",

I power walk a lot of miles weekly so shoes don't last long for me. Both models are good shoes. I just happen to like the Vanquish 2 a little better than the 3. When I can't get the 2 anymore I will wear more 3's. Hoka has great cushioning and they are a good choice for older people, people who have sore knees and some foot problems. The cushioning is the best I have ever seen in a shoe and they melt the miles.",
