We repurchased the \"same\" watch again in April 2015 and to our surprise the INDIGLO was gone along with the water proofing (water resistant to splashed but not submersion). I've added picture of the internals for comparison. If TIMEX brings back the original TIMEX Kids watch, it would be a 5 STAR again!!!",

They last about a year and stop working, either battery runs out and runs you close to 10 $ to have replaced at a store so it's almost cheaper to get a new one. The first versions had backlit display and were really great, this version does NOT have backlit (omnilight). Strap is really good and a good fit for an 8 / 9 yo.

We've had it 1 week and its already gone through the wash and came out working!

More educational than a digital watch, it also has a very easy adjustable band that velcros. The face is also the perfect size for smaller wrists. The only thing he wishes it had was the luminous hands and numbers so he could read it in the dark. After a couple days it hasn't lost any time. Time will tell how accurate it is and how long the battery lasts...",

The leather and faux leather bands stretch after time and I end up having to punch another hole in the band to keep it tight. This fits snugly, right where I put it. Quite comfortable. I also tend to be allergic to the backings on many watches. Since the cloth sits between my skin and the watch, I don't experience the reaction! So far so good!",

Very disappointed that they changed this feature and that it was his big birthday present which ended up being not as good as his previous. Shame on you timex, what was wrong with a great watch for boys that you had to remove a favourite feature?",
