Those who are in great need of something immensely comfortable, supportive, and grippy might also get what they are looking for in this product. That said, the shoe is probably not the best choice when it comes to breathability. To sum up, the Zion Mid Waterproof is yet another incredible Merrell offering whose set of competencies inspires hikers to go further",

        "Numerous customers find their Merrell Zion Mid Waterproof hiking boots unbelievably lightweight",

        "The Zion Mid Waterproof has an excellent support system, say several of those who have bought it",
        "Some users compare the fit of this over-the-ankle hiking shoe to that of a sneaker"

      "cons": [
        "This boot-type hiker from Merrell is not very breathable, less than a handful of testers claim",

I have only worn them on a 4-mile hike, so a thorough review is not available. They are lighter than my previous Merrell boots but give adequate ankle support (mid-height). There was no rubbing in this pair & walk was cushioned well. I will post any significant changes that may appear with extended use. The pair will be used on my summer Colorado Trail hike.",
