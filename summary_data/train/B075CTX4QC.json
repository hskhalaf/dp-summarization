At first I thought they were the pair I had ordered for my wife (they looked small and feminine) but I suddenly realized they were mine! They fit, well, like a glove very streamlined maybe a bit snug but I prefer that over bulky and they are fancy! If I was a secret agent, these would be my gloves as I push an Aston-Martin to the limit on the Bundesautobahn... They're fancy!",

I was warned about this, so I ordered them in XXL instead of my usual XL: but even so, I was barely able to get them over my hands (which are, admittedly, large). Once the base of the gloves was down to my wrist, the fit was fine, but any tighter and I wouldn't have been able to put them on at all. I suggest you order at least one size larger than you normally wear.",

Got the usual \"form letter\" email from Marino asking if I was satisfied; I responded by describing my disappointment with the style and size; and they sent me a replacement pair, size large and in the correct style!

I normally take a small and these are definitely a size smaller. The mediums fit me perfectly. I could do without the fancy gift boxing, however.",

The gloves are waterproof, and performed well in cold, rainy, windy conditions, hiking around for hours. The surface of the gloves look slightly tattered after 3 days of brutal weather and heavy use. They are not the warmest gloves or the best fitting, but they look just like the picture and perfom well considering how cheap they are. If the fit was a little better I'd give them five stars.",

The material inside is warm enough to -10 centigrade. On hand gloves sit right - not too tight and at the same time without too much slack, which eliminates the ingress of cold air inside. The material is very malleable. In gloves, I can freely perform actions that require precise tactile sensations \u2014 for example, buttoning up buttons or pressing some buttons. Contrast trim around the edges and the emblem was also in place. Not too striking the eye and at the same time creating an element of perfection of design.",

      "text": "The package is well packed. Both the inside and the outside are carefully packed together and are suitable for protecting the product and the gift. Leather material is thin, and touch operates smoothly. As recommended by Seller, the actual size of the gloves is smaller than the size shown. Therefore, you must order one more size than one. However, the inner lining was slightly less than expected.",
