Much of the time this great little Canon will suffice, and I don't mind carrying/wearing it on my belt when a heavier camera would have been left at home. Most of the time I do not need the firepower or flexibilty of my G5, Digital Rebel or D10. I have often regretted not having a camera with me when a great shot or memory came up and I left my big and heavier cameras at home. Now I have no excuse. It uses the same CF cards as my other cameras. The camera is built tough and does not show finger prints.",

Other than that, the pictures are wonderful in all settings and it can be used as a point and shoot camera or much more advanced. The movies are great! Definitely buy a large flash card.

In December, they first experienced problems with the LCD viewer which displayed only partial images. The screen completely failed in January. The camera was evaluated by a local Canon repair store which had seen other similar failures. When the camera was sent for repair, Canon accused my parents of dropping the camera and charged $150 to fix it! This camera was NOT mishandled! Of course they offered to sell them a refurbished model from the rest of their dud supply. CONCLUSION: The images are great but the reliability is horrible.",

Yes you'd save money, but there have been many reports of generic batteries exploding when charged for too long. And don't think if your generic battery explodes you can sue somebody and win millions. These batteries are made in sweatshops in China, India and Korea, and I doubt you can find anybody to sue. So play it safe, both for your own sake and the camera's sake. If you want a spare, get a real Canon one.",

    "description": "Canon PowerShot S410 4MP Digital Elph with 3x Optical Zoom\n\nAMAZON.COM\nUpdating the popular S400 Digital Elph, Canon's PowerShot S410 is both elegant and powerful. It features a 4-megapixel sensor, 3x optical zoom, and movie mode for videos of up to three minutes. Elegantly designed and super compact, the S400 has a protective stainless steel shell with a celabrite finish, which mixes metals and ceramics to produce a tough cool-toned exterior that is visually stunning. It also features Canon's new Print/Share button, which helps you quickly connect directly to a printer or send an image via e-mail. \n\n Optics and Resolution\nThe 4-megapixel PowerShot S410 can capture 2272 x 1704 images for photo quality 11 x 14 print enlargements. It also has 1600 x 1200, 1024 x 768, and 640 x 480 resolution modes. The 3x optical zoom lens has a focal length of 7.4-22.2mm (35mm equivalent: 36-108mm). It also has a 3.6x digital zoom. \n\n Movie Mode\nThe PowerShot S410 features 3-minute QVGA (320 x 240) or QQVGA (160 x 120) movie clips with sound recording, full playback and in-camera cutting and editing. Individual video clips are limited to three minutes in length. \n\n More Camera Features\n\n\n \n\n * 9-point Artificial Intelligence autofocus (AiAF) for fast and sharp images, even with off-center subjects \n * 1.5 inch low-temperature polycrystalline silicon TFT color LCD (118,000 pixels) \n * Real-image optical zoom viewfinder \n * Built-in flash with auto, red-eye reduction, and slow sync modes \n * Record a voice memo of up to 60 seconds and attach to images \n * Shutter speed: 15 - 1/2,000 seconds \n * White balance control: Auto, pre-set (daylight, cloudy, tungsten, fluorescent, fluorescent H), or custom white balance \n * Continuous shooting: 2.5 frames (maximum 5 images) \n * 2x to 10x zoom into captured images while reviewing via the LCD \n\n Canon Technology Features\n\n\n * Digic Imaging Processor: While much technical discussion of digital cameras centers around the optics and the CCD sensor, the complex task of image rendering is the job of the image processor--the \"brains\" of a digital camera. Canon's latest, exclusive DIGIC Imaging Processor significantly enhances digital camera performance in numerous areas. DIGIC's high-speed signal processing is combined with high-capacity buffering to give Canon digital cameras fast response and continuous shooting capability unmatched by other digital cameras. DIGIC delivers longer battery life and beautiful, rich color rendition with far fewer white saturation problems. And DIGIC's unequaled precision delivers clear, noise-free images that are demonstrably superior. \n * iSAPS Technology: Canon iSAPS (Intelligent Scene Analysis based on Photographic Space) technology dramatically improves the performance of AF (Autofocus), AE (Auto Exposure), and AWB (Auto White Balance). By analyzing a huge volume of photography data, accumulated over 60 years and the manufacture of over 150 million cameras, Canon engineers arrived at statistical relationships among focal length, focus distance, scene brightness, and other factors. Equipped with this \"fore knowledge\" Canon PowerShot cameras can optimize AF/AE/AWB settings for any given scene more rapidly and more effectively. \n * Multi-point AiAF: Canon's wide-area, multi-point AiAF (artificial intelligence autofocus) automatically selects one or more focusing points based on factors, such as subject position and motion. AiAF works in conjunction with iSAPS Technology to more quickly and accurately achieve autofocus under a wide variety of shooting conditions. You get fast, accurate AF whether you hold the camera horizontally or vertically, with stationary or moving subjects, with off-center subjects, and even in low-light/low-contrast lighting. \n\n Direct Printing/Sharing\nThe PowerShot S410 introduces a new Print/Share button that speeds and simplifies printing to compatible Canon and PictBridge enabled printers and one-touch image transfer to Windows XP, Me, 2000, and 98 computers for use with image processing programs, uploading to the Internet, or placement in e-mail. When connected to a Canon Compact Photo printer, a Movie Print mode divides the selected clip into equal parts and prints thumbnails of a maximum 63 equally spaced frames onto a single sheet of Postcard Size Paper. \n\n Storage and Transfer\nImages and video are stored on CompactFlash memory cards (Type I only) and the included 32 MB card holds approximately 21 images at the Large/Fine setting. Images can be downloaded to either a Mac or PC via USB 1.1 connectivity, which means the camera can be connected to any USB-based Windows Me/2000/XP and Mac OS 8.6 or later computer without installing any software. \n\n Power and Size\nThe camera is powered by rechargeable lithium-ion battery (NB-1LH). With the LCD on, you will get approximately 190 shots. It measures 3.43 x 2.24 x 1.09 inches and weighs 6.5 ounces (without batteries). \n\n What's in the Box\nThis package contains the PowerShot S410 digital camera, 32 MB CompactFlash memory card, rechargeable lithium-ion battery (NB-1LH), battery charger (CB-2LS), USB and A/V cables, and wrist strap.
