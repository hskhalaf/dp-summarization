Our next several emails, after having another wall full of ice on the inside of the fridge, have yet to be answered. The inside of the refrigerator does not keep a consistent temperature. We definitely do not suggest this refrigerator.",

Other than that, I am pleased with this small refrigerator. It is surprisingly roomy as it is a fridge only - no freezer.",
