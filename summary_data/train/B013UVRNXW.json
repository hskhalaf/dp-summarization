Now as I stated I wouldn't care except for using them in a overhead fashion you get chips of cheap finish in your eyes,mouth and all over your face. I have more on the way because they are shipping from different places. Will update on those. I would recommend to buy these without the finish for anyone searching.",

One pair of weights arrived and were halfway through the box. Some sings and noticeable scratches, but nothing that would make me want to go through the ordeal to send them back. They really are very heavy. Seem like they will hold up over time. I think they are a great buy for the money. I\u2019ve seen rubber weights at the gym slowly lose their hex shape and wear over time and from use. I don\u2019t think anyone will have a problem with these cast iron dumbbells. I will purchase more in the future.",
