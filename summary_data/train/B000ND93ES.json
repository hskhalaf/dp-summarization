Transfer between the External hard drive and computer is super fast and the product works with both Vista and W-XP. The Seagate is very light and slender for easy travel yet is also well made. Having owned the unit and used it extensively for over 1 month, there has not been any problems. Highly recommend.",

First off the product had several scrapes and dents which is something a hard drive, as sensative as it is, should not have. Then upon connection to several computers, Macs and one PS3 all consoles failed to detect it while making an annoying beeping noise. And lastly the connection itself, on the hard drive side, was very loose and had to be held manually just to get power into the hard drive.... very frustrating!!",

I think the same goes if you want to use it with a Mac. Also, I don't know why this is, but it has 2 USB plugs, so make sure you have enough USB inputs. Style-wise, it's also cool. It's light and sleek, and has a nice glowing orange light.",
