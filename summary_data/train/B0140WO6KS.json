It comes bubble wrapped enclosed within the attractive product package, attractive even for a nice gift many could use. 1st was purchased for in-office, one to keep in night-stand, and a third to keep in the car. Whether you have a sliver to see magnified, or you're enjoying detailed crafts, or you're mastering your senior years with occasionally needing assistance on fine print - THIS is your magnifier. The light is very effective as well for additional visual assistance/lighting. Insert three \"AAA\" batteries and enjoy a brighter life! :-) Love this product!",

It is as if the lens is put in backwards, but I can't see how to reverse it. The light will turn on ok but to turn it off is not so easy and sometimes requires removing the batteries.

No map detail or medication bottle instructions can escape me now. The smaller lens is like a jeweler's loupe and must be held steadily to focus properly. NOTE: When you lay it down on the light power button, it'll come on, and if you are in a lighted room, you won't notice it. I don't think it has an automatic time out feature. Arrived in a flimsy cardboard box with English and Chinese instructions, but came promptly. I wouldn't spend a bunch more money hoping to find something better than this item.",

It has already withstood the machinations of a very active 6.5 year old boy, playing outside and inside. 2. It only takes 3 AAA batteries, and heavy use for the past few days has not seen them die out yet, so that pleases me. 3. Compact. 4. Very bright LED's, but not blinding.

The high powered one in the middle doesn't fit my needs - but the larger lighted magnifier helps me with so many thing like medicine bottles, expiration dates on food items, ingredient list, adjusting jewelry, recipes, etc. Takes 3 triple A batteries - but really shines a nice light on whatever you are attempting to make larger.",
