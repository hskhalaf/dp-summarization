I have it installed on a JET pedestal which is mounted to a concrete floor, which probably is a good thing to keep it from vibrating out the door. Seems like a well built grinder, until you start it, but the noise gives it away. Really surprised, I own allot of Dewalt products and they've always been really good.",

One of the rests on mine required grinding to even fit the width of the wheel. All the metal and plastic parts are thinner and softer than DeWalt tools of old. Mounting holes in the base don't line up. Mounting holes in the guards don't line up. Paying more for Yellow plastic I guess.",
