      "text": "These are good spade bits, but the plastic pouch they came in is junk. They arrived at my door in one of those bubble wrap envelopes and first thing I noticed is they all seemed to be clanking around on the loose. Sure enough, the sharp tips on the bits cut threw the plastic storage pouch rendering it useless. There was a day when DeWalt would give you a proper carrying case when you bought a tool, and the cordless tools actually included the battery ! Kinda sad....this whole corporate greed thing these days. Well DeWalt......your corporate greed just earned you 2 stars on Amazon from this buyer, spend 10 cents and put a guard on the tips.",

I bought one Bosch spade drill and Makita and they completely suck comparing to this set. They just dont drill, they burn wood, they stuck. But this set drills like a hot knife through butter out of the box without any sharpening. Very glad buying this set, recommend it 5 stars!",
