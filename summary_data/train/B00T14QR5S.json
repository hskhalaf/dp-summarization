I had to return them at my expense, which is only fair. Please be forewarned. Don't make my dumb mistake! Measure your existing bars before ordering new ones.",

These bars seem very nice, highly polished stainless steel will make your grill look brand new. They are heavier gauge steel than the weber OEM parts. For the price, I don't think you can beat them. Not expecting a lifetime of use from these, so in 2 years, I will probably buy them again.",
