Yes, there is a lock which I like, but when you take a sip of water, there is a little bit that stays in the indentation, and when you go to carry it, the little bit of water spills. I'd say it's about an eighth of an ounce, which isn't much, but is annoying if you use for an indoor environment like an office. Finally, get prepared to get squirted in the eye with your drink when you press the release.",

You'll see what I mean when you get it lol just a dumb mistake but definitely a great water jug. Has a lock function to stay closed when you're not using it.
