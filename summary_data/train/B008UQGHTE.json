      "text": "My two boys and I have thoroughly enjoyed FS13 for Wii U. It is no doubt one of the best games on the Wii, especially that allows multiplayer. I like how neat the commentators make it all sound so real. It is practically spot on on many levels. I also love how they fashioned the players to mimic the actual players. Eg. Drogba has better dribbling skills than other players. But he also falls too often - just like the real thing. More importantly, I like how the game makes my kids want to go out and play the game outside like Messi! They asked me to paint our lawn like a football pitch.",

Could have something to do with them finishing up their first year of team soccer. I've played a few times with them. The game has the 4 player option, so I've whooped them in a couple exhibition games, me vs them. Graphics look pretty good! And the price is right!",

It keeps his stats just like it does for all the players on team. This is truely an enjoyable game for my son. Recommended.",

I would say it's closer to the PS4 version than it is to the last gen consoles. Great gameplay, lots of fun, and really cheap. Who cares that it's a year old? Getting people to buy a new sports game every year when it has barely changed is nothing but a scam. (Granted there is no FIFA 14 for Wii U). Either way, get this game.",
