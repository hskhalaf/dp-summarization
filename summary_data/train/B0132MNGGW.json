It came packed well and was easy to assemble. Caution: it will take some effort to hang to your ceiling bracket. The design of the hanging assembly of this lamp is not easy to work with (and I consider myself very handy). However, it is worth the effort... looks awesome!",

      "text": "I purchased two of this product in July and did not begin install until October. The outdoor patio had to be built first. After putting the chandeliers together and adding bulbs, we found that with the slant of the roof, they would hang too low. Following a few emails back and forth with the company, we decided that a piece like those used to make the fixture, rather than the intended long piece at the top, would work best. They sent us the pieces quickly and free of charge. The chandeliers look very nice. I put in vintage bulbs and the industrial style is great for outdoors.",

The young teen who put it together was a little disturbed that the black \"things\" (my word not his!) are of the \"cheap variety.\" They actually are (plastic), but this will be hung high, and I like that they are black so they do not bother me at all. The rest of the fixture is of heavy pipe, and the entire thing looks just as it does in the picture. It it works when we install, and I will think it is a home run!!",

It took my husband about 30 minutes to install. He's not an electrician, but he's handier than most, so I can imagine installation might take an average Joe more time. I'd say the end result is well worth it.",
