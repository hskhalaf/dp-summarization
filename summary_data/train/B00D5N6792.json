I added a few images so you guys could see the quality",

Also outstanding is the wifi, second to none. the included flash is decent, the camera has a hotshoe for other accessories, and offers interchangeable lenses. the low light performance and focusing could improve, but other than that this camera is easy to use, a great value, and feels good in the hands. picture quality is excellent, combined with the fully automatic or fully manual controls, this is an appropriate camera for any and all skill levels. I highly recommend, especially at this reduced price.",

When I bought it, and when I'm writing this review (and probably now too), this was the cheapest APS-C sensor with interchangeable lens camera available in the market. The image quality is nearly equal to that of a less-than-$500 DSLR camera. Sensors, and then lenses are more important for image quality than megapixels of a camera alone, and an APS-C sensor makes this camera just as good as a $500 priced DSLR. However, if you are a serious photographer you may consider buying a DSLR as they are made for the serious photography route.",

The mobile features are an awesome plus, using your phone as viewfinder or being able to easily send the pictures to your phone are really helpful features. The only small problem was that the system got frozen on a specific option, but a firmware upgrade fixed it completely.",

The picture quality was excellent, it had a fast shutter speed, and had all the modes and functions I could have ever wanted. Then the problems began. Before I had the chance to loan this camera to my mother for her trip to San Francisco, the camera started to not take photos or even turn on. I had it for a grand total of one week, and the camera stopped working. I returned it after three days of not being able to use it. Don't waste your time. Invest in a better camera.",
