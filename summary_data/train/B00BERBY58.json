These have an ultra long mega-length of Velcro to keep the wristbands in place and the loop it passes through is a helpful design feature that other brands lack. At $13.99 (price at time of review) these Da Vinci weights are less expensive than other bargain brands, but the quality is far superior. <3",

      "text": "The ankle weights serve their purpose. The outer covering is soft and they are comfortable to wear. The one thing I do not like is that the material stretches. When you move the weight and stop the weight will continue a small movement before stopping. This is because of the stretch in the material so that when your foot stops the weight stretches the material. This makes a weird sensation of the weights still moving. I think the weight material is made of small beads of metal. It doesn't bother me but if you want the weight to feel connected to your movement it might bother you as you do exercise.",

I've owned my oldest Thera-Bands for over 3 years and never needed to replace them. If Thera had 5 pound weights, I never would have wasted money on these. Long and short: they do the job but for a limited time. I won't buy these again.",
