As for the chopper blades they work great however in order for the chopper to work it has to be attached to the small rectangular dish that will fill up after one or if you are lucky 2 potatoes. This product works as intended but I wish I had bought a model with better attachments and a larger base.",

I can get more things chopped in less time! Although it has many other uses the large chopper part is definitely my favorite! I strongly recommend buying this for anyone. Also theres barely any effort needed to clean it or use it. Just cut the potato in half, lay it on the chopper, press down, done!",

It is so helpful on my keto diet, quick dicing, slicing, and super super sharp so I definitely use the glove all the time. The glove is great, works well and I don\u2019t get cut at all. The spiralizer is a bit annoying, I don\u2019t use that very often. It\u2019s manual so much more difficult to get good zoodles out of it.",

The first night I used the small chop blade for mushrooms and it made quick work of 2 pounds. Tonight I finally used it for fries and it sliced right through half of a huge russet potato like a hot knife to butter. I had to cut the potato in half to accommodate for the size of the container. Worth every single penny. I highly recommend! And one thing I hadn\u2019t realized about it was that it came with a little organizer for all the blades. SOOOO thankful for that!",

There is some prepping of the item to be diced by cutting or slicing into smaller pieces but its is not much work really.

My grandmother has arthritis and she uses hers to chop her onions up super fast and I meal prep every with my sister so we go to town she slices our veggies while I smash away at dicing! Need to get out some anger start slamming out some diced onions! It's so much fun and easy to clean and use.",

Cleaning is a but of a chore, you have to pick scraps out of the blades and the chopping anvil manually with the little pick they provide. Overall, it works pretty well and I use it a lot for some things. If I were to buy it again, I wouldn\u2019t bother with all the side accessories, tried them and they don\u2019t seem too useful to me.",

It really does come with everything you need besides a cutting board and a knife to get round fruits and vegetables flat before you cut them. I found it easy to clean and comes with special tools if you want to use, but spraying with water works pretty well. I use it mostly on apples, but it works with basically anything I throw at it.",

While more rare today, the Company definitely stands behind their product, and I would feel confident trying again.",

While the versatility of the product was great, the fact that it cannot chop basic vegetables without struggling means that it is not fit for everyday use. If you plan to use it on anything harder than soft fruits and vegetables, I would encourage you to stay away from this product and buy a chopper with better construction.",
