      "text": "This would be my 3rd pair of Toms. The first two were the standard toms with the cheap rubber sole bottoms that wore out. These are really cool, have a leather insole and are more comfortable then the other two pairs I had. It is a tie between these and my Van's slipons for the most comfortable footwear. Can't wait to use and abuse these all summer. Will report back later on durability.",

They are really nice, very comfortable and perfect for him to throw on to run errands, etc. which is what we wanted. I think I will get them in another color.",
