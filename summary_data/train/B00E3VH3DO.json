It's cheap and won't break the bank if they don't like it. I purchased this for my daughter, she plays travel softball. The leg guards didn't make it through the entire season, the velcro stopped holding. With that being said, I think it's a good beginner's set because it works and it's cheap. Now it's time to purchase a really nice set.",

I'm sure that sounds irrelevant, but if you've coached kids ball before, you know the straps are dangled in the grass, and typically stop attaching well quickly. These seem to really hold up. I also like the shoulder pads these have, that most do not. Its also no longer necessary to have that terrible dangling throat guard the old kids had, now that the new hockey style helmet is available. I bought this for my average sized 7yr old and it fits him very well.",

I have to tuck the excess straps in around his legs to insure they don\u2019t get in the way of the Velcro straps. But otherwise the set is perfect.
