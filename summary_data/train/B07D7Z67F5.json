With the added combo of no wifi and a laggy interface (yes, I updated to the latest firmware), I can only recommend trying at a much higher price or sticking with your phone.",

The sound quality is great, even through the bluetooth. The only bad thing about it is, there isn't any internal storage, and you have to put your music on an SD card, but that isn't a real bother. It has firmware updates, that you can get from the Fiio website, unlike the $20 - $30 mp3 players. For me, it is an all round great choice, and I would recommend the Fiio M7 to a friend, or family member looking for a great mp3 player.",
