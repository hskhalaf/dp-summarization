The first time I used it I couldn't believe it took ice cold water to boiling in like a minute. Seriously. I brought it home and had a wild hair for tea.... Bingo, hot tea and honey in 2 minutes. I've since used it for instant oatmeal, cocoa, sauces, various cooking applications and lots more I hadn't even thought of. I see absolutely no reason why anyone would ever use a tea kettle again.",

I cannot prepare the coffee before the hot water is ready. It literally takes under 30 seconds to have boiling hot water. I also use this with making noodles.

It was fast, easy to use, and reliably shut itself off. Anyway, this was a lifesaver when staying in a hotel room for several days and having no microwave or hotplate. Instead of the crappy or overpriced food and coffee that was available, pairing this various oatmeals and soups and noodles gave me some inexpensive choices and more control over my diet.",

So, at her request, I bought one. What a pleasant surprise. Pros: Heats the water really fast - less than five minutes, every time This sucker gets used every day, usually several times per day - never a blip, and it's still going strong Low profile and easy to use Easy to clean Cons: None that I've found. Very happy with it.",

It is far superior to heating water on the stove or in the microwave, but I find that it may be \"tricky\" in that you have to use a certain amount of finess in making some types of tea, especially loose tea. The pot brings water to a boil, and one rarely boils tea. If I were to ask for one additional feature, it would be a \"keep warm\" setting. The hot tea cools off quickly, once the heating cycle is done. You need to get it into a vacuum carafe quickly, or you will be on your way to iced tea.",
